 "awd_abstract_narration": "Structure function relationship in enolase will be studied                      using a combination of x-ray crystallography, site directed                     mutagenesis, and kinetic studies.  There are two, or perhaps                    three, divalent metal ion binding sites per subunit of enolase                  which are sequentially filled.  Some metal ions activate                        enolase, others bind strongly but don not activate.  Dr.                        Lebioda will study ternary and quaternary complexes of enolase-                 metal ion-substrate-metal ion to image the sequential steps in                  the enzyme mechanism.  Crystals of mutant enolase will be                       obtained (in collaboration with Drs.  Brewer and Robson) and                    their structure determined.  The mechanism of enolase                           inhibition by fluoride ions will be studied.  Interaction of                    single stranded DNA with enolase will be modeled by studying                    the complexes of oligonucleotides with enolase.  The yeast                      enolase crystals scatter to 1.8A resolution; this makes the                     system an excellent object of the proposed studies.                                                                                                             In addition to enolase research, Dr. Lebioda also proposes to                   study the structure of another metalloenzyme, transcarboxylase                  (TC).  There is significant sequence identity indicating homology               between TC and one or more domains of other biotin enzymes. Thus,               its structure will be representative for this class of proteins.",
