 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bermuda Biological Station for Research has been an                    influential and productive marine lab since its creation in 1903.               The Station has supported research and education for resident and               visiting scientists, and continues to offer outstanding facilities.             The Station has experienced rapid growth recently in both its                   research capabilities and its use by the scientific community.  Dr.             Anthony Knap, Director of the Station, now plans to expand the                  Station's capabilities in the area of marine biotechnology and                  molecular biology.  Renovation of several labs and the acquisition              of new research equipment will improve the Station's capacity for               preserving, preparing, and analyzing marine life at the molecular               level.                                                                               The Bermuda Biological Station is unique in offering research              facilities that are close to both shallow tropical marine habitats              and open ocean deep water environments.  The proposed lab                       improvements will provide direct and immediate benefits to a wide               array of marine scientists, and will offer students access to the               most recently developed instrumentation and research techniques.",
