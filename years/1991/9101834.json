 "awd_abstract_narration": "A series of dimeric platinum complexes containing bridging                      (diphenylphosphino)cyclopentadienyl (dppc) ligands will be                      prepared and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray                        diffraction.  Dinuclear reductive elimination reactions will                    result in carbon-carbon bond formation, and the mechanism(s) of                 these processes will be investigated using isotopic labeling                    and variable temperature NMR techniques.  The dppc-bridged                      platinum system will be developed in two ways.  The first will                  be to introduce one or more methyl groups onto the cyclopenta-                  dienyl ring.  This will enhance the coordinating ability of the                 ligand and prevent reversible dissociation of the cyclopenta-                   dienyl ring, which appears to be a feature of the dinuclear                     eliminations.  Secondly, a bis(phosphino)cyclopentadienyl                       ligand will be prepared and used to construct homo- and hetero-                 metallic trimeric and oligomeric complexes.  Where two                          different metals are present in a single complex, chemistry                     different from that found for either metal alone is expected.                   %%%                                                                             In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                     metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Gordon K.                       Anderson of the University of Missouri at Saint Louis will                      prepare dimeric platinum complexes for use as catalysts in                      carbon-carbon bond forming reactions.  This type of reaction is                 involved in reforming processes and the production of fuels                     based on ethylene, methanol, or synthesis gas. In addition,                     complexes containing many metal atoms of different elements                     will be synthesized for the same purpose.",
