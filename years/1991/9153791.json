 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal provides a plan for professional development and                  structured opportunities in science to 200 middle school                        teachers in four targeted urban communities in the San                          Francisco Bay Area. The teachers will be almost exclusively                     from districts whose populations are underserved and multi-                     ethnic.                                                                                                                                                         Over a period of three years, teachers will receive training                    in inquiry-based physical science through summer institutes                     and special sessions during the academic year.  Training will                   include an intensive 80-hour summer workshop and special                        return sessions, based on successful existing models developed                  at the Exploratorium Teacher Institute.  The goal of the                        project is to develop a core group of teachers in each of the                   four target communities, who have had progressively more                        responsible levels of involvement with hands-on science, and                    who, with occasional follow-up attention from the Teacher                       Institute, will be capable of carrying on a professional                        collaboration on their own.                                                                                                                                     Cost sharing is equivalent to $43% of the NSF award.",
