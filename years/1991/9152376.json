 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to provide the equipment needed to                 teach new and innovative labs in introductory molecular and                     cellular biology. In collaboration with Dr.David Becker at                      Pomona College, new introductory biology labs that are designed                 \"to stimulate students\" interest in science and to introduce                    them to the investigative nature of science are being                           developed.  All too often, introductory biology labs are simply                 a series of \"cookbook\" labs that do not stimulate students'                     creativity or natural curiosity.  These boring labs, in                         association with lectures that stress memorizing facts, turn                    many students off to science.  These new labs first introduce                   students to basic concepts.  The students then design, perform,                 and analyze their own experiments, building upon what they have                 learned in class and in the course. The labs are designed in                    modular units of two to three weeks duration.  The first week                   or two of each lab module are devoted to exercises that teach                   the students the basic techniques and illustrate fundamental                    principles in this area.  The second and/or third weeks of a                    module, the students design and carry out their own                             experiments.  They then interpret their data and prepare a                      report.  As the term goes on, students will be encouraged to                    develop more and more sophisticated experiments.  This approach                 to introductory biology labs should challenge students and                      introduce them to the excitement of scientific investigations.",
