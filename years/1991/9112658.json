 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased attention to human-induced environmental change has                highlighted the need to understand more completely the nature and rate          of responses of critical systems to changing environmental conditions.          Among the relationships for which greater knowledge is needed are               responses of hydrologic systems to changes in the land uses within              drainage basins.  This project will analyze the dynamics of watershed           response to during the last century in southwestern Georgia, where rapid        deforestation occurred in the mid- to late-1800s, leading to a deep,            intricate system of gullies and canyons.  In recent decades, however,           logging and agricultural activity in the area have diminished                   substantially, causing less dramatic but nonetheless significant changes        in runoff regimes.  Fieldwork in the area will provide information for          more accurate dating of land-use disturbances and fluvial responses.            Sediment samples of valley fill and terrace sequences will be dated             through dendrochronologic and aerial photographic analyses.  Land-use           changes will be identified using tax records and aerial photos.  Data           from these investigations will be related to topographic and climatic           data using a modified hydrologic model.                                            This project will contribute to both theoretical and empirical               understandings of the conditions that promote fluvial geomorphic                instability.  It also will contribute to new knowledge about the lag            times of response and recovery when watershed characteristics change            through human activity.",
