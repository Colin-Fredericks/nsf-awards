 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to partially support a conference and workshop               to be held March 10-14, 1991 at Texas A&M University.                                The topic of the conference, inverse problems in partial                   differential equations, arises from a wide variety of problems in               science and engineering. The availability of high speed computers               has allowed attempts at large scale problems of enormous social                 and economic value, for example, the CAT scan and oil reservoir                 simulations.  The question of non-uniqueness is a critical one                  for the development of numerical algorithms.  Determining the                   necessary amount of data in order that at most one solution can                 exist is an important question; however, often one can redefine                 the \"solution class\" in order to \"answer\" this question.  Even                  when this is not reasonable, the problem may be reformulated into               a \"sufficiently close\" problem for which the situation is much                  better.  The very fact that CAT scans work or that features of                  submarines can be detected by using reflected sound waves shows                 that complex inverse problems can be, if not solved, at least                   negotiated.                                                                          The conference participants will discuss whether one can                   find numerically implementable methods that give a unique                       solution to some closely related reformulation of problems in the               subareas of impedance tomography, inverse scattering and spectral               methods, and overposed boundary data.  The participants will test               these algorithms in a workshop atmosphere. //",
