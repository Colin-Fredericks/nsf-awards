 "awd_abstract_narration": "Participation in undergraduate research projects at                             thebeginning or honors level has become increasingly important                  at liberal arts institutions.  To significantly increase the                    number of students who participate in project activities, the                   physics department at Illinois Wesleyan University is upgrading                 the type and quality of experiments offered in the junior level                 Experimental Physics course.  Thus, familiarity with advanced                   equipment and techniques is allowing a natural progression into                 senior research projects in which much of the same instrument-                  ation is used in more advanced ways.While the department offers                 course work in all the usual areas of physics, faculty now have                 clearly identified five weak areas in the experimental                          offerings -- those that can lead to senior research.  These                     areas, together with the equipment remedies made possible by                    this grant, are:  1) Modern Optics: the completion of a laser                   laboratory; 2) Low Temperature Physics (10-300 k): a general                    purpose gas refrigerator type cryostat; 3) Nuclear Physics: a                   high resolution gamma spectroscopy system 4) Solid State                        Physics: a small, accurate, general purpose magnet for Hall                     Effect and related measurements; 5) Observational Astronomy: an                 astronomical photometer system to upgrade the department's                      unreliable, 21 year old system.NSF grant funds are being                        matched by funds from non-federal sources.",
