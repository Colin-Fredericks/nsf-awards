 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electronic imaging sensors called charge-coupled-devices (CCDs)                 will be used to replace the photographic techniques and the single-             channel electronic devices currently used in an                                 undergraduate course of Observational Techniques in Astronomy.                  This change will accomplish three important educational goals: 1)               it will afford the students a more realistic data collection                    experience, using the kinds of detectors commonly employed in                   modern optical astronomy, 2) it will extend the useful life of our              on-campus telescope by combating the effects of the increased                   brightness of the night sky, and 3) it will allow students to                   explore the analytical techniques of image analysis which find                  widespread use not only in all parts of astronomy but in most other             sciences as well.                                                                                                                                               Two scientific-grade CCD imaging camera systems and the                         accompanying data acquisition and reduction computers will be                   purchased.  The cameras will be used on two teaching telescopes on              campus; a solar telescope and a 12-inch refracting night-time                   telescope.  On the solar telescope, students will acquire time-                 lapse images of prominences and of active regions on the sun                    through a narrow-band hydrogen filter.  On the night-time                       telescope, students will acquire images of star clusters and of                 variable stars to gain experience in the techniques of broad-band               stellar photometry.",
