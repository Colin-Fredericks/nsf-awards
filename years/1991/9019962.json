 "awd_abstract_narration": "The bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus is likely the                   most extensively studied small cetacean, yet very little is know                about their physiological ecology. Virtually all studies                        concerning the energetic expenditures of Odontocete cetaceans                   have been performed either on captive animals or on trained                     animals doing open-ocean respirometry. Thus far there have been                 no direct field studies of the energy requirements of any free-                 ranging cetacean.                                                                                                                                                    This project represents the next phase in a continuing                     program designed to elucidate the metabolic and behavioral                      adjustments which occur during normal seasonal cycles in                        dolphins. Over the previous 3 years, measurements have been made                of the changes in the insulative blubber stores of dolphins in                  Sarasota Bay, FL, as well as measurements of metabolism and water               and energy flux in captive dolphins. The next phase is to measure               the free-ranging foraging energetics of these animals. The                      Sarasota Bay dolphin community iis ideal for these studies as it                is possible to repeatedly recapture known individual dolphins.                  This capability allows one to correlate seasonal changes in                     energy expenditure, measured using the double-labelled water                    technique, with changes in the animals insulative capability and                foraging costs. In previous research, blubber thickness was found               to vary seasonally. However, it has not been possible to separate               whether these changes in blubber thickness were related solely to               seasonal changes in the animals energy stores (i.e., are they                   responding to changes in prey availability and composition) or                  whether these changes are in response to variations in the                      ambient water temperature. In addition, data derived from this                  study will provide the first direct measurement of the at-sea                   metabolic rate of a small cetacean. Measurement of cetacean                     foraging energetics will increase our understanding of the costs                and efficiencies of various foraging modes in the marine                        environment.",
