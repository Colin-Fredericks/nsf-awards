 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, sociolegal scholars have turned increasingly to                                                                                                the analysis of the language of disputing in order to better                    understand how law and legal processes work.  Some have                         concentrated on the cultural logic of legal arguments, some have                                                                                                focused on the structure of narrative, and others have been                     concerned with the formal attributes of speaking styles.  The one                                                                                               element stressed in discourse in legal settings is that the                     structure of the discussion varies with the function of the                     discussion and, in particular, that fact-finding and evaluation                 look very different in legal proceedings.                                                                                                                       This project will look at the relationship between the ordering                 of speech and fact-finding and evaluation in a cross-cultural                   study of law in India.  It is argued that fact-finding and                      evaluation are distinct functions, and discussions associated                   with each have a distinct order.  Specifically, the project                     examines whether speaking-in-turn in legal settings is associated                                                                                               with fact-finding and overlapping speech is associated with                     evaluation.  To test the hypothesis that the ordering of                        discussion varies by goals, council dispute resolution decisions                                                                                                in two Indian castes will be analyzed and compared.  The two                    castes are of similar cultural background but their councils vary                                                                                               in the degree of fact-finding involved in proceedings.  One                     council focuses on evaluation and the facts are rarely in                       dispute; the other council is more likely to contain participants                                                                                               unfamiliar with the facts of the dispute.  Standard methods of                  discourse analysis involving audio recording of arguments will be                                                                                               used along with observations, interviews, and analysis of                       contextual and secondary data.                                                                                                                                  This study should add to our understanding of how the ordering of                                                                                               speech relates to disputing and dispute resolution.  The India                  context permits controlled comparison of the relationship between                                                                                               \"formality\" and \"informality\" and dispute processing.  In                       addition, this research will make valuable contributions to the                 anthropology of law, discourse analysis, and understanding of the                                                                                               social forms and cultural patterns in India.//",
