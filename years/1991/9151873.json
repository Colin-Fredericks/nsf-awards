 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating a multimedia computer network with                     interactive hypermedia courseware that integrates lectures and                  laboratories in introductory chemistry and geology courses.  This               courseware complements current laboratory experiences and                       encourages students to critically study the context and content of              their experiments.  The project is equipping a multimedia                       laboratory with eight computer workstations interfaced with                     videodisc players, networked to a fileserver computer.  The project             utilizes two additional computer workstations and video recording               equipment for courseware development.  Using hypermedia authoring               software, sets of exercises are being produced which students will              use after completion of laboratory experiments.  These                          computer-based exercises feature text, computer graphics, still                 images captured from live video of laboratory experiments, image                sequences from videodiscs, and simulations.  In doing these                     exercises, students are required to interactively solve problems                relating to the laboratory.  As students work with these exercises              they use a hypertext database of information within an expert                   system context, to logically blend information from lectures and                readings with laboratory observations and procedures.NSF grant                  funds are being matched with funds from non-Federal sources.",
