 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of the Protein Identification Resource is to                develop a biotechnological information resource of protein                      sequences and associated information that is well verified,                     complete, and well organized according to biological principles,                including functional and evolutionary relationships.  This                      Resource is fundamental to developments in all phases of                        biomedical research; it has already made major contributions to                 studies on evolution, on protein structure/function                             relationships, and on the role of proteins (and the genes                       specifying them) in many diseases.  The information is essential                to the basic sciences for developments in areas related to                      protein and genetic engineering and for interpretation of data                  generated in large genomic sequencing projects.  To cope with an                extremely rapid influx of data without sacrificing quality and                  reliability, new software tools, new procedures for data input                  and organization, and methods for the international distribution                of information collection are being developed.  The participation               of the international community of biomedical scientists in data                 collection, analysis, and verification is being encouraged.                     Collaborations with the major nucleic acid sequence databases are               being pursued in order to set up mechanisms to minimize                         duplication of effort and to share insights and experiences.                    Collaborations with the National Library of Medicine and with                   databases containing related information, including particularly                the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank of three-dimensional structures,               will contribute to the organization of biological knowledge into                a multidimensional matrix.",
