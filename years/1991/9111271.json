 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supporting historical references is an important problem in                     several areas of computer science and engineering. The                          significance of the database versioning problem (i.e., keeping                  and accessing old versions) has been particularly mentioned in                  recent advances in the database community. In the rapidly growing               area of object oriented programming, historical references enable               programmers to create new objects based on previous object                      versions. Traditional approaches to supporting historical                       references require either large space or long reconstruction                    times, making the extensive use of such references prohibitive.                 This project provides efficient support of historical references,               i.e., fast reconstruction to any past state without sacrificing a               large amount of storage space. New, optimal ways are investigated               to compress temporal data, while still providing practically                    random access to any past reference on these data. Moreover, the                problems of distributing the history, keeping the history of a                  system that evolves like a graph, keeping histories in limited                  space and other general historical queries (not indexed by time                 but instead using historical correlation) are analyzed. The                     results of this project will greatly impact the use of the                      recorded past history for different programmers or database                     users. Other applications of these results to be considered,                    include network management tools, animation storing and archiving               the UNIX directory system.",
