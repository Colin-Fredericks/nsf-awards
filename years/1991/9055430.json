 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, titled \"New Madrid Earthquake Project for                        Earth Science Teachers,\" is designed to improve earthquake                      education among earth science teachers from seven states                        along the New Madrid fault zone: Arkansas, Illinois,                            Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee.                        Sixty-three Middle/Junior High School, exemplary earth-                         science teachers will be selected: 28 the first year and 35                     the second, evenly representing the seven states.                                                                                                               The project includes a summer institute (2 weeks the first                      year, and 8 days the second) and follow-up activities each                      year.  The teachers will receive a variety of instructional                     strategies (e.g. lectures, field and laboratory work,                           computer simulation, etc.) and a video produced by the                          project to facilitate earthquake education for students,                        teachers, and the general public.  It is expected that each                     participant will conduct at least 3 awareness workshops                         averaging 20 teachers each; thereby almost 4,000 teachers                       will become familiar with the New Madrid Earthquake Project.                    The project provides a model for the study of other regional                    earth science topics.  The utilization of regional topics                       results in secondary science students understanding a                           greater relevance for science in general, and earth science                     in particular.                                                                                                                                                  The cost sharing by UMC is close to 52% of the amount                           requested from NSF.",
