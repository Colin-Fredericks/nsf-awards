 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research project is to develop new theories                 and techniques which can lead to computer vision systems having                 the capability for \"generic object recognition\" (that is,                       identification of objects at the category level).  This                         capability is a fundamental part of the long-term research goal                 of visual perception for an autonomous real-world systems.  The                 approach to generic recognition that is being pursed in this                    proposal is termed form and function.  The basis of the approach                is that concepts of object categories are naturally formed in                   terms of object function, and that reasoning about object \"form\"                (3D shape) can be used to determine the possible \"function\" of                  the object.  A recognition system has been implemented which                    successfully demonstrates this approach for polyhedral shape                    descriptions and the object category chair.  This initial success               demonstrates that the basic approach is valid and worth continued               exploration.  This project will result in extensions of the                     theory in the areas of (1) incorporating multiple distinct super-               ordinate object categories, (2) function-based modeling of object               categories which include articulated objects, and (3) analysis of               shape descriptions acquired from real data.",
