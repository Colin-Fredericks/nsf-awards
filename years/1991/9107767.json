 "awd_abstract_narration": "The natural process of real-estate development, whether                         residential or industrial or dam sites, tends to utilize the                    most easily developed sites first.  Thus, as the 21st century                   approaches, geotechnical engineers are increasingly being                       challenged to provide satisfactory foundations for facilities to                be constructed on sites with poor or marginal soil conditions.                  This trend, combined with improvements in hazard analysis,                      and the increased expectations of the public for constructed                    facilities to be risk free, can be expected to increase.  It is                 especially urgent for existing structures founded on poor soils                 in hazardous locations.                                                                                                                                         The objective of this workshop is to provide a forum for the                    exchange of knowledge and experience among experts with a                       wide variety of viewpoints and perspectives on soil                             improvement, foundation remediation, and geotechnical                           earthquake engineering.                                                                                                                                         The specific goals of the workshop are: (1) to summarize                        the current state of knowledge concerning soil improvement                      and its applicability to foundation remediation for various                     geotechnical hazards, especially those which are earthquake                     induced; (2) to identify and evaluate current research needs                    and opportunities in these areas; and (3) to identify and                       prioritize research needs in soil and foundation remediation.                                                                                                   The participants are experts in soil improvement, foundation                    remediation and earthquake engineering, and come from                           industry, government and academia, thereby providing a                          broad range of background and perspective on the topics to                      be discussed.  The workshop is to be held during July 1991                      on the campus of the University of Washington in Seattle.",
