 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physical structure of the \"30 nm\" chromosome fiber is a                     fundamental unknown of eukaryotic genetics.  The fibers play an                 integral role in gene storage, segregation, expression,                         replication, recombination, damage, and repair.  Detailed                       knowledge of the 3-dimensional structure of chromatin fibers will               give insight into the essential protein and DNA contacts that                   stabilize chromosome structure, constraints imposed on DNA                      sequence and structure, and constraints placed on the enzymatic                 machinery that interacts with the genome.  Those insights will be               important to understanding the normal and abnormal regulation of                growth and differentiation.                                                                                                                                     The research supported by this award will focus on how nucleosome               are packed into \"30 nm\" fibers under physiological conditions.                  This team of researchers proposes to determine important                        structural parameters of chromatin fibers by quantitative cryoEM                and x-ray scattering, using specially-chosen fully hydrated                     chromatin molecules.  In addition, the research team will make                  the first attempts to study the structure of chromatin designed                 to have homogeneous properties. We will determine the following                 structural parameters:  1)  radial distribution of density;  2)                 radial distribution of protein, DNA, and counterions;  3)  radial               distributions of HMG14/17; and 4)  diameter, axial repeat, mass                 per unit length, and helical symmetry satellite chromatin chosen                to be homogeneous by virtue of strong phasing of nucleosomes                    along the repetitious DNA sequence.  Our goal is to determine a                 model-independent, low resolution maps of protein and DNA in                    thick chromatin fibers, which can be combined with higher                       resolution crystallographic information about the nucleosome                    cores to determine the pattern of interactions stabilizing                      chromatin fibers in cells.",
