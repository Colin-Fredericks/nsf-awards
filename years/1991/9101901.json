 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support continued collaborative research in                     computer science between Dr. Jorge Nocedal, Northwestern                        University, and Dr. Claude LeMarechal, French National                          Institute for Information Science and Automation (INRIA). The                   main object of the project is the solution of large scale                       non-linear optimization problems.                                                                                                                               One of the most promising approaches in weather forecasting                     is the variational assimilation technique, which can be used                    to adjust various physical quantities, including the forcing                    data.  Its versatility is due to the fact that the physics of                   the problem is incorporated both in the cost function and in                    the constraints.  The fundamental problem is the determi-                       nation of initial conditions for the numerical models.  Since                   observations are very sparse, the key idea is to estimate the                   unknown observations by means of the nonlinear optimization                     code. Once a good set of initial conditions has been                            determined, atmospheric and oceanographic forecasting can be                    performed by simulation of the dynamical questions.  In this                    project, Drs. Nocedal and LeMarechal plan to develop a pilot                    code, encompassing algorithmic and theoretical developments                     that will be tested on the assimilation problem in meteorology.                 This program will evolve to incorporate new algorithmic ideas                   and will also be applied in the future to two other areas:                      crystallography and transonic flow. This project will                           benefit from complementary expertise of the two investigators                   in the proposed topic of research.",
