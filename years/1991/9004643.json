 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this travel award is to allow Dr.                                Douglas F. Williams to continue the dialogue with the                           Soviet Academy of Sciences (SAS) and USSR Ministry of                           Geology (MINGEO) about a program for long-term                                  research of Lake Baikal as it relates to global                                 climate change, biogeochemical cycles, continental                              rifting and geophysics, and joint US-USSR continental                           scientific drilling.  This would build directly on                              earlier discussions about a possible Baikal Drilling                            Project (BDP) held at the University of South                                   Carolina in July 1989 and at Yaroslavl, Moscow and                              Irkutsk in August 1989.                                                                                                                                         Dr. Williams would also be able to discuss with his                             Soviet counterparts the results of the first processing                         by US geophysicists of Soviet geophysical multi-                                channel seismic (MCS) data from Lake Baikal, collected                          by the Institute of Oceanology (Moscow) in the summer                           of 1989.  That would be particularly important                                  because is shows real progress in the step-wise process                         of initiating US-USSR basic geoscience research on                              Lake Baikal.                                                                                                                                                    This project fulfills the program objective of                                  advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                              researchers in the United States and the U.S.S.R. to                            combine complementary efforts and capabilities in                               areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the                           field of basic scientific research on the basis of                              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
