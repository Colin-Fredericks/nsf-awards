Specific areas of research to be pursued                   by Dr. Stang include: (i) generation and chemistry of diatomic                  carbon and ylides derived from diatomic carbon, (ii) mechanism                  of Ni-Pd-Pt mediated unsaturated cross-couplings and                            unsaturated carboxylations, (iii) homogeneous C-H bond                          activation and heterobimetallic complexes, (iv) synthesis and                   chemistry of highly strained ring systems, and (v) synthesis of                 (presumably stable) xenon-carbon species.                                                                                                                       The long-range objectives of Dr. Stang's project, which is                      concerned with several areas of mechanistic (physical-organic)                  and organometallic chemistry, include: (i) synthesis,                           characterization, and studies of various aspects of the                         chemistry of novel reactive intermediates (e.g., diatomic                       carbon, unsaturated carbenes), and (ii) fundamental mechanistic                 studies of such organometallic reactions as vinylic                             cross-coupling and homogeneous activation of carbon-hydrogen                    bonds. It is anticipated that this broad and diverse program of                 fundamental research will provide (i) new mechanistic insight                   into extensively used modern synthetic reactions and (ii) new                   routes for synthesizing reactive intermediates in solution.",
