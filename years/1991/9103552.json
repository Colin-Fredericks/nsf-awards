 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fifteen of the 26 sporadic simple groups have now been                     characterized in terms of flag-transitive actions on k-fold                     extensions of locally polar spaces and generalized polygons.  The               problem of classifying these types of geometries is closely                     related to the problem of classifying 1 - arc transitive graphs                 with a given local structure.  The principal investigator will                  continue his work in this area and on related problems involving                presentations for the sporadic groups, the amalgam method and the               Moufang property for generalized polygons.                                           A group is an algebraic structure with a multiplication                    defined on it.  One of the major mathematical accomplishments of                the past 15 years was the classification of the finite simple                   groups.  There are 26 exceptional groups, called the sporadic                   simple groups, which did not fit into the classification scheme.                These had to be handled individually.  This research is aimed at                a unified approach to the sporadic simple groups.",
