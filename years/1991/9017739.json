 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studying the molecular mechanisms of cold-adaptation of biological              systems is intrinsically important to understand evolution and                  ecological interaction of species on Earth.  In the Dry Valley                  region of Antarctica, a complete microbial ecosystem lives within               sandstone at freezing temperatures and in permanently ice-covered               lakes.  Vestal proposes to determine whether psychrophilic                      phototrophs (cold-adapted cyanobacteria, algae, and photosynthetic              bacteria) possess unique nucleotides and amino acids sequences in               their DNA and a key CO2-fixing enzyme in photosynthesis to account              for the enzyme's function at sub-zero temperatures.  From a                     previous award (Small Grant for Exploratory Research), Vestal                   determined that this key enzyme from a psychrophilic cyanobacterium             has unique photosynthetic properties that may be related to its                 molecular structure of this particular CO2-fixing enzyme.  Using                the latest methods of molecular biology, true psychrophilic                     phototrophs, which will be selectively isolated from sandstone and              algal mats from Dry Valley lakes, will be studied.  If these                    Antarctic psychrophiles possess unique sequences in their DNA and               enzymes, the information would provide new insight into the                     mechanism of cold-adaptation of biological species and their                    evolutionary relatedness to other temperate species.",
