 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural populations which have been surveyed exhibit large                      amounts of genetic diversity, i.e., differences in the genetic                  makeup between individuals.  This variability allows the                        population to respond to a changing environment.  Variability is                crucial to a population because it allows a population to evolve.                                                                                               Differences in the environment through time and space are thought               to be two primary factors maintaining this genetic variability.                 Spatial heterogeneity is common in a range of environments and                  has been shown to support genetic variability.  Particular                      individuals are often better adapted to their microenvironment,                 thus the population as a whole is comprised of many individuals                 adapted to slightly different environments.                                                                                                                     The investigators will experimentally test if individuals of a                  population are better adapted to particular seasons.  By                        determining whether individuals grow and reproduce better at                    different times within the year, they can test the notion that                  temporal as well as spatial differences in the environment are                  important in maintaining genetic diversity.  No experiments using               plants have explicitly tested the importance of environmental                   differences among seasons or years.                                                                                                                             In addition to understanding underlying mechanisms supporting                   genetic diversity, knowledge of the seasonality of plant                        populations may be of practical benefit.  Efficacy of herbicide                 applications, for example, is partially a function of when during               the plant life-cycle an herbicide is applied.  Additionally, if a               population represents an array of genotypes adapted to different                seasons, particular individuals or populations may have the                     ability to persist in or be \"preadapted\" to an altered                          environment.  A population's response to a global environmental                 change such as warming maybe predicted.  Predictions of                         extinction or genetic change by populations may then be used to                 examine potential shifts in species composition of communities                  and ecosystems.",
