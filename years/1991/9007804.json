It is                     widely held that the study of anaphora can shed significant light               on the logic that underlies our linguistic capacities.  The                     investigators plans to see whether logics that are more \"dynamic\"               than classical logic (such as some of the logics designed to deal               with certain aspects of the semantics of programming languages)                 are better designed for understanding anaphora.  He will start                  from Discourse Representation Theory and use dynamic logic to                   deal with some of the problems that it leaves open (such as the                 interpretation of quantifiers like most).  He will then look into               other relevant issues such as the semantics of definite NPs                     (including definite descriptions, ordinary pronouns,                            interrogative pronouns and relative pronouns) and the semantics                 of impersonal subjects (like si in Italian or on in French).                    These topics are important not only in their own right but also                 because the provide crucial evidence in understanding the way in                which meaning is generally encoded in syntactic structure.",
