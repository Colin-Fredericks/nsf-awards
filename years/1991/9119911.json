 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for a Workshop on Active Vision                       Research, to be held in Chicago, Illinois on August 5-7, 1991 to                take advantage of the occurrence of the Annual Meeting of the                   Cognitive Science Society in Chicago immediately following the                  Workshop.  A growing number of researchers recognize that the                   ability to actively combine computer vision with                                physical/mechanical behavior is vital to achieving useful and                   robust perception for a robot interacting with a complex, dynamic               world.  In this paradigm, termed active vision, the vision                      process is mist readily understood in the context of the                        behaviors that the system is engaged in; these behaviors may not                require elaborate categorical representations of the three-                     dimensional world.  Thirty leading researchers will meet to                     discuss research opportunities and funding needs in this emerging               field.  They will discuss the motivations for active vision,                    recommend research priorities, and identify important influences                on the field, such as emerging computer, camera, and robotic                    technologies.",
