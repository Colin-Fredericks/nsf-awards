 "awd_abstract_narration": "The epitaxial growth of gallium arsenide (GaAs) by                              organometallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE) has been used to                     grow various III-V and II-VI compound semiconductors and for                    electronic and optoelectronic devices.  Optimizing the reactor                                                                                                  design for OMVPE growth has been done by, for example gas flow                                                                                                  visualization and numerical simulation.  A major advantage of                   OMVPE over molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is that the growth                      rates of the former can be four to ten times higher than MBE,                   making feasible the production of electronic devices on a                       large volume scale.  The OMVPE throughput and yield in large-                   scale device fabrication could be enhanced if complete in-situ                                                                                                  device processing, such as etching, patterning and regrowth                     were demonstrated.  The advantage of such processing are:                            (1) potential for fabrication of low-loss buried                                    waveguides and low threshold buried diode lasers                               (2) simplified processing                                                    (3) low contamination                                                      The PIs are therefore working at interfaces developing a                        simple dry etching process with capabilities for in-situ,                       large area etching without contaminant introduction or surface                                                                                                  degradation.                                                                                                                                                    In this study, they plan to investigate the in-situ dry                         chemical etching of GaAs and AlGaAs using methyl radical                        sources.  The PIs plan to study the \"reverse growth\" or                         \"etching\" of GaAs using several methyl radical-sources at near                                                                                                  atmospheric pressure typical in OMVPE growth.  These studies                    will identify the most promising source and operating                           conditions for the in-situ etching of GaAs in OMPVE reactors                    without impurity buildup and/or surface morphology changes.                     Azomethane, iodomethane, hydrogen iodide, and trimethyl                         arsenic will be examined as source compounds at temperatures                    in the range of 300-600oC.  Another objective is to examine                     the orientation dependence of etching.  Patterned substrate                     with different crystal orientations exposed will be studied.                    The anisotrophy of etching will also be examined with masked                    substrate.  Additionally, the work aims at identifying the                      conditions and understanding the process leading to \"poor\"                      etching regimes as evidenced by either substrate morphology                     changes or the incorporation of impurities.",
