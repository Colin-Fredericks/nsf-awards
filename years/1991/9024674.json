 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. R. S. Hicks and others of the Medium Energy             Nuclear Physics Group of the University of Massachusetts to                     collaborate with physicists from Sweden, the Netherlands and the                United Kingdom in an experiment to be carried out using the                     continuous photon beam produced by the University of Lund                       accelerator facility.  Comparable beams of known-energy photons                 are currently not available in the United States.  The main                     European collaborators are Dr. G. van der Steenhoven, principal                 spokesperson of a Dutch group primarily from the National Institute             for Nuclear and High Energy Physics, D. Branford and  D.G. Ireland              of Edinburgh University, and B. Schroeder of the Photonuclear                   Reactions Group, University of Lund.                                                                                                                            The primary objective of this nuclear physics experiment is to                  improve the understanding of mechanisms by which nucleons are                   ejected from the nucleus as a result of an electromagnetic                      interaction with an incident electron or gamma ray.  Specifically,              the cooperating scientists will measure the momentum vectors of                 protons ejected from the nucleus as a result of the absorption by               the nucleus of photons of known energy.                                                                                                                         This study should give fresh insights into reaction mechanisms for              single-nucleon knockout in the kinematic region where meson                     exchange currents and short-range interactions are important.                   Such an understanding is required in order to correctly interpret               certain reactions to obtain comprehensive and detailed information              on the distributions of single nucleons inside nuclei.",
