 "awd_abstract_narration": "Various theories have explored the hypothesis that ordinary matter-             of-fact conditionals (as contrasted with counterfactual                         conditionals) are probability conditionals.  David Lewis showed                 that given certain natural assumptions, there could be no                       probability conditional except in certain trivial probability                   distributions, but others have shown that on different assumptions              nontrivial probability conditionals are possible.  Drs. Stalnaker               and Jeffrey are working together to develop a semantics for a                   probability conditional that avoids Lewis's trivialization, to                  explore its formal properties and intuitive plausibility, and to                relate it to other proposals for the development of a probability               conditional.                                                                                                                                                    In the proposed semantics, the values of sentences are random                   variables, functions assigning values between 0 and 1 to \"possible              worlds\", points in probability spaces.  A simple semantic rule for              the conditional ensures that it is a probability conditional, but               questions remain about the interpretation of complex sentences with             conditionals as parts -- both about conjunctions and disjunctions               of conditionals, and about nested conditionals.  There are also                 interesting questions to be explored about the relation between                 this semantic framework and truth-conditional semantics for                     conditionals developed in the possible worlds framework.  This                  research could contribute to clarifying the role of conditionals                in inductive reasoning and concept formation in science.",
