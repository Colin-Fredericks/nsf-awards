 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Somerset County Business/Education Partnership, formed in                   1988 by senior business executives and school superintendents                   to define goals and create an ongoing relationship, has                         requested support to (a) develop consumer-relevant                              instructional packages for K-12 grades and (b) provide teacher                  training for the implementation and dissemination of the                        packages.  In this 36 month project, industry scientists and                    interested teachers, working in paired teams, will develop                      lessons drawing upon the scientists' expertise for identifying                  potential topics and the teachers' for creating appropriate                     instructional packages.  While only 15 plans are envisioned                     for each of the project's years, each package will be adapted                   for a different age group, thereby leading to the production                    of approximately 90 different units over the life of the                        project.  A one-week training workshop will be held in June                     each year for 30 teachers and participating teachers will be                    expected to participate in two post-training sessions to                        evaluate their experiences using the newly developed                            materials.  While the initial request for support of the                        Foundation did not include provision for significant                            evaluation of student performance, that was added to the                        project in the course of negotiations.  The Foundation's                        support represents approximately 48% of the total project                       costs.",
