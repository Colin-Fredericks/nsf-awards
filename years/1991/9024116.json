 "awd_abstract_narration": "Standard theories of the provision of municipal services hold that              market forces operate to ensure the efficient provision of these                public goods.  The argument is that a market is created as citizens             \"shop around\" among different municipalities deciding to settle                 down and live in the municipality that provides the best                        combination of high services/low taxes for the individual citizen.              Underlying this theory, however, are contrary to evidence                       assumptions that most citizens are well informed about municipal                services and taxes and that it is relatively easy for individuals               to move from one community to another in search of the optimal                  combination.                                                                                                                                                    This award supports an ambitious program of research to test and                refine the standard Tiebout model of urban political economy and                the assumptions underlying it.  The investigators will conduct a                series of surveys to determine the role of individuals, businesses,             and governments in the creation of efficient local markets for                  public goods. In particular, they will examine the possibility that             a subsample of the public exists which is much better informed and              more mobile than the norm and whose members serve, in effect, as                mobility entrepreneurs, creating markets by their actions which                 benefit automatically other residents of the community.  The                    project also considers the possibility that politicians play active             roles in creating markets by competing both for certain kinds of                business and certain kinds of citizens as well.                                                                                                                 When completed this research should provide a better understanding              of the dynamics that underlie the provision of municipal services               in the United States.  It should thereby establish a more rigorous,             empirical basis for judging the efficiency and effectiveness of the             provision of public goods by local governments.",
