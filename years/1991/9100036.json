 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteolytic cleavage of precursor proteins by virus coded                     proteases is a common protein synthesis strategy utilized by                    many animal and plant viruses for synthesis of functional                       viral proteins.  Prevention of these cleavage processes may                     offer a specific means for controlling replication of these                     viruses.                                                                          The proposed project is designed to investigate a protease                    inhibitor which Southern University biologists found to                         exist in cowpea embryos.  This inhibitor can completely                         prevent proteolytic processing of the precursor proteins of                     cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) in an in vitro protein                               synthesizing system.  The plan is to develop a purification                     procedure for complete purification of the inhibitor, to                        characterize the inhibitor biochemically, to compare the                        activity of the inhibitor to the activities of synthetic                        peptides, to determine the existence or absence of this                         inhibitor in CPMV resistance and sensitive cowpea plants,                       and to determine the amino acid sequence of the inhibitor                       using DNA cloning and sequencing methods.  The long range                       goals of this research are to gain a complete understanding                     of the structural and functional properties of this                             inhibitor, and to use this inhibitor as a model for                             examining the possibility of utilizing protease inhibitors                      as antiviral agents for prevention or treatment of viral                        diseases.                                                                         Besides the research goals, an additional objective of this                   proposed project is to present an opportunity to minority                       students and faculty of Southern University and other                           minority institutions to receive research training and to                       gain experience in modern molecular biology techniques,                         including genetic engineering techniques.  This objective                       will be accomplished through seminars and workshops.",
