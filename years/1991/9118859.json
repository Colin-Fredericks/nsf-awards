NSF and Census staff have                         previously identified several key areas where questionnaire                     improvements are needed; efforts to identify additional areas                   will continue during the conduct of this project.                                    Under authority granted by the National Science Foundation                 Act of 1950, NSF collects and disseminates descriptive economic                 statistics, as well as other pertinent information, about                       scientific and technological resource utilization and activities.               Data collected by the Survey of Research and Development in                     Industry, when used in combination with data obtained through                   other NSF statistical and analytical activities, provides policy                makers with an overview of R&D funding and performance in the                   United States.",
