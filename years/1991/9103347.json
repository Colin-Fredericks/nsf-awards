 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project supports a socio-linguistic                  anthropologist in Bethel, Alaska.  The research will study how                  Yupik Eskimo and non-native men in this small rural community                   establish their identities through conversation and discourse                   related to subsistence.  In Alaska, Native American subsistence                 patterns of hunting and fishing are critical definers of an                     appropriate lifestyle.  Methods include participant observation                 during subsistence hunting and fishing, recording and analysis of               conversations during daily life, and extended life history                      elicitation during formal interviews.                                                                                                                           This research is important because Native Americans are one of                  the fastest growing census categories in U.S. society. Increased                understanding of how Native Americans understand themselves in                  relation to non-Native others will help society decision makers                 to design programs that deal with issues of importance to Native                Americans.",
