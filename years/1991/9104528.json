 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of the cytoskeleton in regulation of the division                   plane, mitosis and morphogenesis will be investigated in                        stomatogenesis in the fern ally, Selaginella.  This simple system               takes advantage of two of the most dramatic examples of precisely               defined morphogenetic pathways known in plants: stomatogenesis and              monoplastidic cell division.  In stomatogenesis, the guard mother               cell differentiates from epidermal initials to depart on a pathway              leading to formation of a pair of specialized guard cells.  In                  monoplastidic division, nuclear and plastid division are intimately             coordinated by precise morphogenetic plastid migrations and by                  organization of the spindle at the plastids.  The overall objective             of this research is to use the determinated pathway of                          stomatogenesis and the phenomenon of morphogenetic plastid                      migration to answer questions of fundamental importance in plant                morphogenesis.  Morphogenetic plastid migration provides an                     accurate marker of changes in polarity during the cell cycle.  This             migration will be compared with the better known circadian and                  photostimulated chloroplast migration in Selaginella.  Movement of              chloroplasts has been well studied and provides one of the better               understood examples of actin driven motility in plants.  Proposed               studies include live observations and direct and indirect                       localization of f-actin and microtubules using light (video                     enhanced differential interference contrast, fluorescence, confocal             laser scanning) and transmission electron microscopy.  Drugs will               be used to perturb cytoskeletal proteins to determine function in               control of division plane, organelle migration, and division, and               in cell shaping and wall deposition that leads to the distinctive               form of mature guard cells.                                                                                                                                     Such studies will increase our understanding of the phenomenon of               plastid polarity in monoplastidic cell division, and will                       contribute to the general knowledge of the role of the cytoskeleton             in patterned development in a multicellular plant tissue.",
