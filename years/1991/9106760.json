 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Ye will study evolution equations and applications               to problems in Riemannian geometry. In particular he will study                 the Ricci flow, the Yamabe flow, and the harmonic mapping flow.                 The method of evolution equations has become an important method                for finding critical points of geometric functionals and in                     understanding the dynamic structure of space.                                        The evolution equations to be studied in this research can                 be understood physically by imagining a stretched rubber band                   immersed in a viscous fluid such as oil. The evolution equation                 for this example then describes the way in which the rubber band                shrinks. The speed at which it shrinks at any point on the band                 is proportional to how much the band is curved at that point.                   Since so many physical problems involve deformation of curves or                surfaces, the potential for application of this research is                     substantial.",
