 "awd_abstract_narration": "The idea that highly condensed stars too massive to become white                dwarfs could exist as solid \"neutron stars\" was first advanced by               J. Robert Oppenheimer in 1939.  Since that time the idea that                   supernovae nuclei collapse directly into neutron stars (sometimes               in a rotating, magnetized form called \"pulsars\") is now widely                  accepted.  Despite this progress, rather little is understood about             their radiation and internal structural properties.  Such phenomena             as \"star quakes\" in pulsars suggest that the there are at least two             of neutrons consisting of a liquid core and a solid \"crust\".  The               Principal Investigator (PI) will study a variety of topics dealing              with the interiors of neutron stars, including the transport of                 radiation from their interior to the surface, and vice versa just               after a supernovae explosion, which can be used to make predictions             that can be matched with observations, either from the ground or                from X-ray detectors on spacecraft.  She will include modern                    \"equation of state\" microphysics into these calculations and will               determine what effects magnetic fields and exotic particles called              \"WIMPS\" have on these models.  This work coincides with the                     expected detection of the nucleus of the supernova in the                       Magellanic Cloud, SN1987a, which should become visible shortly as               emission from the exploding ejecta becomes faint.  It is                        anticipated that the detection (and even non-detection) of this                 remnant will elucidate which of various competing physical                      processes are important in neutron stars.  The work supported by                this award should play a key part in this understanding.",
