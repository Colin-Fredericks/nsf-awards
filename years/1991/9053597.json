The research includes the analysis of videotapes of                        small group problem-solving activities within actual                            classroom settings, and individual task-based interviews in                     grades three through six.                                                                                                                                            The study will be conducted in three school districts                      in New Jersey: urban, blue-collar working-class, and upper                      middle-class suburban.                                                                                                                                               The videotapes and accompanying analyses will be                           developed in trial usuage for pre- and in-service teacher                       education programs at Rutgers and subsequently refined for                      more wide-spread dissemination.  The results of this study                      have important implications for teacher preparation and                         development and instruction in a variety of school settings.
