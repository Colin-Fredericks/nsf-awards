Applications for support are solicited and evaluated                 by a committee composed of U.S. members of the ICPEAC General                   Committee.  Particular attention is given to applications from                  students and from scientists who do not have major research                     support from which they could obtain the necessary travel funds.                This biennial conference deals with two-body interactions between               ions, atoms, molecules, electrons, positrons and photons, and                   with interaction energies ranging from subthermal to millions of                electron volts.  The subject matter relates both to fundamental                 physics, and to technologically significant issues.",
