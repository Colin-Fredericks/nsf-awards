 "awd_abstract_narration": "The spatial pattern of pollen dispersal in insect-pollinated               plants affects both plant reproductive success and the rate at                  which novel or introduced genes will spread through plant                       populations.  Currently however, there is a lack of ability to                  combine information about pollinator movement and pollen                        deposition to make quantitative predictions about pollen                        dispersal.  The proposed research will develop quantitative tools               for predicting gene flow in plants using partial differential                   equation (P.D.E.) models of pollinator movement and pollen                      deposition.  Field experiments designed to measure the effect of                plant spatial arrangement on pollinator movement behavior will be               conducted using the mustard Brassica campestris and its three                   major insect pollinators.  The results of these experiments will                then be used to build P.D.E. models of insect movement.                         Additional experiments will utilize a marker gene to measure the                rate of pollen deposition as pollinators visit a sequence of                    mustard plants.  Finally, information about insect movement and                 pollen deposition will be integrated to generate expected pollen                deposition patterns for a variety of plant arrangements.  The                   expected patterns will be compared to the observed dispersal of a               marker gene in field experiments conducted by Drs. Peter Kareiva                and Robin Manasse at the University of Washington.  The results                 of this study will be important in understanding the spatial                    structure of genetic neighborhoods and the effect of plant                      density dispersion on plant reproductive success, and in                        predicting and controlling the spread of introduced genes.",
