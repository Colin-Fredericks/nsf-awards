 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Drs.                     Jeffrey Stephens and Vincent McCoy, California Institute of                     Technology and Dr. Christian Jungen, Laboratoire de Photophy-                   sique Moleculaire, University of Paris, Orsay, France. The                      objective of the research is to study the dynamics of highly                    excited molecular electronic states.                                                                                                                            The investigators propose to develop methods of electronic                      structure calculation, which are particularly appropriate for                   the study of dynamics of highly excited bound states molecules,                 including their photoelectron spectroscopy.  The proposed                       research is relevant to recently developed and future                           experimental techniques, which probe highly excited molecular                   states via selective laser excitation.  The physical basis of                   the method singles out the description of short-range                           particle (nuclei and electrons) correlations, which are                         ultimately responsible for the evolution and decay of a                         highly excited molecular complex.  The proposed research                        connects in a unified manner with multichannel quantum defect                   theory (MQDT), which has been largely developed over a period                   of years for the purpose of describing and predicting the                       evolution and decay of highly excited molecular complexes.                      The suggested approach provides for initial development of the                  technique and ab initio calculation of fundamental interaction                  parameters needed to exploit the power of MQDT.  The results                    of this project will be of fundamental interest and direct                      relevance to researchers currently developing modern                            experimental spectroscopies in the US and Europe. The                           project will benefit from the complementary expertise of the                    two research groups. The French collaborator Dr. Jungen is an                   internationally recognized expert in the area of MQDT and                       molecular structure theory.  The US research team has a                         strong background in the area of ab initio computation of                       molecular Rydberg and continuum states.",
