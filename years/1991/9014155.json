 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports ten U.S. participants in a small interna-                   tional meeting that will be held in Bremen, Germany in March,                   1991 to discuss theoretical issues and empirical studies of                     students' learning processes in physics.  The objective of the                  meeting is to orient physics education research toward the                      investigation of learning processes that lead to a deeper and                   more robust understanding of physics.  The workshop has been                    co-organized by Professor Fred M. Goldberg of the Institute for                 Research in Mathematics and Science Education, San Diego State                  University, and Professor Hans Niedderer of the Institute of                    Physics Education, University of Bremen.  Specific aims of the                  workshop are: (1) to analyze theoretical frameworks for the                     investigation of student learning processes in physics; (2) to                  propose and consider new methodologies and standards for                        qualitative empirical research on student learning processes in                 physics; (3) to discuss new teaching strategies that promote a                  deeper understanding of physics concepts; and (4) to suggest                    specific research questions which might facilitate collabora-                   tion among workshop participants.  The primary participants                     are all highly qualified science education researchers who                      have made significant contributions to the field.  In addition,                 several postdoctoral researchers are invited; the opportunity                   to interact with international leaders in the field of physics                  education research should provide them with a significant                       opportunity for professional growth.                                                                                                                            Since the late 1970's, there has been a major effort in physics                 education research to identify students' ideas about scientific                 phenomena, both prior to and following formal classroom                         instruction.  Very few studies have focused on how students                     learn physics.  There is no international professional                          organization to link researchers interested in the study of                     physics education.  Thus, this workshop provides an opportunity                 for physics education researchers from the United States and                    Germany (and a few experts from other countries) to come                        together for intensive discussions to promote a new orientation                 in their research.  Proceedings will be published by the                        Institute for the Teaching of the Natural Sciences, Kiel,                       Germany.  This will be a vehicle for encouraging a continued                    focus on the issues raised at the workshop, and for sharing the                 results with a larger audience.",
