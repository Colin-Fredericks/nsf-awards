 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last decade there has been substantial progress in                     understanding the role and functions of law through the economic                analysis of legal rules.  Especially in the areas of contractual                relations and torts, theoretical modelling under various conditions             of information and uncertainty has added to our knowledge about the             effects and potential effects of differing rule structures,                     sanctioning systems, and regulatory regimes.  Dr. Shavell has been              a leading scholar studying such problems.                                                                                                                       In this project, Dr. Shavell continues that work through focusing               on three different topics.  The first two, which relate to contract             law, address (1) rules governing disclosure of information at the               time of contracting, and (2) rules governing a party's ability to               withdraw an offer after the party to whom the offer has been made               has relied on the offer by gathering information about the offer's              value.  The final topic addresses (3) rules governing a corporate               employee's personal liability for torts or crimes committed by the              corporation.  Each of these topics frames issues of theoretical and             practical importance for law.  Also, the work being pursued models              situations with increased realism.  While there are already models              to analyze sellers' incentives to disclose information, none has                studied the effects of ordinary contract law.  Similarly, there has             been no rigorous economic analysis of contract law dealing with                 offer and acceptance.  Finally, while there are models of                       deterrence generally, Dr. Shavell adds important realism by                     conceptualizing a business firm as a bundle of actors (each with                their own private incentives) rather than as a single unified                   actor.  This attention to law and to operational context is                     important in its own right and in opening up lines of research for              others to follow.",
