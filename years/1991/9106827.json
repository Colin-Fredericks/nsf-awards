 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transposable elements or TEs, which as examples of so-                   called \"selfish DNA\" function to ensure their own survival and                  reproduction, exist (in multiple copies) in the chromosomes of                  all organisms, often causing mutations.  A portion of the TE's                  own genome is devoted to directing its own reproduction                         independently of the host's genes, thereby enabling it to spread                through a host organism's chromosomes quickly, even if the TE                   has a slightly detrimental effect.                                                     Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, is known to have a               large number of different kinds of transposable elements.  When                 one such element, called hobo, moves among chromosomes, it causes               hybrid dysgenesis, which leads to sterility, high mutation rates,               chromosome breaks, and other deleterious effects, so its                        persistence over millennia of evolution is quite puzzling.  By                  comparing DNA sequences of hobo elements in different populations               and in other closely related Drosophila species (D. simulans for                example), it will be possible to learn about the rate at which                  hobo elements have evolved, what selective forces have acted to                 modify genetic function, and mode of TE transmission between                    species.                                                                               In the long run, studies of this type are expected to                    yield a fundamental understanding of how organisms have dealt                   with \"DNA parasites\" over time, as well as how the action of TEs,               via mutation, have led to useful, novel gene functions.",
