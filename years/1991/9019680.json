 "awd_abstract_narration": "This laboratory has identified Drosophila mutations which disrupt               the release of sister chromatids at anaphase and the process of                 cytokinesis in mitosis.  Experiments proposed will examine in                   molecular detail the products of two genes, \"rough deal\" (rod) and              \"spaghetti squash\" (sqh), whose proper functioning are essential                for the successful execution of anaphase and cytokinesis,                       respectively.  The following studies are proposed:  1) To                       characterize the rod and sqh proteins by immunocytochemsitry and                trace their intracellular distribution and behavior during mitosis;             2) to determine the role of phosphorylation of the sqh gene product             in regulating cytokinesis; 3) to dissect the function of the sqh                gene product through classical and in vitro mutagenesis.                                                                                                        The process of mitosis is fundamental to all eukaryotic organisms.              It has evolved to deliver a complete complement of chromosomes to               each daughter cell.  Two critical and, as yet, poorly understood                late events in mitosis are the release of sister chromatids at                  anaphase and the process of cytokinesis.  This research will take               advantage of two Drosophila mutations which distrupt these                      processes in specific ways.  The identification and analysis of the             products of these two genes should contribute important new                     information on the molecular mechanisms underlying mitosis.",
