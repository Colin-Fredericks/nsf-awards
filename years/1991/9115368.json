 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. John Ogden is Director of the Florida Institute of                     Oceanography, and currently serves as co-chair of the Steering                  Committee of the Caribbean Coastal Marine Productivity Program                  (CARICOMP), a consortium of more than 30 marine labs located in                 more than 20 Caribbean countries.  The consortium was established               in 1985 and has received NSF and UNESCO support for workshops that              initiated planning for a basin-wide information network dedicated               to collecting and maintaining standardized long-term environmental              (oceanographic, meteorologic, and ecosystem) observations.  A Data              Management Center will be established with UNESCO support at the                University of the West Indies, Kingston, to operate the network.                Dr. Ogden proposes initiation of the data network by installing                 personal computers, submersible water quality data loggers, remote              automated weather stations, and networking hardware and software                at five representative marine labs, located in Venezuela, the                   Yucatan Peninsula, Jamaica, St. Lucia, and Barbados.                                 The CARICOMP network will facilitate pure and applied research             into the tropical ecosystems of the coastal zone (reefs, mangrove               wetlands, seagrass meadows).  The proposed effort will provide                  important benefits to research on global change and the impacts of              society and economic development on tropical coastal zones.",
