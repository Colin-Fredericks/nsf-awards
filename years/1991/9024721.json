 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Institutional Infrastructure award is to support research             in the general area of Computer Aided Manufacturing Engineering.                The approach taken by the Utah group is computer aided prototyping              of objects to be manufactured.  The process is broken down into                 three separate areas of research:  design, prototyping, and                     validation.  The design aspect of the research involves enhancing               the Alpha 1 computer aided geometric design system.  This system is             able to mathematically describe objects to be manufactured.  It is              enhanced by incorporating some commonly occurring manufacturing                 steps into the model as special elements (e.g., this hole is to be              counterbored).  The proto-typing aspect is to take the mathematical             description of the object (say a gear) and generate the NC codes                and the tooling sequences necessary to actually produce the item on             a machine center.  The University of Utah already possesses a five              axis machine center, a CNC turning center, 3-D polymer equipment,               and robotics equipment and so can experimentally validate their                 research.  A long term goal is to optimize the tooling sequences                and other necessary manufacturing activities in order to have the               factory operate without human supervision.  This prototyping                    facility would also be used in collaborative work with Dr.                      Jacobsen's Center for Engineering Design.  This center designs and              manufactures many prototype items.                                                   The use of computers to aid and guide manufacturing is more                common in Japan and the European countries than in the United                   States.  This Institutional Infrastructure award is for the support             of an automated manufacturing laboratory that will allow the quick              design and prototyping of manufactured items.  Once the prototype               is deemed acceptable, methods of improving the manufacturing of the             item, particularly in small batch numbers, can be explored.  The                University of Utah has a long history of successful industrial                  collaborations and it is expected that the results of this research             will be widely disseminated to the United States manufacturing                  industry.",
