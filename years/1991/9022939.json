 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between aggregate consumption, productivity of                 capital, and levels of stock and bond market prices is a                        fundamental issue in macroeconomics and finance.  From  a                       macroeconomic policy perspective, an adequate understanding of the              interactions between real market activities and financial market                changes is necessary for formulating policies with direct impact                on the financial markets.  In addition, a reasonable theory of the              relationship between savings/consumption and changes in levels of               prices of financial assets can help policy makers interpret the                 signals that the financial markets continuously send about the                  future course of economic activities.  The contribution of this                 project comes in developing a new theory for the study of financial             asset prices that provides a more realistic representation of                   intertemporal consumption preferences than the classical additive               utility model.                                                                                                                                                  This project studies the microeconomic implications of a model of               choice under uncertainty in continuous time.  The agents in this                model treat consumption at nearby dates as almost perfect                       substitutes except possibly at information surprises.  All the                  time-additive as well as almost all the non-time additive utility               functions used in the literature fail to satisfy this local                     substitution property.  The project also investigates models of                 habit formation while retaining the local substitutability of                   consumption.",
