 "awd_abstract_narration": "In soils, fertilizer ammonia is oxidized to nitrite (NH3 +1.502 -               >HNO2 +H2O) by the chemoautotrophic nitrifying bacterium                        Nitrosomonas europaea. Nitrite is oxidized by Nitrobacter to                    nitrate, a primary source of N for food protein in non-leguminous               crops.  Thus the initial transformation of most food nitrogen is                carried out by Nitrosomonas.  Of great economic importance is                   loss of N in soils as N-gases produced by Nitrosomonas during                   oxidation of NH3 or by reduction of nitrate by denitrifying                     bacteria.  Control of agricultural loss by denitrification is                   attempted by the use of inhibitors of ammonia oxidation by                      Nitrosomonas.  This lends significance to improved knowledge of                 the mechanism of oxidation of ammonia to nitrite.                                                                                                               NH3 is oxygenated by O2 to NH2OH which is then oxidized (NH2OH                  +H2O)-> HNO2 + 4e- +4H+) by the enzyme hydroxylamine                            oxidoreductase \"HAO\".  HAO is a large and unusually complex                     hemoprotein (7 c-hemes and 1 substrate binding \"P460\" group per                 60,000 MW protein).  Four electron pass from HAO to a tetraheme                 cytochrome c-554. Two electrons then pass to a membrane electron                transfer chain and finally to a terminal oxidase, producing                     water.  Two additional electrons pass from cytochrome c-554 in a                separate electron transfer chain to the ammonia oxidizing                       reaction.                                                                                                                                                       Goals of the project include an analysis of the enzyme HAO, the                 cytochrome c-554 and the electron transport chain to dioxygen.                  They intend to determine the structure of the two proteins.                     Particular attention will be paid to the active site of HAO.  The               mechanism of turnover in the active site and electron transfer                  from active site to HAO hemes and then hemes of cytochrome c-554                will be pursued.  The approach involves protein purification,                   optical spectroscopy, peptide analysis, DNA sequencing, kinetics,               suicide substrates, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy,               Mossbauer spectroscopy and X-ray crystallographic analysis.",
