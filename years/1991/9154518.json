 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Consortium for Mathematics and Its Applications, Inc.                       (COMAP) seeks funding for one year to conduct a study of the                    mathematical preparation of elementary teachers in colleges                     and universities in the country.  The study will be conducted                   in two parts.  The first part, a quantitative study, will                       survey a large sample of institutions of higher education to                    determine the number of courses required, corresponding course                  descriptions, and departments offering the course/s.  The                       second part will be a qualitative survey using a smaller                        sample of schools; the data collected will include detailed                     course descriptions, tests, texts used, and other resource                      materials.  Anecdotal information on the relationship and                       collaboration between mathematics departments and colleges of                   education will be obtained in order to have insights on the                     design and implementation of all components of elementary                       mathematics teacher education.  The results of the study will                   be disseminated to all mathematics department chairs and to                     preservice program directors.  It will also be publicized                       through various professional journals.                                                                                                                          The findings of this study will help the profession determine                   the present status of the mathematics preparation of                            elementary teachers and guide future directions and                             initiatives in mathematics education.  The impact of the                        project will be very significant to institutions with                           elementary mathematics preservice program departments, to                       professional organizations, to certification units in state                     departments of education, and to funding agencies.                                                                                                              The study is supported by the Mathematical Association of                       America (MAA) and the American Mathematical Society (AMA).                      Both of these organizations will supply membership lists and                    information on departments and individuals.  The executive                      directors of the  AMS and MAA will endorse the survey through                   cover letters sent with questionnaires.  In addition, the                       Exxon Foundation will support the study with an award of one-                   half of the costs of the project.",
