 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hansen Planetarium proposes the creation, writing,                     and production of a 50-minute star theater program, From The                    Earth To The Stars, and educational chart aimed at                              informally educating over a million individuals regarding                       the exploration of our planet, the planets of our solar                         system, and the stars beyond.  The further production of                        three interactive exhibits is planned to accompany the                          program.  This program will be marketed and distributed at a                    nominal charge to 250 national planetariums, with 50                            additional production packets planned for loan.  In this                        fashion, top-quality, accurate, and timely science education                    can be guaranteed to a large selection of audiences.                                                                                                                 In America today there is growing awareness and concern                    surrounding the serious deficit our society will soon                           experience in the fields of science and technology.  The                        Hansen Planetarium's goal is to stimulate learning and                          interest in astronomy and other sciences for students of all                    ages across the country.  Exploration is, perhaps, the human                    activity in western culture which can most provoke debate,                      excite intense interest and stimulate scientific and                            cultural growth.  The utilization of expert consultants, in                     conjunction with Hansen Planetarium staff, will insure this                     program presents the most current information available                         about the past, present, and future of exploration.  Its                        interactive format is designed to stimulate a proactive                         approach to problem solution on the part of the audience as                     a stimulus to the learning process.  The star show format,                      with its dynamic special effects, will enhance the learning                     of science in America today.",
