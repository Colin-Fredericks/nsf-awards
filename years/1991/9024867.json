 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Battle will continue his work to construct                       nontrivial quantum field theories.  In particular, this project                 will concentrate on the nonlinear sigma model, a strictly                       renormalizable asymptotically free theory.  His technique of                    construction will use the relatively new concept of wavelet which               he will develop to meet the particular requirements of quantum                  field theory.                                                                        Quantum fields are the basic quantities which are thought to               be responsible for all the interactions between particles which                 exist in nature.  It is therefore notable that these objects which              are essentially mathematical entities, have not been shown to                   exist.  Professor Battle is one of the few mathematical physicists              who work in the area of construction of quantum field theories.                 His project involves the construction of a model theory called the              nonlinear sigma model.  A side benefit of Battle's work is his use              of wavelets in this construction.  These objects have turned out to             be of use in many other areas of pure and applied mathematics, and              Battle has and will continue to contribute toward their                         development.",
