 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies and compares three alternative methods of                  measuring willingness-to-accept to find acceptable solutions to the             problem of siting hazardous waste facilities.  They are the                     contingency valuation survey, laboratory experimental method, and               the structured focus group or public value forum.  Each method has              advantages and disadvantages.  The focus of the investigation will              be to compare the effectiveness of these three alternatives in                  obtaining willingness-to-accept measures, so that an acceptable                 solution to the hazardous waste facility siting problem may become              evident.                                                                                                                                                        Information from this investigation will be useful in wording                   questions used in community referenda that determine the acceptance             or rejection of a hazardous waste facility.  Such referenda can                 include a compensation package which is used to make more                       attractive the siting of an hazardous waste facility in a                       community.  Additionally, such information will be useful in                    investigating the ethical and equity implications of certain                    socioeconomic factors such as education and income in willingness-              to-accept responses.",
