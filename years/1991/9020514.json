 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Catharina Schreiber, Mr. Brian Billman               will collect archaeological data as part of his doctoral                        dissertation research.  He will conduct survey and excavation in                the Upper Moche Valley which is located in the northern coastal                 region of Peru.  The Moche Valley is well known to archaeologists               because in its later prehistoric period it contained \"cities\"                   with large scale temple architecture and other attributes                       characteristic of civilization.  Mr. Billman wishes to understand               how this complexity developed, and will focus on the preceeding                 periods where the roots of this process must lie.  His plan of                  research includes three stages.  Using aerial photographs as a                  guide he will locate Initial Period (1800-900 B.C.) and Early                   Period (900-200 B.C.) sites.  These can be dated on the basis of                associated ceramics.  These will then be mapped and surface                     collected.  The second stage consists of excavation of middens                  associated with individual dwellings.  Finally, he will conduct                 laboratory analysis of artifactual, floral, and faunal remains.                                                                                                 Archaeologists have proposed several theories about how complex                 stratified societies arise.  Some believe that the causes are                   external and such factors as the need to join large numbers of                  people together for common goals demands the emergence of a                     hierarchy.  One example is the need to dig and maintain large                   scale irrigation canals.  Others believe that the driving force                 is internal, that individuals compete for status and develop                    mechanisms to reinforce emergent status differences.  The Moche                 Valley provides an excellent opportunity to examine this issue                  because crops were irrigated in this desert region and the scale                of irrigation was different in the upper and lower portions of                  the valley.  Because the lower valley region has been well                      studied, it provides an excellent comparative sample for                        Mr. Billman's upper valley data.                                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons.  It will help                   archaeologists understand how complex societies such as our own                 originally developed and were maintained.  Since in many parts of               the world people still live at a Moche level of organization                    information of more direct relevance may also emerge.  Finally,                 this project will assist in the training of an extremely                        promising young scientist.",
