 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nervous system function is tied closely to the development and                  maintenance of neurons in both the central and peripheral nervous               systems.  Molecular technologies developed over the last two                    decades have greatly enhanced our ability to understand the                     cellular mechanisms that mediate these processes, thereby                       highlighting new areas of research.  One such area has included                 questions of how the neuron sorts its several thousand proteins                 following synthesis, which is then followed by cellular transport               of each one to specific locations.  The general mechanisms used                 to accomplish these tasks are used by all cells throughout their                existence and play important roles in cellular development, the                 reaction of cells to stress and the maintenance of the cell's                   functions.  By studying the above process for molecules like                    choline acetyltransferase, the biosynthetic enzyme for the                      important neurotransmitter acetylcholine, we can begin to                       understand how neurons of this particular subtype continue to                   carry out their contribution to neuron-neuron communication over                time.                                                                                                                                                           The projects undertaken in this study have been designed to                     exploit what is known of protein transport and apply this to what               has been learned about the structure of choline                                 acetyltransferase.  This enzyme possesses an extra statement on                 its amino terminal end that has the appearance of a structural                  domain capable of mediating translocation.  This will be tested                 by examining if the sequence is removed as a result of the                      transport process.  Similar types of proteolytic processing are                 commonly observed for protein translocation in other systems.  If               such a segment removal occurs, then it may identify one mechanism               by which proteins critical to neurotransmission are deployed. In                addition, this may lead to a better understanding of the process                by which proteins are recognized and how the structure of neurons               are maintained.",
