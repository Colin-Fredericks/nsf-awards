 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) project will                   engage educators and scientists in a concerted and sustained                    effort to improve the teaching of science in the nation's                       elementary schools and increase the access of all students to                   effective elementary science instruction.  The National                         Elementary Science Leadership Initiative (NESLI) will: (1)                      develop a talent pool of educators and scientists who can lead                  reform efforts in their communities; (2) provide technical                      assistance to school districts throughout the country that are                  working to improve their elementary science teaching                            resources; and (4) stimulate policy and program changes in                      school districts that will lead to the introduction of high-                    quality hands-on elementary science programs in school                          districts across the nation.  The key to the attainment of                      these goals is the development of informed leadership and the                   identification of national resources that can be made                           available to respond to local needs.  The NESLI project plan                    is based on research findings concerning the content and                        organization of effective elementary school science                             instruction; theories of organizational change; an                              understanding of the context in which organizational change                     must occur in the schools; and five years of NSRC experience                    working with hundreds of teachers, scientists, science                          educators, and school system administrators to bring about                      reforms in elementary school science education.                                                                                                                 The cost sharing for the project will be sixty-four percent of                  the NSF portion.",
