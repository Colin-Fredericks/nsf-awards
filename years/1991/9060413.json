 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is very little systematic data on volcanic emissions                 because of the lack of suitable monitoring equipment.  The                      available data show a very significant correlation between                      volcanic activity and emissions.  Therefore, there is a great                   need for new instrumentation that will provide the needed data to               understand and model the role of geochemistry in volcanism.  The                proposed research is a collaboration between volcanologists and                 gas sensor specialists to develop and use advanced                              instrumentation for systematic monitoring of important volcanic                 gases  (e.g., HC1, CO2, SO2, H2S, HF, H2O and temperature).                                                                                                     Recent advances in microsensor technology and electronics will be               exploited to develop a rugged, low power, low cost, field worthy                monitoring system.  The units would be designed  to collect and                 transmit real-time emissions data for a period of six months                    without any manual intervention.  The data acquired by the                      instrumentation is expected to stimulate the development of new                 models of volcanic behavior.",
