 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hemocyanins are large, oligomeric proteins containing binuclear                 copper centers were oxygen is reversibly bound.  The binuclear                  copper center is not unique to hemocyanins but is present in a                  variety of proteins that perform many important biological                      functions.  Hemocyanins, however, may be considered as prototypes               of this general class of metalloproteins.  The large size of the                native hemocyanins and the existence of subunit diversity have                  hindered researchers in their attempts to unravel the structural                basis for the disparity in chemical reactivity and spectral                     properties exhibited by the binuclear copper centers of                         hemocyanins of different species.  Two subunits, designated IIIA                and IV, of Limulus hemocyanin show differences in chemical                      reactivity similar to those that exist between the hemocyanins of               different species.  The small size and single binuclear copper                  center of these subunits should greatly facilitate the structural               interpretation of chemical, spectral, and electrochemical                       studies.  The two Limulus subunits and proteolytic fragments of                 these containing intact binuclear copper centers will be studied                using chemical probes coupled with ESR spectroscopy, NMR                        spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques in an attempt to                   unravel the basis of the disparity in chemical reactivity and                   spectral properties of the binuclear copper centers of the                      hemocyanins of different species.",
