 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. David R. McMillin of the Chemistry Department, Purdue                       University, is being supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,                  and Organometallic Program to investigate coordinately                          unsaturated excited states associated with metal complexes                      containing 8, 9, or 10 'd' electrons.  Specifically, the                        complexes are copper phenanthrolines and porphyrins and                         platinum(II) terpyridines.  McMillan will identify the orbitals                 involved in the excited states and assess the role of                           d-orbitals in reactivity.  Absorption spectroscopy, circular                    dichroism, and luminescence spectroscopy will be employed and                   emission lifetimes and polarization effects will be measured as                 a function of temperature.  Viscometry will be used in the                      DNA-binding studies to help ascertain the binding modes of the                  complex.                                                                        %%%                                                                             The objective of the work is to characterize the luminescence                   properties of these complexes so that their interaction with a                  variety of \"hosts\" can be assessed.  The excited states of                      these complexes are sensitive to their local environment, so                    they can be used as structural probes.  McMillan will                           investigate their interactions with macromolecules, including                   DNA and RNA, and with layered lattices.  The results could have                 application to catalyst design.",
