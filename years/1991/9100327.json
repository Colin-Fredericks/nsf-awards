 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study equilibrium                          configurations, instabilities and waves in fluids and plasmas.                  In particular, he will focus attention on fluid structures known                as vortex rings with swirl and their plasma counterparts known as               plasma tori.  Such equilibrium configurations are derived from a                variational principle, and the principal investigator will employ               the venerable method of geometric optics to study the stability                 properties of these equilibrium states.                                              In order to study accurately the behavior of fluids within                 the core of the earth one must appreciate the fact that under                   many sets of circumstances the fluids within the core act more                  like plasmas (ionized fluids) than ordinary gases and liquids.                  In this project the principal investigator will first make a                    comparative study of equilibrium structures and their stability                 in both fluids and plasmas.  Then he will apply these results to                describe the long-term evolution of small-amplitude perturbations               to stable vortex rings and plasma tori of the type found in the                 earth's core.",
