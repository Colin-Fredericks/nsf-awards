Tomasko, Doose, and Peter Smith, at the University of Arizona,             will analyze observations in hand and to be taken of Saturn, Titan,             and Jupiter in a coordinated effort which makes use of several                  existing and new theoretical tools.  These include: 1) input from               photochemical calculations regarding the vertical profile of the                production rates of gases that can form solid aerosol material; 2)              extension of an existing cloud physics program that includes                    sedimentation, coagulation, and condensation to evaluate the number             densities and size distribution of haze particles; 3) evaluation                of the absorption coefficients of methane at low temperatures; 4)               creation of a radiative transfer code for use in the thermal                    infrared; and 5) the use of radiative transfer modelling codes for              evaluating the reflection and absorption of sunlight from an                    atmosphere containing the vertical distribution of haze predicted               by the photochemical and cloud physics program.                                                                                                                 The bright and dark cloud features which dominate the appearance                of Jupiter and Saturn play important roles in the chemistry, heat               balance, and dynamics of their atmospheres.  It is now known that               a haze of small particles is formed in the stratospheres of                     Jupiter, Saturn, and Titan by photochemical reactions.  These                   particles fall to tropospheric levels where they can act as nuclei              for the condensation of several atmospheric gases such as ammonia               and methane.  The coordinated efforts of these investigators will               greatly increase our understanding of the physical and chemical                 processes involved in the production, transport, and recycling of               atmospheric aerosols as well as their role in driving the radiative             and dynamical state of these atmospheres.",
