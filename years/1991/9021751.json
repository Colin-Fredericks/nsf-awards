 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 University of Idaho for the renovation and repair of Renfrew Hall               which houses the research and research training activities of the               Department of Chemistry.  This building was constructed in 1963                 and last renovated in 1981.  The ARFMP grant of $1,300,000 and                  $1,948,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to              modernize these research and research training facilities.  This                project will address the need to improve the current research                   infrastructure both in terms of current standards of laboratory                 services and of federal and state safety requirements by upgrading              the ventilation, electrical, plumbing, lighting, and fire detection             and protection systems.                                                                                                                                         This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students in              the only Ph.D.-granting chemistry program in the state of Idaho.                The ability to train students in these laboratories to meet the                 future needs of the state and the nation will be markedly enhanced              by this renovation.",
