 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the response of topical glaciers                 to climatic forcing and comprises evaluation of satellite data,                 analysis of glaciological mappings and measurement, modelling and               prediction.  It is focused on a few regional targets in                         accordance with suitable information.  A \"topical satellite                     glaciology\" may become a reality thanks to the fine spatial                     resolution of SPOT.  Mount Kenya is an obvious early target of                  opportunity because here a calibration is possible with our                     1:5,000 map of the ice status in September 1987.  For Kilimanjaro               satellite sensing shall be used to assess cryosphere changes                    since the early 1970's.  The forcing of the observed ice                        recession by direct solar radiation and greenhouse effects is to                be studied for these two glaciated mountains in East Africa,                    where the changing ice extent can be documented for various                     epochs over the past century and where the topography is well                   resolved by maps at appropriate scales.  Modelling of a causality               chain involving the ice dynamics is intended for the only two                   tropical glaciers with a suitable documentation of field                        observations.  For the Lewis Glacier on Mount Kenya, field                      observations shall be evaluated to verify modelling-based                       predictions and to ascertain effects of climatic change.  For the               Yanamarey Glacier in Peru's Cordillera Blanca, field observations               and modelling are to be combined to predict future developments,                as well as to reconstruct the past net balance conditions and the               climatic forcing responsible for the ice retreat over the past                  century.  In conjunction with similar earlier studies for New                   Guinea and East Africa, this would indicate the diversity in the                beginning of the ice recession across the global tropics.",
