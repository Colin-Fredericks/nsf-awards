 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318891  Taylor  The vision of the Center for Light Microscope Imaging  andBiotechnology (CLMIB) is that understanding the cellular and  molecular mechanisms of fundamental biological processes is within  reach during the next decade.  This will be made possible by  integration of three major tools: biochemistry, molecular  biology/genetics, and optical techniques which allow exploration of  the in vivo dynamics of cell structure and chemistry.  The third of  these is the focus of the Center.  The Center's strengths are in  development of, a) novel reagents for detecting, measuring and  manipulating the chemical and molecular components of cells, b) new  and integrated modalities of light microscopy to detect and measure  temporal and spatial changes in cell structure and chemistry, and  c) advanced computing methods to record, analyze, display and model  complex imaging data.  Technique and instrument development is  driven by the needs of biological research to answer basic  questions in cell and developmental biology, and by emerging  applications in biotechnology.  The Center's research and training  activities are organized into programs in Cell Biology,  Developmental Biology, Applied Biotechnology, Fluorescence-Based  Reagents, Machine-Vision Microscopy, 3-D Microscopy, Advanced Image  Analysis, and Automated Interactive Microscopy.  Twenty-five  faculty from 6 departments and 26 graduate students from 7  departments are now working on research projects that involve  collaborations between biologists, chemists, physicists, engineers  and computer scientists.  Direct or indirect support from the  Center has resulted in 162 publications.  A new interdisciplinary  course, Applications of Fluorescence Spectroscopy in Biological  Research, was initiated, and a biotechnology training laboratory is  being constructed for this and related courses.  Other knowledge  transfer activities include organizing two conferences, supporting  a general-use imaging laboratory for outside researchers, and  cr eating a scientist exchange program with industrial  collaborators.  Transfer of technology occurs through interactions  with 14 corporations that license the Center's technology and/or  collaborate on research projects.  These corporations include  multi-nationals such as Dupont, Kodak, Carl Zeiss and Procter and  Gamble, as well as biotechnology start-ups such as Biological  Detection Systems, One-Cell Systems and Cadus Pharmaceuticals.  Two  new corporations have already been formed in Western Pennsylvania  based on technology transfer from the STC.  Two patents have issued  from Center research, 4 patents have been submitted, and 27  disclosures have been submitted to the University.  The STC is  involved in two major K-12 outreach projects: a) a group of high  school students and teachers worked with the Center for 6 weeks in  the summer in a program called \"Careers in Applied Science and  Technology (CAST), and b) the Center is collaborating with the  Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh and the Studio of Creative  Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University to produce a planetarium show  called \"Journey to the Center of the Cell\".  This project will use  advanced visualization technologies, based on work in the Center,  to educate the general public, particularly young students, about  scientific discovery and the biology of the living cell.***",
