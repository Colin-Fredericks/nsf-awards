 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Geological Correlation Program is a                      multidisciplinary scientific program established in its present                 form in 1973, sponsored jointly by the International Union of                   Geological Sciences (IUGS) and by the United Nations Educational,               Scientific, and Cultural Organization Unesco).  The principal goal              of IGCP is to promote international cooperation in research on                  global geologic problems, with emphasis on the nature and sequence              of major geologic events, geologic hazards, and energy and mineral              resources.  Program work is carried out through 59 individual                   research projects, 20 of which have U.S. working groups.                             The United States has played a prominent role in IGCP since                its establishment.  U.S. geoscientist helped design the Program and             are members of the IGCP Board and Scientific Advisory Committee.                The USNC/IGCP provides coordination and oversight of U.S. IGCP                  activities.  Support for this role is provided by the U.S.                      Geological Survey (USGS) in the amount of $30,000 annually for                  travel expenses for the Committee and administrative support costs              within the USGS.  NSF Funds underwrite domestic meetings of U.S.                project working groups, travel by U.S. representatives to project               conferences and field excursions abroad, and general clerical and               technical assistance to the working group chairman.",
