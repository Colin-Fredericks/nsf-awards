 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research utilizes resonance Raman and Rayleigh                  scattering to probe the electronic and nuclear                                  structure/function relationships of biological molecules such                   as the heme proteins (myoglobin, hemoglobin and cytochrome c).                  Related techniques, such as electronic absorption and far                       infrared spectroscopy, are also utilized and theoretical                        relationship that link a variety of experimental measurements                   are developed.  Further experimental and theoretical studies                    involving the spectroscopic and kinetic effects of protein                      conformational distributions are also proposed.  Dynamic                        studies will include the measurement and analysis of ligand                     binding to heme proteins under a wide variety of sample                         conditions as well as pump/probe experiments designed to                        monitor protein folding and conformational relaxation.  Laser                   mediated thermal perturbations will be followed using                           Stokes/anti-Stokes Raman scattering.  Studies of photon induced                 electron transport kinetics as well as resonance Raman                          saturation studies are also proposed.  Resonance Raman and                      kinetic studies of biological Single crystals will also be                      extended.                                                                          Overall the objectives are to achieve a better understanding                 of the resonant light scattering properties of biological                       molecules and to apply this knowledge to the elucidation of                     their mechanism of action.  These studies are significant not                   only in their relationship to the biological sciences, but also                 in their connection to the understanding of basic light-matter                  interactions.",
