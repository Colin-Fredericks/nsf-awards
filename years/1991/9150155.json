This exhibit offers an                           integrated understanding of how physiological structures in the                 brain relate to vital life functions and human behaviors.                       Senior members of the exhibit development team include                          distinguished neuroscientists who are locally available and                     committed to The Franklin Institute project; the team is also                   advised by a large panel of nationally recognized experts in                    brain research.                                                                                                                                                      Like all SMEC exhibits, The Brain will be seen by over two                 million Americans during a 32-month tour to eight major cities                  across the United States.  During the 1990's -- \"The Decade of                  the Brain\" -- the proposed exhibit project is important and                     timely in its ability to inform the public about new ideas and                  discoveries in the many sciences of brain research.",
