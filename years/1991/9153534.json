 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is making efforts to see a national                                replication/dissemination of the New York Hall of Science's                     successful \"Science Career Ladder\", a career access program                     targeted to women and minorities.  The funds are being used to                  develop materials including a videotape and manual for us by                    replication sites.  The initial replication is taking place at                  25 science-technology centers and was begun with a Conference.                  Together, the conference and materials are providing an                         information and support system for replication of the                           Science Career Ladder at other sites.                                                                                                                           The Science Career Ladder model recruits junior and senior high                 school women and minorities as Explainers for the museum, and                   is motivating them to become precollege teachers of science.                    It is a program aimed at enriching the experience for the                       students when they go on to undergraduate schools and are                       preparing to be teachers.  The high school students gain                        experience and knowledge through being trained as Explainers,                   and are then moved more deeply into the workings of the museum,                 both exhibits and scientific research, as undergraduates.  The                  program is carried out in collaboration with five public                        colleges in the New York metropolitan area.",
