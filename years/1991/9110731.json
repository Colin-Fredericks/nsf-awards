 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central question in development of the brain is how                           precise sets of functional connections are made between                         particular groups of nerve cells.  Model systems to study this                  question often involve a well-defined sensory organ and the                     target areas in the cortex of the brain which receive those                     signals.  Correct central connectivity has been suggested to                    depend on having normal sensory experience during development;                  with deprivation, there often are physiological and biochemical                 changes in the target neurons in sensory cortex.                                                                                                                This study uses the tactile whiskers of rodents and their                       characteristic \"barrel fields\" of target nerve cells in the                     cortex as a model with the addition of clear anatomical                         organization.  The whiskers are easily trimmed at different times               to provide a painless and easily reversible form of sensory                     deprivation in a local area.  Physiological, biochemical and                    anatomical techniques will be used to find out how deprivation-                 induced changes in activity of a particular neurotransmitter                    molecule (GABA) may provide a mechanism for changing the relative               levels of inhibition versus excitation during development and                   establishment of normal connections.  Results from this novel                   model system will have an important impact on sensory                           neuroscience as well as developmental neuroscience.",
