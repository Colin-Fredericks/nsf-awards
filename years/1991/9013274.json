 "awd_abstract_narration": "A chaotic router is a non-minimal, adaptive message router that                 uses randomization in routing and derouting decisions.  The use of              randomization simplifies the router sufficiently that it's                      conjectured chaotic routing can be competitive with oblivious                   routing, achieving equivalent or better average-case performance,               greatly improved worst-case performance and fault tolerance.                    Though the principles of chaotic routing apply to some degree to                any topology with multiple paths between nodes, chaotic routers for             binary n-cubes are presently under investigation.                                                                                                               The goal of the research is to establish a compelling case for                  constructing an experimental version of a hypercube chaotic router.             Towards that end a series of studies are presently underway.                                                                                                    1.            The idealized router of the proposal is being converted                         to practical engineering designs; the details of the                            chaotic routing logic are being specified.  Alternatives                        include sequential and parallel channel match algorithms,                       a virtual cut-through alternative to the store-and-                             forward of the proposal, various alternates for                                 asynchronous channels, various queue sizes, etc.                                                                                                  2.            A detailed simulator (with a granularity of approximately                       a half-dozen gate delays) has been created.  Experiments                        are being run on a 256 node hypercube to compare the                            different chaotic router designs with various alternative                       routers, such as oblivious and priority routers.                                                                                                  3.            Simulations are being run to analyze the effect of                              multiqueue size on the latency and throughput of the                            network.  The role of message length on latency and                             throughput is also being analyzed.                                                                                                                4.            Probabilistic analysis, completed last summer, shows that                       an idealized hypercube chaotic router is                                        deterministically deadlock free and probabilistically                           livelock and starvation free.  The new engineering                              designs are being abstracted and analyzed to assure that                        they are consistent with the idealized model of this                            theory.                                                                                                                                           5.            The first version of a custom CMOS channel design is back                       from fabrication and is being tested.                                                                                                             6.            Alternate implementation strategies, besides custom CMOS,                       are being investigated.                                                                                                                           7.            The generality of the chaotic routing principles are                            being analyzed in the context of different topologies.                          In particular, various forms of the mesh topology are                           being studied as alternates.                                                                                                                      8.            The role of clocked and self-timed logic in chaotic                             routing is being analyzed in light of the fact                                  theoretical foundations are independent of the timing                           policy.",
