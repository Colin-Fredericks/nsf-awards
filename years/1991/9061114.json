 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's             (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is               designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly             the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.                 Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising              proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.               Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the                   conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture             capital or other non-federal financing.                                              This is a Phase I project.  The PI is developing a video                   protocol for ISDN, to provide the foundation for all the real-time              video teleconferencing implementations likely to derive from the                ISDN and image compression technologies in the near future.  The                protocol is directed toward personal computers, converting them to              video telephones for the application.  The open architecture of                 personal computers will most likely be the platform of choice for               personal video telephones, which should be the boom market that                 will cause the general public to finally embrace the ISDN standard.             The principal objective of this protocol is to provide support for              personal video teleconferencing over basic access ISDN, and                     corporate video teleconferencing, with larger and higher resolution             images, over primary access ISDN.  Thus, one protocol could support             video teleconferencing in a variety of ISDN configurations.",
