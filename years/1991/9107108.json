 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research involves production of a generalized                  model of some important developmental aspects of mammalian body                 plans.  Most current models which to are used to understand and                 predict relationships among complex morphological and life-                     history traits are inadequate because they ignore important                     developmental processes.  Specifically, most current models                     ignore the role played by \"genetic maternal effects\"  and so                    called \"epigenetic interactions\" during development.  The                       proposed research will provide heretofore unavailable                           experimental data on the impact of genetic maternal effects on                  randombred mammalian organisms.  In one project, the                            investigators will use embryo transfer procedures among several                 diverse strains of laboratory mice to provide critical new data                 about the relative magnitude of genetic variation in both                       prenatal and postnatal maternal effects on the development of                   complex morphological and reproductive traits.  Further, the                    investigators will determine the extent of genetic correlation                  between these prenatal and postnatal effects.  Finally, they will               examine the persistence of maternal effects across generations.                 The second component of the project involves theoretical                        explorations and computer simulations about the phenomenon of                   epigenetic interactions.  The research will compare evolutionary                predictions made under different models of epigenetic control,                  and examine the consequences on epigenetic selection models of                  major genes and non-additive gene effects.  Finally, new                        experimental designs will be provided for estimating intrinsic                  and epigenetic effects during development.",
