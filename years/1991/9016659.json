 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the participation of ten US                     scientists in a joint US-Japan seminar on \"Micromechanics of                    Granular Materials\". Granular material is an assembly of                        discrete particles, the macroscopic behavior of which is                        significantly influenced by the properties of those individual                  particles and their interactions.   A wide range of engineering                 problems involve characterizing and handling granular                           materials, and solutions to these problems often rely on                        phenomenological formulas.  To improve these phenomenological                   formulations, much research is undertaken aimed at increasing                   our understanding of how microscopic information relates to                     the macroscopic behavior of granular materials.  Research                       undertaken by US and Japanese scientists in this area is                        complementary, US researchers concentrating on the formulation                  of rapidly deforming granular flows and the utilization of                      computer simulation, and Japanese researchers concentrating                     on the mathematical description and physical experiments of                     discrete systems. This seminar should therefore provide an                      excellent forum for scientists from each country to exchange                    results and discuss future research in this area.                                                                                                               The seminar will be held on August 5-9, 1991 at Clarkson                        University, Postdam, New York.  The co-organizers are                           Professor Hayley Shen, Department of Civil and Environmental                    Engineering, Clarkson University, and Professor Masao Satake,                   Department of Civil Engineering, Tohoku University, Japan.                      Specific topics to be discussed at the seminar include (1)                      constitutive relations with internal variables; (2) transiti-                   onal behavior including elastic to plastic, quasi-static and                    rapid deformation; and (3) two-phase flows.  This will be the                   fourth seminar in a series that started in 1978.  The prior                     seminars have been very valuable and the published proceedings                  well respected.   This seminar will allow this successful                       cooperation between the two countries to continue, and should                   lead to further exchanges of information and more extensive                     research collaboration.",
