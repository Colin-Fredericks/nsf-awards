 "awd_abstract_narration": "The museum of Science and Industry, Chicago, in                                 collaboration with the University of Chicago, proposes to                       develop a major new exhibit on \"Imaging Science.\"  Imaging                      science is a new field rapidly emerging from its roots in                       the physical, biological, and behavioral sciences, and the                      graphic arts, and is becoming increasingly important in all                     areas of scientific research.  The primary rationale for                        developing an exhibit about imaging science, and related                        programming, is to enhance the overall scientific literacy                      of four million visitors that come to the Museum each year.                     In view of the scientific, medical, educational, and                            cultural value of images, the Museum and University of                          Chicago believe that an exhibit on imaging science will have                    broad appeal to museum visitors of many different ages and                      backgrounds.  Today, scientific imaging empowers us to look                     inward, at the infinite complexity of ourselves, and outward                    to the edge of our universe.  The main thrust of the exhibit                    will be to teach visitors how images communicate knowledge.                     Technological advances in computer workstations, that are                       revolutionizing scientific study, will be highlighted.                          Exhibit sections will also identify imaging science                             breakthroughs that will impact the lives of students and                        members of the workforce in the 1990s and beyond.",
