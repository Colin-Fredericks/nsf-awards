This                    building was constructed in 1960 and last renovated in 1988.  The               ARFMP grant of $690,000 and $4,025,000 provided by the grantee as               cost sharing will be used to modernize these research and research              training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve             the current research infrastructure both in terms of health and                 safety and of the quality of research that can be conducted by                  providing fume hoods that are in compliance with current codes, by              insuring the adequacy of air-handling exhaust systems, and by                   removing and replacing all transite (cement asbestos) duct work.                                                                                                This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment not only for research in                      chemistry and physics but also more broadly, because these                      departments have a central role in various interdisciplinary                    programs at the University of Kentucky and because a number of                  faculty and students from other state institutions in the area                  utilize these facilities.",
