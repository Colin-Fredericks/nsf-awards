 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Corwin will continue his investigations in harmonic              analysis and representation theory for real nilpotent Lie groups                and reductive p-adic groups.  In the former area he will continue               work with F. Greenleaf on homogeneous spaces of nilpotent Lie                   groups, particularly on problems characterizing the algebra of                  invariant differential operators for such spaces.  Concerning p-                adic groups, he will extend his work on supercuspidal                           representations.  This problem is central in questions of                       representation theory for these groups.                                              Professor Corwin's project involves questions in the                       representation theory of groups.  Group theory is basically the                 study of symmetry.  If a system looks the same from every point in              space then the symmetry group contains the group of translations.               In particular situations, a knowledge of the abstract group is not              enough and one needs to consider concrete realizations of the group             of transformations, in other words, a representation.",
