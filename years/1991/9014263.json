Strahler of Boston University and scientists                            from three institutes of the Chinese Academy of                                 Sciences:  the Institute of Remote Sensing                                      Application in Beijing; the Institute of Optics and                             Fine Mechanics in Changchun, Jilin Province; and                                the Jilin Institute of Geography and its Jingyuetan                             Remote Sensing Experimental Site in Changchun.  The                             project is sponsored by NSF and the Chinese Academy                             of Sciences.                                                                                                                                                    The proposed study will develop models that will                                enable remotely sensed images of forest and crop                                canopies to be measured and evaluated more                                      effectively.  The modeling activities will be                                   conducted in the United States and the radiometric                              measurements made in China at the Jingyuetan site.                              The net effect of the proposed research will be to                              test an important class of models for the interaction                           of plant canopies with light that emphasizes the                                geometric, three.dimensional nature of the canopy.                              The expertise and equipment available at the                                    Jingyuetan site provide a unique opportunity to                                 validate these canopy models, which have been under                             development during the past several years.  If they                             prove sufficiently accurate, these models could                                 supplement or supplant other models in ecosystem                                studies, agricultural monitoring activities, and                                remote sensing applications.",
