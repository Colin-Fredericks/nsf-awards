 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year program, a collaborative of public and                          private sector organizations and business in Dayton, Ohio,                      will address needs for the improvement of the K-12 science                      education program in the Dayton Public Schools.  This will                      be accomplished through in-service training of teachers and                     through pilot testing and assessment of components of a                         revised science curriculum.  The collaborative brings                           together the resources of 27 partners.  The lead agency will                    be the University of Dayton.                                                                                                                                    University faculty from science disciplines, science                            education, and teacher education will provide academic year                     and summer coursework to help teachers from five elementary                     and secondary Professional Development Schools in the City                      of Dayton Public Schools improve content knowledge and                          science teaching skills.  A seminar series for secondary                        level teachers will be taught by scientists, engineers, and                     other personnel employed by private sector partners.                                                                                                            The participating teachers will receive intensive training                      to prepare them for roles as trainers and on-site resource                      staff for personnel in other schools within the district.                       Training will emphasize the development of critical thinking                    skills and the use of interactive learner-centered science                      lessons.  Content areas to be covered for elementary                            teachers includes environmental science and organismal                          biology.  Biology, geology, chemistry, and physics will be                      offered to secondary teachers. Fifty elementary school and                      30 secondary school personnel from the five Professional                        Development Schools will participate in the project.                            Workshops will take place both during the academic year and                     summer months. Summer workshops will be two weeks in                            duration.                                                                                                                                                       An amount equal to 151% of NSF costs has been provided as                       cost sharing.",
