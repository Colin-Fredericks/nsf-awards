 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer hardware will be purchased and used to enhance                    meteorological instructions and research at the University of                   North Carolina at Charlotte.  The acquired hardware will run                    software supplied and supported by the UNIDATA Program Center                   (UPC).  The equipment would be placed in the joint Earth Sciences               and Geography departments.  The common vision shared by these                   departments is to bring computer-based spatial analysis systems                 and enhanced, interactive meteorology instruction into both the                 undergraduate curriculum and research initiatives.  The proposal                is directed towards upgrading computer equipment for                            meteorological investigations that will have the capability of                  interfacing with a unix-based Geographic Information System.  The               faculty are prepared to immediately implement a host of                         physical-based applications to teach meteorological principles                  and access data that allows for applied research in drought                     analysis, water-resource planning, and development of predictive                indices of air-pollution.",
