 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between science and commerce plays a crucial but               little understood role in modern society.  For much of its life as              a nation, the US entrepreneurs \"imported\" scientific work from                  European nations to develop American industry.  Currently, Japanese             entrepreneurs are said to be taking advantage of scientific and                 technological knowledge produced in the US and Europe.  But how do              entrepreneurs take advantage of scientific developments in order                to establish commercially profitable technological enterprises?                 One way to get at this issue is to examine the historical record                and this is what Professor Margaret Jacob is proposing to do.                   Professor Jacob is exploring the feasibility of undertaking a major             research effort to rediscover the mental universe of the first                  generation of European industrial entrepreneurs during the first                industrial revolution, that is from about 1770 to 1820.  She is                 seeking to discover their education in applied as well as                       theoretical science, to examine the role played in their thinking               by mechanical imagery and analogy, by the ideology of science in                relation to discipline and work, order and design, progress and the             control of humankind and nature.  While examining the differences,              she is seeking by means of a comparative approach that will focus               upon archives in English, French, Dutch, Flemish and German, to                 understand the common assumptions of European entrepreneurs, that               is the knowledge and values they shared, as well as what was                    distinctively national, regional and individual.  Under this                    exploratory grant, Professor Jacob and a graduate student will be               determining whether they can in fact achieve this understanding                 with the archival data available in Britain, Belgium, the                       Netherlands, France and Germany.",
