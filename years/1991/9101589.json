 "awd_abstract_narration": "Further development of an interactive software product to aid                   in the building of model proteins is proposed.  Dr. Lee                         proposes to refine, incorporate, and test four new algorithms                   in the program.  The first is the incorporation of secondary                    structure information into the algorithm for the automatic                      locations of conserved regions in the proteins.  It will                        prevent inappropriate sections of the reference proteins from                   being classified as being conserved.  The second is the adding                  of a method for generating loops in the variable regions.  They                 will be more random in nature than those currently found in a                   structural database, and will span more of conformational                       space.  The third is an algorithm for systematically searching                  possible conformations for side chains.  It will help find a                    set of self-consistent rotamers that pack well.  The fourth is                  an algorithm to incorporate low resolution crystal data into                    the model.  It uses simulated annealing using x-carbon                          coordinates as distance constraints to find a folded protein                    conformation with little input structural information.  It can                  also be applied in a more limited way as an adjunct to other                    model building methods.  Taken together, these new methods will                 be of great use to the researchers who use the software                         product.",
