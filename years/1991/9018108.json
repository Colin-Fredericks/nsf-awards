 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this proposal is to understand how                        positional information is established in the Drosophila egg                     during oogenesis. Dr. Cohen is focussing on the expression and                  function of the K10 and C factor genes. His interest in K10 stems               from its known requirement in the establishment of dorso-ventral                polarity in the egg; females deficient for K10 gene activity                    produce abnormally shaped eggs that, if fertilized, die as                      embryos. Dr. Cohen's recent data indicate that K10 is transcribed               exclusively in nurse cells, but that its transcripts are                        selectively and rapidly transported into the oocyte where they                  are translated. Genetic and molecular approaches will be used to                identify the proteins involved in the transport of K10 RNA from                 nurse cells to oocytes. Dr. Cohen's interest in C factor stems                  from its potential role as both an activator of transcription in                nurse cells and a repressor of transcription in oocytes. The                    exclusive synthesis of RNAs in nurse cells appears to be a                      prerequisite for the subsequent localization of some RNAs to                    specific regions of the oocyte. To elucidate C factor function he               will; 1) determine the distribution of C factor protein in nurse                cells and oocytes, and 2) identify/generate C factor mutants.",
