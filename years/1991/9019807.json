 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an international workshop on earthquake                     research to be held in Santiago, Chile from June 4-7, 1991.                     The U.S. organizer is John Anderson of the University of                        Nevada at Reno and his Chilean counterpart is F. Lund of the                    University of Chile who chairs a local organizing committee                     consisting of four Chilean scientists, three from U. Chile                      and one from the Catholic University (PUC).  There is also an                   international scientific committee consisting of scientists                     from the U.S., France, Italy, Japan and Chile.  The par-                        ticipants will come from all these countries, from Austria                      and, in Latin America, from Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia,                         Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.  This workshop                 aims to bring together seismologists and earthquake engineers                   who share an interest in research problems that utilize                         strong motion data.  The strong motion program in Chile has                     collected significant data in recent years, especially from                     the March 3, 1985 earthquake.  Analysis of that data is                         contributing to our understanding of the earthquake source,                     wave propagation, and site effects as they affect strong                        shaking.  For the United States and Chile, specific benefits                    arise because the Cascadia subduction zone off Washington and                   Oregon, as well as the Alaska subduction zone, are similiar                     to the Chilean subduction zone.                                                                                                                                 Apart from the attendance of established workers in the                         field, we expect to have a large participation of younger                       scientists and engineers from the region who will thus be                       exposed to the state of the art in strong-motion-related                        work.  This workshop will provide a place for the exposure of                   U.S. research efforts in the field, and the close contact                       among participants will generate interest among talented                        students from Latin America to pursue graduate studies in the                   U.S. and/or to do postdoctoral work.  Thus, it will fulfill                     the goals of the Science in Developing Countries Program and                    address education and human resource concerns.",
