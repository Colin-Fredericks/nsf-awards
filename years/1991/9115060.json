 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a group of twelve U.S. experts in international             science and technology (S & T) policy, and especially U.S.-German               S & T relations, to participate in a U.S.-German seminar on                     bilateral cooperation in S & T.  The meeting is co-organized by                 the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the                    Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany, and the German                    Union of Technical and Scientific Societies.  It will take place                in Berlin from September 9 through 11, 1991.  The principal                     themes of the meeting are the globalization of S & T, the                       comparison of national issues in Research and Development                       funding, and addressing of public concerns about scientific                     developments.                                                                                                                                                   The objectives of the meeting are particularly relevant to the                  objectives of NSF's U.S.-German cooperative science program.                    They are to: 1) Review major areas of German-American cooperative               activities in S & T, considering strengths and weaknesses in                    these efforts; 2) Exchange views on future developments and new                 opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation; 3) Enhance                   relations between the two countries in S & T, focusing on pre-                  competitive research; and 4) Examine U.S.-German cooperation in                 the context of regional and international developments.  The                    seminar findings and recommendations will be disseminated widely                to public and private organizations in the U.S. and Germany, as                 well as other countries.  These recommendations are expected to                 have implications not only for the future of U.S.-German bilateral              cooperation but also for international science policy.",
