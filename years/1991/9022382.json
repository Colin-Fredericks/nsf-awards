 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mature nervous system functions, in part, because precise                   connections are made and maintained between appropriate groups of               nerve cells.  The formation of these specialized sites of                       connectivity, known as synapses, occurs during development,                     however only a small amount of information is known about the                   mechanisms that influence this critical process.  This                          investigation will focus on the neuromuscular junction, a model                 synapse between motor nerve cells and muscle cells.  The                        formation of the neuromuscular synapse appears to be regulated by               specialized molecules within the extracellular matrix.  Laminin,                a well characterized matrix molecule, is present in all                         extracellular matrices and is a potent promoter of neurite                      outgrowth.  In contrast, S-laminin, known as synaptic laminin, is               a homolog of laminin which is localized within the neuromuscular                synaptic cleft and appears to exhibit selective adhesiveness for                motor neurons.  Instead of promoting growth, S-laminin acts to                  terminate axonal growth and initiate synapse formation.  The long               term goal of this research project is to understand the molecular               mechanisms that contribute to the formation and maintenance of                  neuromuscular synapses.  The immediate goal is to determine the                 function, structure, and association of S-laminin with other                    components in the synaptic extracellular matrix.  Experiments,                  utilizing a Schwannoma cell line, will be performed to purify and               biochemically characterize this molecule.  This specific cell                   line produces and releases large amounts of this rare antigen in                the form of a soluble complex with other matrix compounds.                      Results from this study will facilitate future studies on the                   role of this synaptic molecule in the formation of the                          neuromuscular junction.",
