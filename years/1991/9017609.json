 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Diatom Collection of the California Academy of Sciences                is the largest systematic reference collection of its type in                   western North America.  It includes more than 37,000 prepared                   slides and hundreds of type specimens.  Marine, freshwater, and                 fossil diatom samples from the western U.S. and the Pacific                     margin make this collection an internationally important                        resource.  Dr. John P. Kociolek, Curator of Diatoms, has                        initiated a multifaceted program aimed at improving the                         accessibility of the collection, and increasing its impact on                   systematic, evolutionary, and ecological research.  The donated                 collections within the larger holdings will be integrated and                   entered into a computer database, and unprepared samples will be                processed into usable specimen slides.                                               Natural history collections such as this are the foundations               on which diverse biological research is based.  Ecology,                        evolutionary biology, and biogeography are but three of the many                scientific disciplines that rely on systematic collections.                     Supporting the growth and improvement of these collections will                 provide future generations of investigators with the essential                  tools of biological research.",
