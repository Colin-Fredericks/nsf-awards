 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to develop computing infrastructure in the          areas of parallel languages and compilers, automatic parallelization            of algorithms, computer vision, and simulation and synthesis of                 digital devices.  The infrastructure consists of a state of the art             Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) computer along with support             staff to ensure that the computer hardware and software are properly            maintained.                                                                                                                                                     The parallel languages and compilers for parallel computers research            focusses on the problem of the dependence of efficient software on the          underlying parallel architecture.  This dependence makes the                    development of portable software which is also efficient difficult and          to date impossible.  The research focusses on languages in which                parallelism can be expressed free of architecture assumptions and               compilers that will compile programs using these architecture                   free constructs into efficient code for specific parallel                       architectures.                                                                                                                                                  The automatic parallelization of algorithms research focusses on the            problem of efficiently mapping algorithms to SIMD computers.  The SIMD          computer executes by having many processors execute the same                    instruction on different data.  Thus the movement of data and the               choice of which processors should execute an instruction is critical            in order to obtain high performance.  This research focusses on a               software tool that can be adapted to a variety of SIMD architectures            and which will perform the parallelization of algorithms to be used             with these architectures.                                                                                                                                       Computer vision and image processing have been ideal applications for           SIMD computers because the processing of images can be broken down              into the processing of sub-images, each sub-image algorithm being the           same, followed by uniform data movement between processors.  The                computer vision research aims to develop a collection of algorithms             for vision and image processing that will efficiently use the SIMD              architecture.                                                                                                                                                   The research projects on the simulation and synthesis of digital                devices use the processing power of the SIMD computer to perform tasks          that would require supercomputer computational capabilities.  These             projects include the synthesis of digital diffractive elements and the          simulation of the operation of semiconductor devices.  The synthesis            of digital diffractive elements, used in optics, requires substantial           computational capabilities and input/output capacity (on the order of           10,000 hours on a VAX 780).  Similarly the modeling of semiconductor            devices requires substantial computational resources(the solution of            order 30,000 sparse matrices).  Both of these research projects                 propose to develop algorithms for use on the SIMD computer in order to          obtain the computational capability necessary to solve problems of              this magnitude. //",
