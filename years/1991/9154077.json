 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Minority Research Center of Excellence (MRCE) project at                   Clark Atlanta University represents the establishment of a                      Center for Theoretical Studies of Physical Systems (CTSPS).                     The Center will consolidate and expand existing research                        capabilities in physics through the development of                              interdisciplinary research clusters in:  (1) atomic and                         molecular theory; (2) quantum few/many body problems; and (3)                   mathematical physics and applied mathematics.  The clusters                     will strengthen ties with several national and international                    scientific institutions.  This MRCE is located within an area                   that has the largest consortium of private minority                             institutions in this nation.                                                                                                                                    The CTSPS will play a major role in increasing the                              participation of underrepresented minorities in science and                     engineering.  The Center will mount a comprehensive mentoring                   and tutoring program to encourage more precollege and                           undergraduate students to pursue doctoral degrees in the                        physical sciences.  Researchers at the Center will:  (1)                        conduct a science academy in mathematics; (2) involve capable                   high school students in research; and (3) work with                             precollege physics teachers through workshops, seminars, and                    visually appealing scientific demonstrations.  The CTSPS                        faculty members are well respected in the scientific                            community because of their publications in refereed journals                    and their participation in national and international                           professional conferences.  Because of this record, the Center                   will conduct a feasibility study for a Ph.D. program in                         physics during the fourth year of existence.  Collaborations                    will be strengthened with the physics departments of MIT,                       Georgia Tech, Stanford, and the University of Wisconsin.  In                    addition, ties will be maintained with the Center for                           Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy.",
