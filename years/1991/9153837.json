 "awd_abstract_narration": "The School in the Exploratorium (SITE) is implementing a                        three year multi-tiered program designed to prepare a cadre                     of 37 Lead Science Teachers from the San Francisco Unified                      School District and from Marin County school districts to                       implement district-wide hands-on science teaching.  Working                     in partnership with the newly implemented SFUSD's San                           Francisco Science Leadership Project and similar projects                       in the Marin County districts, SITE will provide intensive                      training in physical science, inquiry-based learning and                        school leadership for the Lead Teachers to support                              implementation of hands on science and the introduction of                      the new California State Science Framework.  This project                       will result in the creation of 34 Lead Schools in which the                     Lead Teachers will work with 74 colleagues also trained by                      SITE, to conduct on-site workshops for their colleagues and                     principals both in their schools and throughout the                             districts.  Additional activities include year-long                             internships for twelve science specialists for the                              districts.  These specialists will have experience planning                     inservice, working with students, mentoring teachers, and                       planning for district wide change.  Each school district                        has made arrangements for these specialists to take on                          positions of leadership and continue in that role after the                     NSF support is completed.",
