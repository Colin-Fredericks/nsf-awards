 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Michigan's Fish Collection contains more                 than 3 million specimens and approximately 2,000 type specimens,                making it the largest university-held fish collection in the                    country and the fourth largest fish collection in North America.                This collection was one of the first to be catalogued on                        microcomputers, and it remains one of the leaders in its                        applications of computer databases for research and curation.                   Dr. William Fink, Curator of the collection, proposes continued                 curatorial improvements to the curation of the collection and an                upgrade for the database hardware and software.  New storage                    containers will assure the long-term preservation of large                      specimens, and an active program of visiting specialists will                   identify new accessions into the collection so that others may                  study them.  New computer equipment will provide dial-in access                 by research scientists at remote sites.                                              The proposed improvements will increase the research impact                of this important collection.  Systematists, ecologists,                        biogeographers, and investigators from a variety of other                       disciplines will benefit from the continued improvements to this                valuable research resource.",
