 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long-distance migration is an integral part of the life                    history of many animals, including over half of all North                       American landbirds.  The mortality associated with migration is                 substantial, and yearling migrants suffer greater mortality than                adult individuals.  This research project compares the behavioral               ecology of yearling and adult Neotropical landbird migrants and                 examines the consequences of age in relation to how migrants meet               the energy demands of migration.  Many of the adaptations that                  have evolved in association with long-distance migration are                    critical when birds must cross geographic barriers.  Hence, the                 best place and time to study the stopover ecology of Neotropical                landbird migrants is immediately before or after they cross the                 Gulf of Mexico.  Study sites along the northern Gulf coast                      provide a unique opportunity to work with populations of                        migratory species.                                                                   Habitat loss is one of the most critical ecological                        problems associated with global environmental change.  The degree               and timing of these large-scale effects can have significant                    ecological repercussions that are hard to measure unless one can                assess each stage of a species' life cycle.  Dr Moore's research                into the critical stopover stage promises new insight into                      species-level effects of higher-order ecological dynamics.                           Decline in populations of Neotropical landbird migrants is a               serious conservation problem; one linked to habitat loss on the                 wintering grounds and fragmentation of forested breeding habitat.               The status of migrant populations is also affected by the                       availability of suitable stopover habitat and the response of                   migrants to en route events.  Consequently, factors associated                  with the stopover biology of migrants must figure in any analysis               of population change and in the development of a comprehensive                  conservation \"strategy\" for Neotropical landbird migrants.  The                 current research project combines observational and experimental                studies to compare stopover biology of yearling and adult birds                 and should contribute measurably to the conservation of                         Neotropical landbird migrants.",
