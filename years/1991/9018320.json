 "awd_abstract_narration": "All cells are known to transiently increase the expression of a                 group of proteins--the heat shock or stress proteins--in response               to a variety of imposed stresses.  These proteins, known to be                  present at reduced, but significant, levels in non-stressed cells               are of, largely, unknown function, although the hsp70 family have               been implicated recently as essential for protein maturation                    events.  The work planned will focus on putative interactions of                hsps70, both in vivo and in vivo,  focusing on the role of ATP in               binding/release of targets, and in the fate of targeted proteins;               evaluation of amounts and types of pre-existing proteins that may               interact with hsp70, as a function of stress, and the relationship              to thermotolerance will be studied.   Such studies should lead to               a fuller comprehension of the functions of hsps in normal cell                  events, and in those that accompany stress responses.                                                                                                           The cellular responses to a variety of stresses--heat, heavy metal              contamination, pressure, etc.--involve an increased level of                    synthesis of certain proteins designated heat-shock-proteins; the               interactions of these proteins with other cell proteins will be                 examined as part of an effort to understand the precise role these              heat shock proteins play in normal, as well as stressed, cells. //",
