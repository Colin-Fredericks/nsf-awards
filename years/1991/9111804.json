 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates how artificial intelligence can be                   applied to the study of organizations.  The authors construct a                 full artificial intelligence model of a small organization of                   cognitive agents communicating and cooperating to accomplish a                  task in which the interdependencies between agents can effect                   organizational performance.  Each artificial agent is represented               on its own computer using an extremely sophisticated software                   architecture, called Soar, that is capable of serving as a basis                for general intelligence and can learn from experience.                         Concurrently with these studies, the researchers conduct studies                in which human subjects participate in a \"real world\" version of                the task.  The task involves retrieving units at various                        locations from a warehouse.  The research question under                        investigation is:  \"Given an organization of intelligent agents                 that are capable of learning, what coordination schemes are most                effective and under what conditions?\"  The specific conditions                  examined are:  the level of training, the type and amount of                    information shared, and the complexity of the task.  A prototype                version of the system, called Plural-Soar, has demonstrated the                 feasibility of this approach.  The researchers intend to:  1)                   extend and refine the Plural-Soar modal to include all aspects of               the task; 2) realize the model on multiple machines that can                    communicate; 3) conduct a series of human studies to be used to                 test, refine, and extend the set of Plural-Soar models; 4)                      compare the results of the simulation and human experiments; and                5) work toward the development of a computationally based theory                of micro-organizational behavior.",
