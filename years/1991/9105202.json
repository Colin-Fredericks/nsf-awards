 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is collaborative research with Stuart Russell at the                       University of California-Berkeley (IRI-90204557).  Game-playing                 is an important domain for two reasons:  first, it exhibits in a                clean form two of the major problems facing AI systems, namely                  how to pay attention to only a small fraction of the                            possibilities in complex domains, and how to use a large quantity               of evidential information to make decisions; second, it has long                been considered a litmus test for ideas about problem solving and               for the quality of AI ideas in general, particularly in                         comparison to human intelligence.  Recent work on control of                    search by Russell and Wefald and on probabilistic inference in                  problem solving domains by Hansson and Mayer, suggests that the                 PI's will be able to break the grip of brute-force methods on                   high-performance systems.  The object of the proposed research is               to test out these ideas, with a view to demonstrating feasibility               of an intelligent chess program with the potential to perform at                a high level.  Should the effort succeed, the PI's will continue                with a concerted attempt to defeat the human world champion.  The               purely scientific benefits should be significant, in terms of                   demonstrating the feasibility of large-scale probabilistic                      inference and metalevel control; the benefits to the field of AI                in the larger national context will be immeasurable, since                      several influential critics will be disarmed, and success will                  avoid the extremely deleterious conclusion the \"all your need for               AI is faster chips\".",
