 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an international workshop on applied                        mechanics to be held in Valparaiso, Chile from January 2-5,                     1991.  The U.S. organizer is Dean Mook of Virginia Polytechnic                  Institute; his counterpart in Chile is Pablo Kittl of the                       University of Chile in Santiago.  The interaction organizing                    and editorial committee consists of engineers from Brazil,                      Canada, Argentina, Venezuela and Chile as well as from the                      u.S.  The objectives of the workshop are 1) to expose                           engineers and scientists as well as graduate students to new                    research findings, techniques and problems and 2)  to provide                   opportunities for personal interactions among the mechanical                    from all the Americans through formal lectures and informal                     conversations.                                                                                                                                                  There will be a special session with a panel of well-known                      engineers from both Americans to discuss how to further open                    channels of communication and to foster future collaboration                    between North and South America.  In addition there were 45                     abstracts received in Chile.  Such a level of interest on                       both sides makes this opportunity for interaction between                       U.S. and Latin American engineers and scientists along with                     the attendance of graduate students a good example of the                       fulfillment of the goals of the Science in Developing                           Countries program.",
