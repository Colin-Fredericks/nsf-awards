 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unemployment Insurance (UI) is an important an expensive program.               In 1987, over 2.0 million people received unemployment insurance                each week at a cost of 15.1 billion dollars.  Workers'                          Compensation (WC) is an increasingly expensive program that                     currently costs almost twice as much as the Unemployment                        Insurance Program.  Between 1970 and 1987, WC benefit payments                  rose at an annual rate of 7% after accounting for inflation.  In                1987, total benefit payments reached $27.4 billion, with an                     insurance cost to employers of more than $34 billion.                                                                                                           The purpose of this research is to assess the effects of higher                 UI and WC benefits by examining people who file just before and                 just after increases in benefits.  These natural experiments                    provide exogenous changes in benefits that can be related to a                  number of outcomes.  The WC study includes an examination of                    medical cost containment, post-injury health and earnings, and                  income distribution effects.  The UI study includes an                          examination of UI experience rating and its relationship to                     layoffs and recalls, the concentration of UI receipts in certain                individuals and firms, and firm histories of layoffs and recalls.               An important part of this study is the documentation of a large                 data set, containing over 30 million records, which provides a                  nearly ideal source to analyze these and other questions.",
