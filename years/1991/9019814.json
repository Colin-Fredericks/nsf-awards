 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      continuing work of Professor Paul Dowd at the University of                     Pittsburgh. The research is directed to the synthesis of reactive               intermediates which possess two unbonded electrons. The project                 will further characterize the electronic state of these                         biradicals. There is an interest in biradical intermediates, since              they are involved in ferromagnetism and some biological processes.                                                                                              Dr. Dowd's research will provide a bridge between theory and                    experiment in the area of biradical chemistry. In one project, the              electronic structure of tetramethyleneethane will be probed                     experimentally in a rigid molecule. Previous studies in flexible                systems have suggested that this biradical is a triplet, while                  molecular orbital calculations indicate a singlet. The use of a                 rigid system here will allow for an adequate comparison to the                  molecular orbital calculations. Simple molecular orbital theory                 predicts that non-alternant biradicals will be ground state                     singlets, yet this has not been tested. As a test of this theory,               these biradicals will be generated and studied by spectrocopic                  methods and chemical trapping. Two other biradical systems,                     semilocalized biradicals and methylenecyclobutanone biradical, are              to be prepared and characterized as well. Since biradicals are                  important intermediates in several chemical reactions, this work                should add to our ability to understand and predict the course of               reactions.",
