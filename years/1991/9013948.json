 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a long term sabbatical                  visit by Professor John J. Rowe, University of Dayton, to the                   Department of Microbiology, University of Groningen, the                        Netherlands, where he will collaborate with Professor Wil                       Konings.  They will apply new techniques to study the process                   of nitrate transport during anaerobic nitrate respiration.                      Their long term objectives are to define the mechanism(s) for                   nitrate uptake, and to develop a data-based model for the                       regulation of nitrate uptake by oxygen and nitrite.  Professor                  Rowe has experience in the area of procaryotic nitrate reduction,               and nitrate metabolism in general, and has recently become                      interested in nitrate transport and its regulation by oxygen.                   Professor Konings possesses expertise in the complementary areas                of bioenergetics and transport of solutes in procaryotes.  He                   has developed an energy transducing proteoliposome system that                  is applicable to the nitrate transport problem and that will                    allow definitive studies of this system for the first time.                     Dr. Rowe will initiate joint research in the Netherlands during                 his sabbatical, and learn these new techniques to enable him to                 continue such experimentation back in Dayton.                                                                                                                   Anaerobic nitrate respiration is common to a great number of                    bacterial genera including organisms of agricultural, environ-                  mental, and medical significance.  As the concluding step of                    one turn of the nitrogen cycle, it is of major significance to                  nitrogen cycling from a global to a microniche level.  Nitrate                  respiration is coupled to the expulsion of protons across the                   cytoplasmic membrane thus generating respiratory energy under                   anaerobic conditions.  Very little information is available about               the mechanism of nitrate transport across biological membranes                  during nitrate respiration.  In part this was due to the need to                use complex, whole cell experimental systems which yielded                      ambiguous results; there also has been a lack of suitable                       radioisotopes of nitrogen and oxygen for such studies.  These                   problems have recently been overcome by the development of                      sensitive nonradioactive methods for analyzing nitrate and                      nitrite and also the creation of more defined experimental                      systems comprised of proteoliposomes fused with biological                      membranes.  Thus the time is right for these investigators to                   join forces to tackle a very important problem in microbial                     physiology.",
