 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposed to demonstrate a novel               method of externally modulating light in a waveguide, utilizing the             surface plasmon polariton (SPP), a two-dimensional electromagnetic              wave confined to a metal-dielectric interface by coupling with                  quantized charge oscillations.  The proposed SPP modulator device is            in contact with a waveguide and consists of:  (1) a thin dielectric             buffer layer; (2) a thin metal film of a few hundred atomic layers;             (3) an electro-optic material with voltage-controllable refractive              index; and (4) the outer electrode.  A prototype modulator will be              fabricated on a single mode optical fiber by applying a thin-film               deposition of the layers.  When the refractive index of (3) is made             equal to that of the effective mode index, there is full coupling of            evanescent waves to SPPs and consequent complete loss of light from             the wavequide, so that modulation is achieved by changes in the                 applied voltage.  Unlike conventional devices, an SPP device can be             rugged and low cost, operating at very high frequencies with low                insertion losses and no back reflections.  The high sensitivity of SPP          excitation means that such a modulator can operate at very low                  voltages.  The feasibility of two-dimensional switching and modulation          matrices will be studied.",
