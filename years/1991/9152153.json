 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new astronomical observatory at Bennington College equipped                   through this project provides undergraduate students at all                     levels with an enriching experience in observational astronomy.                 The centerpiece is a high quality, easy to use, computer-                       controlled reflecting telescope.  It is equipped with a CCD                     camera and photometer.  Beginning students are able to find and                 observe more celestial objects, while more advanced students                    are able to complete laboratory projects in astrophotography                    and photometry in conjunction with advanced courses, and                        undergraduate thesis students use it for research projects such                 as studying variable stars.  This observatory enriches the                      whole physical science curriculum at the college.  In addition,                 the observatory is a community resource through programs for                    local elementary and secondary schools and for in-service                       training of teachers in those schools.",
