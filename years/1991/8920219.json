 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from the University of Utah, in cooperation with                  Cornell University, Brown University, the University of North                   Carolina, and the California Institute of Technology, requests                  funds to establish a Science and Technology Center for Computer                 Graphics and Scientific Visualization.  The Director of the                     Center will be Professor Donald P. Greenberg.                                                                                                                   The first generation of computer graphics will be harnessed into                a comprehensive coherent, and fundamental conceptual base for                   graphics and visualization.  It will provide tools for a new                    computational thrust in human-computer modeling and simulation                  and play a key role in our ever-increasing information-based                    society.  With increasing data from large-scale simulations or                  data collection, graphics is becoming the means to evaluate and                 assimilate results.  Computer graphics will become the dominant                 means of communication between humans and machines.                                                                                                             The major components of the Center's research are:                                                                                                              o      Modeling:  Current geometric modeling systems for objects                       with complex shapes have been based primarily on boundary                       representations.  New candidates will be explored in                            order to lay the foundations for a more general and                             sophisticated intellectual base.  The trimmed surface'                          approach will be investigated to make this a useful                             paradigm for modeling.                                                                                                                                     o    Rendering:  While the global illunimation algorithms that                       are now used can handle specular environments (ray                              tracing) and diffuse environments (radiosity), no                               comprehensive theory exists that can accurately simulate                        global specular and diffuse reflection.  Light-reflection                       models will be established to simulate reflectance                              functions and determine illumination methods for the                            general surface.  Techniques for progressive refinement of                      rendering methods will be validated through comparison to                       physical experiments.                                                                                                                                      o    Architecture/Software for Visualization:  The development                       of algorithmic improvements and specialized hardware will                       be pursued to accelerate the computations.  Emphasis is on                      portraying the time varying behavior of a model in real                         time in order to steer a scientific calculation.  The                           development of direct three-dimensional view and                                manipulation paradigms will be accelerated, as will the                         development of parallel rendering boards as full fledged                        nodes on state-of-the-art message-passing multicomputers.                \f8920219                                                                        Greengers                                                                       Page 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          In a field that has developed in a fragmented fashion, the Center               brings together disparate researchers and areas to create a                     unified approach for producing images by formulating definitions                and models as tools for image design.  This effort will atempt to               develop a common intellectual base and software for graphics                    research.                                                                                                                                                       This Center will stimulate enhanced activity in education and                   the development of human resources.",
