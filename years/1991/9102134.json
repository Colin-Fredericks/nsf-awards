 "awd_abstract_narration": "Common carrier operations, including truckload trucking, less-             than-truckload trucking, rail and ocean container, are playing                  increasingly important roles in the manufacturing and production                process.  These carriers are, for the most part, being asked to                 provide an even higher quality of service for an even lower cost                for shippers using their standard services.  This pressure has been             combined with a substantial increase in the size of the largest                 carriers, complicating the overall operation.                                        A common mathematical foundation is developed which focuses                on dynamic fleet management under forecasting uncertainties, which              is formulated as a network with random arc capacities (representing             market demands).  A novel solution strategy is used, extending                  similar research developed for stochastic models of truckload                   operations.                                                                          The core of the research is on the solution of                             stochastic, dynamic models arising in fleet management problems,                and the development of approximation methods for stochastic                     programs that allow the solution of large, real-world problems.                 Extensive empirical testing in a simulation environment is planned.",
