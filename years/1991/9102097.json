 "awd_abstract_narration": "In May, 1989, the National Science Foundation, NOAA                             (Office of Marine Assessment), the Max and Victoria                             Dreyfus Foundation, the New Jersey Marine Sciences                              Consortium, the Paul Hall Endowment of the University of                        Southern California, and the Port Authority of New York                         and New Jersey supported the first International Symposium                      on Coastal Ocean Space Utilization (COSU I) held at the                         offices of the Port Authority at the World Trade Center in                      New York City.  The purpose of the three-day meeting was                        to bring together an international group of senior experts                      in coastal ocean management and development to discuss the                      implications of new technology on coastal management                            policies throughout the world.                                                                                                                                  The success of that conference was manifested by the                            substantial attendance from around the globe.  During the                       three days of discussions, over 175 individuals                                 participated.  The discussions, all held in plenary                             sessions, were designed to provide an opportunity for                           discussion of international developments that were                              potentially useful to all coastal nations and regions                           facing similar environmental, political, social and                             economic challenges.  While it was not designed to be a                         technology transfer conference, certainly the outcome of                        the meeting was the communication of ideas for improved                         management of multiple uses in the coastal environment.                                                                                                         The grant provides support for the preparation of a second                      COSU meeting.  Primary activities include:                                                                                                                        1.
