 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference grant supports an international workshop on voltage             collapse and voltage regulation for U.S. and Sub-Saharan African                scientists/engineers.  Power system engineers from several African              countries will be invited to participate in a four-day tutorial/lecture         in Nigeria with experts in the power field from U.S. academia,                  industry, and government.  A major objective of the workshop is to              increase participation of Third World countries in providing solutions          to these problems.  Participants will define the common needs for               development, and formulate research priorities for cooperative                  research or exchange programs.  Reliable power is a prerequisite for            most activities in modern society, including most scientific endeavors.         The problems to be dealt with in the power system become increasingly           important as the complexity of the power grid increases.  The current           modelling tools and experimental data are not sufficient for                    understanding the problems.  The workshop promises to be mutually               beneficial for U.S. and African engineers by helping them in the                development of a new theory for large scale nonlinear systems such as           power systems.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the               Science in Developing Countries (SDC) Program with regard to strength-          ening the scientific and engineering infrastructure in developing               countries, and increasing the level of cooperation between U.S.                 scientists and engineers and their counterparts in developing                   countries.",
