 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between US                       and French computer scientists.  The US investigators are:                      Dr. C.L. Liu, Dr. Edward M. Reingold and Dr. Nachum                             Dershowitz, all from the University of Illinois at Urbana.                      The French collaborators include:  Dr. Rene Schott, University                  of Nancy and Claude Kirchner and Michael Rusinowitch, of the                    Lorraine campus of INRIA, the French National Institute for                     Research in Computer Science and Automation. The research                       will focus on algorithmic solution of restraints and the                        design and analysis of search algorithms.                                                                                                                       The task of designing algorithms for finding optimal or                         near-optimal solutions to problems as a set of constraints                      has received added impetus from needs engendered by advances                    in VLSI circuit design.  At the same time, some modern                          programming languages (e.g. Prolog) can be viewed as                            systems that search for solutions to programs specified as                      sets of constraints.  With parallel computers, new issues in                    constraint solving have arisen.  Furthermore, future                            programming environments may contain built in theorem                           provers and constraint solvers.  Techniques for analyzing                       search algorithms need to be developed. This project will                       address two major areas in VSLI research.  In the design and                    synthesis area, most of the effort in the short term future                     will be devoted to research in physical design. In the long                     term, the investigators will build up their effort in the                       area of higher level synthesis, in particular, working on                       topics such as logic minimization, module generation and                        state assignment. The project will benefit from the extensive                   and the complementary expertise of the two groups in the                        physical design of integrated circuits.  The problems to be                     considered will have important applications to very large                       scale integration, very high level programming languages,                       automated deduction and design of efficient search and                          constraint-solution algorithms.  The results of the                             theoretical work will have a direct benefit to our ability                      to design the wiring and placement of multichip modules, a                      very important concept which is being exploited by US                           electronics firms.",
