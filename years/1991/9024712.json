 "awd_abstract_narration": "The diffusion of impurities in semiconductors must be modeled              accurately to achieve the shallow junctions and high densities                  required for very large scale integration.  A five -species kinetic             model has been proposed to explain the observed nonlinearities in               dopant profiles without ad hoc assumptions and a research code                  written to implement the model in three dimensions.  Much work                  remains to analyze the resulting reaction-diffusion PDE system                  mathematically and to develop computationally  efficient algorithms             to solve equations numerically.  Specific tasks include                         investigating existence, uniqueness, and stability for solutions to             the five species reaction-diffusion system; comparing various                   integration techniques with the backward difference formula                     currently used; comparing several matrix-free iterative techniques              such as GMRES and BCGS with the incomplete orthogonalization                    method; finding a  suitable preconditioner that is natural;                     developing an efficient adaptive grid refinement strategy;                      addressing theoretical questions of convergence and stability for               the discrete method; and finally, parallelizing the algorithm.                       This project has been motivated by the need of developing                  smaller semiconductors for very large scale integration.  Progress              in this project has direct consequence in computer hardware design.",
