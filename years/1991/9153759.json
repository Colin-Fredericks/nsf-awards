 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this proposal is to use project-based science as                     a vehicle to improve science teaching and learning so that                      students will become more knowledgeable, thoughtful, and                        motivated to learn science.  The staff of the project will                      work collaboratively with upper elementary and middle                           school teachers to meld the theoretical and research based                      knowledge of university faculty with the professional                           teaching knowledge of teachers.  Because of an interest in                      the problems and potential of project-based science for                         different types of students, half of the participating                          teachers will be drawn from schools which service a                             substantial number of low-income, minority, and high risk                       groups.  The project will result in the development and                         dissemination of a variety of enhancement materials for                         teachers who want to use project-based science instruction.                     These support materials will be based on the detailed                           accounts of problems that teachers face and the solutions                       they devise as they implement project-based science.  They                      will include central components of successful project                           design and implementation such as illustrations of key                          events like introducing the project and instructional                           strategies in the life cycle of a project.  The materials                       will be expressed through a range of media from written                         documents to a computer-based hypermedia project support                        environment that will allow the teachers to search and use                      information to implement, modify and generate projects.",
