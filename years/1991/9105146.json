 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ordovician Period in Earth history (505 to 438 million                 years ago) appears to have been a time of rapid rotation of North               America.  The most important evidence for this rotation is                      paleomagnetic; the magnetic signal recorded in Ordovician rocks.                Unfortunately, the original magnetic record in many Ordovician                  rocks has been overwritten by a wide-spread hydrothermal alteration             during the late Paleozoic.  This late Paleozoic remagnetization                 obscures our view of the Ordovician motions of North America and                has made it very difficult to develop a consistent record of                    reversals of the magnetic field (magnetostratigraphy) in the                    Ordovician.  Reversals are very useful as time markers in the rock              record because they occur simultaneously over the entire Earth.                 The late Paleozoic overprinting is so widespread that it is of                  significant interest in itself:  What is the cause of the                       overprinting event?  Why are some rocks strongly affected and                   others hardly at all?                                                                To detail the Ordovician motions of North America and develop              an Ordovician magnetostratigraphy, and at the same time examine the             nature of the late Paleozoic event, we need a set of Ordovician                 rocks which are only partially affected by that event.  We can then             use the magnetic signal of the unaltered rocks to address the issue             of Ordovician polar wander and magnetostratigraphy, and use the                 relationship between the unaltered and altered rocks to determine               the controls on the late Paleozoic alterations.  This study will                focus on such a set of rocks from northern Arkansas.  The results               of such a study will provide valuable insight into the dynamic                  history of the Earth and its magnetic field, as well as information             regarding the dynamics of the hydrothermal system responsible for               the remagnetization of Paleozoic rocks in North America.",
