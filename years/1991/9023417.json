 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient and intense heat removal from a hot surface is of                     great importance in various engineering problems, such as                       nuclear power plant emergency cooling, continuous material                      casting processes, design of compact heat exchanges, etc.                       Spray cooling has been widely used in various industries and                    thermal management due to its convenience of use, low cost of                   operation, and more importantly high intensity of cooling                       rate.  However, the conventional spray cooling process cannot                   reach its full potential until its shortcomings, i.e.,                          inefficient utilization of coolant and non-uniform                              distribution of heat dissipation rates over a hot surface can                   be remedied.                                                                                                                                                    This research involves the use of electrostatically charged                     liquid sprays in the cooling process.  Preliminary experiments                  conducted at the University of Illinois at Chicago revealed                     that electrically charged water droplets dissipate heat about                   40% greater than the uncharged conventional case.  In                           addition, various interesting effects of charged droplets were                  observed, i.e., increased critical heat flux (CHF), extended                    CHF temperature, and increased heat dissipation in the film                     boiling region of the coolant.                                                                                                                                  Effects of charged droplets, namely, electric charge density,                   droplet size, droplet number density, liquid properties, and                    heater surface temperature are being investigated by both                       experimental and hybrid-analytical methods in this study.                       Using specially designed experimental apparatus and recently                    developed instruments, visualization tests of droplet                           impaction and heat transfer experiments will be performed.  In                  the heat transfer experiments, two different boundary                           conditions for a hot surface, i.e., a transient surface                         temperature and a constant temperature boundary conditions,                     will be tested in order to see whether a boiling hysteresis                     exists in charged spray cooling heat transfer.  In addition to                  the laboratory type of heat transfer experiment, real scaled                    experiments will be conducted by using commercially available                   electrostatic spray atomizers.  All the information obtained                    through these tasks will serve as a sound data base for future                  development of an efficient and high intense cooling                            technique.",
