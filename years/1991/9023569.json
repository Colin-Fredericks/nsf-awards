 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Moss Landing Marine Laboratory of San Jose State University                 will acquire several items of ocenaographic instrumentation to                  placed in a pool of shared use equipment. This equipment is                     maintained for use on or in association with the R/V POINT SUR, a               research vessel owned by the NSF and operatate by the laboratory.               A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1991                 is in support of NSF.sponsored research projects. The                           instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the ship                 and of the University to support research and engineering                       activities. The instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                       .A pc computer system for shipboard data management that is                     essential for real.time acquisition and display of large data                   sets,                                                                           .A six.pen color plotter for displaying processed data on board                 ship,                                                                           .A precision temperature and conductivity sensors for improving                 the capabilities of the CTD system,                                             .remote readout of navigational system for main science                         laboratory, and                                                                 .triple point of water cell for use in calibrations and high                    precision chemical analyses at sea.
