 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will analyze the geometry and topology             of manifolds by comparing different partial differential operators              defined on the manifold. It is known that there is a relationship               between certain invariants of a partial differential operator and               the geometry of the space on which the operator is defined. The                 principal investigator will use heat kernel methods to approximate              the invariants associated to the differential operators. He will                use this approach to try to find an index theorem for a Laplace                 operator which was originally introduced to study certain problems              in physics. The index theorem is the main tool used to link the                 topology and geometry of a space to the differential equations                  defined on the space. Hence if the investigator can find an index               for this particular Laplace operator he will have established a                 method which can be applied to the study of the geometry of the                 space. It will be important to understand                                       the role of curvature in such an index theory.                                    A manifold is the mathematical object which formalizes our                    understanding of form, shape, and distance; a curved surface is an              example of a two dimensional manifold. Partial differential                     equations are the equations used to describe most physical                      phenomena. The study of the solutions of these equations is a major             branch of mathematics in itself. The principal investigator will                study problems which involve both of these topics and the                       relationship between shape and solutions of partial differential                equations.        //",
