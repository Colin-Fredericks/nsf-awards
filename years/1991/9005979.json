 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this research is to investigate the                          application of observations from MST/ST radars to aspects of                    mesoscale circulation.  In particular, observations from the                    Flatland radar located near Champaign, Illinois, will be used to                explore three issues.  The first issue is that there is a need                  for better understanding of the relationship between the space                  and time scales of vertical motions, especially relating to the                 interpretation of measurements of vertical motions by ST radars                 and the synoptic or sub-synoptic scale circulation.  Coupled with               this issue is a need to identify the source of the apparent                     downward bias in measured vertical velocities.  Second,                         measurements taken with a five-beam configuration are now                       available and will be used to study gravity waves.  Case studies                and statistical summaries of features such as the vertical flux                 of horizontal momentum will be used to characterize the source                  mechanisms of mesoscale motions and the effects of varying                      background weather conditions.  Also, they will help interpret                  the variance spectrum of horizontal motions.  Third, the data                   from Flatland will be combined with other mesoscale observing                   systems located nearby, such as the microbarograph array operated               by NOAA and the Urbana ST radar, to provide physical insights of                mesoscale processes not possible with a single radar.//",
