They will work under the                 supervision of the principal investigator, assisted by several                  faculty members of the mathematics department.  The program will                                                                                                run for eight weeks concentrating on problems of cooperative game                                                                                               theory.  A well-trained mathematics student can understand the                  basic concepts with only a short period of preparation.  Some                   preliminary reading will be assigned before the students arrive                 at the site.                                                                                                                                                    Several areas in which there is ample potential for the                         development of sound research projects will be presented to the                 students. They include value axiomatics, application of values to                                                                                               real life cost allocations, value computation of the nucleolus of                                                                                               a game and multi-alternative voting power indices and matroidal                 simple games. Ample computational support for the project will be                                                                                               provided by the college.

Visits to the NSF center, the                    Advanced Research Institute for Discrete and Applied Mathematics                                                                                                at nearby Rutgers University are also expected.  Final reports                  are expected at the end of the program.  The most promising will                                                                                                be revised where necessary for journal submission.",
