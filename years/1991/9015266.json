 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a \"U.S.-Australian Cooperative                          Workshop: The Chemistry of Reactive Intermediates\" to be held                   13-17 July, 1991 at the University of Queensland, Queensland,                   Australia, and to be organized by Dr. Matthew Platz of Ohio                     State University and Dr. Curt Wentrup of the University of                      Queensland.  Great excitement currently exists in the field                     of reactive intermediates, those molecules essential to                         almost all chemical reactions.  They are seen as having                         potential for the discovery of new types of molecules, new                      structures, new materials,improved understanding of chemical                    reactivity, and the discovery of new chemical reactions.                        Progress in reactive intermediates is also seen as important                    for the chemical industry, as well as for areas as diverse as                   biochemistry, medicine, pharmaceuticals, new materials,                         petroleum chemistry, atmospheric pollution control, and radio                   astronomy. The 1980s was a decade for dramatic scientific                       advance in reactive intermediates, which can be attributed to                   both improvements in synthetic methodology and the introduc-                    tion of sophisticated new technology.                                                                                                                           Consequently, the time appears particularly ripe for a U.S.-                    Australian workshop, condusive to intensive discussion of                       these developments and applications, and participated in by                     scientists with complementary interests, but with different                     skills and expertise. No existing alternatives, such as The                     Gordan Conferences, present the opportunity for discussion in                   small groups needed to advance this field. In particular,                       this workshop will provide a rare opportunity for contact                       between expert U.S. and Australian scientists with strong                       interests in this area. The workshop will allow approximately                   twenty-five U.S. and Australian researchers to review recent                    research developments and discuss critical issues in this                       area. About six third country nationals (from Japan and                         Germany) will also participate. One goal of the workshop will                   be to define joint U.S.-Australian interdiscipliary experiments                 to advance knowledge of the structure and reaction mechanisms                   of these molecules. A book of abstracts and the proceedings                     of the workshop will be published, as well as collaborative                     research papers.",
