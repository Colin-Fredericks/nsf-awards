 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to expose the students to                      advanced technology used in quantitative investigation of plant                 hormone and secondary compounds in plants, problems in water                    relations in plants, and in the computer assisted monitoring of                 plant growth.  Students learn the principles of chromatography                  using a gas chromatograph and conduct quantitative                              determinations of hormone concentrations in plant tissues under                 varying conditions.  A water relations package gives students                   the opportunity to probe a field of science which is often                      neglected in most plant science classes due to a lack of                        equipment and expertise.  Computer and video digitization                       technology allow students to examine the factors that influence                 both the rate and directional component of plant growth.  The                   equipment is used in courses taken by students majoring in the                  sciences and non-science majors, allow students to actively                     participate in self-designed independent student research                       projects.",
