 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on building vision systems                   with supercomputer capability into fast, small, low-power, analog               integrated circuits.  Examples where visual acuity and dexterity                would be useful in products include collision sensors for cars,                 ground speed detectors for anti-skid lock brakes, navigation                    systems for mobile robots, perception sensors for micro robots                  and image pre-processors for remote sensing instruments.  Current               supercomputers are too large, too general and too complex to be                 cost-effective for such applications.  Vision algorithms will be                implemented directly in silicon through analog networks.                        Computation performed this way is the ultimate in parallelism, is               inherently low power and compiles to a very small package size                  because sensors can be integrated directly with computational                   networks.  Single chip sensor systems to be useful in the real                  world however, must be adaptive and self-calibrating.  Designing                adaptive, flexible, smart sensors requires extensive simulation.                In fact, for simulations to complete in any reasonable time                     frame, computational assets on the order of supercomputer                       capability are essential.  The research proposed is to utilize                  today's general purpose supercomputers to develop the appropriate               algorithms for designing tomorrow's application specific single-                chip supercomputers (analog vision chips).  The Connection                      Machine, a 64,000 processor supercomputer, will be used for                     algorithm simulation and device design of these self-calibrating,               adaptive vision chips.                                                               Standard computer vision algorithms bog down even the                      fastest computers in the world.  For most vision applications,                  commercial supercomputers would not be feasible.  For example, an               automobile collision detection system must be small, low-cost,                  and consume little power.  For such applications, general-purpose               supercomputers would not be satisfactory (even if they were fast                enough).  The solution is to utilize special-purpose custom                     analog VLSI chips.  These analog chips are fast, low-power, cheap               and small.  I have successfully built and tested more than a                    dozen different analog VLSI chips during my Ph.D. work at                       Caltech.  These chips perform various smoothing, segmentation and               interpolation algorithms using input from on-chip photosensors or               scanned-in test data.  Recently I am investigating some simple                  motion and stereo ideas.",
