 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Ronald M. Milburn of Boston University and Dr. Alan Sargeson                    of the Australian National University (ANU). The objective of                   the research is to better understand metal ion mediated                         synthesis of phosphate derivates. Previous collaborative work                   between Dr. Milburn and Dr. Sargeson demonstrated extraordinary                 hydrolytic reactivity for a phosphate ester in a cobalt(III)/                   phosphate ester system. This work has been the basis for                        further advances made at ANU, at Boston University, and                         elsewhere, in the area of metal ion promoted reactions of                       phosphate derivates (especially in the hydrolysis of phosphate                  esters and polyphosphates). The emphasis of the prior                           collaboration was on degradation of phosphate derivatives; this                 project will focus on synthesis of phosphate derivatives                        mediated by metal centers, including reactions which can lead                   to the formation of new phorphorus bond frameworks.  Systems                    to be studied will include phosphate ester complexes of                         cobalt(III), for both mononuclear and dinuclear complexes, in                   which reaction between the phosphate ester and a proximate                      coordinated phosphate may lead to diphosphate formation (and                    concomitant ester hydrolysis). While the research is                            exploratory, its potential is significant for results of                        considerable importance in further understanding of metal                       ion/phosphate interplay in biological systems.                                                                                                                  The project represents excellent U.S.-Australian collaboration.                 Previous collaboration in phosphate chemistry between Dr.                       Milburn and Dr. Sargeson led to a variety of new ways to                        activate phosphate derivatives, which have been used worldwide.                 This collaborative work with its emphasis on synthesis of                       phosphate derivatives has the potential for similar impact.                     Overall, this research will advance basic understanding of                      both synthesis and degradation of phosphate derivates through                   the use of metal ions. There is also additional opportunity                     for this project to have potential application to biotechnology                 related-problems, in particular, those centering around                         developing metal ion hydrolytic reagents for site-specific                      cleavage of DNA/RNA regions.",
