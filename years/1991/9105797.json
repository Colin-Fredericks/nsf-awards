 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) synthesize and                  retain high concentrations of urea in their tissues for the purpose             of osmoregulation.  Mammals also synthesize urea, but for the                   purpose of detoxifying nitrogen wastes for disposal in the urine                as urea.  The enzyme catalyzing the first step of urea biosynthesis             in liver of sharks is uniquely different from the corresponding                 enzyme in mammalian species, and it is also present in a few non-               elasmobranch species of fish, which is interesting, since fish                  generally do not make urea - they excrete ammonia directly into the             water via their gills.  The product of this reaction step is also               utilized for biosynthesis of precursors needed for genetic                      expression, and the formation of this compound is catalyzed by a                different but related enzyme, which in sharks is also different                 from the corresponding mammalian enzyme.  These differences are                 related to  the absence of a compound needed by most tumor tissues              for nitrogen and energy, and the results may have a bearing on the              observation that sharks are resistant to cancer.  Elasmobranchs                 also differ significantly form other species in how they store fat              for energy and how this is made available during fasting.  These                enzymes and processes will be investigated in this study and the                results will provide valuable comparative information about 1)                  these enzymes (the enzymes for shark appear to be evolutionary                  intermediates),  2) the evolution and function of the urea                      biosynthetic pathway, and 3)  the enzymatic regulation of energy                and of nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism in sharks and fish,                 which may serve as useful model systems for studying these                      processes in humans or mammalian species in general.//",
