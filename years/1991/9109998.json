 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Cordero is undertaking a new interpretation of the theory and               conceptual problems of quantum mechanics (QM).  His study                       emphasizes the role played by credible low-level theories as guides             and constraints in the revision of standard QM.  The project                    concentrates on the following elements:  1)  The claim that                     standard QM is incomplete and needs to be revised rather than                   reinterpreted.  2) Problems with approaches that do not modify the              time-dependent part of QM.                                                      theory as a major step forward, its critique and prospects.  4)                 Concepts of explanation deployed in the advancement of QM.  5)                  Partial theories of spontaneous state reduction induced from the                practices of scientists working on specific problems.   6) The use              of such theories as a source for non-ad-hoc revisions of QM.  7)                Incorporation of partial theories in a generalization of the GRW                theory.  8)  The paradoxes generated by collapse variants and their             prospects of resolution.  9) Measurement theory within stochastic               revisions of QM.  10)  The concepts of 'system,' 'dynamical                     property,' 'possibility,' 'actuality,' and 'causal efficacy' in a               coherent stochastic single-case QM.",
