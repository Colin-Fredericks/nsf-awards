 "awd_abstract_narration": "The phenomenon of fouling plays a major role in the                             performance of a wide range of systems including heat                           exchanges, organ implants, cardiovascular devices, teeth,                       and membranes.  In areas other than the membranes, it                           appears that the most non-adhesive, non-fouling surfaces                        are quite hydrophobic, with critical surface tensions of                        less than 30dynkm.  In the membrane industry, however,                          the opposite approach has been adopted in the making of                         low fouling membranes.  Hydrophilic, high energy surface                        membranes are produced having critical surface tensions                         of greater than 40 dynkm. by incorporating polar and even                       charged functional groups in the membrane.  One incentive                       for doing this is that membranes of low surface energy are                      difficult to wet.  Beyond this and for a few other possible                     reasons, there remains the question of why the differ approach                  is different.                                                                                                                                                   In the proposed work, both low and high surface energy                          membranes will be produced using a novel grafting technique.                    The                                                                             membranes will undergo fouling tests and performance tests                      with a                                                                          variety of foulants to define the effect of the research can                    lead to                                                                         new membrane materials, other approaches at minimizing fouling                  in                                                                              membrane systems, and to a cost-effective means of producing                    low-fouling membranes.",
