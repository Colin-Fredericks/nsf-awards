 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arabidopsis thaliana is a plant that is emerging as a model for                 understanding plant genetics, development and physiology at the                 molecular level.  It has many characteristics that make it more                 amenable to molecular inquiry than are other flowering plants and               yet because it is a flowering plant, has many homologous DNA                    sequences and genes which can be used to both isolate and                       understand gene action in plants with less accessible genomes.  The             laboratory headed by Dr. Gerald Fink has been in the forefront of               those using Arabidopsis to ask questions which have been                        unanswerable in previous work with plants.  The biosynthetic                    pathway for aromatic amino acids is under study and that study has              already provided information suggesting that differences exist                  between the pathway in animals and plants.  Continuation of this                work requires more appropriate facilities for growing plants under              controlled conditions.                                                                                                                                          The greenhouse, which will be built on the roof of the Whitehead                Biomedical Institute, will allow the continuation and expansion of              research using plants as experimental organisms by scientists in                Dr. Fink's laboratory as well as others at the Institute.***//",
