 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project contributes methodologically and substantively to our              understanding of the relationship between long-term and short-term              interest rates.  It explores surprisingly robust empirical                      regularities in the term structure of U.S. interest rates obtained              earlier by the investigator in joint work with applied empirical                economists using financial data from Goldman and Sachs.  The                    project uses these empirical results as guides toward developing                theoretical models that capture the dynamics of financial markets               much better than other existing models.  New statistical methods                for estimating the characteristics of non-linear dynamics from                  discrete economic data are also developed.  The research addresses              a number of fundamental theoretical questions about financial                   markets.  It will provide new insights into the determinants of the             volatility of financial markets.                                                                                                                                The research consists of two main projects.  The first one                      estimates an unobservable states, Markov chain model of interest                rates using a time series of prices on different interest-rate-                 sensitive instruments such as U.S. treasury bonds, bond futures and             options on bond futures.  The presence of futures and options on                the data should enhance the estimation of the process that                      determines the volatility of interest rates.  The use of a time                 series of different bonds allows for the estimation of the risk                 premiums embedded in the securities' prices.  The second project                aims at developing moment conditions to be used in testing and                  estimating continuous time stochastic models while avoiding either              the use of continuous data or the use of numerical solutions for                the conditional distribution of the state variables.",
