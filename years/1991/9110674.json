 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to develop expressions for                   the thermal properties of protein, fat, and carbohydrate food                   components during freezing.  These food components are                          considered to be the building blocks of food materials.  The                    specific objectives are to:  1) to identify standard materials                  for use in food freezing studies which represent the basic                      food components;  2) to construct phase diagrams for these                      materials;  3) to develop relationships between temperature                     and unfrozen moisture content for each test material; and,  4)                  to develop thermal property relationships for these materials                   during freezing.                                                                                                                                                The first task is to identify protein, fat, and carbohydrate                    based test materials which represent the basic components of                    foods.  Then, phase diagrams will be formulated from phase                      transition temperatures determined for different                                concentrations of these materials from differential scanning                    calorimetry experiments.  The expressions for the thermal                       properties will be based on thermodynamic relationships                         between temperature and moisture content formulated from these                  phase diagrams.  The building block concept represents a novel                  approach to the investigation of the freezing process, and it                   has great future potential for the expanded practical use of                    mathematical food freezing models which require knowledge of                    the thermal properties.  First of all, use of this concept                      eliminates the need for freezing point depression data to be                    available for different food products, and secondly, it could                   result in simplified thermal property relationships which                       would facilitate the use of complex multi-dimensional freezing                  models.",
