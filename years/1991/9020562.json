 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this proposal is to quantify variation                 in the anatomy of the head and jaw of four, closely related                     species within a subfamily of New World monkeys, the Atelinae.                  Currently there are a number of diverse approaches by which                     quantification of the morphology of complex structures has been                 attempted.  Each has a number of advantages and disadvantages.                  The PIs will utilize several of these in order to provide data                  which can then be used to explain cranial variation within these                monkeys.                                                                                                                                                        Hypotheses related to function, such as the role of dietary                     adaptations, will be tested to clarify the role of developmental                factors in the production of variation.  The results should help                to clarify the forces which were involved in the diversification                of these related species for it is thought that much of the                     variability seen today results from alterations in the patterns                 of growth in the species.  The results may also have explanatory                power regarding the relationship of form, function and evolution                in other primate groups.",
