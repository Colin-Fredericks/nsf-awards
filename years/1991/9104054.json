 "awd_abstract_narration": "To identify host-cell or viral \u0131proteins! that interact with                    conserved nucleotide sequence elements in the promotion of                      alphaviral RNA replication.  Four conserved nucleotide sequence                 elements of 19 to 51 nucleotides may serve as promoters in the                  replication of viral RNA.  Mutational analyses of three of these                elements in Sinbis virus have shown that they are crucial for the               replication of the virus and have suggested that they are sites of              interaction with host-cell and viral proteins.  Three approaches                to identify host or viral proteins that interact with these                     elements will be used.                                                                                                                                          RNA binding will assay proteins from infected or uninfected cells               that interact with these sequences elements.  Short probes of viral             RNA that contain a conserved sequence element will be synthesized               in vitro and used to study the interaction of the sequences element             with proteins.  These interactions will be assayed by mobility                  shift analysis of the RNA probe.  UV crosslinking of bound proteins             to labeled probe can then be used to identify specific proteins                 that interact with these probes.  Such proteins can be isolated and             sequence obtained in order to identify the nature of the protein.                                                                                               Many of the mutations introduced into the various sequence elements             render the virus temperature sensitive (ts) or otherwise highly                 attenuated for growth.  Second site revertants of two such mutants              have been isolated and it is anticipated that second site                       revertants of other mutants can also be isolated.  The supperessor              mutations in such second site revertants are presumably changes in              viral proteins that interact with the sequence elements, and such               suppressor mutations will be mapped.  In this way it is hoped that              specific viral proteins that interact with a particular sequence                element can be identified.                                                                                                                                      Chimeric viruses between Ross River and Sindbis viruses will be                 constructed.  In such chimeras, the proteins encoded by one virus               must interact with sequence elements of the second virus.  The                  properties of such chimeric viruses will allow us to probe the                  functions of the various domains and to determine the nature of                 protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions.                                                                                                                   To determine the boundaries of and requirements of these conserved              nucleotide sequence elements for alphavirus RNA replication and the             effects of changes in these elements upon RNA replication.  We will             follow up our mutational analyses of Sinbis virus conserved                     sequence elements in two ways will be followed up by:                                                                                                           Construction and testing; mutations in Ross River virus conserved               sequence elements in order to compare the results of the same                   mutation in two different alphaviruses.  A comparative approach to              the study of alphavirus genomes is useful and informative and                   Sindbis and Ross River viruses differ in a number of interesting                ways that can be exploited in the study of virus RNA replication.                                                                                               Viral RNA replication by these mutants will be studied  in order                to further define the role of these sequence elements in RNA                    replication.  Utilization of truncated RNAs with mutations                      introduced into these sequences elements in an attempt to dissect               the role of these elements in promoting the synthesis of plus                   strand versus minus strand RNA will be undertaken. //",
