In accord with our predictions,                                                 intraband processes involving                                                   tunneling and photoexcitation have                                              been found to have special                                                      advantages in terms of electronic                                               switching speed and the ability to                                              tailor infrared detector response                                               bands.  The proposed research will                                              be oriented toward improved                                                     understanding of intraband process                                              in selectively doped A1GaAs/GaAs and                                            silicon devices and toward concepts                                             which could contribute to the                                                   development of (A) heterostructure                                              quantum well (superlattice) infrared                                            detectors, (B) ultrafast electronic                                             devices involving quantum well                                                  structures and, (C) infrared                                                    optoelectronic devices employing                                                abrupt interfaces.  Some of the                                                 proposed work is exploratory while                                              other aspects represent a                                                       continuation of current research.                                               Infrared detector concepts involving                                            abrupt metal-insulator transition                                               impurity band interfaces associated                                             with modulated doping during                                                    epitaxial growth will be developed                                              and effects at impurity band                                                    interfaces will be studied.  The                                                work involves issues related to                                                 ultrafast resonant tunneling in                                                 heterostructure devices.  The work                                              also involves electron-electron                                                 exchange interactions, and effects                                              at heterostructure interfaces as                                                well as interfaces in modulation                                                doped, epitaxially grown silicon.",
