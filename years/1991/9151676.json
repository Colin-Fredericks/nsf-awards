 "awd_abstract_narration": "An undergraduate lab unit in composite materials, part of a                     mechanical and aeronautical engineering laboratory course, is                   being established.  The fundamental ideas demonstrated include                  the facts that composites are engineered materials, built from                  constituent building blocks, that their microstructure is                       widely tailorable and has a dramatic influence on properties,                   that the properties are strongly anisotropic, and that                          composite materials are part of an engineering loop which                       involves constituent properties, processing, and                                microstructure.  To vividly illustrate these ideas students                     make composite specimens, measure their microstructural                         features, test their mechanical properties, and look at the                     inextricable interactions between all three.  A unique feature                  of this lab is the use of computer-aided image processing as a                  technique to quantify the complex microstructures of                            composites.  As a result of this lab students have a greatly                    improved sense of how composite materials truly are engineered                  materials, and are better prepared to incorporate composite                     materials into their future engineering.",
