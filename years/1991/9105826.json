 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first three enzymatic steps in the de novo synthesis of                     pyrimidines (carbamyl phosphate synthetase II, aspartate                        transcarbamylase, dihydroorotase) are the same in all cells,                    whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic.  The structure, organization,                and regulation of these three enzymatic activities and their                    respective genes vary among species.  In bacteria, each enzyme                  activity is associated with a separate protein.  In mammals, they               are found together in a single translation product of 240,000                   daltons called CAD. By placing portions of hamster CAD cDNA into                expression vectors, one can attempt to complement E. coli and                   hamster cell mutants defective in each of the three enzyme                      activities.  This avenue of experimentation allows one (i) identify             the minimum genetic information encoding each domain, (ii) to learn             pyrimidine metabolism is affected when specific mutations are                   introduced that eliminate allosteric regulation of CAD or alter                 activity of one of its enzymes and (iii) to gain insight into the               roles of the bridging sequences that link the enzymatic domains.                Combining the approaches of molecular biology, genetics, and                    biochemistry should provide insight about the structure, function               and evolution of a multifunctional protein that plays a key role                in an important biosynthetic pathway.",
