 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computers of any kind take time to produce an answer to a                       problem.  Mental operations also take time to produce answers.                  Psychologists have studied reaction time data for over a century                in an effort to infer from the observed patterns of reaction time               the details of the mental computation being performed.                                                                                                          The past decade has seen a resurgence of interest in \"brain-like                computation\" which attempts to capture in artificial systems some               of the computational power of the nervous system.  Such \"neural                 network\" or \"connectionist\" models are potentially very powerful                and very fast, though it is not yet clear for what problems they                are best suited.                                                                                                                                                This project will study the behavior of neural networks with                    respect to the time they take to perform simple computations,                   with the primary objective of understanding the operations of the               human brain, comparing neural network simulations to human                      experimental data on the same tasks.  Different neural network                  architectures differ a great deal in the time it takes for a                    particular operation to be performed.  Parallel computers, for                  instance, generally exhibit reaction time patterns completely                   different from more traditional von Neumann machines, because                   they can perform many operations at the same time.  For example,                the most popular class of neural networks, multilayer feed                      forward networks, use completely parallel operations operating in               synchrony.  All computations take essentially the same time,                    although it is possible to build time dependencies into these                   models with additional assumptions.                                                                                                                             However, another class of parallel neural network models, non-                  linear dynamical system models, show very strong intrinsic time                 dependencies.  Examples of such neural network models are                       Hopfield networks, the ART models, and the model to be used in                  this research, the BSB model.  Most of the interest in neural                   networks has been in their computational abilities, i.e., getting               interesting answers to problems.  But ideally, a model of a human               mental operation should do two things, compute the answer and                   take the same relative time to do it as humans.  Preliminary                    simulations using the BSB model for a simple task have shown a                  reasonable match to experimental reaction time patterns in the                  well-studied, simple problem of deciding whether two stimuli are                the same or different and responding appropriately.                                                                                                             Study of the reaction time patterns produced by neural network                  models for human cognition will begin with simple tasks and then                progress to more complex problems.  One example is application of               this model to the reaction time required to obtain the answers to               problems in simple arithmetic.",
