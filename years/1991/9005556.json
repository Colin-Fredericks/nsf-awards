 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will build on recent experimental and                             theoretical discoveries concerning lipid monolayers at the                      air-water interface, discoveries based in large part on the                     use of epifluorescence microscopy.  The objective of this                       research is to exploit further these microscopic techniques                     so as to detect with ultrahigh sensitivity physical,                            chemical, photochemical and biochemical events that occur at                    this interface.                                                                                                                                                 Topics of special relevance to this overall objective include                   the investigation of the structural properties of molecules                     (for example peptides) that affect the free energy along                        boundaries between lipid domains, molecular events that                         modify the local monolayer pressure and photochemical                           reactions involving attack of reactive oxygen species on                        lipids and other surface active molecules.  Biochemical                         events of special interest include studies of lipases that                      selectively attack molecules at domain boundaries, and                          molecular events relevant to cell-cell recognition, and                         virus-cell recognition.  Experiments will be conducted to see                   if the shapes, and shape transitions of lipid domains can be                    used to detect products derived from microlectorphoresis.                                                                                                       From a long-term point of view these experiments may lead to                    new techniques for detecting, and manipulating small numbers                    of molecules, especially biological macromolecules.",
