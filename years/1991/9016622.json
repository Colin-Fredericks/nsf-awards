 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the participation of eight US                   scientists in a joint US-Japan seminar on \"the Biophysical                      Chemistry of Retinal Proteins\".  The chemistry of retinal                       proteins is a rapidly emerging area of biophysics.  Retinal-                    containing pigments are a class of intrinsic membrane                           proteins the mediate energy and information transduction.                       Much research in this area concentrates upon the molecular                      mechanisms of the transduction processes and recent progress                    on site-specific mutagenesis, sequence and structure                            determination and spectroscopic studies of intermediate                         structure and dynamics now present the real possibility of                      determining the molecular mechanism of these processes.  Most                   of the main contributions to this area have been made by                        American and Japanese scientists, many of whom it is intended                   should participate in this seminar.  For this reason the                        seminar should provide an excellent forum for formulating a                     more complete picture or retinal transduction.                                                                                                                  The seminar is to be held on January 12-18, 1992 at the                         University of Hawaii, Honolulu.  The co-organizers are                          Professor Richard Mathies, Department of Chemistry, University                  of California, Berkeley and Associate Professor Toshiaki                        Kakitani, Department of Physics, Nagoya University, Japan.                      Specific topics to be discussed at the seminar include (1)                      retinal protein structure and genetics; (2) chromophore                         structure and the environment; (3) photoactivation of                           retinal-proteins; (4) analysis of structure and transduction                    mechanisms; and (5) pigment regeneration and signal transduc-                   tion.  These topics represent the right combination of                          biochemistry, spectrochemistry and genetic engineering to                       make a real contribution to this subject area.  The seminar                     will permit representatives from several research groups in                     the two countries to meet and exchange information which                        could lead to more extensive research collaboration.",
