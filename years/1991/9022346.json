 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grounding of the Argentine ship Bahia Paraiso near the United               States Palmer Station highlighted the need, and potential, for                  resolving hydrocarbon contamination due to acute releases,                      chronic exposure and global transport.  This study will                         investigate the distribution, sources, and fate of hydrocarbons                 along the Antarctic Peninsula.  Hydrocarbons are ubiquitous                     components of marine and terrestrial systems and represent inputs               from biological processes, local contamination, atmospheric                     transport, recycled continental material and digenesis.  The                    biogeochemical cycle of hydrocarbons encompasses a variety of                   interaction which impart characteristic compositions that are                   useful as tracers of complex processes.  Detailed analysis of                   hydrocarbons and their alteration products will be used to                      document the relative importance of various inputs as well as                   provide insight into the processes that determine pollutant                     distributions.  Cores taken close to scientific stations will be                used to document the onset, composition, and magnitude of                       hydrocarbon pollution caused by man's presence on the Antarctic                 Peninsula.  This historical perspective will be provided by the                 analysis of core samples dated by tracer methods.  Shallow                      sediments collected near Palmer Station will be analyzed as well                as surficial sediments from remote areas.  Data collected will be               used to assess the importance of present day atmospheric                        transport of combustion product hydrocarbons.  The relative                     importance of localized anthropogenic, global anthropogenic and                 natural combustion hydrocarbons is expected to be resolved.",
