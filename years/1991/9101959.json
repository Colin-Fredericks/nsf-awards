 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Berkson will apply abstract operator theory and                  harmonic analysis to a broad range of topics in modern analysis.                In recent years Professor Berkson's efforts have been directed at               developing an abstract Banach space operator theory which                       incorporates and expands the transference methods of Coifman and                Weiss.  These efforts have now reached fruition, providing a                    unified and simplifying overview of the role of harmonic analysis               in many aspects of general analysis.  The present program will                  apply this overview to applications of central themes in analysis.              The focus will be ergodic theory and its generalizations, as well               as on classical and abstract harmonic analysis.  The consequences               for spectral theory and harmonic analysis in special spaces will be             investigated.                                                                        Professor Berkson's work has been in abstract operator theory.             (Harmonic analysis can be considered a study of special classes of              operators.)  In the present project he will turn his attention to               more applied topics to see how successfully the abstract ideas can              be used in areas such as ergodic theory, classical analysis, and                spectral theory.",
