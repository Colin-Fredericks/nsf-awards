 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to provide travel support for young scientists               to attend the International Conference on Calcitonin Gene-Related               Peptide.  Calcitonin gene-related peptide is 37-amino acid                      biologically active hormone discovered in 1983 by molecular                     techniques.  This neuropeptide has profound effects on the                      neural, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems and may act                 as a neuromodulator and/or tropic factor.  The format of this                   meeting reflects the interdisciplinary nature of the research.                  Topics include the characterization and distribution of the                     receptors in the nervous system, the molecular and biochemical                  processing of the peptide, its biological actions and a session                 to address new perspectives.  Indeed, this meeting brings                       together, for the first time, leading experts and young                         scientists from around the world that use wide variety of                       approaches to share information about calcitonin gene-related                   peptide.  This cross-pollination of the disciplines will                        accelerate process in understanding the role of calcitonin gene-                related peptide in intercellular signalling and intracellular                   processing in the brain which could have implications for                       clinical applications.",
