 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Utah, in conjunction with the University                 of Texas at Austin, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and                  the University of Washington, will conduct a Regional Geometry                  Institute aimed at integrating research and educational                         activities in the area of geometry.  The participants in the                    Institute will include research faculty in mathematics;                         mathematics educators; faculty from undergraduate institutions;                 graduate, undergraduate and high school students; and high school               teachers.  They will participate in month-long summer workshops                 and in academic year activities at three sites.  The guiding                    philosophy of the Institute is that research and education in                   mathematics can and should be working partners, and that                        researchers and educators can benefit from one another.  During                 the first year the research focus will be the geometry and                      topology of manifolds and quantum field theory.  During the                     second year the focus will be on nonlinear partial differential                 equations in differential geometry.  The educational component                  will focus on various means of introducing modern concepts in                   geometry into the undergraduate and precollege classroom.",
