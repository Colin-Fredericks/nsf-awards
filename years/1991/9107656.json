 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Seventh Conversation in Biomolecular Stereodynamics will be                 held in June at SUNY/Albany.  Started in 1979, then repeated every              two years, the conference has become a main event to discuss and                debate the developing ideas and discoveries in the broad context                of biological structure, dynamics, interactions and expression.                 Over 500 scientists from 15 countries participated in the last                  meeting.                                                                                                                                                        The following areas will be covered:  1) RNA structure and                      activity; 2) DNA protein modular structural motifs; 3) protein-                 nucleic acid interactions; 4) protein structure; 5) DNA structure               & dynamics; 6) unusual DNA-drug interactions; 7) DNA damage and                 repair; and 8) DNA footprinting.  Every effort will be made to                  devote a significant part of the time to talks by graduate                      students, postdoctorals and young faculty.  The main lectures will              be published within a year of the meeting as the Proceeding of the              Seventh Conversation.",
