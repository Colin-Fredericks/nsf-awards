 "awd_abstract_narration": "Foreign policy decisions are influenced to a considerable extent                by the nature of the information available to the decision maker                and by the way that information is analyzed and processed.  A long              tradition of previous research demonstrates that the way decisions              makers perceive and respond to information depends significantly                on their prior beliefs.  To date, however, the complexity of these              beliefs has made them very difficult to study systematically using              standard empirical methods.  This project uses computational                    modeling techniques, including expert system technology, to more                systematically examine the impact of complex belief systems on the              processing of foreign policy information.                                                                                                                       Specifically, this research continues development of a large expert             system model, called POLI, of U.S. foreign policy making in Asia.               Prior work with this model has focussed on the 1950s and has proven             highly successful in reproducing U.S. responses to Asia during that             decade.  This project will attempt to validate and refine the model             by extending its analysis of foreign policy in Asia from 1960                   through the present.                                                                                                                                            When completed this project not only should provide a better                    understanding of the processes through which U.S. foreign policy                is made but should provide a powerful tool that can be used by                  policy makers to improve decision making.",
