The purpose of this research is to analyze               the impact of job characteristics on retirement.  A model is                    developed and estimated which takes into account the notion that                pensions and age of retirement are jointly determined, based on                 comparison of a workers productivity and the marginal disutility                of work.  This differs from previous studies where age of                       retirement has been treated independent of these factors.  The                  model will be tested using data on characteristics of occupation                drawn from a number of sources and individual work histories from               the Retirement History Survey.  Several alternative specifications              will be tested, including continuous dependent variables,                       categorical dependent variables, and transition hazards.  This                  research is important because it will provide a better                          understanding of how retirement age may be affected by public                   policy regarding pensions, and how changes in retirement age might              affect the composition of the labor force.",
