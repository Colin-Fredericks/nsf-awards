 "awd_abstract_narration": "An ion chromatograph is to be purchased with this Research                      Equipment Grant to support three different projects in the                      Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Departments.  The purpose                    of the first project is to identify and quantify the metal                      species that exist as a result of thermal degradation of                        hazardous waste.  In the second, high performance ion                           chromatography will be investigated as an analytical tool for                   characterizing cyanide bearing waste.  A third application is                   to the evaluation of the concentration and speciation of                        metals and other substances such as cyanide in the tailings at                  abandoned mining sites, and to assess the leachability of                       hazardous chemicals from the site.                                                                                                                              Heavy metals such as leaf, mercury and arsenic pose a serious                   hazard to human health if they become concentrated in drinking                  water or the food chain.  An ion chromatograph has the ability                  to separate mixtures of cations and anions, free and                            complexed, providing a way to characterize the chemical state,                  and thus the desirability, of specific heavy metals present in                  a waste stream.",
