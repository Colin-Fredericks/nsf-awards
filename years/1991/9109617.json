 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses topics in the area of the worst                         case identification of dynamical systems.  The goals of                         this research program are to develop methods for                                system identification that reduce the uncertainty                               surrounding a given dynamical system in a way that is                           matched to robust control theory.  There will be three                          areas of concentration.  The first area of research will                        be algorithm development for linear time invariant                              systems using a combination of a priori and                                     experimental information.  The error criterion of                               identification will be chosen to be compatible with                             robust control design techniques.  A study will be made                         of the intrinsic difficulty of identification of each choice                    of a priori and experimental information using the                              techniques of Information Based Complexity theory.                              The second research area is the study and the                                   development of worst case identification methods for                            the determination of linearized models of nonlinear                             systems.  The research will develop methods for study                           intrinsic limits of identification of locally unstable                          linearized dynamics of smooth nonlinear systems when                            experimental data is obtained from closed loop                                  experiments.  The third research area is the study of                           offline adaptive control techniques.  The research will                         study the merging of worst case system identification                           with robust control theory with the goal of developing                          efficient and nonconservative methods for utilizing                             tools for the reduction of uncertainty and the                                  consequent design of feedback controllers in order to                           meet a given performance goal.",
