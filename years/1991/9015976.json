 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of hydrodynamics (HD) is critical in several areas of                 astrophysics.   One of those areas concerns certain brief phases                of stellar evolution, lasting minutes or even seconds, in which                 very rapid structural changes can occur in the star, critically                 affecting their evolution.  The most common of these events in the              sudden core-collapse of a massive star, leading to the explosion                of a \"supernova\" (SN).  It has long been known that the remnant                 \"shell\" from supernova explosions aggregates into filamentary and               \"elephant trunk\" structures that indicate HD instabilities as the               SN blast wave expands into interstellar space.  The most recent                 observations of the supernova \"SN1987a\" in the Large Magellanic                 Cloud show \"finger\" shaped structures rich in the element nickel                that developed weeks or even days after the explosion.  The                     Principal Investigator (PI) plans to use a new HD numerical                     calculation procedure, the Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM) to                  perform numerical simulations of the detonation and explosion of                Type II supernovae such as SN1987a.  The new technique is generally             far more efficient than old ones and will permit calculations to                be done in two and even three dimensions, thereby permitting an                 understanding of the development of small structures in these                   remnants.  Moreover, with a Co-Investigator and student, the PI                 will utilize a new theory of convection that is essential to                    understand the observed swirling of gas \"blobs\".  Many of the heavy             elements on the Earth are synthesized during the critical moments               following this explosion.   It now seems that heavy elements such               as nickel are synthesized unevenly in the small \"finger\"                        structures.  This project should provide some understanding of how              and why this uneven formation of heavy elements occurs.   The                   techniques and computer programs developed for this study are                   expected to find future application in several other astrophysical              contexts, such as Type I supernovae (accreted matter on a hot white             dwarf from a double star companion), pulsation in large amplitude               variable stars, and convection in stable stars such as the Sun.",
