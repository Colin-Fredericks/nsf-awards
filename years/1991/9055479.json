 "awd_abstract_narration": "Purdue University seeks funds for a three-year program to                       enhance middle and high school mathematics teachers in                          teaching mathematics as communication.  This will be                            accomplished through two-week workshops held in each of                         three consecutive summers as well as monthly meetings during                    the school year.  During the second summer, ten of the                          original participants will serve as teacher-leaders to help                     enhance 35 new participants.  During the third summer, 35                       teachers from the first two years will be invited back.                         There teachers will act as teacher-researchers, developing                      suitable teaching and learning methods which will be edited                     and disseminated by the Principal Investigator.  They will                      also prepare to serve as teachers-teaching-teachers,                            conducting approximately 35 half-day workshops for their                        colleagues.                                                                                                                                                     Sixty-five middle and high school teachers will receive                         first-level enhancement, and 350 additional teachers should                     receive second-level enhancement through the half-day                           workshops.  In all, 415 teachers and administrators will be                     enhanced.  Purdue University's cost-sharing will account for                    15% of the NSF budget.                                                                                                                                          Mathematics as communication is one of the National Council                     of Teachers of Mathematics Standards which needs further                        research, development and implementation.  This project                         should help accomplish these goals.",
