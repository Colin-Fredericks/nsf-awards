 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on the utility of ichnofossils               (biogenic sedimentary structures) for biostratigraphy and                       paleoenvironmental studies in the eastern Great Basin and western               Rocky Mountains.  Four aspects of Lower Cambrian trace fossils will             be studied: ichnotaxonomy (systematic classification); mode of                  production (tunnels, open furrow, etc.); ichnostratigraphy;                     paleoecologic and paleogeographic implications.  Preliminary work               has revealed a great diversity and abundance of ichnofossils in                 this area.  In addition, diverse fossil assemblages of potential                trace-makers also are present.                                                       A revision of the taxonomic classification of arthropod trace              fossils will be undertaken, and a set of taxonomic criteria that                can be applied consistently across the group will be formulated.                Consideration will include patterns of morphology, mechanics of                 construction, the type of structure (endogenic or epigenic), and                inferred trace-makers.  The stratigraphic distribution of trace                 fossils within the Lower Cambrian of Utah and adjoining areas will              be documented, and the global significance of Cambro-Ordovician                 stratigraphic models using ichnospecies of Cruziana and Rusophycus              will be assessed.                                                                    The mode of production of Cruziana and Rusophycus will be                  investigated by the examination of samples and the reproduction of              traces in sediment flume and aquarium experiments, using modern                 trace-makers (e.g., insects and crustaceans).  Characterization of              relationships between ichnofacies and lithofacies (or lithotopes)               will be made to document benthic community relationships in the                 early Paleozoic.  Trace fossils also can furnish detailed                       information about important environmental factors, such as                      substrate consistency, salinity, and sediment anoxia.  Patterns in              the distribution of these factors allow local paleogeography to be              inferred, which will allow existing regional paleogeographic models             to be defined more clearly than they are at present.//",
