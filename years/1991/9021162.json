 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed studies is to further the                           understanding of how the brain controls voluntary movements.                    Voluntary movements are controlled, in part, by the motor areas                 of the cerebral cortex. This control is accomplished by                         correlated activity of specific groups of brain cells, or                       neurons. Each group of neurons is responsible for the control of                individual muscles. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms               of motor control is contingent upon deciphering the circuits that               link these neurons into functional groups. Furthermore, knowledge               about the interactions among different functional groups is                     important. This information can be obtained by identifying the                  functional properties of single neurons, and then defining the                  specific connections that link them into neuronal groups. These                 studies require an interdisciplinary approach, combining                        electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity, labeling of               neuronal pathways, and electron-microscopical examination of                    connections between identified neurons. The importance of this                  research is that it contributes to fundamental knowledge about                  motor control.",
