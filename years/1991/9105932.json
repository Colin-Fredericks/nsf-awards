 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing resistance of pest insects to convenional                        insecticides and public concern about environmental contamination               mandate the search for effective and safe pest control methods.                 One hope for the future depends on designing new selective methods              of insect control by exploration and exploitation of those                      biochemical and physiological processes which are unique to                     insects.  In an effort toward this goal Dr. Giebultowicz is                     studying physiological processes which, when disrupted, cause                   sterility in male moths.                                                                                                                                        She has discovered and investigated the rhythms of sperm release                from the testis and rhythmic secretory activity in the reproductive             tract of the gypsy moth.  These rhythms are necessary for post-                 testicular sperm maturation and their disruption results in sterile             insect males.  Timing of sperm release is controlled by a                       biological \"clock\" located in the testis and that rhythmic sperm                release persists in testis cultured in vitro.  This finding provide             a unique opportunity to identify and study molecular correlates of              the rythms associated with sperm maturation.  Proteins involved in              the circadian rhythm of sperm release will be characterize by                   electrophoretic protein separation, generation of antisera and                  subsequent investigation of the role of specific proteins in the                rhythmic sperm release.  Separation and purification of proteins                would provide a first step toward resolving molecular basis for                 biological clock controlling rhythmic release of sperm in insects.              Partial sequencing of selected proteins and synthesis of specific               peptides might lead to the isolation and identification of genes                involved in the mechanism controlling sperm release.  In future,                she plans to clone such genes and to attempt introducing them into              insects using pest-specific baculoviruses which are harmless to                 other living organisms.  In this way sperm release could be                     disrupted and pest moths in the field would become sterile.//",
