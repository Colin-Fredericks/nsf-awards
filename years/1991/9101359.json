 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is concerned with algorithms for minimizing               smooth nonlinear functions of many variables.  The research has both            practical and theoretical components, and its ultimate goal is the              development of new general-purpose software.  The project has three             components.  (1) The incorporation of variable metric information in            algorithms for large constrained problems will be considered.  The              initial effort will concentrate on the use of limited memory methods            for bound constrained problems, but novel techniques useful for more            general constraints will also be developed.  (2) A complete                     convergence theory for nonlinear conjugate gradient methods will be             derived.  The new results will fill important gaps in our present               understanding of nonlinear gradient methods.  The new methods                   suggested by the theory will be tested on large scale problems, in              particular, in the variational assimilation of metereological data.             (3) New full-rank automatic scaling techniques for optimization                 methods will be developed.  The idea is to scale the columns of a               factorization of the Hessian approximation.  The scaling techniques             will result in dramatic improvement in the performance of quasi-                Newton methods, especially for ill-conditions problems.",
