 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particulate and emissions regulations suggest that methanol                     fueled diesels need to be investigated as an alternative to                     control technologies.  Methanol has a high autoignition                         temperature, and requires a system to improve its ignition.  A                  promising solution is to use an on-board catalytic reactor to                   generate dimethyl ether (DME) from the methanol fuel.  The DME                  is aspirated into the engine, and ignites the main methanol                     charge.  In phase I, it was shown that ignition angle can be                    adjusted by controlling the DME concentration.  Maximum                         cylinder pressures and rates of pressure rise were compatible                   with current engine designs.  Exhaust concentrations of CO and                  hydrocarbons were slightly increased, although the absolute                     levels were still low.  The mechanism by which DME ignites the                  methanol was identified, and a preliminary DME reaction                         mechanism was developed.  In Phase II the functional                            relationship between DME concentration, ignition angle,                         emissions, and engine efficiency will be determined.  A                         control system will be developed and the entire system tested                   using a steady-state approximation to the EPA transient test                    cycle with bottled DME.  The mechanism responsible for the low                  temperature ignition of DME will be determined and combustion                   modelling to support system development will be carried out.                                                                                                    The research addresses the key problem in methanol diesel                       engines; unacceptably long ignition delay.  This technology                     makes possible use of methanol to meet particulate standards,                   without requiring extensive engine modifications or expensive                   fuels.  Significant interest has been expressed by the major                    diesel manufacturers.",
