 "awd_abstract_narration": "This specialized beam line is under development at the Synchrotron              Radiation Center, University of Wisconsin.  The project includes                the construction of a new, high-efficiency undulator based beam                 line on the storage ring, Aladdin, to be used to address the                    science and technology of high-temperature superconducting                      materials.  The beam line will have higher angle and energy                     resolution capabilities than presently available in the United                  States, and will provide a complementary capability to the efforts              now under development in France, Germany, and Japan.  This beam                 line will be ideally suited for high-resolution photoelectron                   spectroscopic studies of high-temperature superconductors.  The                 source will be a specially designed undulator.  The radiation will              be dispersed by a Wadsworth monochromator, with the grating being               the only optical element in the photon path.  The monochromatic                 radiation will impinge on a two-hundred and fifty micron size spot              on the sample, which typically will be at low temperatures.  The                photoelectrons will be energy analyzed by a hemispherical capacitor             analyzer with a position-sensitive detector on a goniometer.                    Completion on this beam line is anticipated for late 1993, and will             be available to general users about one-fourth of the operating                 time for broader applications.",
