First is the development of                           asymmetric synthesis with vinyl carbenoids using                                (-)-pantolactone and related systems as inexpensive chiral                      auxilaries. Second is the synthesis of phorbol analogues using                  the tandem cyclopropanation/Cope rearrangement sequence. The                    third area is the study of novel annulation reactions based on                  preliminary observations which have shown unusual reactivity at                 the vinyl terminus of monosubstituted vinylcarbenoids                           containing an electron withdrawing group.                                                                                                                       %%%                                                                                                                                                             With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                  Division will support the research of Dr. Huw M.L. Davies of                    the Department of Chemistry at Wake Forest University. The                      research involves the use of metal stabilized vinylcarbenoids                   as reactive intermediates in organic synthesis. These                           intriguing and fascinating species will be used to development                  asymmetric synthetic methodology. Their utility will be                         demonstrated in the synthesis of several natural products or                    analogues.",
