 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds to a group of scientists who                 direct microchemical facilities that serve large numbers of                     investigators at their own and other institutions.  The funds will              be used to obtain and distribute synthetic peptides useful for                  measuring the sensitivity and accuracy of protein sequencing                    procedures at these and many similar facilities, and to increase                cooperation and contact between such facilities.  The overall aim               of the project is to increase the quality of service provided by                the facilities.                                                                      The use of microchemical techniques for the sequencing and                 synthesis of protein and DNA now occupies an important role in                  modern biology.  Because of the substantial investment in equipment             and personnel required, such work is most often performed in                    central facilities that serve a large group of investigators.                   There are now over a hundred such facilities in the U.S.  This                  award will help insure that the service provided by each is of a                uniform high quality and is consistent with the state of the art                in protein sequencing.",
