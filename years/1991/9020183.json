 "awd_abstract_narration": "By virtue of its simplicity and fast rate of evolution,                    mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is playing an increasingly important                  role in avian systematics.  Yet despite its great potential, the                application of mtDNA to avian problems depends heavily upon                     evolutionary assumptions extrapolated from mammal mtDNAs.  While                initial rates of bird mtDNA evolution appear to be fast, it is                  unknown whether they are the same as in mammals.  Further,                      evidence is accruing that the mtDNA saturation plateau in birds                 may be lower than in mammals, which implies a difference between                bird and mammal rates at some levels of divergence.  The upshot                 is that we are producing data on avian genetic divergences                      without knowing how rate patterns are influencing those                         estimates.                                                                           In this project, mtDNA and single-copy nuclear (scn) DNA                   hybridization will be employed to estimate phylogenies of the                   Hirundinidae (swallows) and Paridae (chickadees and titmice) and                divergences among selected non-passerine taxa.  DNA hybridization               is especially appropriate for such analyses because it can                      measure overall divergence among taxa for both the small mt and                 huge scn genomes, and present them in a single data form.  These                data can then be plotted, without conversion or reference to                    fossil datings, to depict relative rates and saturation levels.                 DNA-hybridization phylogenies will also be compared to one                      another and to results of extensive restriction fragment analyses               to assess the various types of phylogenetic data.",
