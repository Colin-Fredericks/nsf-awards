 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a joint research project between Clarkson University                    and the Laboratory of Materials Science in Space at the Space                   Research Institute (IKI) of the USSR Academy of Sciences to                     elucidate the transport phenomena that occur during                             directional solidification in a large centrifuge.  Clarkson                     University and the Space Research Institute (IKI) are uniquely                  configured to accomplish this goal.  Prior research on                          transport phenomena in large centrifuges has shown unexpected                   results that have not yet been fully explained.  For example,                   a critical rotation rate was found for the onset of                             temperature oscillations, with a higher critical rotation rate                  for cessation of temperature fluctuations.  Several                             directional solidification experiments exhibited a \"magic g\"                    at which impurity segregation and microstructure became what                    one would expect from a complete lack of convection in the                      melt during solidification.                                                                                                                                     Theoretical models will be developed at Clarkson University to                  predict convection and mass transfer in the melt, temperature                   distribution in the solid, solid-liquid interface shape, and                    freezing rate during solidification in the centrifuge.                          Predictions of these models will be compared with experiments                   carried out on the Soviet apparatus.  Clarkson and IKI                          scientists will work together to modify the Soviet apparatus                    to permit temperatures to be measured inside the material                       during solidification, and to determine the heat transfer                       coefficient between the material and the steel cartridge.  We                   will add either current interface demarcation or vibration                      interface demarcation to allow us to determine the interface                    shape and freezing rate versus time.  We will also cooperate                    in development and execution of flow visualization experiments                  in the centrifuge.",
