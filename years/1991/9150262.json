There will be two cycles, each                     with 60 teachers who will participate in a sequence of                          activities focused on the development of regional student                       research projects. The program includes: Spring introductory                    workshops, a 3-week summer institute during which teacher                       develop the student research-project plans using a regional                     sharing model; an academic-year program including meetings,                     a newsletter, and electronic bulletin board network, student                    fairs and congresses, and staff support; a 1-week summer                        institute to complete documentation and dissemination plans;                    and continuing academic-year support for student research                       projects and for local, regional, and national dissemination.                                                                                                   The project runs from March 1, 1992 to February 28, *@1995.                     The cost sharing is about 23*% of the amount requested from                     NSF.",
