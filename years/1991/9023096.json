 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Robert Soare of the University                    of Chicago and three other US mathematicians to collaborate on                  research in the field of mathematical logic with Professor                      Klaus Ambos-Spies of the University of Heidelberg.  Through                     reciprocal research visits, they are developing new insights                    into recursive function theory, the theory of computation, and                  computational complexity.                                                                                                                                       Research on these topics has recently become very active in the                 U.S. and abroad.  The increasing relation and application to                    theoretical computer science and computational complexity have                  made them even more timely.  The U.S. participants in this                      collaboration have become some of the U.S. leaders in the field                 of recursive function theory.  Germany, meanwhile,  has had a                   long and distinguished tradition in the field.  Klaus Ambos-                    Spies is currently the leading figure in Germany in recursive                   function theory.  He has done extensive work in applications of                 the methods of recursive function theory to computational                       complexity.  Further collaboration among these leading                          mathematicians in this increasingly important field should                      continue to be extremely productive.",
