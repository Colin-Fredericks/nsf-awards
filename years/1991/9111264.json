Moreover, it reveals how discourse genres and                      cultural practices are partially constructed through speakers'                  use of grammatical resources.                                                                                                                                        The grammar of Northern Pomo, a dying American Indian                      language of Northern California, displays several grammatical                   subsystems (e.g. fluid-S' subject case marking, logophoric                      pronouns, so-called switch reference) which interact with                       discourse in ways that are of interest to theories of grammar and               discourse.  The grammar has been extensively described, but                     descriptive and theoretical work on these and other topics has                  been limited by the availability of a very small corpus of                      extended discourse.                                                                                                                                                  Now an opportunity has arisen to collect a large corpus of                 conversational and traditional narrative data from two of the                   last fluent and intellectually active Northern Pomo speakers.                   The Principal Investigator will collect conversational data, and                working with her consultant of the last decade, will transcribe,                analyze, gloss, and translate new and existing conversational and               monologue data.  This will culminate in a volume of texts, with                 grammatical and lexical supporting material.  The PI will also                  investigate specific linguistic hypotheses about the grammar of                 Northern Pomo based on the analyzed corpus of connected                         discourse.",
