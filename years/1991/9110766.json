 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ultimate goal of this research is to develop sophisticated                  compilers for parallel machines.  Memory latency is the focus of our            research because it is the bottleneck that drives many design                   decisions in parallel architectures today.  As systems become larger,           it is increasingly difficult to have all memory close to all                    processors which can increase effective memory latency.  Current                solutions for reducing memory latency can be categorized as either              dynamic or static.  Dynamic solutions include multi-caches and shared           virtual memory.  These methods are based on the assumption that                 programs exhibit a high degree of locality and therefore, the cost of           servicing a cache miss or a page fault can be amortized over many               references that cache line or page.  Current static solutions rely on           the programmer to use memory efficiently.  Three related research               directions are proposed:  a static solution to the problem of                   reducing effective memory latency that requires much less detailed              knowledge of the machine by the programmer than present solutions,              the combination of static and dynamic techniques for reducing memory            latency, and static and dynamic methods for exploiting locality in              recursively defined dynamic data structures.//",
