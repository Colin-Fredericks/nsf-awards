 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abrasive Flow Machining is a finishing process utilized in                 several vital industrial segments, for finish-machining of                      manufactured components. This work will develop, as a first phase,              the qualitative and quantitative relationships between process                  parameters such as media viscosity, extrusion pressure, flow volume             and number of cycles. This will be accomplished through                         experimental work and stochastic modelling, since the process is                random in nature. Based on the established relationships, an off-               line optimization scheme will be developed and tested. An on-line               monitoring and computer based control system will be implemented                to improve the performance and efficiency of the process.                            In the area of Abrasive Flow Machining, the United States                  stills holds a lead both in technology and applications. This work              will assist in maintaining this lead while strengthening the                    technological base of the domestic industry. Through improvements               in process efficiency and process capability, this work will also               broaden the application base of this technique, with economic                   benefits to a  wide spectrum of manufacturing industries.",
