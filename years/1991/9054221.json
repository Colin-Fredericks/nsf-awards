 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces faculty in the physical and life sciences               teaching at two- and four-year colleges to the use of computers in              experimental work.  The emphasis is on learning how computers can               be interfaced to instruments and experimental apparatus for the                 purposes of experimental control and data acquisition.  The                     activity involves both lecture and laboratory work over a four week             period.  After an introduction to fundamentals of digital                       electronics, signal conditioning, personal computer architecture,               and programming, participants will focus on such applications as                developing a digital oscilloscope and interfacing personal                      computers to spectrometers and titration apparatus. Topics include              serial and parallel data transfer, analog sampling principles, and              integrated circuit timers. After the instructional phase of the                 course, participants will select among a number of specific                     applications for further study.  Included among these are                       interfaces to spectrometers, a flow injection analysis application              featuring computer-controlled valve manipulation, and two                       undergraduate chemistry experiments which use computers to improve              the quality of the data being collected. Time will also be                      available to investigate applications of unique interest to each                applicant.  The program is intended for faculty who wish to                     incorporate computer interfacing into their own teaching of                     experimental science.//",
