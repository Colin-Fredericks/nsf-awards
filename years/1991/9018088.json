 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three different aspects of plant peroxisome biogenesis will be               pursued: (1), the means by which the expanding membrane of                      oilseed glyoxysomes acquires its protein and lipid is an integral               part of the organelle biogenesis.  The hypothesis will be tested                that lipid bodies contribute membrane lipid to differentiating                  oilseed glyoxysomes; (2), parameters and conditions necessary                   and/or sufficient for recognition and tranlocation in vivo of                   malate synthase, isocitrate lyase and catalase into peroxisomes                 of cultured monkey kidney and selected plant cells will be                      determined; (3) studies will continue on deciphering patterns of                regulation and developmental expression of catalase isoforms                    during the changeover from glyoxysomes to leaf-type peroxisomes,                and of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase during glyoxysome                   differentiation in maturing and germinated seeds.  The                          availability of an embryo culture system is expected to provide a               unique means to help resolve regulation patterns within maturing                seeds.                                                                                                                                                          Peroxisomes occur in virtually all eukaryotic cells, conducting a               variety of essential metabolic functions depending on the cell                  type in which they reside.  They are not capable of synthesizing                their own phospholipids or proteins, and are therefore dependent                upon the selective and complicated intracellular trafficking                    mechanisms responsible for their biogenesis.  The objectives of                 this proposal are to examine the molecular and biochemical bases                of selected, interrelated aspects of peroxisome biogenesis; the                 emphasis will be on cottonseed glyoxysomes.",
