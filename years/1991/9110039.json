 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiparametric estimators are used intensively in applied work as               a way of avoiding detailed assumptions on model specifications and              as a way of avoiding difficult computational problems.  The                     contribution of this project comes from developing a general                    asymptotic theory for semiparametric estimators, investigating                  methods for nonparametric estimation of structural equation models,             and using nonparametric estimators of consumer surplus for an                   empirical analysis of gasoline demand.                                                                                                                          Knowledge of the asymptotic variance of an estimator is important               for large sample inference, efficiency, and as a guide to the                   specification of regularity conditions.   This research develops                a general formula with a relatively simple set of regularity                    conditions for the asymptotic variance of semiparametric                        estimators.  This is an important contribution because at present               asymptotic variance calculations for semiparametric estimators are              model specific and usually involve a great deal of tedious detail.              This project will make semiparametric estimators much easier to                 use.                                                                                                                                                            Nonparametric estimators have gained wide attention in the past                 few years in econometrics because they impose even fewer                        restrictions than semiparametric estimators.  But nonparametric                 models are difficult to interpret and their usefulness in applied               research has been demonstrated in a limited number of cases.  This              project applies nonparametric regression models to                              estimation of demand curves of the types most often used in applied             research.  Estimators of exact consumer surplus and deadweight loss             will be derived from the demand curve estimators.  The research                 includes an application to gasoline demand.  This represents an                 important contribution because estimators of                                    consumer surplus and deadweight loss are the most widely used                   welfare measures in applied areas of economics such as public                   finance.  The results from the empirical research will provide new              insights into the magnitude of welfare loss from carbon taxes that              are currently being considered as one of the policy tools for                   reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.",
