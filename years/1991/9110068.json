 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although air pollution and soil heavy metals are higher in                 New York than in rural sites, litter decomposition rates in oak                 forests located along an urban-rural gradient were surprisingly                 faster in urban sites.  To determine whether differences in leaf                quality contribute to faster decay rates of urban litter, Dr.                   Carriero will conduct a decomposition experiment on newly fallen                oak leaves collected along the gradient and incubated in the                    laboratory.  Since temperature, moisture, and microbial inoculum                will be standardized, the experiment will directly assay whether                the quality of living oak leaves has been changed enough in cities              to result in more rapid decay after leaf fall.  Dry weight loss of              laboratory-incubated litter will be measured at intervals over a                4-month period.  Growth and respiratory activity of fungi and                   bacteria colonizing litter will also be measured as decay                       progresses to determine responses to possible differences in leaf               quality.  An understanding of mechanisms behind the different                   litter decay rates in urban and rural forests is important since                decomposition rates regulate nutrient flows within these ecosystems             and influences nutrient availability to plants.  The facilities                 available for conducting this research are first-rate.  ***",
