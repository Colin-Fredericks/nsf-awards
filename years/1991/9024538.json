 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Leiba Rodman of the College of                    William and Mary to continue a highly productive collaboration in               mathematics with Professors A. C. M. Ran, M. A. Kaashoek, and                   I. Gohberg, of the Vrije University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.                They are working together on several interrelated research topics               in the general area of systems and control.  The common theme is a              study of invariant subspaces of matrices, rational matrix valued                functions and the interrelations between them.  More specifically,              the proposed research problems include perturbation analysis of                 invariant spaces, symmetric factorization and interpolation of                  symmetric rational matrix functions, and minimal factorizations of              real skew-symmetric rational matrix functions.                                                                                                                  The proposed work is in a highly active area of mathematics                     involving linear algebra and classical operator theory.  Results                will lead to a better understanding of invariant subspaces of                   matrices (both general and special classes) and of several                      interpolation and factorization problems for self-adjoint and                   skew-symmetric matrix functions.  These two topics are interrelated,            and comprise an important part of the ongoing research of a                     developing field of mathematics inspired by and applied to modern               electrical engineering.",
