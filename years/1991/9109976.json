The program will couple the New Jersey Institute               of Technology in the US with the Queens University of Belfast in                the UK.  The ultimate objective of this joint effort is to couple               the Environmental Science and Technology Research Center at Queens              University, (established in 1989) with the I/UCRC for Hazardous                 Waste Management at NJIT.  The joint research program is to study               the potential of lignite and lignite derived activated carbons as               solid absorbents to provide a support-matrix for treatment of waste             water streams using microbiological process to degrade organic                  toxic constituents.                                                                  Additional support is provided for an evaluation activity in               studying the industry/university interaction occurring in both                  Centers as well as the interaction between the Centers.                              The British Science and Engineering Research Council has                   reviewed and funded the Irish (UK) component of this collaborative              effort at approximately $240,000 over a three year period.                           The Program Manager recommends that the New Jersey Institute               of Technology be awarded $80,000 for first year of a three-year                 continuing award.  This project is being coordinated with the                   National Science Foundation's Division of International Programs.               Also, $8,000 is awarded for the first year of three-year continuing             award for an evaluator function.",
