 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Drosophila melanogaster accessory  gland is a male specific                 tissue whose cells synthesize and secrete a variety of products                 which are transferred to females during copulation.  These                      transferred products are involved in several processes in the                   female. These include increased egg production and oviposition,                 storage of viable sperm, and lowered receptivity to further                     mating. Dr. Kraus has obtained a cloned gene which is expressed                 only in the accessory gland. The RNA encoded by this gene is                    approximately 400bp in length, making the determination of gene                 structure and sequence a relatively simple task. The goal of the                proposed research is two fold; 1) to define the DNA sequences                   responsible for the regulation of this gene, and 2) to begin to                 identify the function of this gene's polypeptide product. Dr.                   Kraus will first sequence the gene, and then define the sequences               responsible for the sex and tissue specific expression via                      deletion mutagenesis and germline transformation. A polyclonal                  antibody against the polypeptide will be raised in rabbits. Dr.                 Kraus will then study this gene's expression during the processes               of aging and mating by a combination of Western and Northern                    analyses. Finally, he will begin to examine the role of the                     polypeptide in the reproductive process by determining whether or               not it is transferred to females.",
