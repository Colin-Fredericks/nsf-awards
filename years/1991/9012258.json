 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Hull is engaged in an investigation of two separate                   projects:  the first concerns criteria for selection of taxonomic               principles; the second concerns the processes by which science                  itself develops.  While seemingly unrelated, Professor Hull is                  using the first study as a case for exemplifying his arguments                  concerning the processes of scientific development.                                                                                                             Although the distance between alternative principles of biological              classification and anything that might be considered \"evidence\" for             them is great, empirical considerations can be brought to bear on               the decision to choose one set of principles of classification over             others.  Professor Hull argues that the taxonomic principles that               result in classifications that facilitate the discovery of natural              regularities are preferable to those that do not facilitate such                discoveries.  Dr Hull is examining the recent literature in                     evolutionary biology to see what sorts of classification aid either             phylogenetic reconstruction or the discovery of regularities in the             evolutionary process.  The results of these investigations will in              turn be used to support the contention that the use that scientists             make of each others work is central to the ongoing process of                   science.",
