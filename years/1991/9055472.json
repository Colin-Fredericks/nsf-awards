 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a three year program for high school biology                    and agriculture education teachers that includes 1) three                       summer institutes to be held at The University of                               Wisconsin - River Falls, and 2) a series of twelve 2-4 day                      regional workshops led by institute participants.                               University faculty will assist in the teaching of the                           workshops.  The summer institutes are an improved version of                    a successful institute piloted during the summer of 1990                        with Wisconsin NDEA Title II funds.                                                                                                                             The purpose of this program is to provide over 300 high                         school and agriculture education teachers with new knowledge                    and teaching skills in the area of biotechnology.  This                         program is unique in that applications of plant and animal                      biotechnology will be featured.  It is also unique in that                      opportunities for biology and agriculture education teachers                    to work together will be emphasized.  Master teachers from                      previous summer institutes will participate as institute                        staff so as to share successful classroom experiences and                       teaching strategies.                                                                                                                                            An amount equal to 11% of the NSF award will be provided as                     cost sharing.",
