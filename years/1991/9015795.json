 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between US                       and French scientists on the topic of massively parallel                        processing of computational fluid dynamics and large-scale                      coupled computational fluid and solid dynamics problems.                        The US investigators are Dr. Charbel Farhat and Dr.                             Oliver McBryan, University of Colorado at Boulder, and Dr.                      Elaine Oren and Dr. Jay Boris, Naval Research Laboratory,                       Washington, DC. The French participants are Dr. Alain                           Dervieux and Dr. Bernard Larrouturou, French National                           Institute for Computer Science and Automation (INRIA),                          Sophia-Antipolis, France.                                                                                                                                       The proposed research includes five components:  steady                         and unsteady flow computations on unstructured meshes,                          direct and large-eddy simulations on structured grids,                          multigrid methods applied to flow problems, and transient                       fully coupled fluid/structure simulations.  The application                     problems, real-gas flows at high Mach number, transonic                         combustion, transonic combustion, detonation physics,                           turbulent flows and aeroeleastic analysis of full configura-                    tion aircraft structures, are chosen because of their                           technological importance and in order to demonstrate to                         the engineering community the potential of the emerging                         massively parallel technology in solving problems that are                      presently beyond the reach of sequential supercomputers.                        The research team at Colorado will bring their extensive                        \"hands on\" experience with massively parallel finite                            element/difference computations using novel adn intrinsi-                       cally parallel numerical algorithms.  This team will also                       be responsible for the coordination of the project and the                      integration of the fluid and structure engineering                              software.  The research group at INRIA will contribute                          expertise in steady flow finite element computations with                       unstructured meshes.  The NRL team will bring their                             advances in unsteady flow parallel computations using                           unstructured grids, as well as their expertise in massively                     parallel computing.",
