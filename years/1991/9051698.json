 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new laboratory course, Discovering Physics, will be                      enhanced by the purchase of equipment for student measurements                  of wave phenomena in different contexts and for measurements                    of electrical and magnetic phenomena.  These topics have been                   chosen for their accessibility and interest to non-science                      majors and their importance in physics.  The course is taught                   using a discovery approach with a minimum of lectures and an                    emphasis on a guided approach to student discovery of                           important physical principles.  Funds will be used to purchase                  sufficient equipment for additional students and for more                       sophisticated equipment that will yield more precise                            quantitative results and reduce one layer of student                            confusion.  The course is oriented especially toward students                   planning to become elementary school teachers, uses much of                     the same equipment and philosophy that most education experts                   claim should be used in the elementary school classroom, and                    has a fifty percent enrollment of female students.  Since                       there are no available textbooks for a course of this type, a                   university-level modular Discovery Workbook will be produced                    that can be made available to students as they learn.",
