 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators study the dynamical behavior of systems of               difference and differential equations that describe interacting                 populations with and without genetic variation.  Special                        consideration will be given to the onset of chaos and of strange                attractors, e.g., a period-doubling cascade to a strange                        attractor that is forced by changing a single intraspecific                     parameter.  The proposers will attempt to reverse the onset of                  chaos by the periodic harvesting or seeding of a population.                    These studies will include numerical experiments and analytical                 arguments employing techniques such as stability theory,                        invariant set theory, bifurcation and perturbation theory.                           The development of an ecosystem, whether natural or managed,               is affected by complex interactions among environmental and                     genetic components.  The proposed research will study                           mathematical models that attempt to capture some of the essential               features of these interactions.  The objectives of the research                 include understanding:  (i) how environmental and genetic                       parameters influence species coexistence and extinction; (ii)                   the onset of chaotic fluctuations in the densities of ecosystem                 populations; and (iii) how harvesting and seeding strategies                    affect ecosystem stability.                                                          Such knowledge may help in maintaining biodiversity in                     natural ecosystems, in the management of natural resources such                 as forests and lakes, and in the development of disease-resistant               crops.",
