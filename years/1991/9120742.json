These monies, along with monies from                  the NEH, will provide for completion of the project, \"Development               of a Curriculum Data Base for Undergraduate Education,\" to be                   conducted by the Association of American Colleges (AAC). NEH will               let a sole-source contract to AAC to undertake this effort. NEH                 will also administer the contract for NSF and itself. The project               will provide transcript, demographic, and academic information,                 in the form of an accessible data base for NSF researchers, on                  about one million of the nation's undergraduates. NSF's funds are               to allow for inclusion of those data which apply to science and                 engineering (S/E) majors, as well as those students who are not                 majoring in S/E but take courses in science and engineering.",
