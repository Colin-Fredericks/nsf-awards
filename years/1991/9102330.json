 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the following principle: imposing large             loading on asymmetric systems results in highly oscillatory behavior.           The greater the asymmetry, the larger the number of oscillatory                 solutions.  This research applies this principle in one form or another         to nonlinear boundary value problems of elliptic, hyperbolic, and               parabolic type as well as with ordinary differential equations and              Hamiltonian systems.  In the periodic case, there is a considerable body        of information which suggests that some of these solutions are                  asymptotically stable and commonly occurring.  This work has led to new         insights into nonlinear periodic oscillations in suspended masses, rods         and beams, and in floating beams.                                                    This research is in the general area of applied mathematics.  The          project involves a mixture of analytic theory, functional analysis,             numerical and computational analysis, and an extension of these results         to concrete engineering problems such as the structure of bridges and           ships.",
