 "awd_abstract_narration": "New and developing science centers make up a significant                        percentage of ASTC membership.  They often have limited                         funds, facilities, exhibits, education programs and                             experience developing and operating a science center.  These                    institutions desire ready-to-use exhibits, demonstrations                       and education materials, as well as management workshops                        concerning the basic operation of a science center.  This                       project proposes the formation of a Science Carnival                            Consortia, a partnership of the Pacific Science Center and                      five to eight new and developing science centers.  Building                     on the success of the Pacific Science Center's Science                          Carnival, Consortia members:                                                                                                                                      (1)  Obtain twenty to forty Science Carnival exhibits                           (2)  Obtain six ready-to-use demonstrations                                     (3)  Obtain supplementary education materials                                   (4)  Obtain appropriate training regarding the                                       implementation and maintenance of the above items                          (5)  Participate in a week long management workshop at the                           Pacific Science Center                                                     (6)  Receive ongoing consultation with Pacific Science                               Center Staff                                                               (7)  Participate in three annual meetings of Consortia                               members                                                                                                                                                  The project also produces a Science Carnival \"cookbook\"                         which provides instructional for fabricating and maintaining                    all exhibits in Science Carnival, plus scripts and material                     lists for each demonstration, and enrichment class.  The                        project also evaluates the success of this model for serving                    other new and developing science centers.",
