He                                                    proposes to make fundamental                                                    contributions to the numerical                                                  approaches available to researchers                                             in this field and to apply his                                                  methods to widely-used neural                                                   network models.  Building in part                                               on his previous research on neural                                              networks, he proposes to apply,                                                 modify, and develop conjugate                                                   gradient and low-storage variants                                               of Newton and quasi-Newton methods                                              and to test these methods on                                                    applications and standard test                                                  problems in the neural network                                                  literature.  Preliminary numerical                                              results are very encouraging and                                                indicate that these techniques can                                              significantly reduce the numerical                                              burden of learning in large                                                     networks. He proposes to adapt the                                              most promising methods (probably                                                low-storage quasi-Newton) to solve                                              estimation problems for biological                                              networks and recurrent networks.                                                He proposes to investigate hybrid                                               strategies in which he combines his                                             approaches with techniques that                                                 generate the underlying network                                                 during the learning process and to                                              investigate the application of                                                  these techniques to recurrent and                                               biological networks.  Further, he                                               proposes to continue his previous                                               research on fault-tolerant networks                                             by investigation further                                                        applications of this model and                                                  developing effective numerical                                                  approaches for the resulting large-                                             scale non-linearly constrained                                                  optimization problems.",
