 "awd_abstract_narration": "In areas of continental rifting, the flanks of the actively                extending areas are commonly topographically elevated.  Flexural                rebound of the lithosphere in response to tectonic unloading during             extension has been proposed to be the dominant process by which                 rift flank topography is generated, although other explanations are             possible.  This project will attempt to rigorously test this                    hypothesis by using gravity data coverage of several large lake                 systems in the East Africa rift.  Gravity data on land around the               lakes is adequate to model the profiles, but data from the lakes                are sparse, yet the lakes mark the greatest depressions of the                  system.  In cooperation with the Ugandan Department of Geological               Survey and Mines and the Zairian University of Lubumbashi, gravity              surveys of Lakes Albert, George and Edward will be performed  and               resulting data used in detailed three-dimensional models of this                area.  Results are expected to determine the role of tectonic                   unloading in rift-flank topography development.",
