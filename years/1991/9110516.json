 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is a widely-held view that the United States remains preeminent              in the world in the performance of basic research, but does an                  inadequate job of commercially exploiting that research.  In                    particular, it is feared that publicly-funded research at                       universities and other nonprofit institutions is not yielding the               highest possible benefits, because of the failure of American firms             to commercialize the fruits of that research.                                                                                                                   This project has two fundamental objectives.  One is to develop a               methodology for quantifying the \"basicness\" of inventions, based                on the pattern of patent citations.  The other is to trace the                  geographic pattern of diffusion and subsequent commercialization                of inventions, particularly basic ones, again using patent citation             data.  All patents assigned to universities based on applications               from the years 1975-1980 will be identified.  In addition, samples              of U.S. corporate patents will also be identified as a control.                 The research will test whether university patents are, indeed, more             basic than corporate patents according to these measures, and                   whether patents that are generally basic as measured by their                   citation patterns are perceived to be basic by people knowledgeable             about the research. The citation data will also be used to trace                the geographic location of any subsequent commercialization of both             university and corporation patents.  This research is important                 because it will provide a better understanding of the process of                technological change and diffusion.",
