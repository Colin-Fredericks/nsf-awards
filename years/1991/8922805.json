 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his research into                 computational issues involving transonic flow and the behavior of               plasma in tokamaks. In particular, he will derive numerical                     algorithms to determine the wave drag in a flow past an airplane                and the drag induced on a wing tip.  And he will study the weak                 solutions of the magnetostatic equations that define the toroidal               equilibria of a plasma.                                                              The energy crisis of the seventies motivated airplane                      designers to seek designs that would allow airplanes to fly                     efficiently at speeds at or near the speed of sound.  This led to               a renewed interest in so-called transonic aerodynamics, which is                the mathematical theory of the flow of airplanes at speeds close                to the speed of sound.  The principal investigator is a leading                 expert on the numerical solution of the differential equations                  that arise in transonic aerodynamics, and in the present proposal               he will continue his studies on reducing the drag of an airfoil,                which in turn lowers the fuel consumption of the airplane.",
