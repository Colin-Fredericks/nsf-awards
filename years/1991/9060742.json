 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's             (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is               designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly             the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.                 Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising              proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.               Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the                   conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture             capital or other non-federal financing.                                              This is a Phase I project to investigate a new type of low                 cost, high performance optical interconnection network:  an                     intelligent bus extender crossbar network (IBECN).  It involves                 combining fiber bus extenders with an electronic crossbar packet                switch to network high-speed workstations.  The fiber extender has              been designed and studied under a Phase I SBIR grant from DOD, and              a hardware prototype is being developed in Phase II.  That project,             however, involves only two workstations at a time.  This research               would allow more than two workstations to transfer data at 200                  million bits per second over fiber lines.  This transfer rate is                approximately double that for current optical (FDDI) local area                 networks and, while less than for future gigabit networks, the cost             of the switches is expected to be significantly cheaper than for                either FDDI or gigabit equipment performing similar                             interconnection.  There are extensive commercial applications in                parallel computing, signal processing and telecommunications.",
