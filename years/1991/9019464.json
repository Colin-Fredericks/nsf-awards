 "awd_abstract_narration": "Potassium is the most abundant ion found in mammalian cells and                 many cell functions are critically dependent on its concentration.              Indeed, too much or too little potassium in the blood can cause                 changes in blood pressure and precipitate life threatening muscle               weakness and heart rhythm disturbances.  For these reasons, the                 total amount of potassium in the body and its distribution in and               out of cells is very tightly regulated.  The kidney is the major                organ involved in the long term regulation of total amount of                   potassium in the body.  In many cells, including those of the                   kidney, potassium is transported via specialized protein structures             called ion channels.  In the kidney, nothing is known about the                 structural properties and regulation of these proteins.  Using a                new and powerful research technique called the Polymerase Chain                 Reaction (PCR) Dr. Desir and collaboration have been able to                    isolate parts of six genes which encode potassium channels in the               kidney.  He now proposes to further characterize these kidney genes             using the tools of molecular biology.  He will then examine the                 mechanisms by which these proteins are regulated in the kidney.                 These studies will make fundamental contributions to our                        understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of potassium                transport in the kidney.//",
