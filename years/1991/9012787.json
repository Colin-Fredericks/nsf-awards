 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work in the preceding grant                                                 period demonstrated the utility of the                                          single-arm fiber interferometer as an                                           all optical switch.  It led to an all                                           optical switch of unprecedented low                                             switchout power with no stabilization                                           of the interferometer.  The fiber-ring                                          reflector has similarly stable                                                  performance that needs no external                                              stabilization.  The use of the ring                                             reflector with a 42% /68% coupler as                                            an optical switch was first                                                     demonstrated by the research group                                              at British Telecom.  The Principle                                              Investigator has shown that an                                                  improved version of the ring reflector                                          can be devised if the 50% / 50%                                                 beam splitter is used.  Further, a very                                         simple version of such a reflector is a                                         means for producing pulsed squeezed                                             optical vacuum in a way that separates                                          the pumping radiation from the                                                  squeezed radiation.  The P.I. proposes                                          to concentrate upon various aspects of                                          switching and squeezing of this fiber                                           ring interferometer, generically                                                equivalent to the single fiber                                                  interferometer, but easier to construct                                         and therefore preferable for                                                    experimentation.  He proposes to                                                develop further the quantum theory of                                           solitons.  Finally, he proposes to                                              investigate the two photon absorption                                           in silica fibers that may, or may not,                                          affect the switching properties of                                              optical fibers.",
