 "awd_abstract_narration": "A necessary part of language understanding by people or                         computersis to determine the meaning of ambiguous words.  Efforts               at automatic disambiguation of text have so far been evaluated by               ad hoc, manual checking of their results.  As more disambiguation               systems are developed and put to use, a rigorous method of                      evaluation becomes necessary.  This work will study text                        disambiguation by human informants, to aid in developing both a                 formal model of the process and a metric or correctness for                     automatic disambiguation.  The study will include the selection                 of representative texts and development from these of a                         disambiguation test to be administered to a large sample (over                  100) of informants, from university students to professional                    lexicographers.  Analysis of the test results will provide                      insight into the human disambiguation process that will                         contribute to the evaluation and refinement of current models of                disambiguation, both human and computation, and eventually to                   thedevelopment of new models.  The test results themselves will                 form a statistical profile of the disambiguation of English text,               as a benchmark for efforts at automatic disambiguation.",
