 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to update a program in cell and                  molecular biology at a college that serves adult learners and                   a significant number of minorities and women.  Students are                     introduced to basic experiments in molecular biology by                         incorporating modern DNA technology into an existing cell                       biology course.  A microcentrifuge, electrophoresis chambers                    and shaking water bath allow students to transform E. coli with                 p-amp and recombinant DNA, isolate DNA, perform DNA restriction                 digests and analyze their results using electrophoresis.  These                 experiments provide the student with 'hands-on experience' in                   DNA science.Instruction in cell biology is enhanced by                          familiarizing students with tools by which cells and their                      constituent components can be examined, analyzed and                            documented.  A phase contrast microscope allows students to                     examine living cells, protozoans and bacteria.  Electrophoresis                 units for protein separation are used by students and replace                   demonstration laboratories.  Darkroom equipment (enlarger and                   ektamatic processor) give students experience in                                photomicrography and a visual record of their work with                         isolated organelles, stained chromosomes and transcriptionally                  active nucleoli, and cytochemical localization of                               carbohydrates.",
