 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a need for powerful, extensible speech research tools                  with an interactive interfaces.  This effort is to produce an                   integrated set of software tools to enable speech research and is               a contribution to research infrastructure.  The tools to be                     included support speech analysis, speech production and speech                  recognition,  particularly from the acoustic point of view.  The                neural network simulation tools provide the ability to simulate                 recognition tools with biological plausibility.  The tools may                  also be used for teaching students about speech and computer                    speech recognition.  The specific goals are to (a) enhance                      existing software research current tools, (b) develop an portable               and extensible environment, (c) develop documentation for users,                and (d) provide distribution of the software.  The tools will be                available free of charge and will be distributed with documented                source code so they can be enhanced locally.  Since the toolkit                 will be portable to several platforms, it can short-circuit the                 need to reinvent the same tools, with different errors and bugs,                in each speech research laboratory.  Students would be able to                  graduate with a toolkit useful in subsequent research and                       teaching and the cost of subsequent research may be reduced.  The               communities of potential users of these tools include computer                  speech recognition researchers, speech pathologists, speech                     psychologists, linguists, and others.",
