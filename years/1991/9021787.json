 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to Morgan              State University for the renovation and repair of the Spencer and               Calloway wings of the Science Complex which house research and                  research training activities in biology, chemistry, and physics.                This building was constructed in 1953 and some renovation is                    currently underway.  This ARFMP grant of $186,325 and $575,000                  provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be used to modernize               these research and research training facilities.  This project will             address the need to improve the current research infrastructure by              reconfiguring the space, adding wall cabinets in the Student                    Research Laboratory, creating a molecular biology laboratory, and               installing wiring necessary for computer access by researchers.                                                                                                 This award contributes to the infrastructure of science and                     engineering by providing an improved environment for the conduct                of research and for the training of undergraduate and graduate                  students.  The project will have an impact on minority student                  education and the entry and retention of minority students in the               human resources pipeline.  It will enable Morgan State University               to move forward more smoothly with its plans for expansion of                   graduate science programs to include master's degrees in biology,               chemistry, and physics and the doctoral degree in applied physics.",
