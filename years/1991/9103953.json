 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators propose to develop theoretical foundations for                automatic and efficient methods to translate programs written for               ideal abstract shared-memory parallel machines to programs for more             realistic (but still abstract) parallel machines.  \"Realistic\" in this          context means that components of the machines may suffer failures or            that different components may execute at different speeds.                                                                                                      The first step in the translation is to divide the parallel program             written for the ideal abstract machine into fragments whose different           portions do not interfere with one another.  Each such program                  fragment will be transformed to a program on the more realistic                 machine, which executes the fragment fast but only \"tentatively\"; that          is, the result is correct only with high probability.  Then the                 realistic machine checks whether the tentative computation was                  correct.  If so, the fragment has completed its execution, otherwise            its effects will be undone and it will be re-executed.  Algorithmic             ideas are drawn from the literature on randomization and transaction            processing.                                                                                                                                                     The significance of the proposed work is that many algorithms have              been developed for ideal shared-memory parallel machines, since they            are easy to program and understand.  The success of the research will           contribute to the theoretical foundation of the automatic translation           of such algorithms to programs executing efficiently on more realistic          machines.",
