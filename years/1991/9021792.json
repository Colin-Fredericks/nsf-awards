 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to                     Carnegie Mellon University for the renovation and repair of the                 Mellon Institute Building which houses the research and research                training activities of the Chemistry Department.  This building                 was constructed in 1933 and last renovated in 1937.  The ARFMP                  grant of $1,600,000 and $1,600,000 provided by the grantee as cost              sharing will be used to modernize these research and research                   training facilities.  This project will address the need to improve             the current research infrastructure by upgrading all building                   services and providing adequate fume hoods so that the facilities               will meet current health and safety standards and  will be                      compatible with the use of modern research equipment and                        procedures.  The renovated facilities will increase the quantity                and quality of research conducted in a wide range of important                  areas, including polymer and materials sciences, biological                     chemistry, and nuclear and theoretical chemistry.                                                                                                               This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of quality undergraduate and graduate students.                The Chemistry Department at Carnegie Mellon University explicitly               recognizes that faculty research, graduate student research and                 education, and undergraduate research training and education form               a cohesive whole in a strong department and, conducted                          accordingly, can make a particularly significant contribution to                the future of our nation's science.",
