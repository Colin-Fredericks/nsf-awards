 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Robert Drennan, Mr. Carl Langebaek                   will collect data for his doctoral dissertation.  He will conduct               archaeological survey and excavation in the Guatavita Valley                    located in a highland plateau ca. 25 km north of Bogota,                        Columbia. When the Spanish first arrived in this region, they                   found a hierarchical society with clear differentiation between                 chiefs and commoners.  Although the archaeology of the region is                not well known, available data trace settlement back to ca. 600                 BC and indicate that before Spanish arrival, regional specialists               produced salt as well as blankets and gold ornaments.  To                       increase knowledge of this region Mr. Langebaek will direct a                   surface survey of the valley.  The location of all sites will be                mapped and surface materials collected.  Limited excavation will                also be carried out.  On this basis, it should be possible to                   construct a detailed ceramic chronology and to trace changes in                 settlement pattern over time.  Because excellent soil maps exist,               this process can be placed into a detailed ecological context.                                                                                                  Following the development of agriculture and pastoralism in many                parts of the world, one can trace changes in social organization                which lead, ultimately to the rise of states.  Early in this                    process, chiefdoms arose and anthropologists still do not                       understand the mechanisms through which this happened.  Some                    argue that population growth, permitted by a more stable                        subsistence base, provided the driving force while others point                 to factors such as the development of long distance trade.  Mr.                 Langebaek's research addresses this issue.  It will provide an                  independent data base which covers this transition.  The                        Guatavita Valley is relatively small and thus offers a manageable               unit.  It is also unusual because good ethnohistoric                            documentation (provided by the Spanish) is also available and                   thus gives a solid point from which one can work back in time.                                                                                                  This research is important because it will provide data of                      interest to many archaeologists.  It will increase our                          understanding of how complex societies arise and will assist in                 the training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
