 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports Dr. Elitzur's research on projects which share              the common theme of application of radiative transfer techniques                for line analysis in various astronomical environments.  The topics             include studies of star forming regions; the envelopes of late-type             stars; and photoionized regions, such as the accretion disks of                 cataclysmic variable stars.  The structure of and physical                      conditions in these various astronomical objects will be studieed               from their line emission in the ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and             radio spectral regions.                                                                                                                                         Dr. Elitzur applies radiative transfer techniques to four specific              topics.  (1) The polarization of line radiation provides important              information on the properties of the source where it was generated.             A solid theoretical framework is needed to interpret the                        observational data.  (2) Two of the more prominant properties of                star forming regions are strong maser emission from hydroxyl and                water vapor and powerful outflows of material.  The theoretical                 implications of both issues are addressed by Dr. Elitzur.  (3) In               the area of late-type stars a long range goal of Dr. Elitzur's                  research is the construction of a coherent picture for the outer                envelopes, where a multitude of interesting effects are observed.               (4) The study of accretion disks has steadily gained importance in              the last few years with the mounting evidence that disks are a                  common occurrence in astronomical systems of all scale sizes.",
