 "awd_abstract_narration": "By channeling the energy flux from the energy-containing                   motion below the photosphere to the solar atmosphere, magnetic                  fields play an important role in the energetics of the                          chromosphere and of the corona.  The mechanical energy which must               be supplied at the higher altitudes may have its origin in quasi-               steady magnetic fields relaxing themselves via microflares,                     and/or in waves propogating in the magnetized plasma.  Most of                  the magnetic flux emerges from the sun in high intensity flux                   tubes.  Near the surface of the sun, the flux tubes expand as                   they reach the solar atmosphere.  Previous studies have shown                   that this expansion strongly affects the equilibrium structure                  and the observed emission measure.  The propagation of                          magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves is also affected by the                         expansion.  A numerical study of these processes in                             multidimensional geometry will bring a better understanding of                  the coupling between the photosphere and solar atmosphere, such                 as e.g., estimates of wave energy output.  It is planned to use a               previously developed magnetohydrodynamic numerical code with                    curvilinear coordinates adaptable to the geometrical complexity                 of the magnetic field and to the strong density stratification.                 The focus of this study is on the effects of magnetic structures                on MHD wave excitation and transfer in the solar atmosphere.                    These multidimensional results will be compared with the previous               one-dimensional estimates as well as with the mechanical energy                 requirements given by transport models.",
