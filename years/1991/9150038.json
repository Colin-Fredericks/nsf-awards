 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marquette University seeks funding for The Project for                     the Improvement of Mathematics Education (Prime):                               Mathematics Teacher Education Faculty Enhancement, a                            three-year plan to bring mathematics education in Wisconsin                     into alignment with the NCTM Curriculum and Evaluation                          Standards and with the MAAguidelines, A Call for Change.                        To accomplish this goal, the PI, Professor proposes a                           two-phase project.  The first phase involves the                                development of preservice mathematics education courses                         appropriate for the preparation of teachers at each                             of the certification levels: elementary, middle, and                            secondary school.  The curriculum development will be a                         collaborative effort of teachers, mathematics and                               mathematics educators, including state supervisors.  The                        Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (WDPI) supports                      the projectand will be a part of all of its activities.                         WDPI will play a role in publishing and disseminating                           course syllabi in the state and will use them as a basis                        for program review in state certification requirements and                      guidelines for teacher preparation programs.  This first                        phase of the project also includes two state conferences                        for the professional enhancement of the faculty, both in                        mathematics departments and colleges of education, at                           colleges and universities in the state who teach                                mathematics education.  The second phase of the project is                      to establish a collaborative network of three centers in                        the state which will facilitate and sustain mathematics                         education reform at institutions that prepare teachers.                         Each regional center, located at a university, will serve a                     segment of the state and will coordinate and promote                            activities which involve faculty and preservice teachers as                     well as novice teachers. Project activities will also                           involve leaders in the Wisconsin Mathematics Council in                         collaboration with colleagues in other mathematics                              organizations such as the MAA.                                                                                                                                       This project has potential for making a significant                        impact in the state and for serving as a model for other                        states.  Furthermore, the project has the components to                         promote systemic changes and improvement in all aspects of                      mathematics teacher education in Wisconsin.                                                                                                                          The cost-sharing will amount to 17% of the NSF total                       cost.",
