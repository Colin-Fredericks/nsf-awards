 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Clark has received a research planning grant to explore                the use of anabolic steroids as a means to examine the                          relationship between brain and behavior.  Until recently, the                   mechanism of steroid action was thought to require genomic                      activity.  Steroids, such as testosterone, estrogen and                         corticosterone, are lipid soluble compounds that readily enter                  all cells.  Within target tissues, such as the brain, uterus and                prostate, the cells contain intracellular protein receptors that                bind the hormone.  The steroid-receptor complexes interact with                 the nuclear DNA and initiate RNA and protein synthesis.  This                   increase and/or decrease in protein synthesis mediate the                       physiological and behavioral responses to the hormone.  Recently,               membrane binding of steroid hormones has been proposed as an                    alternative mechanism to explain some biological functions that                 occur too rapidly for genomic activation.  Because the family of                anabolic steroids have a different chemical structure and                       metabolic properties, these compounds may be ideal to investigate               this alternative mechanism of steroid action.  Dr. Clark will                   carry out a series of studies to determine the ability of                       anabolic steroids to bind to intracellular and membrane                         receptors.                                                                                                                                                           Anabolic steroids were initially developed for medicinal                   purposes and were used for the treatment of hypogonadal                         dysfunction in men, initiation of delayed puberty and growth                    production.  Although these synthetic compounds were synthesized                to have maximal effects on protein synthesis and muscle growth,                 they also have androgenic or masculinizing effects.  Therefore,                 Dr. Clark will examine how these synthetic compounds modulate the               biochemical and behavioral action of naturally occurring                        androgens and estrogens.  Anabolic abuse by athletics is                        receiving international attention.  Although little is known                    about the mechanisms of action, it is clear that these drugs have               harmful side-effects, especially on muscle, liver and                           cardiovascular functions.  The results from these types of                      studies will provide needed important about how these compounds                 are working.",
