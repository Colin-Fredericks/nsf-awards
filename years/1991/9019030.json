 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to constrain the                 relative roles of eustacy and tectonics for the origins of                      Pennsylvanian cyclothems by testing how the cyclothem pattern and               timing in a basin directly influenced by uplift compares with the               pattern and timing of eustatic cyclothems.  The Desmoinesian                    interval in the Ardmore Basin in southern Oklahoma contains                     progradational sequences separated by transgressive deposits.                   Based on the abrupt introduction of detrital chert, a change in                 paleocurrent directions, and the facies patterns, we suggest that               this interval was directly influenced by tectonic activity in the               Ouachita fold and thrust belt.  Development of a relative sea level             curve for this interval based on a genetic stratigraphic sequence               approach and biostratigraphic calibration of the curve will allow               a comparison with a eustatic curve from the Midcontinent based on               fusulinids, and will refine and test this correlation based on                  studies of conodonts and other fossil groups where present.  We                 have a good stratigraphic framework for most of the interval based              on outcrop studies.  Additional sedimentologic and stratigraphic                studies of both outcrops and subsurface sections will be integrated             to develop the genetic stratigraphic sequences.",
