These                     studies are aimed at determining the details of the structural                  and dynamical correlates of the enzymatic reaction.  These                      studies will utilize a new type of SNase,  SNase, n which the                   solvent accessible and disordered  loop has been deleted.                       Preliminary studies suggest that (i) the deletion of the  loop                  does not have large structural consequences; (ii) by random                     mutation of residues 50 & 51 a series of proteins can be                        generated which have continuum of structures and activities;                    (iii) the residue at position 43 can be varied in conjunction                   with random mutation at positions 50 & 51 to investigate the                    structure-function correlates of basic catalysis; (iv) the                      comparison of the inhibitor and substrate binding of  loop                      containing and sNase could offer important information about                    the details of active site interactions and (v) the comparison                  of the flexibility of  loop containing and SNAse may offer                      information about the role of active site flexibility on the                    catalytic reaction.  the major technique to be used in these                    studies in NMR.",
