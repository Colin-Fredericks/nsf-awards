 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolutionary and systematic relationships of the Tribe                      Anthemideae (Asteraceae, sunflower family) will be examined with                molecular techniques.  Using representative species, variation in               the chloroplast genome will be assessed using :  1) comparative                 restriction site mapping, and 2) sequencing of the gene ORFk (open              reading frame k).  The data will be analyzed phylogenetically using             available software packages (including PAUP, Phylogenetic Analyses              Using Parsimony; PHYLIP, Phylogenetic Inference Package; among                  others).  This research will test hypotheses of evolutionary                    relationships, and will provide an independent assessment of                    character evolution (including morphology, breeding systems, and                chromosome numbers) in an important group of flowering plants.                                                                                                  The Anthemideae is an important tribe in the Asteraceae, being the              fifth largest tribe in terms of number of genera, and the seventh               largest in terms of number of species.  It is important                         economically with numerous species used for sources of                          insecticides, malaria medicines, cultivated plants, and herbs.  And             it is important ecologically with sagebrush a dominant species in               the Great Basin of North America.  Evolutionary relationships of                this important tribe remain obscure, with extensive diversity and               convergence being contributing factors.  Additionally, the                      sunflower family is one of the largest, most diverse, and                       successful families of flowering plants, and has long provided a                model for systematic studies at all taxonomic levels.  This                     tradition has continued with pioneering studies of molecular                    systematics using this family.  This study will provide a greater               understanding of the evolutionary and systematic relationships in               an important family and tribe of flowering plants.",
