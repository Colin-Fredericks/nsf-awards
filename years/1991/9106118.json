The project will study                the use of traditional medicine by rural poor in three                          communities in the Dominican Republic: one of Haitian, one of                   Spanish identity, and one of African-American descendants of                    nineteenth-century migrants. The project will focus on women                    healers and will use a combination of participant observation,                  in-depth interviews and survey research to study the healer's                   role in their societies and the differences in usage of these                   traditional healers as opposed to urban biomedical physicians in                these three cultural communities..                                                                                                                              This research is important because most poor areas of the world                 are underserved by trained biomedical physicians, and                           understanding the roles and activities of traditional healers                   will aid planners to develop programs of health care for                        underserved rural areas in developing countries.",
