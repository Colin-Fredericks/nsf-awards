The dynamics of C60 by itself, in a Van der Waals                   cluster, or with adsorbed metal atoms will be studied for the                   effects that substituents produce.  Collisions with different                   target molecules will also be investigated.                                     %%%                                                                             Since the discovery of the molecule C60 (buckminsterfullerene                   or fullerite), chemists have wondered about the physical and                    chemical properties of this soccer ball-shaped molecule, since,                 because of its high symmetry, it is expected to be unusually                    stable with respect to chemical reaction.  A recently disclosed                 method for making large quantities of C60 allows this unique                    species to be studied by a wide variety of techniques.  This                    current study will help to answer a large number of questions                   about the properties of fullerite in particular and will help                   form a basis for understanding fullerenes in general.",
