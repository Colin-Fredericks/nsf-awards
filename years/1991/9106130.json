 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regulated transcriptional termination and RNA processing of the                 immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene during B cell development will             be examined.  The long-term goal of this research is to understand              the general mechanisms governing these events as well as to                     determine the basis for the developmentally regulated changes that              occur during B cell maturation.  Transcriptional termination of                 normal and altered Ig u-o genes, introduced into established B and              plasmacytoma cell lines, will be analyzed using the standard                    nuclear run-on assay or a proposed PCR-based assay.  The                        contribution a functional poly (A) site and the downstream                      termination region make to termination within the u-o gene will be              analyzed by deleting the poly (A) sites, altering the poly (A) site             strength and mutating the termination region sequences.  To                     determine whether the regulated production of us and um RNA, which              is dependent on the efficiencies of two competing RNA processing                reactions, is a u gene-specific event or is instead due to global               changes in processing efficiencies, a non-Ig gene that can be                   alternatively processed by splicing and polyadenylation will be                 expressed in B and plasmacytoma cells.  The u gene will be                      expressed in non-B cells to identify the non-regulated processing               pathway and, by inference, the regulated pathway.                                                                                                               The results from this study could have significant impact in other              systems where alternatively processed pre-mRNAs are invoked as well             as increasing our insight into the switching process in                         immunoglobin maturation.***//",
