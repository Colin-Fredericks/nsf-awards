 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year project sponsored by Arizona State                              University will offer a five week workshop to 32 \"master\"                       teachers in microchemistry techniques and in the learning                       cycle method of instruction.  The learning cycle is an                          effective inquiry-oriented method which helps students                          acquire key scientific concepts and improve their general                       thinking skills.  In each of the first two years 16 learning                    cycle modules will be prepared and microscale laboratory                        techniques will be included in these modules if appropriate.                    After each summer the master teachers will conduct an                           inservice program of eight 15 hour workshops for peer                           teachers in their districts or from nearby schools.  In the                     third year these 32 learning cycle modules for chemistry                        will be revised and a teachers guide for the use of these                       modules will be prepared.  The Master teachers in the                           project will become student teacher supervisors, assuring                       that the techniques of the program  will continue to be                         implemented in the schools.                                                                                                                                     The matching funds from the University and the school                           districts constitute 27% of the NSF grant.",
