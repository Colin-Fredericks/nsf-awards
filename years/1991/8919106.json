 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three-year renewal of a U.S.-Yugoslav                     cooperative research project in elementary particle physics between             Dubravko Tadic of the University of Zagreb and Ephraim Fischbach of             Purdue University is to continue joint investigations in Quantum                Flavor Dynamics by studying its phenomenological consequences.                  Particular attention will be paid to kaon and B-meson interactions              in a standard model.  The investigators will also continue their                work on the non standard structures and forces in physics, in                   particular the search for a fifth force of nature.   The previous               collaboration was highly sucessful having resulted in an impressive             record of publications.                                                                                                                                         This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The award,                except for funds for U.S. scientist travel, is made to the Yugoslav             institution.",
