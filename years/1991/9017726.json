 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the photoregulation of carbon-                   fixation enzymes in the photosynthetic process; two key enzymes--               one in the cytoplasm, the other in the chloroplast--are subject to              post-translational modification by reversible phosphorylation(s),               and are the focus of the research planned.  Detailed biochemical                examination of in vivo phosphorylation events is one part of the                project, while a second part will be focused on an apparent light-              modulated protein turnover.  Regulation of photosynthetic events                will be understood much better when the results of these studies                are available, for they will provide enlarged insights into both                chloroplastic and cytoplasmic, reversible phosphorylation processes             in plants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This three year, renewal project is focused on analysis of the                  reversible light activation of two key enzymes involved in C-4                  photosynthesis in plants.  The results can be expected to provide               important details of this regulation as it is effected by                       reversible phosphorylation in both the cytoplasm and chloroplasts               of plants.   //",
