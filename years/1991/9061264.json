 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to select low cost, light weight               materials transmitting in the infrared and then to design optical               components, and coatings that are required for infrared                         detection.                                                                                                                                                      The investigations will be directed towards the review of                       material technologies such as Ge-based chalcogenides and plastics               to achieve the selection goal of both low cost and light weight.                The experimental program will be directed towards gaining insight               into the evaluation of transmission properties, hardness factors,               humidity and chemical attack tolerance.  The eligible material                  will be coated, to obtain transparent or semi-transparent                       components.  Tests such as adhesion, humidity, salt spray,                      scratch, will be carried out in order to determine optical and                  mechanical quality of the coated components.                                                                                                                    The results obtained during this program can substantially reduce               the cost of the detection system assemblies over currently                      available ones that use expensive materials such as AnSe, AnS,                  Ge, GaAs.  considerable cost economies can be obtained by                       combining, for example, plastic optical elements with other                     stronger material.  Plastics and chalcogenides can offer high                   performance if they are used in the areas of their capabilities.                The commercialization of these inexpensive optics will benefit                  the entire optical community.",
