 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Warren is supported by a grant for exploratory                        research from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to                    develop the methods that will take advantage of a newly                         observed phenomenon in which irradiation of samples with                        circularly polarized light causes frequency shifts in the NMR                   spectral lines of a chiral molecule.  Since each NMR nucleus,                   depending on its location relative to the chromophore, will                     experience a different sign and magnitude of frequency shift,                   this phenomenon has the potential of being able to distinguish                  among the protons located close to the chromophore in a                         congested spectrum.  It is possible to eliminate all signals                    from achiral molecules in the majority, in order to observe                     minority chiral species by taking a difference spectrum for                     left vs. right circularly polarized light.  Since many                          important molecules are optically active, this phenomenon could                 have very powerful applications. There are possibilities of                     incorporating this technique into multidimensional NMR                          spectroscopy of complex systems, with the laser on in one                       dimension.                                                                      %%%                                                                             This exploratory research project will make use of the just                     discovered effect on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)                       signals of nuclei that are located close to the chromophore                     group of a molecule possessing handedness (optically active)                    upon irradiation with circularly polarized visible light using                  a laser.  It is possible to eliminate entirely all signals in                   the NMR spectrum from all other non-optically active molecules                  in the sample.  If successful, this technique could have a                      great impact on the NMR spectroscopy of samples containing                      biological molecules.",
