 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research issues to be addressed include:  study of mesh                design methodologies; recognition of geometric features of                      workpiece and tooling; decomposition of two-dimensional domains                 into regions bounded by four curves; suitability of the                         hierarchical refinement model of design for mesh design tasks;                  research of geometric data structures for finite element systems;               and automated smoothing of evolving boundaries.                                      As the outcome of this investigation, a novel technology for               automated two-dimensional metal forming modeling should result.                 This technology will contribute to the transformation of non-linear             Lagrangian finite element analysis from a research analysis method              to an engineering design tool.  Furthermore, the availability of                automated finite element analysis could enable the integration of               process design and analysis systems.  Design could be readily                   evaluated through modeling, and modeling results fed back to the                design system for redesign.  Finally, the study and understanding               of the way in which humans perceive and understand shape has                    important implications in the automation of those design activities             that, like mechanical design, are dominated by geometric reasoning.",
