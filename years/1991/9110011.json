 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is generally believed that by the year 2000, less than a decade              away, the United States will face a serious shortfall of engineers              and scientists.  Many believe that the problem lies not only in the             demographics which project decreasing numbers of 18 to 22 year-olds             entering the nation's colleges, but also a serious problem in the               way in which engineering, mathematics and science are taught in our             schools.  National reports have been written, conferences held, and             some very successful models of educational reform and innovation                have been implemented at individual institutions.                                                                                                               The University of Maryland, College Park is sponsoring a workshop               to bring together national leaders who have been at the forefront               of these activities to develop an action model to transfer, where               appropriate, some of these innovations in mathematics and                       engineering education.  The workshop will be held at the Center of              Adult Education at the University of Maryland, College Park,                    Maryland on April 11-12, 1991.                                                                                                                                  The objectives of the workshop are:                                                                                                                                  o to bring together a small but select group of national                   leaders in mathematics and engineering education reform;                                                                                                             o to provide a forum for the exchange of the best of the                   national projects in mathematics and engineering education; and                                                                                                      o to develop an action agenda for national implementation of               the best of these projects in mathematics and engineering                       education.",
