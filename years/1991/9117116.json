 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is being made to cover round trip air fare to                   Moscow, USSR for six American Scientists for attending an                       international workshop on cloud chemistry organized by the World                Meteorological Organization (WMO).  Dr. Rumen Bojkov, Chief,                    Environment Division of WMO is convening the workshop with the                  help of Dr. Peter Summers.  The workshop is co-chaired by V.                    Mohnen and Professor Chernikov.  All expenses in Moscow will be                 paid for from funds secured by Prof. Chernikov.  The workshop                   will be held from September 30 - October 4, 1991.  As a result of               these cloud induced processes, the tropospheric oxidation                       efficiency and trace gas budgets for many sulfur nitrogen and                   carbon containing species ar significantly altered.  The workshop               will first review the current status of knowledge of cloud                      chemistry in order to assess the role clouds play i global                      chemical cycling in the atmosphere, in the study of global change               and related concerns and finally to identify future research                    needs in support of these programs.  A document will be prepared                and published detailing the results of our assessment and                       outlining future research needs.",
