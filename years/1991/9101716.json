One-time use of an enzyme, however,                                             is expensive.   This has motivated                                              a large body of research on enzyme                                              immobilization.  The goals of this                                              project are to develop a simple                                                 method to permit repeated use of an                                             enzyme along with enhanced enzyme                                               stability and, if possible,                                                     activity. A new immobilized enzyme                                              system is to be developed that will                                             convert solid or macromolecular                                                 substrates, something that many                                                 other immobilized systems are not                                               suited to do.  This will be based                                               on conjugating the enzyme (or                                                   enzyme complex) to a water-soluble                                              polymer that is sensitive to                                                    temperature, or in some cases, to                                               both temperature and pH.                                                        Temperature sensitive polymers                                                  exhibit a lower critical solution                                               temperature (LCST) when dissolved                                               in water.  Such polymers                                                        precipitate from solution when the                                              temperature is raised above the                                                 LCST.  This occurs when the polymer                                             is conjugated to a protein.  At any                                             time during or after the enzymatic                                              reaction, the polymer-enzyme                                                    complex may be reversibly                                                       precipitated from the reaction                                                  solution, facilitating product                                                  recovery and recycle of the enzyme.",
