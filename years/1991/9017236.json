 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies are proposed in two main areas:  the physics of flowing               sand and the dynamics of heat flow and convection in liquid 3He /               superfluid 4He mixtures.  Specific studies:                                       Sand:- 1.  Using X-ray and other techniques, the propagating                  waves that we have discovered in simple flow experiments.  2.                   Continue modeling these flows using cellular automata.  3.  The                 filamentary (and possibly fractal) stress chains which are known to             form in two-dimensional arrays of disks and probably occur in 3-d               grain arrays as well.                                                             Helium:- 1.  Continue an experimental and theoretical                         characterization of the convective states in superfluid mixtures.               2.  Use techniques recently developed by the P.I. to probe the                  transport coefficients and Kapitsa (boundary) resistance for very               dilute mixtures of 3He in superfluid 4He.                                         An understanding of granular dynamics would lead to iportant                  technological improvements and possibly the avoidance of                        catastrophes.  The proposed work on He will enhance our knowledge               of quantum-mechanical systems.  In addition, it is of some                      technical importance in that it may help to explain limitations on              the transport of matter, including ozone between temperate and                  polar latitudes.",
