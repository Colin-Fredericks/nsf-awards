 "awd_abstract_narration": "R.L. Cohen plans to pursue several projects involving                      algebraic topological questions arising in gauge theory.  One                   project, joint work with J.D.S. Jones, involves finding an                      explicit relationship between representations of braid groups and               families of elliptic operators coupled to SU(2) monopoles.                      Another project is to pursue joint work with Jones and G. Segal                 on Morse theory.  Given a Morse function on a compact manifold,                 they have described an explicit simplicial space decomposition of               the manifold using classifying space theory.  They plan to                      investigate the applicability and implications of these                         techniques to various infinite dimensional settings; for example,               the Chern-Simons functional and the Yang-Mills functional.                           Milgram plans to study the geometry of moduli spaces of                    holomorphic bundles, concentrating on SU(2)-instantons over S4                  regarded as equivalence classes of based holomorphic bundles on                 CP1 x CP1.  He also expects to continue his study of the geometry               and homology of sporadic groups and exceptional Lie groups.                     Finally, he hopes to work with R. Penner on the relations between               moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and representations of                        symmetric groups.                                                                    Mrowka plans to pursue three projects.  The first is to                    prove there are 4-manifolds homotopic to a K3 surface which do                  not admit any complex structures.  The second is to study the                   effect on the Donaldson polynomial of the existence of embedded                 S2's or T2's.  Finally, with K. Walker, he hopes to study gauge-                theoretic generalizations of the Casson invariant.                                   The connections between geometry and physics involved in                   this work are striking.  They work both ways.  While much of the                motivation for studying four-dimensional manifolds, Lie groups,                 and group representations may once have come from the hope of                   calculating things of interest to physicists, in recent years                   notions inspired by quantum physics have given rise repeatedly to               constructions of new topological invariants that answered                       questions the topologists could not answer before.",
