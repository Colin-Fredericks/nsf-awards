 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns the motion of an interface                          between two fluids of different densities when the                              heavier fluid initially rests on the lighter fluid                              (Rayleigh-Taylor flow).                                                         A combination of analytical and numerical techniques will be                    employed to follow the motion of a highly convoluted interface                  for late times when traditional numerical methods have difficulty               because of resolution problems.  The method relies on actually                  following the motion of singularities in the unphysical domain                  that on their approach to the physical domain correspond to                     interfacial features such as spikes.  By subtracting such                       singularities from a basis representation in the physical domain,               it is proposed to calculate a continually distorting                            Rayleigh-Taylor interface numerically.                                               Interest in the Rayleigh-Taylor instability stems                          from its disruptive presence in inertial confinement devices                    where attempt is made to confine a hot plasma through                           a magnetic field and achieve controlled nuclear fusion for                      energy needs.  Because an accelerating field and a gravitational                field are equivalent, the radial acceleration of a plasma as it                 turns around makes it susceptible to this instability.  It is                   clear that for plasma confinement to succeed, one should be able                to control this instability.  A first step is to understand the                 detailed nature of a Rayleigh-Taylor flow.  The method of attack                is novel and is an attempt to overcome the shortcomings of some                 other traditional numerical methods.",
