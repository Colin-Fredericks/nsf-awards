 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal involves estimating the memory requirements of a program           by a pre-processor at compile time.  The information obtained about             the memory requirements is used for designing better memory management          schemes in conventional uniprocessor virtual memory systems, CVM, for           efficient page distribution in a distributed virtual memory system,             DVM, and for load characterization necessary for load balancing                 operations.                                                                     The pre-processor analyzes the source code to identify the locality             constructs exhibited by the program.  Then it estimates the virtual             sizes of the localities and the position or the level of a locality             construct within a structure of nested localities.                              For CVM, the size and the level of a locality are passed to the                 operating system through memory directives.  At execution time, the             operating system allocates memory to the running process guided by              memory directives.  For DVM, the directives are used to distribute the          pages of a program over distinct sets and to distribute the sets of             pages over various nodes in the system.  A quantitative                         characterization  of the load through estimation of the memory                  requirements of a program will provide a solution to the                        synchronization problem encountered in load balancing.  As a side               effect, this will give more precise definition of balanced system.",
