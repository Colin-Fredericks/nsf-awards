The                particular objects of interest are critical exponents for these                 walks:  the intersection exponent, which measures the probability               that two independent walks intersect; the chemical exponent, which              measures the length of the shortest subpath between two points; the             resistance exponent; the loop-erasing exponent, which measures the              length of a path derived from erasing loop chronologically; and                 exponents related to the behavior of a particle diffusing on a                  random walk path.  The investigator will also study clusters formed             from random walk dynamics.                                                           The principal investigator will continue his work on the                   fractal-like structure of random walk paths in two and three                    dimensions.  This is an area of probability theory that draws                   heavily on heuristic models in physics and chemistry for                        motivation.  Results in this area will impact both the probability              community and the theoretical physics community.  One object of                 interest is the intersection exponent of a random walk, which                   measures the probability that two independent walks intersect.",
