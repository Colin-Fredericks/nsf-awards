 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to obtain a greater understanding of                the role of genes in plant embryogenesis by analyzing the dek1                  locus. Dr. Sheridan will characterize ten mutations at the dek1                 locus. All ten mutant alleles produce a recessive embryo lethal                 and a defective endosperm phenotype lacking anthocyanin and                     carotinoids. The dek1 mutant embryo is blocked at the proembryo                 state and is unable to form a shoot apical meristem but can                     enlarge and form a root apical meristem late in development. The                mutant alleles will be analyzed for uniformity of phenotype and                 level of expression by dosage analysis including deletion                       studies. Five of the alleles arose in stocks that were active for               the transposable element Mutator and two of these alleles display               mutability. Segregation analysis on one of these alleles by                     Southern blotting and hybridizing with a Mu1 probe has revealed a               cosegregating DNA band. This allele will be used for an initial                 cloning effort while continuing to search for new tagged alleles                and DNA cosegregating bands. The cloned mutant allele will be                   used to identify a normal allele clone and to isolate a cDNA                    clone. The latter will be used to examine spatial and temporal                  expression in developing embryos. X-ray induced sectors will be                 used to examine the cellular autonomy of dek1 morphogenesis                     expression, and to evaluate the role of this locus in anthocyanin               gene expression. New 1S B-A translocation will be induced that                  will aid in the genetic and structural analysis. In addition to                 studying the blockage of shoot apical meristem formation by the                 dek1 mutation, X-ray and structural approaches will be used to                  follow up promising preliminary observation of x-ray blockage of                shoot apical meristem formation of normal embryos and the                       capacity of irradiated normal embryos to regulate and produce                   multiple embryos.",
