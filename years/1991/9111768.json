 "awd_abstract_narration": "The phenomenon of enhanced acidity occurring in the excited state               of hydroxyarenes will be studied. Through strategic design and                  directed synthesis, new molecules with specifically designed                    internal proton acceptors or with greatly enhanced photoacidity                 have been prepared and will be studied. These substrates will                   allow the testing of various theories of exited state proton                    transfer, provide new methods of studies of proton transfer                     initiated reactions, and yield novel structures unattainable by                 ground state methods. These studies will involve molecular orbital              calculations, organic synthesis of target molecules, time-resolved              nanosecond fluorescence and other spectroscopic techniques, and                 structure analysis.                                                             %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Laren M. Tolbert at Georgia Tech                   University. One of the important properties of organic molecules                is their acidity, that is, how readily a proton can be transferred              to a substrate. Proton transfers are important in the catalysis of              many reactions and this is one of the reasons for the great                     interest in the acidity of organic molecules. Molecules that are                excited by irradiation with ultraviolet light may display enhanced              acidity, compared to their acidity in the absence of irradiation.               The origin of this effect is not well understood and previous                   explanations may be in error. In the present study, molecules will              be specifically designed to test various theories of proton                     transfer from molecules that are excited by ultraviolet light                   irradiation.",
