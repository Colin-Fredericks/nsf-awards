 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for a planning grant to facilitate development of               a more extended comparative research project on the process of                  adoption in the United States and Sweden.  The project will                     investigate the connections between (1) global market processes of              economic exploitation (specifically the commodification of poor and             Third World children); (2) transnational legal processes of                     juridical production and expansion (specifically the expansion of               legal ideologies and practices through the activities of legal                  practitioners involved in handling adoption); and (3) local                     practices, epistemologies, and policies surrounding adoption in the             United States and Sweden.                                                                                                                                       The planning phase of the research will involve interviews with                 attorneys, social workers, staff, and officials of adoption                     agencies and organizations in the United States and Sweden to                   explore commonalities and variation in the assumptions informing                adoption practice and to develop more formal instruments for                    subsequent, extended interviews.  In addition, this phase of the                research will involve a review of appropriate literature on                     adoption, on legal practitioners, and on the economic, cultural,                and political contexts of adoption in each country.                                                                                                             The research will contribute to our understanding of theories of                legal pluralism as the interpenetration of global (world-system)                processes with local knowledge and practices.  The approach will                set in question the polarity of \"official\" law and plural social                fields by examining the ways global processes both appropriate and              are domesticated by \"local\" and regional processes.",
