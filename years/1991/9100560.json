 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alaska, Institute of Marine Science will                      receive renewed support for shipboard technician activities                     associated with the research vessel ALPHA HELIX, a 133-foot                     ship that is owned by the NSF and operated by the University.                   A significant portion of the ship's operating schedule in                       recent years and again in 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored                   research projects.  The Shipboard Technician Program has two                    components: an at-sea component and an ashore component.                                                                                                        The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                         personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; mainten-                    ance, repair, and calibration of scientific instrumentation;                    instruction and supervision of deck operations; and providing                   logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going scientific                      parties.  On shore activities include the maintenance,                          repair, and calibration of shared use seagoing equipment and                    assisting scientific personnel in preparing for field work on                   the vessel.  Shipboard technicians funded by this award have                    broad responsibilities for providing the coordination and                       assistance needed for the successful completion of research                     projects at sea.  The level of activity and amount of support                   are closely related to the size and capability of the vessel,                   and its scientific outfit and capability.",
