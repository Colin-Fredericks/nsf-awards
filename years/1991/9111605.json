 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an ROW/Planning Grant.  In many problem areas, such as                  robotics, planning must occur in a dynamic and unpredictable                    environment.  As in any reasoning process, the act of planning                  takes time to complete - the more time that is spent in planning,               the less time that is available to enact the final solution.                    Thus when planning in a real-time environment we must consider                  the time required not only to enact the plan, but also to form                  the plan.  A real-time planning system then must be able to                     recognize the fact that its reasoning takes time, and the during                this time, changes in the world can occur (which may affect its                 reasoning).  Most of the work that has been done in formalizing                 commonsense reasoning and in planning has left this issue                       unaddressed.  The objective of this research is to understand the               role that time plays in planning and to design a formal model of                planning that incorporates time.  We propose to extend step-                    logic to address these real-time planning issues.  Step-logic is                a formal mechanism for modeling the ongoing process of reasoning.               Unlike traditional logical formalism, step-logic does not                       calculate a final set of conclusions which can be drawn from an                 initial set of facts, but rather monitors the ever-changing set                 of conclusions as time goes on.//",
