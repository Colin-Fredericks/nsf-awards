 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Mexico award will support a collaborative project                     between Professor Alfredo Huerta of Miami University at Oxford,                 Ohio and Professor Sergio Castro-Nava of the Universidad                        Autonoma de Tamaulipas, Mexico.  The investigators intend to                    study physiologically based selection criteria for development                  of drought resistant varieties or hybrids of grain sorghum.  A                  second objective is to further basic understanding of drought                   resistance mechanisms in plants.  Experiments will be conducted                 in the field at the agricultural research station in Tamaulipas                 and in greenhouses at the Department of Botany in Oxford, Ohio.                                                                                                 Water availability is the major limiting factor for crop                        productivity worldwide.  In the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico,                    grain sorghum is a major crop and the state contributes almost                  half of the total sorghum produced in Mexico.  Three quarters                   of the sorghum produced in Tamaulipas is cultivated as a                        rainfed crop, thus exposing the crop to a high probability of                   water stress during some part of its development, with resultant                very low yields.  Current advances in the development of                        locally adapted varieties and hybrids of sorghum have not                       focused on drought tolerance.  This collaboration between a                     plant pathologist (Huerta) and a breeder (Castro) will lead to                  results on the physiology and metabolism of drought tolerance                   that should help to focus on new directions and possible new                    selection criteria for these crops.",
