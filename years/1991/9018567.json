This                       method has been used to detect low numbers of genetically                       engineered microorganisms in environmental media.  A                            similar method proposed for study in this project has                           shown promise in improving the sensitivity for detection                        of retroviruses such as the HIV-I in environmental media.                                                                                                       The results of this project are expected to be useful in                        developing a method for determining the presence and                            amount of the target virus in environmental media and may                       lead to development of strategies for use in engineering                        design of collection and treatment systems for waste                            residues that are contaminated with viruses of                                  significance to public health.",
