 "awd_abstract_narration": "Real-time computer systems perform computations and I/O operations in           a time frame defined by processes in the external environment.  This            research addresses the class of real-time systems characterized by the          existence of strict timing constraints that must be satisfied if the            system is to function correctly.  The goal is to develop methods for            assessing and ensuring the temporal correctness of such real-time               systems.                                                                             There are two main thrusts to this research.  The first is the             creation and analysis of more pragmatic models of real-time systems.            The goal is to extend the theory of deterministic scheduling and                resource allocation to encompass more realistic assumptions about               program behaviors and to accommodate new forms of timing constraints            motivated by the development of technologies such as digital video and          high speed local area networks.  The second focus is on the design and          construction of operating system kernels that efficiently support the           process model and scheduling policies indicated by the analysis of the          resource allocation problems.  The goal is to provide a facility for            the predictable execution of real-time applications.",
