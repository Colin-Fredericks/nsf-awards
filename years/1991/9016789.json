 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                 the Chemistry Division, Professor George will perform                           theoretical studies of the elementary excitations of atoms and                  molecules coupled to a host matrix, which is either a solid or                  a cluster. This work is  critical in understanding the                          important experimental data gathered in this area.                                                                                                              A formal theory will be developed to describe the dynamics of                   molecular exciplexes coupled to elementary excitations of a                     solid matrix; i.e., quasiparticles such as phonons. This theory                 will incorporate electron-phonon interactions and the effects                   of spontaneous emission between phonon-shifted electronic                       states. A semiempirical approach called the                                     diatomics-in-ionic-systems (DIIS) method will be used to study                  the structure of neutral and positively charged rare gas                        clusters containing hydrogen and/or halogen species. Special                    attention will be given to the case of argon cluster. This                      study will  also involve the calculation of excited as well as                  the ground electronic states.",
