 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1989 and 1990, competitive elections were held in the Soviet                 Union for the first time in decades.  The all-Union and republican              legislatures that subsequently were convened also feature, again                for the first time, open political debate, non-unanimous voting,                and recorded public votes by the legislators. With the weakening                of the Communist Party, ethnic cleavages have begun to be apparent              in these legislatures.  Whether and how the representatives of                  various ethnic interests are able to build effective political                  coalitions or form effective political parties is of extreme                    interest not only to the future of democracy in the Soviet Union                but also to social scientific theories about legislative coalition              building more generally.                                                                                                                                        This research will analyze the formation and evolution of political             alliances in soviet legislatures.  The project will focus on the                way in which ethnic cleavages become associated both with different             patterns of political accommodation and confrontation, and with                 different patterns of party formation.  Data will be collected on               the voting decisions of legislators in the all-Union legislature                and in the legislatures of five union republics.  In addition to                providing the basis for the current study, the data will provide                valuable data for a variety of future studies interested in                     tracking the process of democratization in the Soviet Union.",
