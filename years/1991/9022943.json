 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering educators and specialists outside engineering                       education increasingly recognize that to prepare engineering                    students for the ethical issues they face as engineers, the                     undergraduate engineering program must somehow be fashioned to                  include the teaching of ethics.  Toward that end, it is necessary               to develop the materials for teaching and the background and                    skills of engineering faculty, and it is essential to enlist the                support of engineering deans who have power to affect the                       curriculum.  This project is directed primarily to the latter                   goal; the vehicle is an engineering ethics workshop prepared for                about twenty engineering deans in Texas.  The workshop will                     provide an opportunity for the deans to show their commitment and               to study the subject in enough detail to appreciate how                         teaching/learning engineering ethics is like certain traditional                components of engineering education (e.g. design courses) and how               it differs from traditional presentation of engineering technical               material.  The workshop will also focus on methods for conveying                to faculty the importance of ethics teaching and for integrating                engineering ethics in engineering degree programs.  Funds from                  NSF will be used to support the participation of outside                        consultants, some administrative costs, and a portion of the                    principal investigator's time on the project.  The Texas State                  Board of Registration for Professional Engineers is also                        contributing to funding this project.  Results of the workshop                  will be reported on in articles in periodicals aimed at two major               audiences, engineering educators and specialists outside                        engineering who work on ethics in engineering and related issues.                                                                                               This proposal is a modest request for support to enable leading                 engineering educators, with engineering ethics consultants, to                  take up the task of enlisting engineering deans in the effort of                incorporating engineering ethics in engineering curricula.  The                 principal investigator and project associates are well qualified;               institutional support is exceptional; the workshop plans are well               worked out; dissemination is likely to be broad and to reach the                appropriate audiences.  Support is highly recommended.",
