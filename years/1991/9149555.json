 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work sponsored by this Presidential Young Investigator Award               will focus primarily on questions arising in the applications of                mathematics to problems of elasticity and liquid crystals, to                   geometric problems related to the study of curvature on manifolds               with boundary.                                                                       The problems to be addressed are presented in terms of                     various partial differential equations arising either from                      physical considerations - minimization of functionals or                        variational inequalities, or are motivated by geometrical                       concepts.  The latter include the problem of finding a metric on                a manifold with prescribed Ricci tensor.  This problem is                       studied locally or globally through the analysis of systems of                  elliptic equations.  In the Hodge theory, the problem reduces to                that of solving the boundary regularity of solutions of                         degenerate elliptic systems.  For a single equation, the problem                has recently been settled.                                                           Focus of the elasticity (plasticity) studies will be on                    the Singonolli problem, seeking the best possible regularity                    of vector valued functions which solve obstacle problems.  In                   liquid crystals many physical properties such as line                           singularities, phase transition, and moving defects, may be                     explained within a comprehensive theory.  Related work will be                  done on studies of the corresponding dynamical equations.  In an                isotropic case, these problems reduce tot he analysis of heat                   flow of harmonic maps and to harmonic maps from Minkowski space                 to singular target manifolds.",
