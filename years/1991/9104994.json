In particular, he                 will use the techniques of mathematical analysis to investigate                 the existence of smooth solutions for all time and their                        asymptotic behavior for large times, the formation of                           singularities such as shock and rarefaction waves from initially                smooth data, and the existence of weak (i.e., nondifferentiable)                solutions.  The goal of the work is to understand rigorously the                nature of nonlinear elastic responses of materials that are                     subjected to dissipative forces such as viscosity and heat.                          Many materials of importance in science and technology                     exhibit an elastic response that is modulated by the presence of                dissipative forces like viscosity and heat.  The most striking                  manifestation of this modulation is the actual breakdown of the                 material in a finite time due to the formation of shock waves.                  Thus it is very important to understand the interplay between                   dissipation and the formation of shocks.  In this project the                   principal investigator will prove rigorous results concerning the               formation and propagation of shock waves in systems of equations                that model the behavior of nonlinear elastic bodies in the                      presence of viscosity and heat.",
