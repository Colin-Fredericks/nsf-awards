 "awd_abstract_narration": "A potential use for scientific databases in the biological                      sciences involves the simulation of in vivo metabolic tracer                    experiments. The queries of interest in this area are difficult                 to answer using existing technologies. The proposal suggests two                hypotheses: first, that complex biological processes can be                     modeled as logical enterprises comprising objects, processes and                constraint dimensions; second, that deductive database technology               is suitable for the computer realization of such models. To test                these hypotheses, the proposal focuses on the possible                          representations of compounds, biochemical reactions, and                        biochemical and physiological constraints, and the computational                consequences of the alternative representations.  The reactions                 come chiefly from intermediary carbohydrate metabolism, and the                 strength of the computational ideas will be evaluated by                        comparing the results with experimental data from the biological                literature. At the conclusion of the project, the strengths and                 limits of the different representational schemes should be much                 clearer.  The impact on biological sciences will be the                         development of a generic representational solution for a wide                   class of biological problems, while the computer science impact                 will lie in the successful integration of the data and process                  aspects of the problem in a declarative, symmetric treatment. In                the long run it is expected that computer systems of this type                  will be used for predictive purposes and in the a prior                         assessment of in vivo experiments.                                               //",
