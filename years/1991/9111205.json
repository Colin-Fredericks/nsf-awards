 "awd_abstract_narration": "Streptomyces scabies is a gram positive soil bacterium that is the              causative organism for scab disease on a variety of underground                 vegetables.  The scab lesion that forms at the site of infection                is composed of a proliferation of suberinized material by the                   plant.  The mechanism by which the organism elicits the formation               of the typical scab lesion on the tuber is not well understood, but             may involve the production of compounds such as thaxtomin by the                pathogen.  The goal of this proposal is to begin to study the                   regulation of expression of plant genes, in response to the                     infection process.  In order to identify these plant regulated                  genes, a cDNA library will be prepared from tissue with developing              scab lesions.  Differential hybridization of the library with cDNAs             prepared from non-scab plant tissue versus cDNAs prepared from scab             tissue will be used to identify genes expressed specifically during             lesion formation.  Future work will be focused on studying the                  regulation of the genes and on the identification of the gene                   products that are made in response to infection.",
