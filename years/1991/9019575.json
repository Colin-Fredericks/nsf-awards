 "awd_abstract_narration": "The discovery of endemic communities at deep-sea                           hydrothermal vents has promoted the question of how these species               are able to persist over evolutionary time in isolated, ephemeral               vent habitats.  One possibility is that larvae and early                        juveniles of benthic invertebrates are entrained into the buoyant               hydrothermal plumes emanating from vents, and are transported to                remote vent habitats in lateral plumes, several hundreds of                     meters above the seafloor.  Dr. Mullineaux and associates will                  examine this hypothesis by sampling larval distributions in                     hydrothermal plumes and by using hydrodynamic models to predict                 larval dispersal dynamics.                                                           Hydrothermal plumes may also transport reduced substrates                  (e.g. manganese, iron, methane), microbes, and vent-dwelling                    zooplankton up into planktonic communities several hundred meters               above the seafloor.  These scientists will investigate whether                  zooplankton assimilate chemosynthetically-derived resources, by                 characterizing their carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition,                  and by examining their guts for presence of vent-derived mineral                precipitates.  If the injection of chemosynthetically-fixed                     carbon into the water column enriches the food resources at level               of the lateral plume, then they should find evidence of elevated                zooplankton biomass and altered species composition in the plume.",
