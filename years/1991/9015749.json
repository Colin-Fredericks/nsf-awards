 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research on ways for computer vision systems                to exploit the Computer Aided Design models available for many                  manufactured objects.  The goal is to learn how to build a vision               system capable of recognizing and locating instances of curved 3D               objects modeled by parametric surface patches and their                         intersection curves in the imperfect line drawing obtained by                   edge detection from a single image.  Ongoing implementation of                  research system building blocks will be completed, including                    specialized components of a solid modeler, algorithms for                       constructing exact aspect graphs of object models, and techniques               for locating model instances from image contours.  Novel                        recognition strategies will be investigated, based on both                      object- and viewer-centered representations.  New data structures               and algorithms will be developed that efficiently implement these               strategies; these will be integrated into a working recognition                 system.  A notable aspect of this research is the systematic                    characterization of geometric constraints by polynomial                         equations, which may then be solved by application of available                 computational and mathematical tools.",
