 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to continue work on the genesis of repetitive,             associated self-organization patterns of texture and composition                of quartz in volcanic agates.  The main patterns to be studied are              (a) the systematic interlayering of bands made up of twisted (and               very fine and high-Al) chalcedony fibers with bands made up of non              twisted (and coarser and low-Al) fibers, and (b) the systematic                 association of fibrosity with banding, and of non-fibrosity with                lack of banding.  We theorize the fibrous habit and texture are                 produced by a morphological instability of the crystallization                  front.  This spatial instability causes the front autonomously to               develop regularly spaced fingers, each of which becomes a quartz                fiber.  The fibers produced by the morphological instability pierce             through decreasing Al contours produced by another instability (an              autocatalytic one, which is temporal), and grow by accretion of                 conical \"sleeves,\" their rims being forced to incorporate more Al               than their centers.  This causes the fibers to grow twisted.                         This project will unravel the dynamics of agate                            crystallization -- a complex self-organization process with                     geochemical, crystallochemical, and petrologic significance well                beyond agates.  It will clarify also the geochemical factors that               control crystal morphology and authigenic-texture type in other                 minerals and other low-temperature environments.",
