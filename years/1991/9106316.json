 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed studies focus on the expression of the immunoglobulin              (Ig) heavy chain gene in the channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus.              The specific issues addressed are:  1) Regulation of the                        differential expression of B-cell membrane receptor and secreted                forms of the IgM heavy (mu) chain.  This laboratory has found that              the pattern of alternate exon splicing involved in the production               of the mRNAs encoding the membrane and secreted forms of the mu                 chain in the channel catfish is different from that used by                     mammals, elasmobranchs and amphibia.  Expression vectors containing             relevant regions of the channel catfish mu chain gene will be                   transfected into mouse pre-B or plasma cells to investigate the                 factors influencing splice-site choice in the catfish mu chain                  transcript.  2)  Assembly of hybrid catfish/mouse Ig heavy chains               in mouse B cells.  This laboratory has observed that the assembly               and secretion of Igs in which the heavy chain consists of a mouse               VH domain fused to the channel catfish mu chain constant region                 domains is blocked.  It is proposed to identify the sites of this               blockage in the biosynthetic pathway.  Potential sites of blockade              to be investigated include defects in disulfide bond formation                  improper glycosylation, abnormal association of the heavy chain                 with the immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP), and failure to                   associate correctly with the endogenous mouse light chains.  3)                 Identification of the putative enhancer driving expression of the               channel catfish Igh locus.  Regions of the channel catfish Igh                  locus will be put into appropriate expression vectors, and B-cell               specific enhancer activity in heterologous (mouse) B lymphocytes                will be sought.                                                                                                                                                 These studies should result in greater understanding of the                     expression of the antibody mu chain gene and the function of its                encoded protein in the channel catfish.  In addition, they will                 contribute to our overall understanding of the evolution of the                 immunoglobulins and their genes in the vertebrates.",
