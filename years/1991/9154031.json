 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important source of human capital is the intellectually                      able but physically disabled student.  Since teachers                           typically are not prepared to know how to deal with this type                   of student in the science classroom and to cultivate the                        student's full potential, teachers usually discourage disabled                  students from pursuing continued study in science.  In order                    to address this problem, The American Institutes for Research                   will develop, test, and disseminate instructional modules to                    prepare science teachers to deal with specially challenged                      students in the science classroom and to understand how to                      encourage these students to reach their full potential in                       science.  Specific barriers unique to the study of science                      will be considered and strategies for overcoming these                          barriers will be discussed in the modules.  The writing team                    will include teachers with experience in teaching science to                    specially challenged students, and the modules will be                          reviewed by a distinguished panel consisting of disabled                        scientists and experts in the area of meeting the needs of                      disabled science students.  The modules will be field tested                    and disseminated through four regional sites throughout the                     country.  It is envisioned that these materials will be useful                  to both preservice and inservice teachers in enhancing their                    attitudes and effectiveness in working with specially                           challenged students in the science classroom.",
