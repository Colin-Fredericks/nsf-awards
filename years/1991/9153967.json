 "awd_abstract_narration": "Award-winning Scholastic Productions, Inc. proposes to                     produce 39 fully animated, half hour television programs,                       based on the successful children's science book series, The                     Magic School Bus.  We are seeking funding for the initial                       three seasons (13 episodes per season) which will be                            produced over a four year period.  Designed as an informal                      science education series for PBS, it is targeted primarily                      for 6-9 year-olds, with special attention given to reaching                     girls and minority children.  The series has clear science                      pedagogical goals: 1) to motivate children to further                           science study, 2) to present science facts, concepts and                        systems, and 3) to inspire positive attitudes towards                           science and education for students and teachers.  Throughout                    the production, audience research and field testing will                        ensure that the programming is effectively meeting these                        goals.  The series features a remarkable teacher, Ms.                           Frizzle, who takes her class on equally remarkable field                        trips.  While other teachers may go to a museum, Ms. Frizzle                    leads her class onto a yellow school bus that shrinks (along                    with its students) to the size of a cell to journey through                     the human body, rocket into outer space, or travel into the                     eye of a hurricane.  Thus, the series makes science tangible                    and relatable for an audience of children who are still                         concrete thinkers.  We will create a broad outreach program,                    utilizing the publishing and distribution resources of                          Scholastic Productions' parent company, Scholastic Inc.,                        (the largest publisher of children's materials in the                           English-speaking world), and other targeted organizations.                      Through viewer guides, series publicity and promotion,                          magazine editorials, community and after-school programs, we                    expect to reach a large and culturally diverse audience,                        including minorities frequently not served by PBS.",
