 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and implement the second semester of                  a newly conceived integrated science course for elementary                      education majors.  This one-year course includes topics from                    chemistry, earth science, and biology in the first semester,                    and topics from physics, astronomy and meteorology in the                       second semester.  The principal objective of the course is to                   prepare students to teach science in the elementary schools.                    Thus, the lectures rely heavily on demonstrations and the                       explanation of natural phenomena through what is termed a                       \"discrepancy approach\". A major innovative feature of this                      project is the heavy emphasis on laboratory experiences.  In                    the lab, the prospective teachers perform hands-on activities                   which they will utilize in the future in their own elementary                   classrooms.",
