 "awd_abstract_narration": "To obtain useful predictions beyond a few days requires that               both cloudiness and radiation processes be accurately represented               in a numerical weather prediction model.  Since it is not                       possible to represent all physical processes on all scales                      explicitly, it is necessary to use physically based sub-grid                    scale parameterizations.  The goal of this project is to evaluate               the current cloud generation and radiation schemes used in the                  National Meteorological Center (NMC)'s operational global model                 and to evaluate the sensitivity of forecasts to those schemes.                  Based on the analyses, the PI will suggest improvements to the                  schemes.  The results of this study should be relevant for                      climate as well as weather models.                                                   This project is part of a joint program in numerical weather               prediction sponsored by NSF and NOAA's NMC.  The principal                      investigator and his colleagues will work closely with NMC staff                during the research.",
