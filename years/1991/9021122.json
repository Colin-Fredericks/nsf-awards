 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                  will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                      Colorado at Boulder acquire an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance                  (EPR) spectrometer with variable temperature controls.  The EPR                 will be used by five faculty members to characterize free                       radical reactive intermediates in a variety of liquid and solid                 organic systems.                                                                                                                                                Electron resonance is a branch of absorption spectroscopy in                    which radiation of microwave frequency is absorbed by molecules                 possessing electrons with unpaired spins.  In electron                          paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) two different energy                  states arise when a magnetic field is applied and a transition                  between the two different electron spin energy states occurs                    upon absorption of a quantum of radiation in the microwave                      region.  When an unpaired electron comes in the vicinity of a                   nucleus with a spin, an interaction takes place which causes                    the absorption signal to be split into several components.                      From this interaction molecular structure can be inferred.  EPR                 spectroscopy is also used in studies of the rates of reactions                  and in studies involving radical intermediates produced in a                    reaction.",
