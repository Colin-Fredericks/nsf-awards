 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program for undergraduate laboratory research experience at Cornell         University is based on the fact that Cornell's School of Civil and              Environmental Engineering has a strong experimental research program            using modern lab facilities in all principal subareas of civil and              environmental engineering.  The program is designed to generate hands-          on-lab research experiments performed with faculty in the following             laboratories, based on the students' interests, backgrounds, and                talents:  Concrete and Construction Materials, Environmental                    Engineering, Geotechnical, Hydraulics, Remote Sensing, and Structural           Engineering.  The program is building on a successful REU program in            civil and environmental engineering held at Cornell the past two                summers.  Each laboratory program has a faculty member as co-principal          investigator in charge.  A carefully thought-out evaluation, feedback           and interaction mechanism has been designed to assure that the                  undergraduate lab research experience is an enticement for talented             students to think seriously about advanced studies in engineering.              Cornell's minority recruitment, and advising and counseling program             assures that the interested minority students can be identified and             recruited.",
