 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intermediate filaments (IFs) are a major structural component of                striated muscle.  To study the organization and functions of                    muscle IFs, we have constructed two types of mutant forms of the                IF protein vimentin.  C-terminal truncations of vimentin co-                    assemble with and disrupt IFs.  The expression of such                          \"disruptive\" mutants in the rat myogenic cell line L6 will be                   used to study the effects of disrupting IF organization during                  the course of muscle differentiation in vitro.  A combination of                light and election microscopy will be used to determine whether                 an intact IF system is required for myoblast fusion, the                        establishment of sarcomeric organization, the formation and                     stability of costameres (i.e. regions of interaction between Z-                 lines and the plasma membrane), or the lateral alignment of                     myofibrils into myofibers.  To complement these in vitro studies,               we will examine the effects of disruptive vimentin mutants on                   skeletal muscle organization in the developing Xenopus tadpole.                 In the context of the swimming tadpole, functions of IFs related                to mechanical integration of muscle and muscle components may                   become more obvious than in cultured cells.                                                                                                                     To identify proteins involved in muscle IF organization, we have                made mutants forms of vimentin that do not co-assemble with                     endogenous IFs.  These soluble, \"non-assemblying\" mutants retain                either the C- and/or N-terminal domains of the vimentin molecule                intact.  It is through these domains that IF proteins are thought               to intact with other molecules.  Non-asssemblying mutants are                   therefore expected to interact with, and perhaps sequester,                     specific IF-associated proteins involved in the interaction                     between IFs and the Z-disc, the plasma membrane, microtubules and               mitochondria.  We will determine whether the expression of non-                 assemblying vimentin mutants affects IF organization or cellular                differentiation in muscle and myogenic cells.  We will then                     determine whether specific cellular proteins co-isolate with the                exogenous, non-assemblying, mutant proteins.  The study of these                proteins should extend our understanding of how the changing                    organization of IFs during myogenesis is controlled.                                                                                                            The result of our studies should provide a clear definition of                  the functions of IFs in striated muscle and, through the                        identification of IF-associated proteins, a better understanding                of the molecular architecture of muscle.",
