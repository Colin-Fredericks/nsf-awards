 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent NSF-sponsored experiments indicate that when people talk                 or write about upsetting experiences in their lives, they become                physically and mentally healthier.  For example, individuals who                write about personal traumas for four consecutive days for twenty               minutes a day evidence improved immune system activity,                         reduced physician visits over a 2-4 month interval, and report                  being happier and healthier than those who are asked to write                   about superficial topics.  The purpose of the present grant is to               understand why writing or talking produces such beneficial                      effects.                                                                                                                                                        Over the three years of research, a series of experiments will                  explore which dimensions of writing promote health.  Writing                    about traumas, for example, may be beneficial because it                        organizes the events in people's minds, changes the ways that                   people think about the traumas, or perhaps fulfills basic human                 needs for self-expression.  By pinpointing the health-promoting                 dimensions of writing, researchers will better understand the                   mental processes underlying stressful events and coping.  The                   results also have important implications for studying                           psychotherapy and interpersonal relationships.",
