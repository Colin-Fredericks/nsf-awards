 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eighties were the decade in which macroeconomists returned to               growth theory and turned to development.  The new growth theory                 deals explicitly with development, seeking to account for the                   apparent non-convergence of per capita income levels between                    developing and industrialized countries.  A hallmark of much of                 the new literature is the demonstration that distortions and                    policy interventions that can be shown to affect the level of                   income in conventional models, can affect the steady state growth               rate in the new models.  The theory also emphasized the roles of                technology, international trade, human capital, economies of                    scale, and the possible need for a co-ordinated big investment                  push to break out of a low income equilibrium.  The empirical                   work associated with the new growth theory consists largely of                  cross-country regressions.  But there has been remarkably little                focus on the long-term influence of macroeconomic policies on                   growth.  The contribution of this project comes from pulling the                different strands of the theoretical and empirical literatures                  together to achieve as comprehensive an understanding of the                    development process as possible, and within that framework, to                  focus on the policy choices that are open to governments.  The                  project will also focus on the influence of macroeconomic                       policies on developing countries growth rates.                                                                                                                  More specifically, this program on growth and development:                      (1)  isolates the contributions of physical and human capital                   investments to growth in different countries, and attempting to                 explain the determinants of physical investment;                                (2)  identifies the policy choices that governments can make to                 influence the accumulation of factors and the efficiency of their               use;                                                                            (3)  identifies and explains differences in total factor                        productivity growth among countries; and                                        (4)  focuses on the technologies for the accumulation of human                  capital, and the question of the type of educational policy that                is most conducive to economic growth.",
