 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the Schrodinger operator, the effective geometry for                   spectral considerations consists of the distribution of resonant                wells and is controlled by the pseudo-Riemannian metric of Jacobi               and Agmon.  The effective geometry for the wave equation is                     determined by the shape of the obstacle and the boundary                        conditions.  The effective geometry for the hyperbolic manifold is              determined by the Poincare metric.  In each of these cases, this                research will examine how the spectral data reflects the trapping               or non-trapping property of the potential or the capacity of the                metric to trap geodesics.  A goal of this research is the                       derivation of the trace formulas which express geometric properties             of the manifold in terms of the spectral data.                                       This research addresses the general question of the interplay              of the geometric and spectral properties of non-compact manifolds.              First, how does the geometry of the manifold determine the spectral             types.  Second, how does the spectral data place constraints on the             geometry and topology of the manifold.  Three cases of application              are the quantum mechanics of ordered media with electric fields,                scattering for the wave equation, and infinite volume hyperbolic                manifolds.",
