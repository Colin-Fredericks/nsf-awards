 "awd_abstract_narration": "Infants and young children are active information processors and                they seek information that they can use in deciding how to behave               in a variety of situations, particularly those that are novel or                stressful.  One source of information to which even young                       children learn to pay attention is the behavior of other people,                particularly emotional reactions to events as they occur.  That                 is, other people's reactions are an important source of                         information about hazards and opportunities in the world.  By the               end of the first year of life infants notice and base their                     behavior partly on reactions communicated to them by other                      people.  This series of studies will investigate processes of                   social referencing and their development in infants and young                   children.  Social referencing refers to the use of another's                    interpretation of an event as basis for forming one's own                       interpretation of the meaning of that event and as a basis for                  subsequent responses to that event.  Specifically, this program                 of research will follow-up findings obtained in my previous work                which indicated that some children did not show behavior                        regulation in response to parental affective communications; and                that this effect was associated with parental contingency, an                   issue in the timing of information.  The effect of contingency is               proposed to operate via infant attention, with noncontingent                    messages occurring in nonoptimal state of attention with regard                 to linking the message with the intended referent.  Projects will               1) investigate the development of infant attention and link                     social referencing outcomes with messages received in optimal and               nonoptimal state of attention, 2) experimentally manipulate the                 occurrence of parental messages to occur in optimal and                         nonoptimal state of attention, and 3) investigate the                           contribution of infant affect prior to and during receipt of                    parental messages to social referencing outcomes.  These projects               will contribute to our understanding of processes that underlie                 social referencing and facilitate or inhibit the transmission of                social influence the transmission of social influence from one                  person to another.  Thus, they will add to our knowledge of how                 this significant form of social information is communicated to                  and used by very young children in dealing with events.",
