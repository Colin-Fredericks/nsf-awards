 "awd_abstract_narration": "A voluntary movement can be made rapidly or slowly, and it                      appears to the person making a movement that it can be made about               equally accurately at any intermediate speed.  However, if the                  mechanism responsible for timing the movement has one or more                   characteristic frequencies of oscillation, the actual speed of                  movement would be expected to depart from the intended value in                 the direction of one of these frequencies.  That is, each                       intended speed would be subject to its own degree and direction                 of bias.                                                                                                                                                        Collyer, Broadbent, and Church have recently demonstrated a                     pattern of biases across a wide range of movement speeds which                  confirms the existence of characteristic frequencies in motor                   timing and allows them to be measured.  This finding shows that                 motor timing is categorical rather than continuously adjustable,                and this is an important step toward an adequate theory of the                  timing of voluntary acts.  However, much remains to be learned                  about this categorical timing mechanism.                                                                                                                        This research is designed to examine some basic properties of                   this type of motor timing.  The basic task involves repetitive                  manual tapping at target rates set by a series of computer-                     generated sounds.  It will involve three types of experiments:                  (1) Manipulation of the relative contribution of external and                   internal bases for motor timing, with the expectation that the                  biases introduced by characteristic frequencies will be greatest                when internal (cognitive) factors predominate;  (2) Study of the                role of the characteristic frequencies in controlling fast and                  slow speeds of movement and transitions between speeds;  and (3)                Examination of correlations between characteristic frequencies                  and other behavior such as preferred rates of movement and                      perceived durations of signals.                                                                                                                                 The research will advance our understanding of normal motor                     timing processes and provide information about a potentially                    important link between time perception and time production.",
