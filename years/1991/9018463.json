 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will examine the marine climate along the Atlantic             Coast of the U.S. during three middle and late Pleistocene                      interglacial periods.  The project will have two main goals: 1)                 produce detailed records of seasonal temperature ranges for the                 Virginia and South Carolina coasts during these interglacial                    periods, and 2) potentially improve the chronology of these                     transgressive events using strontium-isotope stratigraphy.                           The seasonal paleotemperature ranges will be calculated from               the stable oxygen (  O) and carbon (  C) isotope profiles of fossil             mollusk shells.  Shell growth increments will be measured to                    identify periods of cessation of shell growth that truncate the                 isotope profiles.  The growth increment data will also be used to               assess an independent paleothermometer based on the geographic                  variation in ontogenetic growth trends.                                              The timing of the Pleistocene transgressions onto the Atlantic             Coastal Plain is the subject of an active debate over various                   interpretations of amino acid racemization and uranium-series                   dating methods.  The strontium isotope analyses included in the                 proposed project should provide an independent set of data that                 addresses the geochronology of these units.                                          All geochemical analyses will be performed on the same                     specimens that have been analyzed for amino acid racemization, so               that the climatic and geochronologic information will be directly               comparable.",
