 "awd_abstract_narration": "Andean cloud forest is the most devastated and threatened area             within Ecuador.  Consequently, studies of cloud forest plants must              be undertaken before their genetic diversity is lost to extinction              through habitat conversion.                                                          The Ericaceae family (blueberries, cranberries, rhododendrons,             and azaleas) is a prominent feature of tropical cloud forest in                 Ecuador and often dominates a major vegetation type.  Fifty percent             of the Ericaceae (92 species) growing in cloud forest in Ecuador                maybe be considered endangered.  Ericaceae also has great economic              potential in Ecuador for food, horticulture, and floriculture which             have not yet been exploited.                                                         This project, culminating in a taxonomic treatment of the                  family Ericaceae for the international project Flora of Ecuador,                will enhance the capabilities of institutions in Ecuador to conduct             research related to biological diversity and economic potential.                It will provide basic information on species richness (i.e.                     biodiversity); it will provide a picture of the distribution of                 plants thus pinpointing centers of diversity (for local                         conservation); it will provide a reference for purposes of                      comparing areas and help Ecuadoreans in locating and designing new              areas for protection and in preparing master plans for these areas;             and finally it will provide training for local scientists and                   students in survey and collecting techniques, herbarium management,             and botanical publication.",
