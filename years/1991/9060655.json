 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glass micropipettes are of fundamental importance in cell                       physiology with profound applications in neurophysiology.  The                  ability to access the cell's interior and monitor the electrical                characteristic of the cell has lead to new information about                    neuronal behavior.  Micropipette pullers that are currently                     available, utilize metal heating filaments and are limited to                   working with low melting point glasses such as borosilicate and                 aluminosilicate.  High melting point glasses, such as quartz,                   possess superior material properties for electrophysiological                   research but are rarely used because their melting points exceed                those of conventional heating elements.                                                                                                                         The Sutter Instrument Corporation, under the direction of Dr.                   Dale Fleming, will develop a laser based micropipette puller for                making pipettes from quartz glasses.  The heating source for the                micropipette puller will be a carbon dioxide laser which produces               a well-controlled light beam that can be focused precisely onto a               small area.  In addition to the laser's ability to melt quartz,                 the laser delivers heat directly to the glass and does not leave                deposits on the pipette, unlike metal filaments.  The mechanical                and electrical properties of quartz pipettes have the potential                 of expanding several areas of research in neurophysiological                    sciences, that will result in an increased ability to obtain                    information from cells.  Additionally, quartz micropipettes would               be valuable in the emerging technology of molecular exciton                     microscopy.",
