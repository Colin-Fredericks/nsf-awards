The overall                      hypothesis is that differences in fine root morphology (length,                 width, production of root hairs) and production (birth, death,                  and elongation rate) will determine the rate at which species can                                                                                               encounter and exploit soil resources that vary in space and time                                                                                                (i.e. their foraging ability).  Previous work suggests there are                                                                                                difference among annuals and perennials in response to soil                     nutrients.  this has led to the hypothesis that the replacement                 of annuals by perennials in successional fields may be partially                                                                                                due to the increased patchiness in soil resources over time and                 difference in the abilities of annuals and perennials to find and                                                                                               exploit these patches.  Of particular interest is the timing of                 responses to nutrient patches which will be determined by                       measuring the demographic response of species.                                       Several specific hypothesis will be tested in greenhouse and                                                                                               field experiments.  By varying the distributions of nitrogen, and                                                                                               using 15 N as a tracer, the relationship between fine root                      morphology and dynamics and resource acquisition will be                        measured.  Fine root dynamics (branching, growth, birth and                     mortality) will be measured in situ with video technology.  This                                                                                                technology allows the response of individual roots to nutrient                  patches to be followed and related to species differences in                    below-ground morphology, growth, and ability to acquire soil                    resources.  The results of these studies will contribute to the                 development of a more mechanistic understanding of soil resource                                                                                                acquisition by plants and to a better understanding of how                      competition for resources affects species distributions in                      terrestrial plant communities.",
