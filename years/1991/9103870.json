 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microzooplankton (protozoans and micrometazoans) are                       abundant in the sea and play significant roles in pelagic food                  webs.  Estimating microzooplankton biomass, however, is a tedious               and relatively specialized process.  Techniques are needed to                   augment traditional approaches.                                                      It is known that algal pigment content is roughly                          proportional to biomass.  The hypothesis of the present study is                that carotenoid pigment content in microzooplankton is also                     correlated with biomass.  The objectives of this research are to                test this hypothesis and to identify environmental forcing                      functions responsible for variability in the relationship.                      Findings, to date, support the hypothesis, but elaboration is                   necessary.  Experiments will be undertaken to identify the                      influence of food availability, light intensity and spectral                    characteristics, and population growth on the pigment:biomass                   relationship.  In addition, the analytical method, which involves               HPLC, will be modified to increase carotenoid resolution.  The                  improved method will provide data at higher rates than presently                possible, and may allow discrimination between micrometazoan and                protozoan biomass.",
