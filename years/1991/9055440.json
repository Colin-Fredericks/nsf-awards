 "awd_abstract_narration": "The LASE project is centered on an innovative \"do-it-                           yourself\" optics laboratory course based on the principles of                   manipulating and modulating laser beams, and designed to make                   physics more attractive to high school students by                              introducing them to every-day laser applications.                                                                                                               To facilitate implementation of these ideas, 2 two-week                         Summer workshops will be provided during 1991 to train forty                    high school physics teachers to teach the course, with in-                      service help, the following academic year.  The project                         concentrates on three strong pedagogical ideas developed                        during the first phase of the project:                                               1.  providing each participant with an optical system                               designed to be easily reproduced or modified in any                             modestly equipped workshop, and incorporating many                              \"off-the-shelf\" hardware-store items (A prototype                               has already been competed),                                                 2.  providing a series of station-by-station                                        instructions beforehand for the participants as they                            all work on the same activity at the same time.                                 This is the advantage of having a common optical                                system,                                                                     3.  involving all participants as peer teachers during                              the 1991-92 academic year in-service phase of the                               program.  Groups of five teachers will take charge                              of each of the monthly meetings scheduled for that                              period.  Students will help them.                                                                                                                      Ten teachers from Phase 1 will provide instruction during the                   Summer workshops, along with faculty from San Jose State                        University.  Assistance will be provided by a full-time                         technician and SJSU physics majors.                                                                                                                             The forty participants will bring along at least one guest                      teacher to at least one in-service meeting during the year.                     This will be formally required.  By year's end close to                         seventy teachers will have been actively involved.                                                                                                              Cost sharing equals 48% of the NSF award.",
