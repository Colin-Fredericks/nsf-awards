 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discrete pattern matching includes a large class of problems of                 pattern matching over discrete domains.  These problems are driven by           several applications, mostly in the areas of molecular biology and              information retrieval.  There are several features that are common to           most of these problems.  The input is usually a sequence, a set of              sequences, a set of integer-weighted sequences, or even a graph of              sequences, over a finite alphabet.  The goal of the problem is to               identify common patterns (i.e., a subsequence or a set of                       subsequences) that satisfy several constraints and/or optimize several          objectives.  The problems differ not only by the constraints and                objectives, but also by the type of input.  This project mainly                 concerns algorithmic questions in discrete pattern matching.  The               investigators will identify important problems, develop new algorithms          for a variety of problems, find common algorithmic techniques, and              study relationships among different problems.  The emphasis will be on          four kinds of problems which are identified by their domains:                   sequence comparisons, which involve problems of finding large common            subsequences of two (or more) sequences; pattern-sequence comparisons,          which involve finding more complicated patterns, such as regular                expressions of sequences, in given sequences; pattern matching in               hypertext systems, which generalizes the previous problems to \"hyper-           sequences\" or, in other words, pieces of sequences connected by links;          and hierarchical pattern matching, which involves finding patterns              over domains that are by themselves patterns obtained from other                matches.",
