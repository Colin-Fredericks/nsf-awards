 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research is to develop and                      demonstrate an intelligent machining monitoring and diagnostic                  system for quality assurance in end-milling.  This will be based                on the integration of multiple sensors outputs, such as acoustic                emission, vibration, cutting force, and cutting temperature, with               cutting conditions via artificial neural networks in conjunction                with an expert system.  Product quality characteristics such as                 surface finish and tolerance will be estimated and, therefore,                  eventually maintained by the system during end-milling. The                     research team will conduct machining experiments to acquire data                and determine the best sensor feature that correlates to product                quality, develop multi-sensor integrated neural networks for                    estimating product quality, develop trend classification neural                 network for identifying trends and train and evaluate the                       performance of these networks.                                                       Product quality in manufacturing is of paramount importance                especially in view of the tremendous competition that we face in                the globalized marketplace.  Pioneering work of this nature, where              the latest developments in artificial intelligence are applied to               basic problems in manufacturing and in close cooperation with a                 United States machine tool manufacturer, will help domestic                     manufacturing compete successfully.",
