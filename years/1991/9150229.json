 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Task Force on the general chemistry curriculum appointed by                 the Division of Chemical Education of the American Chemical                     Society is considering three approaches to the reform of                        general chemistry instruction:  1.  Laboratory-based revisions                  in which new topics in chemistry would first be introduced in                   the laboratory.  2.  A subject area approach that selects the                   content and method of general chemistry on the basis of the                     chemistry one needs to know to grasp socially significant                       substances and processes.  3.  A modular approach that teaches                  an irreducible core and supplements that with coherent material                 that is customized for the student audience.                                    The Task Force will make recommendations on alternative general                 chemistry curricula, produce and publicize new materials                        through public presentations and publications, provide tested                   instructional materials, and conduct workshops on how to                        implement new curricula.  The aims of this proposed project are                 to carry on two symposia at national scientific meetings and to                 hold a summer 1991 workshop involving the whole Task Force that                 will produce a report of accomplishments of the first two                       years.",
