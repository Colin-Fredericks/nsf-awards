 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support of research to study the portion                      of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet which feeds in to the Ross                      Ice Shelf.  Satellite image analysis, ground surveying, and                     radar soundings by both airborne and ground-based systems                       comprise the necessary elements of this research.  These                        activities are an essential part of the Siple Coast Project                     and the new SeaRISE initiative which have as goals: 1)                          Determination of the configuration and mass balance of the                      Siple Coast region of the West Antarctic ice sheet, 2)                          Determination of the physical controls of ice flow in this                      region, and 3) Prediction of the future behavior of this                        region using numerical models.  These models will be                            enhanced by: 1) Completion of the surveys in the catchment                      areas of all the ice streams, 2) Determination of surface                       velocities in ice streams D and E,  3) Measurements of the                      discharge flux of ice streams D and E,  4) Examination of                       ice stream flow in the area of a surface undulation using                       satellite imagery, 5) Quantify the relative motion between                      the surface and bed in the grounded region just upstream of                     the grounding line.",
