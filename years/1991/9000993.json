 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are a number of major issues relative to mid-ocean ridge                  magmatism; such as the along-axis compositional variations, the                 effects of variable magma chamber recharge rates, the distribution              of feeders, convective partitioning of a contiguous chamber,                    tectonic segmentation, trends in fractionation, mixing, and                     contamination.  This study will address the role of variable                    recharge and/or spatially varying boundary conditions in generating             chemical partitioning of a magma chamber.  The objective is to                  determine the time and length scales associated with crystal and                convective fractionation where the crystallization is fully coupled             to the heat transfer regimes in the wallrock and to the phase                   diagram for real compositions.  This involves the coupling of the               transport equations directly to the phase relations of the system               through the code SILMIN.  An additional objective is to initiate                laboratory experiments of convective regimes with appropriately                 varying boundary conditions.  Questions to be addressed include:                (1) How will convection be influenced by recharge?  (2) How is                  crystallization and fractionation influenced by convection?  (3) To             what degree does convection partition the chamber into domains that             have difference chemical evolutions?  (4) What is the effect of                 hydrothermal convection on the chamber?",
