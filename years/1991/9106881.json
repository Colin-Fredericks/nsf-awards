 "awd_abstract_narration": "A debate of general interest to all food web theory has                    arisen over whether attack rates of predators should depend on                  instantaneous prey densities, or instead on ratios of prey                      numbers to the numbers of predators sharing them.  Models with                  attack rates scaled to absolute prey densities predict that                     trophic levels will be added stepwise with increasing                           productivity, and that until links are added to food chains,                    biomass of consumers and resources should be uncorrelated.                      Ratio-dependent models predict continuous monotonic increases of                biomass at all trophic levels with increasing productivity, so                  that abundance of consumers and resources should covary                         positively.  These assumptions and predictions can be tested with               fairly simple field observations.  The P.I. proposes to test                    assumptions and predictions of both models in rivers using a                    mixture of experimental and multi-river comparisons.  The                       investigator will study effects of productivity on food web                     structure in a seasonal river where, following winter floods,                   community development occurs during the predictable summer low-                 flow season and manipulate primary productivity by shading                      instream channels, and by fertilizing nutrient-diffusing                        substance (clay pots).  In these experimental arenas, the P.I.                  will observe the post-flood assembly of food webs under various                 productivity regimes, recording the accrual of individuals and                  biomass in producer, primary consumer, and predator guilds; the                 taxonomic composition and diversity of these guilds, and the size               structures of their component populations.  The P.I. will conduct               other, short-term behavioral experiments to measure attack rates                of common predators feeding on dominant prey under different prey               and predator densities, and in the presence and absence of plant                cover.  To test the generality of results from experiments at the               primary study site, the investigator will survey several rivers                 that represent a gradient of environmental productivity, and                    examine trophic structures of food webs that assemble during the                summer low-flow season, following winter floods.",
