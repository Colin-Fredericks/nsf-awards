 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Wendell L. Roelofs of Cornell University and Dr. Stephen                        Foster of the New Zealand Department of Scientific and                          Industrial Research (DSIRO).  Over the last two decades,                        researchers have built a knowledge-base of the biosynthetic                     enzyme pathways through which production of pheromone                           located in glands and other organs, is activated by the                         brain-hormone, biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN).                     Critical unanswered questions,however, have pervaded  these                     studies: How did these hormonal systems and their unique                        biosynthetic enzymes and brain-hormonal control of pheromone                    production, which are species-specific, evolve?  This                           cooperative project will focus on this research question,                       that is, the evolution of how PBAN effects pheromone production                 in several moth species.                                                                                                                                        The project represents excellent collaboration between New                      Zealand and U.S. researchers.  The New Zealand group has                        extensive experience and knowledge of the only moth species                     known in the world to exhibit the pattern of primitive to                       more advanced pheromone biosynthetic pathways within the same                   genus.  The U.S. group will apply the series of techniques,                     which they developed, for studying the action of PBAN, and                      provide synthetic PBAN for the study.  The research is                          important fundamental work in advancing basic understanding                     of evolution of the brain-hormone, PBAN.  Also, since                           hormones cause chemically-based radical changes in behavior,                    the study has the potential for results relevant to regulating                  insect behavior in areas such as cardiac activity and blood                     sugar.",
