 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program supports research by Dr. John A. Morrison of the                        Chemistry Department, University of Illinois at Chicago,                        concerning polyhedral boron halide clusters.  Divalent anions                   with equivalent numbers (n) of boron and halide atoms                           (including n = 7, 8, 10, 11, 12) will be synthesized and their                  reactivities and structures characterized using PES, XPS, NMR,                  and X-ray crystallography.  Diboron tetrahalides and tetraboron                 tetrahalides and B(14)Cl(18) will also be studied.                              Substituents will not be limited to halides, but also will                      include alkyl, alkoxide, and amide groups.  The goal of the                     research is to investigate the bonding modes of these electron                  deficient compounds which are expected to exhibit structures                    not previously observed in boron clusters.  Molecular orbital                   calculations will facilitate the interpretation of spectra and                  bonding.                                                                        %%%                                                                             Large regular polyhedral clusters containing up to 12 boron                     atoms are well known.  Each boron is typically bound also to a                  hydrogen or halide atom.  The number of \"framework\" electrons                   required to hold the cluster together is usually 2n+2, where n                  is the number of boron atoms in the cluster.  Morrison will                     synthesize novel species which contain only 2n electrons and                    observe the effects on the shape and reactivity of the cluster                  and its bonding characteristics.  Although the research is                      fundamental, it may be applicable to clusters of other                          elements, particularly those containing metals which are found                  in many catalytic and electronic materials.",
