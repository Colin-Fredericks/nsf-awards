 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most natural populations of plants and animals display great               genetic variability, even though many factors reduce genetic                    diversity within a species.  Plant and animal breeders, as well                 as conservation biologists, often attempt to maintain genetic                   diversity within desirable lines, since such diversity is                       thought to reduce the possibility of extinction due to inbreeding               depression, disease, parasites, and new environmental challenges.               Understanding how genetic diversity is engendered and maintained                in natural populations is therefore a major goal of conservation                biologists.                                                                          This project will focus on the ways in which spatial                       heterogeneity can bring about genetic diversification within a                  single plant population  Microgeographic variation due to slope                 aspect, snow melt, water evaporation, or elevation can force                    plants within a single site to flower at different times and can                lead to different selective pressures on early and late flowering               individuals.  Population genetics theory suggest that these                     conditions will lead to the maintenance of high genetic                         diversity.                                                                           In this study system, variation in snow melt schedule                      imposes variable growth and flowering schedules on the alpine                   plant community.   How the temporal and spatial components of                   this heterogeneity maintain genetic variation within an alpine                  population of Ranunculus will be determined.   This research will               produce insight into factors that preserve genetic diversity in                 economically useful plant and animal breeds, as well as in                      threatened populations.",
