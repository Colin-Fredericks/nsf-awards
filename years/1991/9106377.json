 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research program deals with fundamental questions                  regarding unfolding transitions in proteins and the interaction                 of specific ligands with proteins.  The work will focus on two                  proteins, nuclease A and trp aporepressor, and certain site-                    directed mutants of these proteins.  Dr. Eftink will study the                  cold (as well as high temperature) unfolding and pressure                       unfolding of relatively unstable mutants of nuclease.  The goal                 is to evaluate and correlate various thermodynamic parameters                   for the unfolding of several mutants of nuclease in order to                    better understand the forces responsible for stabilizing                        proteins.  The \"structure\" and dynamic characteristics of the                   various unfolding states (i.e., produced by low and high                        temperature, pressure, urea, low pH) will be studied by a                       combination of several techniques, including i) time-resolved                   fluorescence anisotropy to measure local motion (of the single                  trp residue), ii) resonance energy transfer between sites to                    obtain intramolecular distance information, iii) size exclusion                 chromatography to measure the overall hydrodynamic radius of                    the molecule, and iv) CD to observe any differences ins                         secondary structure.  In addition to comparing the various                      unfolded states, the effect of the destabilizing mutations on the               folded state of the proteins will be studied by some of the                     above methods and by v) room temperature phosphorescence to                     compare the rigidity of the environment of the trp residue, and                 vi) titration microcalorimetry to measure thermodynamic                         parameters for the binding of specific ligands to the protein.",
