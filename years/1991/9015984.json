 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will support collaborative research between Dr. B.                    Lakshminarayana, Department of Aerospace Engineering,                           Pennsylvania State University, and Professor Francis Leboeuf,                   Fluid Mechanics and Acoustics Laboratory, Ecole Centrale de                     Lyon, France.  The objective of this project is to develop                      and validate models for turbulence.                                                                                                                             The flow phenomena in turbines is extremely complex.  It is                     three dimensional, turbulent and unsteady, with substantial                     influence of rotation, curvature and heat transfer effects.                     Attempts to predict this flow have not been successful due to                   inadequate turbulence models.  The inability of the Navier-                     Stokes codes to capture the physical phenomena in turbines                      and pumps has hampered improvements in design and analytical                    procedures for the development of high performance turbo-                       machinery.  The aim of this cooperative research effort is to                   develop turbulence models that incorporate the effects of                       rotation, curvature, compressibility, three dimensionality                      and heat transfer.  The turbulence transport equation (based                    on density averaging) and velocity-density covariance transport                 equations will be modelled to derive algebraic stress                           transport and Algebraic heat flux equations respectively.                       These equations, coupled with the turbulent kinetic energy                      and the dissipation equations, and mean momentum equations,                     should provide accurate prediction of flow and heat transfer                    field in turbines and pumps.  A validation experiment is also                   proposed to check the accuracy of modelling, including                          evaluation of various terms contributing to the turbulent                       stress and energy, and turbulent heat flux transport equations.                 This research will benefit from the extensive and complementary                 expertise of the US and French investigators in turbulence                      modeling of turbomachinery.",
