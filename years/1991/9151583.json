 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests the computing equipment and software                     necessary to convert a classroom at Towson State University                     into a Social Sciences Laboratory.  The lab will consist of                     twenty 80386/SX work-stations, two printers, projection                         equipment, a local area network, and system and application                     software.The laboratory will permit hands-on learning by                        students in statistical and simulation techniques used in                       social science research.  Currently there is no such facility                   on campus.  In political science, the laboratory will support                   research methods courses in statistics, system dynamics, and                    game theory as well as applied courses in international                         relations (using the ICONS simulation) and public policy.  In                   sociology and anthropology, the laboratory will support                         research methods courses required by sociology majors and                       provide vital tools for students in demography and                              anthropology.The proposed software provides both the user-                      friendly interface necessary for new computer users and the                     computing power needed for more advanced courses. The lab will                  be supported by faculty with experience in teaching computer                    applications and research methods and by the commitment of the                  University to encourage and expand student exposure to research                 in the social sciences.",
