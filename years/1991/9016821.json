 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a continuing cooperative                        research project on solid-state dynamics, between Professor                     David N Hendrickson, Department of Chemistry, University of                     California, San Diego, and Professor Michio Sorai, Chemical                     Thermodynamics Laboratory, Osaka University, Japan.    The                      onset of dynamics associated with ligands, counterions and                      even solvate molecules in crystals can dramatically affect                      several phenomena involving transition metal complexes in                       solid state.  Intramolecular electron transfer in mixed-                        valence complexes, spin-state interconversion in spin-                          crossover-complexes, and thermochroism in copper and nickel                     complexes are current phenomena being studied.  In all these                    phenomena, intermolecular interactions in the solid state are                   important in controlling the events.  A study of the onset of                   the dynamics involved in these phase transitions will help                      considerably to elucidate the factors controlling these                         phenomena.  Heat capacity measurements and a variety of                         spectroscopic techniques are being employed to delineate the                    macroscopic and microscopic details involved in the above                       phenomena.  Thermodynamic studies serve as a powerful tool to                   elucidate energetic and entropic aspects of a phenomenon,                       from which one can gain better evidence as to whether a phase                   transition exists or not.  Moreover based on the transition                     entropy, it is possible to discover the microscopic processes                   involved in a phase transition that spectroscopic and                           structural studies fail to detect.  On the other hand,                          spectroscopies and X-ray diffraction provide us with very                       detailed microscopic information at the atomic or electronic                    level. The aim of this proposal is to bring together these                      techniques in order to study the mechanisms of those phase                      transitions in which electrons play, either directly or                         indirectly, important roles.                                                                                                                                    The skills of the two research groups involved in this                          project are both comprehensive and complementary; the                           Japanese group having considerable expertise in macroscopic                     calorimetric studies and the US group having similar expertise                  in microscopic spectroscopies and structural studies.                           Because of their very different backgrounds Professors                          Hendrickson and Sorai will bring quite different perspectives                   to developing a model for a given order-disorder transition.                    If successful, this project should make a considerable                          contribution to this complex area.",
