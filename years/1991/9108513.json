 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although faced with massive job losses in recent years, labor                   unions in advanced industrial countries only occasionally have                  responded with strikes or other industrial actions.  Previous                   research in Political Science suggests that variations in the                   responses of organized labor to threats of work force reduction are             linked to the institutional context of labor-management relations.              Specifically, where seniority protects union leaders from layoffs               industrial actions are less common.  Research in economics suggests             in contrast that unions are indifferent to layoffs when the average             member is protected.  This research attempts to reconcile these                 disparate perspectives and to develop a comprehensive and unified               political economic theory of industrial action.                                                                                                                 Specifically, this award is intended to prepare this talented young             investigator to conduct the innovative research she proposes.                   Specifically, the award will be used to allow the investigator to               supplement her training in Political Science with additional                    training in Economics and econometrics.  This additional training               will enable the investigator to further pursue the productive line              of research already begun.                                                                                                                                      When completed this research should increase our understanding of               labor-management relations and provide insights into the causes of              strikes and other industrial actions.",
