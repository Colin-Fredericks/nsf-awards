 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                          Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will seek new ways                 to separate and characterize large molecules and small                          particulates using Field Flow Fractionation, a technique                        pioneered by the principal investigator.  Crossed flows of                      solvents or crossed force fields (fluid flow vs. temperature,                   fluid flow vs. electric field, or fluid flow vs. gravity) are                   employed to separate molecules and particulates based on                        differences in their density, electrical mobility, and                          diameter.  Applications include both preparation of                             mono-dispersed particulates and analysis of mixtures.                                                                                                           %%%                                                                                                                                                             This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                          Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, renews support of                  the principal investigator's work in field flow fractionation                   (FFF) for separation and analysis of large molecules and                        particulates.  FFF separates molecules, particulates, or cells                  based on the competitive interaction of a fluid flow adn a                      perpendicular force field (flow of a second fluid, gravity,                     heat, or electric field) with the mixture to be separated.                      This contrasts with more common separation methods that depend                  on the chemical interaction of the substances to be separated                   with a stationary, selective phase.  The current proposal                       focuses on separations of polymers and emulsions, based on                      thermal gradients.",
