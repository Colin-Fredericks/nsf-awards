 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of the proposed research is to                     describe and explain how community composition and nutrient                     limitation of aquatic primary producers (especially algae) are                  influenced by land use and ecotonal complexity in the Andean                    Altiplano.  The four large-scale nutrient flux treatments to be                 compared are:  ancient raised fields currently under                            rehabilitation vs. flat pastures and fields (now more common),                  and complex littoral ecotones (shallow slopes) vs. simple                       ecotones (steeply sloping shorelines).  Several hypotheses                      derived from the \"big perturbation\" of anthropogenic land-use                   changes are constructed as tests.  Field sampling and                           measurements will take place in stream surface water between                    agricultural fields and the lake, and in nearshore zones of                     several drainage systems.  Analyses will be primarily for the                   major forms of nitrogen and phosphorus, bioassay studies of                     nutrient limitation, and aquatic biological responses.  Thus,                   nutrient-algal relations will be tested with both large-scale                   landscape treatments and more controlled bioassay experiments.                  These studies will be coordinated with ongoing field                            investigations by other scientists of: nutrient dynamics in                     agricultural fields, remote sensing and GIS-based modeling of                   land-water interactions, and archeological and paleolimnological                                                                                                studies of land use history.",
