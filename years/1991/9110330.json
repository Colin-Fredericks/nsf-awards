 "awd_abstract_narration": "Japanese industrial relations are often seen as being                    characterized by permanent employment, seniority wages, and a high              level of inequality between workers in large and small firms.                   These characteristics of the Japanese labor market may be vanishing             as Japan is becoming a highly industrialized, mass society.  If                 that is the case, then it should have implications for the mobility             of workers within and between firms and for the level of earnings               inequality between workers in large and small firms.  This project              will address these issues by analyzing the Japanese Surveys of                  Social Stratification and Mobility from 1955, 1965, and 1975.                   These data span four decades of rapid industrialization and                     economic growth for Japan.  The investigator will use econometric               models to analyze the data.  He will examine whether between-firm               mobility of workers has become more common over time, and whether               the earnings determination process still is dominated by the                    existence of seniority wages.                                                                                                                                        This study will be an important addition to the literature on              the Japanese labor market because it examines whether the rapid                 industrialization and strong economic growth of the last four                   decades have replaced the practices of permanent employment and                 seniority wages by productivity-based wage determination more                   similar to the patterns known from the American labor market.",
