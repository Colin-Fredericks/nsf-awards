To date, most of the flight-                                     qualified production III-V compound                                             semiconductor high-speed electronics have used                                  GaAs- or AlGaAs/GaAs-based devices.                                             Recently high electron mobility (HEMT) and                                      heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) systems                                 based on AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs,                                                    AllnAs/InGaAs, and InGaAs/InP have                                              demonstrated excellent device performance at                                    frequencies far exceeding those possible with the                               AlGaAs/GaAs system.                                                             In this Research Planning Grant award, both                                     two- and three-terminal GaInP/GaAs and                                          AlGaInP/GaAs devices will be fabricated and                                     tested.  The material will be grown by organo-                                  metallic vapor phase epitaxy at the University of                               Utah and complete device characterization (dc                                   to 60 GHz) will be carried out under this                                       research.  Device concepts to be implemented                                    in this work will include discrete HEMT,                                        insulated gate field effect transistors, and                                    quantum well devices along with prototype                                       varactor frequency multipliers and converters.                                  After the completion of the planning research,                                  optical control of microwave and millimeter                                     wave devices of GaInP/GaAs and                                                  AlGaInP/GaAs heterosystems will also be                                         investigated.  The device concepts for high-                                    frequency electronic and optoelectronic circuit                                 applications will then be used for designing and                                fabricating a monolithic millimeter wave                                        integrated circuit.  In addition, two-dimensional                               array of high frequency devices of GaInP/GaAs                                   and AlGaInP/GaAs will be fabricated to                                          produce high output power (i.e., Watt level) at                                 frequencies in the range of 94 to 147 GHz.",
