Further development work is needed on                              the growth techniques used to fabricate these                                   structures.  Advanced electronic systems will                                   require higher performance devices that will require                            high-quality heterostructures for radar and                                     communications systems. At present, the two most                                commonly employed techniques for the growth of                                  multilayer materials for today's complex device                                 structures are molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and                                 organometallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE), also                                known as metalorganic chemical vapor deposition                                 (MOCVD). In the last few years a hybridization of                               the above two techniques has occurred, resulting in                             a new technique known as chemical beam epitaxy                                  (CBE). The initial results suggest this is a superior                           technique for the growth of material for use in                                 advanced device structures such as InGaAs/InP                                   heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs).                                      Disadvantages exist with both MBE and OMVPE.                                    The inability of MBE to grow good epilayers of P-                               containing materials such as InP and GaInAsP will                               severely limit this technique for next generation                               devices. Furthermore, with MBE grown material,                                  oval defects place an upper limit on the number of                              devices at an integrated circuit level and the overall                          device yield. In addition, an upper bound on doping                             levels translates to higher series resistance and a                             compromise in HBT design. Low wafer throughput                                  and the down-time needed to reload source                                       materials substantially increase cost and result in                             unpredictable time delays. The most serious                                     problem facing the OMVPE technique is the need                                  for high flow rates of hazardous and life-threatening                           gases such as arsine and phosphine. This point                                  cannot be overemphasized: the impact on future                                  growth techniques will be highly influenced by                                  environmental concerns, health risks, and legal                                 prohibition. Engineered properly CBE can                                        overcome these problematic limitations.                                         This proposal discusses an investigation of chemical                            beam epitaxy, including work on the development                                 of new sources and the growth mechanisms. The                                   primary focus of this investigation is to develop safe                          organometallic group III and group V sources that                               result in materials with properties superior to those                                                                                                           produced to date by CBE and comparable to the                                   best produced by MBE and OMVPE. The overall                                     objective is to make significant and substantial                                improvements in the CBE process for the                                         production of As-andP-based semiconductors with                                 the major emphasis being on P-containing binary,                                ternary and quaternary III/V compound materials                                 for device applications using safer, less toxic                                 sources.",
