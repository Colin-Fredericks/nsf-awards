 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is in the areas of knot theory and 3-                         dimensional manifolds.  One of the problems Thompson will work on               is the property-P conjecture.   A knot in the 3-sphere is said                  to have property P if no non-trivial surgery on the knot yields a               homotopy 3-sphere.  It has long been conjectured that all non-                  trivial knots in the 3-sphere have property P.  Gordon and Luecke               have recently shown that non-trivial surgery on a non-trivial                   knot cannot yield the 3-sphere itself.  There remains the                       possibility that one could do surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere                 and obtain a counter-example to the Poincare conjecture.  The                   suggested approach to this problem involves a generalization of                 work of Gabai on sutured manifolds, as well as considering the                  equivalent problem of whether one can do surgery on a knot in a                 fake 3-sphere and obtain S3.  In addition, recent work with                     Scharlemann has suggested several interesting questions about                   imbedded finite graphs in 3-manifolds.  Thompson will try to                    generalize their work characterizing unknotted planar graphs in                 S3 to arbitrary finite graphs in the 3-sphere.                                       These are fundamental questions about three-manifolds.  The                fact that they are open points up how much we still do not know                 about three-dimensional manifolds.  This is so despite the fact                 that we live in one, and so such topological questions might even               have cosmological significance.",
