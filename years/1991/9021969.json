 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Charles Redman, Ms Ronna Bardley will                analyze a body of archaeological material to collect data for her               doctoral dissertation.  She will study marine shells and shell                  artifacts excavated from the site of Casas Grandes in Northern                  Mexico and from a number of sites in the U.S. Southwest to                      determine the interactions between these regions.  She wishes to                trace this process from collection (in the Gulf of California)                  through manufacture, distribution and consumption. To accomplish                this, she will examine the natural ranges of species represented.               Because within a single species shell chemical composition varies               by region, she will analyze and match archaeological specimens                  with samples from different geographical areas.  Finally, she                   will conduct a stylistic analysis to help determine where                       manufacturing took place.                                                                                                                                       Between approximately 1100 - 1300 AD, a large population grew in                Chihuahua, Mexico and was centered at the site of Casas Grandes.                Given the size and monumental nature of the site, it is clear                   that a stratified complex society was present.  The discovery of                many exotic materials at Casas Grandes indicates that widespread                trade occurred, and the city in fact may have served primarily as               a trading center.  At approximately the same time large sites                   also appeared in the Southwestern United States and                             archaeologists have questioned whether these represent an                       independent local process or rather result from direct                          Mesoamerican influence via Casas Grandes. Through chemical and                  stylistic analysis of shell artifacts, Ms Bradley will examine                  the issue directly.                                                                                                                                             This research is important for several reasons.  It will shed new               light on the role of trade and inter-regional exchange in the                   emergence of complex societies.  It will also help to develop a                 new approach to shell sourcing which may be applicable in a wide                variety of situations.  Finally, it will assist in the training                 of an extremely promising young scientist.",
