 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several hardware description mechanisms and computational problems              involved in the analysis and design of digital circuits are                     investigated.  The goals are to obtain a deeper, theoretical                    understanding of how the description mechanism affects these                    computational problems, and to devise more efficient algorithms for             specific problems of interest.  New models are being formulated where           appropriate, the effects of varying the form of certain description             mechanisms are being clarified, new algorithms and construction                 schemes are being developed, and the complexity of many problems is             studied.                                                                                                                                                        There is a focus on hierarchical descriptions, with attention paid to           which problems can be solved more efficiently than is possible when             the flattened circuit specified by the given hierarchical description           is constructed.  Issues associated with the tree corresponding to a             given hierarchical description, and attributed values on this tree are          being addressed.  The effect of algebraic specification and the effect          of the underlying algebraic system are also studied.                                                                                                            Problems considered include analysis, simulation, testing, and                  synthesis.  The construction and analysis of test schemes for                   algorithm-based fault tolerance is studied.  Certain hardware                   synthesis problems are investigated, from the perspective of                    exploitability of algebraic or hierarchical specifications.",
