 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Gifford Miller of the University of Colorado at Boulder and                     Dr. Allan R. Chivas of the Australian National University.                      The research is to apply to ostrich eggshells a new and                         highly successful varient of the dating technique, amino acid                   racemization, that is, investigation of protein changes from                    active to inactive materials. The technique can only be used                    when there is no loss of these materials from internal to                       external environments; the great density of ostrich eggshells                   protects such loss in this research. Highly reproducible                        dates on the timing and patterns of the migration of hominids                   across Asia and into Australia, and information on climatic                     changes over relatively short periods of geological time will                   result from this research. As racemization can be applied to                    materials which are too old to be dated by radiocarbon                          dating, the project provides a unique opportunity to date                       activities in the 35,000 and older time range.                                                                                                                  The project represents excellent collaboration between the                      Australian and U.S. researchers. The Australian group will                      contribute expertise in isolating individual amino acids from                   fossils, excellent laboratory facilities, and field support                     for collecting samples. Dr. Miller will contribute his                          already-extensive expertise in the technique of amino acid                      racemization for dating. This is clearly important work of                      benefit to both the Australian and U.S. scientific communities                  on dating the ages of human migration and associated climate                    change.",
