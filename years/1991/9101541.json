 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator continues his research on the design and             evaluation of the memory hierarchy of high-performance systems.                 Uniprocessors as well as shared-memory multiprocessors will be                  studied.  The studies will cover innovative architectural features,             compiler support, and protocols and hardware synchronization                    primitives for several parallel programming models.                                                                                                             In case of uniprocessors, a hardware-based preloading scheme that               should reduce the number of misses in data caches, will be                      investigated.  Compiler support for this hardware function will also            be investigated.                                                                                                                                                In the case of multiprocessors, various protocols and possibly                  enhanced synchronization primitives to cater to several consistency             models will be investigated.  The goal is to reduce the impact of the           performance degradation components (large memory latency, processor             stalling, network traffic) arising from the access to shared                    variables.  Other topics include architectural features such as the             use of the interconnection network, or one of its levels, as a                  component of the memory hierarchy.                                                                                                                              Trace-driven simulation will be the choice performance evaluation               tool.  Computer-intensive programs with large data sets drawn from              scientific and CAD tool application will be instrumented.",
