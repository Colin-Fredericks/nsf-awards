 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to increase access to                     engineering careers for women students.  About 25 women high                    school graduates between the ages of 25 and 45, who are                         employed in jobs below their potential capabilities, are                        enrolled in engineering programs at the University of Tennessee                 Chattanooga on a part-time basis.  Their employers are partners                 in the project and provide opportunities for employees to                       observe science, engineering and technically related                            activities.  The women are enrolled at the University in a                      seminar for beginning engineering students and participate in                   enrichment activities which emphasize academic involvement,                     careers, professionalism, communications, social interaction                    and motivation.  At the end of this period, students who have                   demonstrated aptitude will be encouraged to enroll in                           engineering curricula structured for part-time students.  This                  project gives women students a sense of community and                           involvement in engineering-related activities.",
