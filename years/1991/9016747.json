 "awd_abstract_narration": "This goal of the research program proposes to define and                        understand the role of each of the three components (araF, araG,                and araH) of the high-affinity L-arabinose transport system and                 the manner in which they interact to effect the efficient                       accumulation of L-arabinose from the environment for metabolic                  utilization.  Residues on the cleft surface of the arabinose                    binding protein ( product of araF) that engage in interactions at               the membrane complex as identified by saturation mutagenesis will               be individually modified by site directed mutagenesis to                        establish the chemical requirements of that interaction.  The                   organization of the components of the membrane complex (araG and                araH) will be determined by selective modification of residues                  exposed to the inner outer surfaces of the cytoplasmic membrane                 using vesicles prepared in the correct and inverted orientation.                Radiolabelled modified proteins will be visualized by SDS PAGE                  and radioautography.  Information obtained from the biochemical                 modification experiments will be correlated with the properties                 of TnphoA insertions to establish the orientation of the                        individual components in the membrane environment.  The role of                 the araG protein will be pursued by UV crosslinking of                          radiolabelled nucleotides into one or both of the putative ATP                  binding sites and the site(s) of preference identified.                                                                                                         Binding protein transport systems provide an ideal model to                     consider the manner by which cells communicate with the                         environment outside the cytoplasmic membrane, how surface                       receptors are organized, how cells generate pores in lipid                      membranes to accomodate transit of hydrophilic molecules, how                   cells direct proteins to specific locations in the cell, in the                 membrane, or outside the cell, how cells utilize energy to effect               substrate accumulation.  Further consideration of such systems                  can only add to our understanding of cellular processes.",
