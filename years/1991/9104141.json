 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to compare two fields of \"table-                    top\" science separated by 25 years: lasers in the early 1960s                   and high-temperature superconductors in the mid-1980s.  Focus                   will be upon continuities and changes in two kinds of behavior:                 the international relations of the scientific teams, and the                    changing connections of university teams with industry and                      government, and the impact of these linkages on the contents                    of the research.                                                                  The project should afford significant insights into the                       nature of modern science, particularly the dichotomization                      between \"big\" and \"little\" science, as well as to the                           significance of the relations between university teams and                      other sectors of the research community.  It furthers VPW                       program objectives to provide opportunities for women to                        advance their careers in science or engineering through                         research, and to encourage other women to pursue careers in                     these areas through the investigators' enhanced visibility as                   role models on the host campuses.  In this project, the                         proposed activities which contribute to the second objective                    include:  teaching three courses over five academic quarters                    in the history and philosophy of science--two in the history                    of 19th and 20th century physics and one in U.S. science                        policy, leading a seminar series in the history of U.S. science                 policy designed for faculty and graduate students,                              participating in the physics colloquium, advising students and                  recruiting some to work on special problems, giving public                      lectures to make visible female participation in the history                    of the \"hard sciences,\" an area of scholarship in which women                   are at present underrepresented, and organizing a symposium on                  the effect of intersectorial linkages on university research                    for one of the major societies.",
