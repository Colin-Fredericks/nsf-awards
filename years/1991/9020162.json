 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Herbarium of the San Diego Museum of Natural History                   contains more than 125,000 specimens, including more than 200                   type specimens.  This collection is an important repository of                  plants representing the flora of the southwest U.S. and Baja                    California.  Dr. Geoffrey Levin, Curator in charge of the                       Herbarium, has planned important improvements in the physical                   curation of these plant specimens.  New storage cabinets will be                installed on compact storage rails, thereby providing more                      efficient and safe storage without sacrificing access to the                    specimens.  The proposed compact storage will provide room for                  decades of collection growth.                                                        The proposed collection improvement represents a long-term                 plan for managing an important research resource.  The community                of research biologists depends on herbarium collections such as                 this for reference materials.  Countless studies in ecology,                    evolution, biogeography, and global change will draw crucial                    information from this collection.  Future generations of research               depend on the care and growth of collections such as this.",
