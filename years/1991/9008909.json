 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will extend previous work developing a computer                   simulation model of human memory.  The project includes two kinds               of activities.  First, the research will use simulation to                      explore interesting properties of the model in greater depth and                to apply the model to human memory phenomena that were not                      considered in its initial development.  Second, the research will               include experiments on human memory, in order to better                         understand the reasons behind several of the model's apparent                   predictive failures.  These experiments will focus on how                       information is retrieved from memory and how judgments regarding                remembered events are based on the retrieved information.  The                  questions to which the experiments are addressed are general                    ones, not model-specific, so that the experimental results will                 be of broad relevance to theories of human memory.   Although                   this work is unlikely to have immediate practical application, it               will further our understanding of the properties of human memory                and its role in cognition, and so will contribute in the long run               to applications in such areas as education and training, brain                  damage and amnesia, and biases in human judgment and decision                   making.",
