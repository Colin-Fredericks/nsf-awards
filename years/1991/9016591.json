 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a joint award with Dr. Joshi at the University of                       Pennsylvania.  This team has proposed several major research                    tasks in natural language processing with special emphasis on                   several mathematical and computational aspects.  The work clearly               has a formal and mathematical character.  The various                           computational structures and strategies the team has developed                  and will develop, need to be investigated mathematically                        becausesuch investigations shed light on the descriptive and                    processing powers of these formalisms.  These two aspects, i.e.,                the  development of the structures and strategies, and their                    mathematical investigations, are very much interrelated.  It is                 believed that natural language processing backed up by a formal                 framework, and mathematical investigations grounded in empirical                studies are two very productive areas of research.  The                         researcher will focus on interested in mathematical                             investigations only to the extent to which the results have                     important implications for natural language processing.",
