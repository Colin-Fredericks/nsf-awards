 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principle objective of the State Industry/University                   Cooperative Research Center for Capsule Pipelines at the University             of Missouri-Columbia is to generate knowledge and know how for the              design and operation of these pipelines.                                             Studies have shown that products can be transported                        economically to distant places by capsules (large cylindrical                   containers or log forms) moving through pipelines.  The technology,             called \"capsule pipelines\" or \"freight pipelines,\" has many                     potential advantages including lower freight costs, less energy                 consumption, less pollution and environmental problems, greater                 safety, and better reliability.  Presently, interest in capsule                 pipelines is centered around the \"coal log pipeline (CLP),\" i.e.,               the \"capsules\" are compressed coal cylinders (coal logs) in direct              contact with the water flowing in the pipe.  The center research                during the first four years will focus on CLP, and then gradually               shift to other types of capsule pipelines.                                           The Core Program of the Center includes basic and applied                  research in hydrodynamics of capsule flow, theory of capsule pumps,             automatic control of capsule pipeline systems, manufacturing of                 coal logs, water quality and corrosion of coal log pipelines, and               legal/institutional issues relating to eminent domain and water                 rights for coal pipelines.  The Core Program will also involve                  technology transfer activities such as preparing a detailed design              and operations manual and constructing a small-scale demonstration              system of coal log pipeline for training industry personnel,                    holding a technology-transfer workshop, etc.  The Non-Core Program              will include the following:  methods to fabricate coal logs,                    determination of the best ways to prevent jamming and to minimize               abrasion of capsules and coal logs in pipelines, optimum design of              coal log pipeline systems, and the economics of coal log pipelines              as compared to other competing transportation modes including                   train, truck, barge, and slurry pipelines.  The State of Missouri,              industry and NSF will provide matching funds totalling $525,000 in              the first year.",
