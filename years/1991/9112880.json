 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implicit invocation mechanisms are a fundamental technique for                  organizing software systems.  Typically, each of these mechanisms has           been produced - at significant cost - as an innovative design and               implementation.  One reason for this diversity is that each mechanism           has been designed for different domains.  Another reason, however, is           that the common properties of implicit invocation mechanisms are                poorly understood.  Consequently, it is hard to take advantage of               previous experiences when designing a new mechanism.  Now, however,             the collection of mechanisms and practical experience is rich enough            to permit the characterization of the design space so that choices can          be made in a principled and routine way.  To achieve this ability to            engineer implicit invocation mechanisms requires three steps.  First,           based on an analysis of the common and distinct aspects of existing             mechanisms, the underlying architecture of such mechanisms will be              formalized.  Second, how to create new mechanisms with specific                 desirable properties by specializing this architecture according to             well-defined principles will be determined.  Third, this architecture           and these principles will be applied to two domains:  an environment            for manipulating formal specifications and an environment for                   interactive manipulation of encyclopedia articles.",
