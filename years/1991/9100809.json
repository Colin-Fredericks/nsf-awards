 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the continuation of an                     Research for Undergraduate site at the Space Physics Research                   Laboratory of the University of Michigan.  The Space Physics                    Research Laboratory is a broad interdisciplinary research                       organization which is part of the Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space               Sciences academic department of the University of Michigan.                     Research undertaken in the laboratory spans several fields of                   engineering and geophysical sciences, with an emphasis on the                   observation and understanding of the physical processes which                   control the gaseous, plasma and liquid envelopes of the Earth and               planetary bodies.  The annual research budget of the laboratory                 is  $9M and major funding comes from the National Science                       Foundation and NASA as well as other agencies.  Because of the                  strong ties to the academic environment as the University, and                  its presence within a geoscience department in the College of                   Engineering, the Space Physics Research Laboratory has always                   maintained an active interest in providing significant                          undergraduate and graduate research opportunities, particularly                 in the area of Solar-Terrestrial research and Aeronomy.  The                    continued REU site will involve the direct participation of about               11 key faculty members (plus about 7 others) who have all had                   previous experience with the training of undergraduate students                 in research on the REU program on the SPRL.  Funding is                         requested to provide support for approximately 12 students, of                  whom at least half will be from institutions other than the                     University of Michigan.  Because of its commitment to high-                     quality to undergraduate education, the University has agreed to                waive indirect cost on this program.  The rich variety and                      significance of the research carried out within the Laboratory                  and the commitment of time on the part of the faculty                           participants will provide the undergraduate of the program a                    significant opportunity to have hands-on experience in active and               exciting research.",
