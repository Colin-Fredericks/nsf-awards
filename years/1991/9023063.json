 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to study and                      analyze random particle methods for Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck                systems.  It is proposed to see if a random particle-in-cell                    method can be implemented that takes into account the fact that                 plasma particles (ions and electrons) undergo Brownian motion due               to collisions with the medium or background particles.  The                     research efforts will be mainly devoted to the convergence                      analysis and numerical implementation of these methods.                         Simultaneously, the investigators shall continue investigations                 on particle methods for solving Vlasov-Poisson systems.  Their                  research will be addressed to improving convergence rates for                   simulation methods, introducing time discretization of                          particle-in-cell methods, and analyzing more efficient                          algorithms.                                                                          For problems of controlled fusion and laser fusion, the                    physics of laser-matter interactions is still not well                          understood.  Consequently, scientists are turning more and more                 to microscopic models based on kinetic equations to better                      understand these phenomena.  For modeling the evolution of                      rarefied plasmas for those times less than the binary                           collision times, the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations is used                 for the relevant kinetic model, when the magnetic fields vary                   slowly.  Particle simulation methods consist of replacing the                   plasma by a large set of charged superparticles that obey the                   usual laws of classical and modern physics, and then computing                  the interactions of these superparticles.  A thorough                           understanding of the accuracy properties of these methods will                  enable the scientist to use different approximate parameters                    efficiently in a numerical simulation (e.g., the minimum number                 of particles to obtain a given accuracy).                                            The Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck system of kinetic equations               incorporates collisional effects of a plasma with the background                material (e.g., a plasma system in a thermal bath or \"reservoir\")               by regarding the motion of a particle as Brownian motion caused                 by collisions with the background.  This model is analogous to                  the classical description of the irregular or Brownian motion                   exhibited by a particle of colloidal size immersed in a fluid.                  In stellar dynamics also, the effect of encounters between stars                under gravitational forces influences their motion in the manner                of Brownian motion.  The random particle method for                             Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck models is proposed in order to                     better understand the effects of collisions by incorporating the                Brownian motion in the numerical schemes.",
