 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the participation of ten US                     scientists in a joint US-Japan seminar on \"Finite Element                       Analysis of Reinforced Concrete\".  The modelling of the                         behavior of reinforced concrete, particularly its dynamic                       behavior, is an extremely important field.  Increased                           demands are being placed on certain special structures, such                    as nuclear power plant facilities and offshore drilling                         platforms, and hence there is a growing need for a more                         comprehensive analysis tool to aid in the design of such                        structures.  The development of the finite element method has                   made it possible to analyze many different kinds of structures                  and to model their geometry more realistically, thus enabling                   researchers to gain new insights into the behavior of                           reinforced concrete structures. The research undertaken by US                   and Japanese scientists in this area is complementary, US                       researchers having made very valuable basic contributions to                    the advancement of finite element methods while Japanese                        researchers having been much more active in transferring                        those advances into practice.  The seminar should therefore                     contribute both to the documentation of recent advances in each                 country, and to getting new techniques being developed into                     practice, particularly in the US.                                                                                                                               The seminar is to be held on June 3-6, 1991 at Columbia                         University, New York.  The co-organizers are Professor                          Christian Meyer, Department of Civil Engineering and                            Engineering Mechanics, Columbia University, and Professor                       Hiroshi Noguchi, Department of Architectural Engineering, Chiba                 University, Japan. The seminar will be divided into two                         parts, the first part concentrating upon the state of the art                   and the second on verification and application to practical                     engineering problems.  Specific topics to be discussed at the                   seminar include (1) constitutive models; (2) fracture                           mechanics; (3) reinforced concrete models; (4) time-dependent                   behavior and behavior under dynamic loading; and (5)                            computational aspects. This will be the second seminar on                       this subject under the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Science                           Program, the first being held in 1985. It is expected that this                 seminar, as with the first seminar, will lead to increased                      exchanges of information and more extensive research collabor-                  ation.",
