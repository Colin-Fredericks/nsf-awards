 "awd_abstract_narration": "When tissue gafts are transplanted from one species of mollusc to               another (xenografts), the grafts reportedly fail, i.e., die.  The               goal of the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms of                xenograft failure in molluscs.  Specifically, the study will assess             the relative roles of (1) physiological incompatibility between                 donor and recipient and (2) immunological rejection by the                      recipient.  Methods will include implantation of hearts from                    phylogenetically close and phylogenetically distant species into                a single recipient snail species.  Fates of the implants will be                followed histologically and histochemically, and will be compared               to fates of hearts maintained in vitro, and to fates of implants                from donors of the same species.  In addition, the role of the                  immune system will be ascertained by conducting implants in                     immunosuppressed recipients, i.e., snails infected with larval                  trematodes.  Finally, initial information on the types of                       determinants on the xenograft recognized as non-self will be gained             by subjecting grafts to chemical modification such as neuraminidase             digestion and lectin binding prior to implantation.                                                                                                             The potential significance of this project is that it may help to               elucidate the mechanisms of immune-like self recognition in                     molluscs, serve as a model for studying primitive forms of self                 recognition that also occur in vertebrates, and provide information             on phylogenetic relationships within an important group of                      molluscs.",
