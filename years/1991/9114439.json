The              emphases in the program will be on the fracture related issues in               new material systems in which strength, toughness, fatigue and                  corrosion properties along with the residual stresses may be                    controlled by controlling the composition profile during                        processing.  Functionally gradient materials are essentially fine               composites or nano composites which are synthesized to achieve a                desired thermomechanical property variation in the material by                  grading the volume fractions of the constituent materials through               the thickness.  This new process of grading the properties of the               interfacial regions and coatings by gradually varying the material              composition through the thickness appears to have some very                     important advantages.  First, the process smooths the stress                    distribution and drastically reduces the stress concentration                   factors thereby reducing the likelihood of failure due to residual              and thermal stresses.  Secondly, it improves the bonding strength,              in most cases quite considerably.  The third advantage of the new               technique is the improvement one obtains in fracture toughness and              fatigue and corrosion crack growth parameters of the material.  The             second part of the program deals with the investigation of the                  influence of material orthotropy, particularly the structure and                thickness of interfacial zones in bonded layers on the crack                    driving force in delamination and fracture penetration problems.",
