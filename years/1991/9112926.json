 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Horia Metiu is supported by a grant from the                          Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                      theoretical simulations of silicon growth on surfaces and time                  dependent quantum theoretical treatments of the effects of                      ultrashort laser pulses on molecular solutes.  In the first                     area of research, Metiu will use correlation function theory to                 calculate the rates of all the elementary kinetic steps                         involved in the epitaxial growth process: the sticking of atoms                 to the surface, their jumps from one surface site to another,                   the dependence of the jumping rate on local configuration of                    adsorbed atoms, and the final sites involved in the jump.                       These rates will be used in a kinetic Monte Carlo program to                    simulate the kinetics of epitaxial growth of silicon.  In the                   second area of research, Metiu will develop methods capable of                  analyzing the results of novel experiments with ultrashort                      pulses which are used to probe the dynamics of solute                           molecules.  He will also explore the theoretical consequences                   of coherence and interference in generating laser signals that                  are very sensitive to the quantum dynamics.                                     %%%                                                                             This research will provide an important molecular level                         understanding of epitaxial growth on semiconductor surfaces and                 of techniques for laser control of chemical processes in                        solution.",
