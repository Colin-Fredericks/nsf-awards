 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental research, dealing with quasi-static and dynamic crack              initiation and growth at material interfaces subjected to                       mechanical and thermal loading, will be carried out.  The research              will contribute to a better understanding of interfacial failure                mechanisms which predominantly control the fracture behavior of                 multi-phase materials such as polymer and metal matrix composites,              metal filled composites, and of adhesive bonds and thin films on                substrates.  The proposed work is concerned with crack initiation               and growth simulations under controlled loading conditions in                   bimaterial specimens.  Interfacial crack tip deformations will be               optically measured prior to and at fracture initiation.  A newly                developed, real time, full field optical technique, 'Coherent                   Gradient Sensing' (CGS), will be utilized as an experimental tool               for measuring deformations near interfacial cracks.  From these                 high resolution optical measurements, local crack tip parameters                such as complex stress intensity factor and crack tip mode mixity               will be inferred.  The optical measurements will allow us to seek               relationships between the local crack tip parameters and                        external/material parameters such as remote loading and material                property mismatch.  This will provide valuable data for identifying             parameters which significantly influence crack initiation at                    interfaces and for establishing interfacial failure criteria.",
