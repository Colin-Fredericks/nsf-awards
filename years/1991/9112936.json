 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a major and important puzzle with                        implications for our understanding of U.S. manufacturing                        productivity.  The results should also enhance our understanding                of the determinants of economic fluctuations in output.  The                    puzzle is the idleness of capital much of the time in U.S.                      manufacturing.  Specifically, the workweek of capital in U.S.                   manufacturing averages only 55 hours per week.  If a unit of                    capital does not get less productive with more intensive use over               time and if its user cost is independent of the rate of                         utilization, then the productivity of the capital stock in U.S.                 manufacturing could be three times higher simply by increasing                  the utilization of the existing capital stock.  The idleness of                 capital also implies that even at cyclical peaks, tight capacity                does not limit the expansion of the economy.                                                                                                                    This project investigates the costs of increasing the workweek of               capital along several dimensions.  It determines whether these                  costs justify the low utilization of capital.  The estimates of                 the cost of using capital more intensively are based on a study                 of the U.S. economy during World War II.  The private U.S.                      economy during World War II produced a tremendous increment in                  output with little increase in capacity.  This project assembles                and analyzes data on shift work, female labor participation, on                 work hours and conditions for production works and on other labor               arrangements during World War II from the records of the price                  control board, the military procurement agencies and private                    companies.",
