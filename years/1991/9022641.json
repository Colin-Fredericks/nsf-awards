Invited speakers from government                  laboratories, universities, and industry will lead discussions                  on the applications of the latest theories and techniques in                    laser diagnostics to combustion systems.  Topics will include                   various spectroscopic techniques (Raman, LIF, CARS), high                       intensity resonant interactions, turbulence-combustion                          interactions, quantitative imaging, diagnostics in                              supercritical oxidation and hypersonic combustors, and                          measuring surface film growth.                                                                                                                                  The Thermal Systems Program has partially sponsored these                       biennial gatherings over the past few years because the                         structure of the conference lends itself to a strong                            interchange of ideas among the combustion laser diagnostics                     community, with experienced practitioners and postdoctoral                      students, academic and industrial researchers, and foreign and                  US scientists participating.",
