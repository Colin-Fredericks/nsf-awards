 "awd_abstract_narration": "The production of humoral immune responses is dependent on                      antibody-producing B-cells which develop from precusor stem cells               that are present in the bone marrow.  Antigen-independent B-cell                differentiation involves a series of developmental stages                       (generally designated as pre-B cell stages) during which a                      sequential and ordered recombination of antibody genes occurs.                  Although the stages of pre-B cell differentiation have been fairly              well characterized, the control signals that regulate the                       progressive steps of pre-B cell maturation are not yet understood.              We have previously proposed that DNA recombination might play a                 role in the initiation of lambda gene recombination in maturing                 pre-B cells.  We now propose to directly test this hypothesis by                producing mice carrying a mutation that prevents the recombination              of RS DNA.  We will determine the physiological effect of this RS               mutation on B-cell maturation.                                                                                                                                  The results from this project have the potential to have a major                impact upon our understanding of the events which occur in the                  formation of active antibodies in mammals.",
