 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research program will investigate the biochemical                  mechanisms used by the extremely thermophilic eubacterium                       Thermotoga neapolitana to derive energy from the oxidation of                   carbohydrates and the reduction of elemental sulfur.  T.                        neapolitana grows less efficiently in the absence of elemental                  sulfur by producing hydrogen as a fermentation endproduct.  The                 regulation of the switching between this hydrogen-generating                    metabolism and a sulfur-reducing metabolism will be studied by                  analyzing growth responses and protein profiles of cells grown                  under different conditions.  Other sulfur-containing compounds will             be screened for their ability to act as electron acceptors to                   identify the actual substrate of the electron-donating enzyme(s).               The sulfur reduction system will be fractionated to identify its                components and determine their location within the cell.  The                   enzymes involved in glucose metabolism will also be investigated                briefly to identify the source of the electrons used for sulfur                 reduction.  T. neapolitana belongs to a group of eubacteria that                may be the closest living relatives of the ancestral eubacterium.               Sulfur reduction may be an ancient physiological trait since it is              found in Thermotoga species as well as many archaebacteria.  An                 understanding of this process may reveal how metabolic processes                evolved in early microorganisms.  In addition, sulfur reduction may             have biotechnological applications for the removal of sulfurous                 compounds from ores, coal and petrochemical products.//",
