 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the fact that nearly half of all stars are in close                     binaries (double star systems), our understanding of their                      evolution is far less advanced than it is for single stars,                     primarily because an appreciable fraction of mass can be                        transferred from one star to the other, and sometimes back again,               or even lost to the system altogether.   The beta Lyrae class is                an important system among high-mass, eclipsing stellar binary                   systems in which mass transfer from the initially more massive star             has progressed to the stage where the ratio of masses has been                  reversed.  Despite a large number of beta Lyrae systems now known,              our understanding of these systems has been stymied by the absence              of any systems that have just begun this mass transfer as the                   massive star first evolves and enlarges.  The PI argues that the                binary star named SV Cen is just such a system.  He also suggests               that results from earlier attempts to model the light variations                of this system as the stars eclipse one another can be best                     explained by a binary early in its mass-transfer evolution.  In his             picture mass is lost from the more massive star to an accretion                 disk around the less massive star.  The PI plans to simulate the                light variations and ultraviolet spectra with a computer model of               this picture.  The results are expected not only to clarify the                 role SV Cen itself plays in binary evolution but to test the                    correctness of many past models of light curves of similar                      eclipsing binary systems by many authors.  Finally, the results of              this study are expected to force a greater interaction between                  researchers investigating binary star evolution and the phenomenon              of accretion disks.",
