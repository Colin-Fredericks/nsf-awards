 "awd_abstract_narration": "Yeast provides an excellent system for the study of Golgi                    secretory function because of its tractability to genetic,                      molecular, biochemical, and cell biological analyses.  This                     project focuses on the role of SEC14p, the protein gene product                 of the SEC14 gene identified previously as being required for                   normal yeast secretory activity.  Prior work under NSF support                  has shown that SEC14p is a cytosolic protein, which somehow                     is required for export of proteins from the lumen of the                        Golgi.  Also, extragenic suppressors of sec14-ts have been                      characterized.  The long-term goal of the project is to                         understand, at the molecular level, how the secretory process                   functions. The specific aim of the proposed research is to                      identify and characterize the specific membrane compartment of                  the Golgi apparatus which is involved in the function of SEC14p.                This study will involve enrichment of the compartment from                      temperature-sensitive sec14 mutants by biochemical means, and                   immuno-identification of these compartments using antibodies                    against various gene products known (from genetic analyses) to be               involved in SEC14p function.                                                                                                                                    The function of the Golgi in the secretory process is an                        important question relevant to several disciplines of the life                  sciences.  These studies will make an important contribution to                 this area of research.",
