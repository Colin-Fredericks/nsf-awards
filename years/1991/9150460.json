 "awd_abstract_narration": "A prototype \"ANEX\" facility has been developed that allows                      lower division Civil Engineering undergraduates to compare                      ANalytical and EXperimental results of small-scale structural                   model tests in a portable, personal computer-controlled                         environment. This project is to refine and test the existing                    ANEX prototype and to develop an expert system that will act as                 a trouble-shooter for student users when analytical and                         experimental results do not correlate acceptably well.                          Further, a \"RIED\" facility is to be developed and deployed in                   the ANEX facility to improve student skills related to the                      Reading and Interpretation of Engineering Drawings.  The RIED                   facility also helps students to correlate idealized small-scale                 models with real-world engineering structures.  Plans to assess                 the impact of ANEX/RIED on introductory structural analysis                     courses at the University of Missouri-Rolla and at the                          University of New Hampshire are to be prepared, and then,                       preparation for the disemination of the results will be                         initiated.",
