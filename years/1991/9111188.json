 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                   be concerned with superstrings (which are one - dimensional                     objects) and their higher - dimensional generalizations, known                  as super p - branes.  In particular, the role of these objects                  as effective, long-distance descriptions of topological                         defects in supersymmetric quantum field theories will be                        explored.                                                                            The theory of superstrings shows promise as a theory                       which would describe all of the forces of nature, including                     gravity.  Supersymmetry relates the particles which make up                     matter to those which carry the forces between bits of matter.                  The study of strings and their generalizations as topological                   defects has proved to be of importance in elucidating the                       nature of string theory.",
