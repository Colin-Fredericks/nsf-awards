 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chimpanzees are well known to be our closest non-human relatives,               but the surprising extent to which they share cognitive abilities               with human beings is still being discovered.  Drs. Boysen and                   Berntson are investigating the numerical competence of                          chimpanzees.  Their studies should contribute to our                            understanding of the similarities and differences in cognitive                  capabilities across species and toward clarifying those processes               that may support numerical skills in non-human primates.  Besides               these contributions to basic scientific knowledge, these studies                may yield sharper tests for and understanding of numerical                      competence in children and, more generally, provide a better                    understanding of non-verbal intelligence.  Thus, the present                    project may provide insights into the cognitive abilities of                    language-impaired or otherwise developmentally-challenged                       children.                                                                                                                                                       Experiments will examine the manipulation of numerical symbols,                 the emergence of counting skills, and the representational nature               of number symbols.  Training methods previously developed will be               extended to increase the range and functional significance of                   number use by three young-adult chimpanzees, and to examine                     features of summation and subtraction using arrays containing                   both symbols and objects.  The emergence of counting skills will                also be examined in an adult and an infant chimpanzee, including                an analysis of ability to recognize the position within the                     series from 1 to 7 of two quantities (3, 6) that have not                       previously been paired with arrays of objects.  The contribution                of abstract symbol use will be further examined in a study of                   food sharing that employs Arabic numerals and arrays of objects                 in a social, cooperative context.  A final study will investigate               the chimpanzees' formation of equivalence sets among categories                 of numerical stimuli.",
