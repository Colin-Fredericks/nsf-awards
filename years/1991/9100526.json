 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much attention has focused in recent years on rapid rates of               deforestation in the Amazon Basin and about related extinctions of many         plant and animal species and adverse impacts on global climatic                 patterns.  Frequently overlooked, however, has been the ability of the          region's forests to naturally regenerate in time frames that mitigate           the detrimental impacts of deforestation.  Some scientists estimate             that as much as 85 percent of the forests are recolonized by native             plants within a few years after clearance.  This project will consist           of a detailed analysis of the processes of natural regeneration and the         roles of native people as they affect reforestation of forests in the           Xingu Basin near Belo Monte in the central Amazon Basin.  Analyses of           remotely sensed data will be combined with field observations in order          to estimate rates of cleared land and to track the rates of succession          at two specific sites.  Field-based analyses will assess the                    relationships among various successional forests, soil types, slope             conditions, land uses; these analyses will determine rates of                   reforestation under different sets of conditions.  Detailed analyses of         past and present human activities in two sites with more fertile soils          will provide a means for assessing the response of forests to clearance         and the potential for encouraging deforestation activities into these           types of areas rather than into areas with slower natural rates of              recovery.                                                                            This project will provide valuable new information into the                processes by which cleared tropical forest tracts regenerate                    themselves.  New insights will result both with respect to the Amazon           forests of Brazil and for similar biomes on other continents.  The              project also will make methodological contributions, providing greater          knowledge of the ways that remotely sensed data can be used to monitor          deforestation and regeneration.  Because this project is conducted in           collaboration with two Brazilian agencies and because Brazilian                 nationals will be employed to help complete it, the project will help           develop Brazilian scientific capabilities with respect to this                  important topic and these useful new methods.",
