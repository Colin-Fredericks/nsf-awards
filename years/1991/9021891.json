This building was constructed in                 1929 and last renovated in 1985.  The ARFMP grant of $950,000                   and $950,000 provided by the grantee as cost sharing will be                    used to modernize these research and research training                          facilities.  This project will address the need to improve the                  current research infrastructure in terms of health and safety as                well as of quantity and quality of research that can be conducted               by repairing structural deficiencies and the heating,                           ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and all other building                 systems.                                                                                                                                                        This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for the conduct of research and               for the training of undergraduate students at Morehouse College                 which is outstanding among Black liberal arts colleges in the                   degree of emphasis it places on the preparation of its graduates                for research careers.  The project is of special benefit to the                 broadening of the nation's science base because it facilitates                  the provision of quality research and research training                         opportunities for minorities.",
