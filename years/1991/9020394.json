 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research study is a joint collaborative                                    research effort between an academic research                                    unit and a professional design office to                                        investigate seismic torsional effects in                                        multistory buildings.  Two projects (BCS                                        9020394 and BCS 9116089) are combined into a                                    joint cooperative study of the referenced                                       topic area as a single research effort.                                                                                                                         By means of analytical models and a                                             probabilistic approach, this research study                                     evaluates the inelastic seismic response of                                     torsionally unbalanced structures, with a                                       view towards developing more rational methods                                   of design.  Knowledge of the seismic                                            response, calculated for seismic motions                                        defined by ensembles of normalized real and                                     synthetic accelerograms, are used to gain                                       physical insight in the examination of a wide                                   range of elastically-based procedures widely                                    used in current codes for torsional effects                                     in seismic design.  The validity of these                                       procedures are assessed by first designing                                      the structural models according to the                                          elastically-based \"static\" and modal                                            superposition rules, followed by an explicit                                    evaluation of the inelastic response of these                                   models.  A torsionally unbalanced structure                                     will be judged to have been properly designed                                   if the probability of exceedance of a seismic                                   response parameter (story drift or component                                    ductility demand) does not exceed that for                                      the corresponding balanced (symmetric)                                          system.  Criterion established will help                                        identify deficiencies in current practice and                                   will provide a method for testing and                                           modifying systematically different design                                       rules until satisfactory probabilities are                                      obtained.  Results from this project provide                                    critically important data on the torsional                                      effects in multistory buildings induced by                                      seismic forces.",
