 "awd_abstract_narration": "Antarctic diving petrels, unlike other surface-feeding seabirds in              the Antarctic, have lost their ability to produce stomach oils to               feed their young.  As a result, petrel chicks grow slower and                   fledge older than other seabird chicks reared on meals containing               a high (20%) percentage of stomach oils.  Any adaptive advantage                that stomach oils provide the chicks of these other seabirds                    remains unknown.  Using cross-fostering experiments, diving petrels             rearing chicks that are normally fed meal with stomach oils and                 vice versa, Dr. Roby proposes to investigate how the presence or                absence of stomach oils in the meals fed to seabird chicks                      influence the growth rates.  Specific topics to be addressed are:               (1) gastrointestinal transit rates, (2) lipid assimilation                      efficiencies, (3) patterns of lipid storage and catabolism, (4)                 growth and development, (5) adult foraging efficiency, and (6) net              production efficiency of the parent/offspring unit. The results                 will be evaluated to address the ecological and energetic                       significance of stomach oils for reproduction in Antarctic                      seabirds, as well as the factors responsible for the absence of                 stomach oils in diving petrels.",
