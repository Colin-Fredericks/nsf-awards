 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed to identifying the mechanisms and                 quantifying the rates of atmospherically important heterogeneous                processes.  The full range of these processes includes the                      transfer of molecules from the gaseous to the condensed state by                new particle formation or by adsorption onto or dissolution into                a microdroplet or aerosol particle, together with concomitant                   chemical conversion.  These processes can serve to remove species               from the gas phase, thereby altering their lifetimes, transport                 and removal processes, and at the same time influencing their                   further participation in gas phase reactions and enhancing those                possible in the condensed phase.  The thrust of the present                     proposal is on studies designed to elucidate the mechanisms of                  reactions which involve aqueous systems comprising the liquid                   media associated with (some) aerosols, cloud droplets and ice                   crystals through an investigation of clusters.                                       Some critical experiments will be conducted in each of the                 aforementioned areas, including work designed to elucidate                      transformations in aqueous phases and the influence of various                  neutral and ionic species.                                                           The proposed studies are subdivided into four general areas.               The first, to which major emphasis will be given, constitutes an                in-depth investigation of reactions involving water clusters,                   both pure and containing other constituents, along with important               atmospheric molecules and free radicals.  An investigation of                   mixed cluster systems between water and other molecules such as                 salts and acids, along with a determination of the role of                      various co-clustered species on the structure and bonding, will                 also be undertaken.  The second area, which is related to the                   aforementioned, involves an investigation of the thermochemistry                of mixed clusters.  The primary objective of this aspect of the                 work is to provide data from which to determine the partial                     pressure of constituents interacting with droplets (related to                  activity coefficients).  The third aspect of the work involves                  studies of the influence of light on the reactions identified to                be important in the first area.  The fourth activity constitutes                a calculational phase of the program devoted to elucidating the                 structure and bonding of cluster species identified in the other                three phases of the program as being of critical importance to                  the reactions and the activity coefficients.  Calculations of                   vibrational frequencies and related dynamical aspects of clusters               will be of value in interpreting the results of the proposed                    studies in the first three areas.",
