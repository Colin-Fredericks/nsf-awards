 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study how ultrasonic waves                 scatter from partially closed cracks and other imperfect                        interfaces.  An important part of this research is developing a                 model for such interfaces that takes account of surfaces roughness              and the partial contact between crack or bond faces.  An equally                important part is developing a model of the measurement process                 that accounts for the transmitting and receiving characteristics                of the transducers.  The results of this research will enable more              complete, quantitative information about such cracks and interfaces             to be extracted from scattered ultrasonic signals.  Examples of                 such quantitative information include the size of a fatigue crack               and an estimate of the strength of a diffusion bond.  Such                      information enables one to assess quantitatively the quality and                reliability of manufactured parts.  The approach used is                        interactive.  It involves a combination of analytical and numerical             approaches whose outcomes will be continuously compared.  Moreover,             the predictions from these calculations will be continuously                    compared with existing data from measurements carried out at the                Center for Nondestructive Evaluation at Iowa State University.",
