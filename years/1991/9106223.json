 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six undergraduates will receive support from this Research                 Experiences for Undergraduates award.  They will work under the                 direction of several faculty advisors all of whom have strong                   research programs under way.  This program continues a successful               program of undergraduate research at Washington University.  It                 will be augmented during the next two years by a series of visits               by leading mathematical researchers.  The environment for this                  activity is particularly fecund at Washington University which                  has produced many of the top finalists and leading teams in the                 Putnam examinations over the past ten years.                                         Included among the many topics which will be available for                 student projects is the study of the phi-transform.  This concept               is a very recent variation of the wavelet transform allowing one                to decompose general functions into sums of simple terms.  It                   has interesting computational characteristics which allow for                   simple but important questions to be undertaken early without                   need for extensive theoretical training.  Work will also be done                on the boundary behavior of conformal mappings and harmonic                     measure.  This work will fit well into the development of                       students who have recently completed an undergraduate complex                   variables course.                                                                    Another area of interest includes problems arising in the                  theory of several complex variables.  Here, researchers can                     construct numerical models for automorphism groups and perform                  calculations of invariants associated with boundary differential                invariants.  The work only requires basic algebra and an                        understanding of symbol manipulation programs.  In the process,                 students will develop concrete understanding of geometric                       structures and the analysis related to them.                                         A more applied program developing mathematical models of                   molecular evolution will also be available.  Students will                      consider questions concerning the distribution of nucleotides in                the coding regions of individuals chosen from a random-mating                   population. Connections with algorithms for estimating                          phylogenies of creatures whose traits are known in the present                  will be investigated.",
