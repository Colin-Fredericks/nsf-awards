 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will look into a                fundamental problem of importance in statistical mechanics today,               namely establishing connections between microscopic phenomena and               macroscopic phenomena.  More specifically, he will try to                       understand the relationship between microscopic laws that                       describe the interactions of many particles and macroscopic                     observables such as temperature that characterize the bulk                      properties of a phenomenon, in the context of quantum mechanics.                Part of the difficulty here lies in the fact that physicists                    cannot agree about what the microscopic laws are for the quantum                mechanical formalism.  The principal investigator will attempt to               establish such laws and then examine their phenomenological                     consequences in a rigorous fashion.                                                  An easily describable and observable phenomenon such as the                temperature of your morning cup of coffee is what physicists and                applied mathematicians call a \"macroscopic\" or bulk property of                 the coffee, that is, it is a measurable quantity that describes                 how hot or cold the liquid is, based upon some conventional                     scale.  The temperature however is actually governed by the                     collective behavior of the many molecules and atoms that are in                 ceaseless motion inside of the cup and that are governed by the                 \"microscopic\" laws of interaction.  In this proposal the                        principal investigator will examine the relationship between                    microscopic and macroscopic effects in the context of quantum                   mechanics, the ultimate theory of matter.",
