 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most research on manufacturing automation focuses on the                   derivation of fully automated control and scheduling techniques.                An alternative and more realistic paradigm to \"lights out\"                      automation is supervisory control; the design of manufacturing                  control and scheduling processes that explicitly integrate human                decision makers with underlying automation.  Supervisory control                designs the human-computer interaction in order to augment and to               extend the human's role and decision making effectiveness.  Neither             the goal nor the unintended side-effects of supervisory control are             to automate the human decision maker out of the system nor to                   reduce the human's role to a set of undesirable or ineffective                  tasks.  At the same time, supervisory control ameliorates the                   inherent limitations of flexibility in automated control.                            This research offers supervisory control as an                             alternative to the goal of full automation in manufacturing                     processes.  With supervisory control, the goal is to design into                the control process human functions that utilize human skills and               that enhance human effectiveness and overall system performance.                The research offers a three part approach to explore supervisory                control in advanced manufacturing systems:  first, the development              of an interactive, real-time, object-oriented manufacturing                     simulator; second, the development of modeling methods to                       prescribe/describe operators who control and troubleshoot                       manufacturing processes; and third, to use the operator models and              the object-oriented manufacturing simulator to systematically                   explore, with realistic manufacturing system dynamics, the                      integration of analytical methods and knowledge-based techniques,               effective designs for an on-line decision support system.",
