 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eukaryotic initiation factor 2, eIF, is an essential protein                    synthesis initiation factor that is subject to regulation by                    reversible phosphorylation.  As part of the cellular antiviral                  defense mechanism, an interferon-induced, dsRNA-dependent protein               kinase,eIF-2.-PKds, becomes activated on viral infection and                    phosphorylates the alpha subunit eIF-2.  This results in a                      limitation of functional eIF-2 available for protein synthesis with             a concomitant reduction of protein synthesis.  A number of animal               viruses, including vaccinia virus, have evolved mechanisms to                   inhibit the activation of eIF-2.-PKds in interferon-treated cells.              The ability of vaccinia virus to grow in interferon-treated cells               stems in part from the production of a vaccinia early gene product,             termed specific kinase inhibitory factor, SKIF, that prevents                   activation of eIF-2.-PKds.  In addition vaccinia virus encodes a                gene which has homology with the alpha subunit of eIF-2 and encodes             a 10 kDa protein.  Although the function of the eIF-2 alpha-like                gene is not known, an eIF-2 alpha-like peptide of approximately                 10 kDa accumulates early in vaccinia virus infection.                           The first aim of this proposal is to monitor the effect of vaccinia             virus infection on the levels and activation state of elF-2.-PKds,              as well as the phosphorylation state of elF-2. in vaccinia virus                infected Hela cells.  The reagents necessary to do this, antibody               to elF-2.-PKds and elF-2. are available.  The second aim of ths                 ptoposal is to investigate the function of pK2 and to determine                 whether its product has elF-2\u001a.-like activity and whether it is                 involved in the ability of vaccinia virus to grow in interferon-                treated cell.  The K2 gene has been cloned into the expression                  vector, pTM1, which will enable us to synthesize radiolabelled PK2              in vitro, as well to transfect the gene into mammalian cells.  The              gene will be transferred to a bacterial expression vector to allow              the production of milligram quantities of pK2 for biochemical                   analyses.  The properties of the vaccinia encoded elF-2.-like gene              product will be compared with those of cellular elF-2. with                     reference to its guanine nucleotide binding properties, its                     ability to enter preinitiation complexes, and its ability to                    function as a substrate for elF-2.-PKds.",
