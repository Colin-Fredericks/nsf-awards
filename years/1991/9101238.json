 "awd_abstract_narration": "Even though all aerobic organisms require molecular oxygen for                  survival, the release of activated oxygen species resulting both                from normal metabolism and environmental pollution can cause                    serious damage to the cell.  Enzymes such as the catalases, protect             plants from damage and the resulting reduction metabolic                        efficiency.  Since metabolic efficiency, particularly in leaves,                is a primary determinant of plant productivity, these enzymes are               of significant agrononic as well as scientific importance.  The                 ultimate objective of this research is to understand the roles of               the various catalases in both normal and stress-related metabolism.                                                                                             CAT3 is the most abundantly transcribed catalase gene in maize                  leaves, and the unusual timing of its expression implies an                     important, specific metabolic function early at night.  The goal                of this project is to clarify the metabolic role of this catalase,              and identify DNA sequences responsible for its novel light                      regulation.  Ultimately this research will allow the manipulation               of agronomically important plants to increase their resistance to               oxidative stress.",
