 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in applied                       mathematics between Dr. George Baker, Los Alamos National                       Laboratory and Professor P.R. Graves-Morris, Bradford                           University, West Yorkshire, England.  The objective of this                     investigation is to develop the theory and practice of                          approximation methods, based on Taylor series expansions                        which go beyond the first Riemann sheet.                                                                                                                        The proposed work will be based on approximations by the                        solution of differential equations.  The investigators will                     apply recently developed theoretical techniques, develop new                    ones and supplement them by numerical investigations.  The                      results of this research are expected to have wide applica-                     tions.  One case in point is the theory of critical phenomena,                  which has suffered from lack of methods to interpret adequately                 the complex singular structure at some of the harder critical                   points.  Both Dr. Baker and Dr. Graves Morris are established                   mathematical physicists, who have made important contributions                  to the theory of applications of Pade approximants.",
