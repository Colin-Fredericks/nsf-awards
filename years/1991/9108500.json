 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michael Herman is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and                 Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies                  on vibrational relaxation in liquids. He will apply                             path-integral Monte Carlo computer simulation techniques to the                 calculation of the relaxation rate for vibrational populations                  of small molecules in simple solvents.  He will continue to                     refine the methodology for conditioning of the highly                           oscillatory integrands which occur in real time discretized                     path integrals.  In the initial phase of the project only low                   lying vibrational excitations of diatomics in simple solvents                   will be considered.  After sufficient numerical experience has                  been gained from these systems, he will consider systems with                   highly vibrationally excited diatomics and polyatomics for                      which the full path integral theory is required.                                %%%                                                                             Theoretical studies of vibrational relaxation in liquids is                     important in the field of chemistry because the rate at which                   molecules gain and lose vibrational energy influences their                     rates of chemical reaction, their energy transport properties                   and their experimentally observed spectra.",
