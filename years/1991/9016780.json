 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in software                      engineering between Drs. John Guttag and Stephen Garland,                       Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Drs. Michel Bidoit                    and Christine Choppy, Laboratoire de Recherche Informatique,                    University of Paris-Sud, France. The investigators propose a                    joint project that will first work on combining Assegigue, a                    specification environment under development at the University                   of Paris-Sud, and LP, a theorem proving system under                            development at MIT. They will then experiment with using the                    combined system to develop and reason about specifications.                                                                                                     There is now widespread agreement that precise specifications                   can play a useful role in software development and maintenance.                 The most vexing problems in building systems deal with                          overall system organizations and the integration of components.                 Modularity is the key to controlling this, and specifications                   are essential for achieving modularity.  Both the US and                        French research groups have adopted a style of specification                    that emphasizes brevity and clarity rather than executability.                  To make it possible to test specifications without executing                    or implementing them, both groups have developed techniques                     that enable specifiers to make claims about logical properties                  of specifications.  However, whereas the French have centered                   their research around the technology needed to produce and                      manage large scale specifications, the MIT group has centered                   its research around the technology needed to check claims                       about logical properties of specification.  By combining these                  two complementary research efforts, the investigators plan to                   produce a tool that can be used to develop, reason about and                    manage large-scale formal specifications of software.",
