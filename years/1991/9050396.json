 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support establishment of a computer                      laboratory in which students use powerful software for                          interactive computational investigations and numerical                          experiments.  It is being funded under the Instrumentation and                  Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of                     supporting projects to develop new or improved instrument-based                 undergraduate laboratory courses in science, mathematics, or                    engineering.  The Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement                    Program provides matching support for the instrumentation                       necessary to implement undergraduate instructional improvements                 at U.S. colleges and universities.                                                   In particular, the main objective of this project is to                    bridge the gap between where the students currently are and where               the faculty are in their own professional use of computer                       hardware and software.  This will be done by restructuring the                  applied mathematics and numerical analysis sequences so as to                   include a computer laboratory that is based on student projects                 using MATLAB for interactive numerical investigations.",
