 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bladder function is controlled by spinal reflexes involving                spinal motoneurons, which connect to muscles in the periphery,                  and interneurons, which make their connections within the central               nervous system. The activity of these spinal neurons is                         coordinated by higher centers in the brain. The object of the                   present work by Drs. Collins and Erichsen is to identify and                    characterize these spinal motoneurons, both anatomically and                    physiologically. At present, little is known about these neurons,               particularly the spinal interneurons; this lack of knowledge is                 the result of the inability to identfy function-specific spinal                 interneurons and to establish their connections within the spinal               cord. Recently, the investigators of these studies have developed               both the electrophysiological and neuroanatomical techniques                    which will enable them to achieve this objective. The use of a                  multidisciplinary approach in this research will allow a more                   comprehensive examination and analysis of individual spinal                     neurons than would be possible with any single technique. The                   information obtained from these experiments will provide an                     essential database of the locations, functional identities, and                 synaptic connections of spinal interneurons involved in the                     control of bladder function.",
