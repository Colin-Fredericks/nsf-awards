 "awd_abstract_narration": "To effectively utilize the resources of parallel systems,                       transformations are necessarily applied by compilers to increase the            degree of parallelism in program code or to improve the efficiency of           exploiting parallelism.  However, the interactions among the                    transformations as well as the interactions between transformations             and scheduling are not well understood.  Guidelines for applying                transformations, ratios of the cost and benefit of the transformations          and the design of tools that operate on the transformed code have yet           to be adequately developed.  This research investigates these issues.           A unifying framework for parallelizing transformations and a set of             dependencies that is used to specify the conditions under which a               transformation may be safely applied.  The framework will be described          on two levels:  definitional, and operational.  Using the definitional          level of the framework, enabling and disabling interactions among the           transformations and between transformation and scheduling will be               studied.  The operational level of the framework will be employed in            the development and prototyping of tools that generate and support              transformed code, and in particular a transformation tool generator,            interface tools for the generator and resulting transformer, and a              symbolic bugger.  Costs and benefits of transformations will be                 investigated using the framework.  A set of guidelines will be                  developed for the application of transformations base on their                  interaction, costs, and benefits, taking into account scheduling                strategies, program structure, architecture, and resources available.           These tools will be designed to operate on any set of transformations           expressible in the framework.  The utility of the framework for user            defined tranformations will be investigated.  Throughout the work,              experimentation will be performed comparing the framework approach to           transformation with the traditional approach of hand-crafting                   transformations.",
