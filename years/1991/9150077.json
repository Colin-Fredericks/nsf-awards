 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project describes an in-depth case study of one science                    department of fifteen experienced traditionally-oriented teachers               as they undergo the process of large scale change from teaching                 the sciences as separate disciplines to a scheme of integrated,                 coordinated sciences to a target group of 1200 students (ages                   11-16) in the Comprehensive School in Newcastle upon Tyne,                      England.  Results from this study are expected to apply to our                  understanding of the use of diverse teaching strategies                         with mixed ability young people, tying school sciences as                       interdisciplinary.  (In some ways it is complementary to NSF                    projects in Scope Sequence and Coordination and Project 2061.)                                                                                                  This study has direct applications to the delivery of new curricula             in similar schools in the United States.  The Salter's Science                  curriculum which is the underpinning of the project has been                    developed in England and has aroused great interest here.  The                  PI, who is working closely with the head of the Chemistry                       Department and faculty from the Education Department of                         University of University of Alabama, will establish field test sites            here based on expressed interest by several US school districts.                The staff development, the management of change and other issues                will be addressed in the project results.                                                                                                                       UAB, University of York, Rutherford School and Tektronics                       Foundation are contributing cost-sharing equal to 76% of the NSF                request.",
