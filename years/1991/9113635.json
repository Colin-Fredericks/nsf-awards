 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gas-liquid drop interactions are usually not viewed as                     surface chemical reactions but considered as a sequence of mass                 transport processes followed by aqueous-phase homogeneous                       reactions.  The mechanisms and rate equations used to describe                  the aqueous reactions are those obtained from bulk solution                     measurements that are assumed to assumed to be directly                         applicable to dispersed systems such as clouds and fogs.  This                  project addresses the question of bulk vs. dispersed state                      chemistry in aqueous reactions of nitrogen dioxide in laboratory                clouds.  Its objective is to evaluate experimentally two working                hypotheses formulated to explain our previous results, which are                inconsistent with the conventional picture of nitrogen dioxide                  chemistry.  Our main findings are: (1) Nitrate forms rapidly when               nitrogen dioxide reacts with a laboratory cloud. (2) The nitrate                concentrations associated with subsaturated sodium chloride                     aerosol and especially with cloud drops substantially exceeds the               maximum level expected from scavenging the nitric acid impurity                 present in the nitrogen dioxide supply, i.e. there is a net                     production of aerosol or cloud water nitrate.  (3) The                          composition of cloud drops exposed to nitrogen dioxide is                       radically different from bulk water exposed to nitrogen dioxide                 from the same source.                                                                The first of our two hypotheses is that the observed vs.                   bulk differences are due to an intrinsic, possibly surface                      chemical, property of high surface-to-volume aqueous systems.                   The second is that the uptake of nitrogen dioxide and its                       conversion to nitrate ion in a dispersed aqueous system is                      strongly enhanced by trace amounts of nitric acid adsorbed on                   subsaturated aerosols, cloud drops, or aerosol particles that                   serve as cloud condensation nuclei.",
