 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integration of photonic devices has been the subject                            of much research interest in recent years due to its                            implications for optical communication systems.                                 However, the development of the fabrication                                     processes involved in photonic integration has not                              been trivial due largely to the diversity in functions                          and consequently modes of operation of various                                  photonic devices.  Because of these requirements,                               many photonic device structures have poor                                       compatibility for monolithic fabrication.  There is                             an important need to develop better large scale                                 manufacturable processes to facilitate photonic                                 integration.  We propose to investigate ion mixing                              as a process for planar integration of photonic                                 devices made of quantum-well and superlattice                                   structures.  As a processing technique, ion mixing                              offers many advantages: (i) the process can be                                  carried out at sufficiently low temperatures to allow                           for a self-aligned process, (ii) metallic ion masks for                         self-alignment purposes can serve as electrodes for                             devices, (iii) readily available noble gas ions are just                        as efficient as shallow dopant ions with similar                                atomic mass in causing disordering, and (iv)                                    judiciously chosen ions can be used to induce                                   disordering and to improve device isolation                                     simultaneously.  However, there are several issues                              that need to be resolved before ion-mixing becomes                              a useful process for photonic integration.  The first                           issue is to understand the mixing process at a                                  microscopic level so as to relate the intermixing of                            semiconductor materials and their properties such                               as bandgap, optical index, with or without strain                               involved.  The second has to do with the material                               damage caused by ion-irradiation which can affect                               both the transport and the optical properties.                                  Approaches to reduce this damage to a level                                     acceptable to photonic integration will be                                      investigated in this study.  The third issue is to                              study how ion-mixing can be used in the formation                               of laser waveguide, a critical component of photonic                            technology.  A fourth issue is to investigate the use                           of ion mixing in the improvement of heterojunction                              bipolar transistors.  To address these issues, the                              proposed program has the following objectives: (i)                              investigation of process control of ion mixing,                                 particularly the reduction of ion irradiation damage                            to a level acceptable for photonic devices, (ii) the                            planarization of devices by ion mixing with an initial                                                                                                                             (2)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          goal if fabricating planar stripe index guided lasers,                          and (iii) monolithic device integration by ion                                  mixing, driving toward modulator/laser and                                      laser/HBT integration.",
