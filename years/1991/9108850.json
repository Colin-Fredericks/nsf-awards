 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mission of the Integrated Electronics Engineering Center               (IEEC) will be four-fold:  (1) to support the integrated                        electronics industry of New York State with short-and long-range                research and development and planning efforts, (2) to disseminate               the results of research which will advance the leading edge of                  technology in the field, (3) to provide a technology transfer and               training program to enhance economic development in New York State,             and (4) to deliver a unique educational experience in integration               of electronics design and assembly at the undergraduate and                     graduate level.  The goals and objectives for IEEC can be                       classified into three areas of activities:  (1) research and                    development, (2) collaborative activities with industry, other                  academic institutions and government agencies, and (3) economic                 development, including business start-up and work force                         productivity and stability enhancement.                                              The organizational framework will include an Industrial                    Advisory Board (IAB) for formal liaisons with industry.                         Additionally, there will be a cadre of Project Liaisons from                    industry working directly with faculty researchers on each                      technical project.  The IAB has representatives from IBM, GE,                   Universal Instruments, the State's University Industry Public                   Partnership for Economic Growth (UnIPEG), and the Watson School of              Engineering.  The purpose of the IAB is to provide a collaborative              technical interaction between the Watson School and the Electronics             packaging industry, by establishing broader industrial consensus                on the most critical packaging topics, and by encouraging                       interdisciplinary activities among university researchers.                           Leading two-year academic institutions in the State will serve             as transmitters for amplifying the technology transfer mechanism                to other regions of the state.  Research results will be                        disseminated by: (i) reporting initially to IEEC members via                    regularly scheduled Center briefing sessions, followed by, (ii)                 publications or presentations in public forums, followed by, (iii)              training workshops open to any member of the public on a course fee             basis.  Additional courses will be offered at the undergraduate and             graduate level beyond those already provided by the Watson School               in electronics packaging.      Aside from the transfer of research              results directly to sponsors, there is the prospect of transfer in              the longer term to other firms through the active involvement of                faculty with state agencies, such as the University/Industry Public             Partnership for Economic Growth (UnIPEG) and their Industrial                   Technical Extension Service (ITES).  The Continuing Education                   Office of the Watson School will develop a number of short courses              related to the Center's implementation  retraining programs for the             local microelectronics industry at the level of the individual                  employee, thereby improving productivity and/or employment                      stability.  The State of New York, industry and NSF will provide                matching funds totalling $750,000 in the first year.",
