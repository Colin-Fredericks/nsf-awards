The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds               for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                      conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support                for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the                deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational                equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                        receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                          communication equipment including radio transceivers and                        satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                            communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                  for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                                                                                                   The Project Director, Joseph L. Coburn is fully qualified to                    direct this project having had considerable experience in                       overseeing similar activities.                                                                                                                                  This project will allow the institution to replace an ageing                    crane, obtain a winch base, radio direction finder and GPS for                  the OCEANUS; obtain a radar, GPS, speed log, intercom, HF                       receiver, EPIRB and liquid scintillation counter for the KNORR;                 upgrade telex communications for the ATLANTIS II; and replace the               shore base radio.",
