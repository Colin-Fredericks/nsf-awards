 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Schwartz's research is focused on two areas.  First,                        transition metal complexes will be bound to an oxide support                    which will then be a ligand environment for them by anchoring                   to prevent clustering of coordinatively unsaturated species,                    stabilizing high-oxidation states of the transition metal, and                  acting as a variable ligand in which basicity and availability                  of Lewis acid and hydroxylic sites can be adjusted.  These                      complexes will be probed by kinetic, structural and synthetic                   studies.  Second, early transition metal complexes will be                      studies for use as new synthetic reagents.  The focus will be                   on the catalytic conversion of hydroxy acids into lactones by                   use of oxotungsten compounds.  The preparation of oxide-bound                   zirconium species and comparisons to soluble analogs will also                  be carried out.                                                                 %%%                                                                             With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                 Division will support the research of Dr. Jeffry Schwartz of                    the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University.  The                       research is in the general area of synthetic methodology and is                 focused on the areas of transition metal reagents in organic                    synthesis.  The goals of the project are to find metal                          complexes which can perform specific transformations on organic                 substrates under mild conditions and in high yield.",
