The                      workshop, organized by Professor Thomas Morgan of Wesleyan                      University and Professor Carmen Cisneros, Director of the                       Institute of Physics at Cuernavaca, will serve to continue                      the research and collaboration momentum that was developed as                   a result of two earlier workshops held in 1981 and 1986 and                     to initiate new research directions in this field for the                       1990`s.                                                                                                                                                         Many body and many electron effects in atomic and molecular                     structure and in collisions have received considerable                          attention during the last several years, and there is much                      current interest in these topics within the atomic and                          molecular physics community.  Significant experimental and                      theoretical progress has been made in the last few years on                     electron correlation and on some few-body problems and an                       initial understanding of many important aspects is now at                       hand.  However, the field in nascent and with proper guidance                   and stimulation it is likely that, in the near future,                          research on the more complex attributes of few-body problems                    and of electron correlation, and their consequences in                          differing physical phenomena, will produce conclusions of                       wide generality.  An important focus of the proposed workshop                   is to identify common features present in a diverse network                     of experimental and theoretical data.  The workshop aims to                     provide an atmosphere that promotes and encourages open                         presentation of ideas and free discussion in order to search                    for and identify the most influential characteristics                           responsible for the diversity of many body and many electron                    phenomena.",
