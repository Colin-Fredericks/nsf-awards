 "awd_abstract_narration": "Necessary components will be purchased to construct an ultrasonic               resonance spectrometer.  The equipment will be used for several                 research projects involving the evaluation of the mechanical                    properties of materials, particularly the elastic constants.                                                                                                    The intended use of the apparatus is to measure the resonant                    frequencies of free vibration of materials of very small size that              have been manufactured or already exist in the shape of a                       parallelepiped, a sphere, or a cylinder.  Using numerical                       techniques that are currently being developed, approximations to                these frequencies are also evaluated using the theory of                        elasticity.  By comparing the measured frequencies with the                     calculated frequencies and minimizing the difference between these              values, optimal estimates can be obtained for the elastic                       constants.                                                                                                                                                      The measurements system will allow a wealth of material studies to              be completed and can be used to study any solid: metal, ceramic,                semiconductor, polymer, composite, and so on.  Other uses include               the effects of temperature and pressure on the elastic constants,               general structural vibration studies, and internal friction                     measurements.  The system possesses both scientific and practical               potentials, and will provide the opportunity to establish a new                 standard method for measuring material properties.",
