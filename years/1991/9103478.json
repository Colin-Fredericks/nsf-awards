 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research consists of two parts: (1) a study of the young                 extensional history of Bulgaria; and (2) application of fluid                   dynamic theory to the problem of lower crustal flow during                      continental deformation.  The Bulgarian component of the                        program consists of:  compilation of existing data on the                       structure, age, stratigraphy, etc. of features related to young                 extension in Bulgaria; regional correlation of extensional                      events with coeval events along the Hellenic trench system; and                 quantitative analysis gravity and topography data across young                  extensional features.  The goal of this portion of the study                    is to better understand the relationship of subduction and its                  driving forces to regional deformation in the upper                             lithosphere.  The problem of lower crustal flow during                          lithospheric deformation will be addressed by application of                    a variation of simple channel (or sheet) flow to simple two and                 three dimensional models of the deforming lithosphere with the                  ultimate goal of better understanding the coupling of crustal                   and mantle motions during continental deformation.                                The project combines an attempt to understand the basic                       tertiary evolutions of Bulgaria with an attempt to get a better                 theoretical handle on flow in the lower crust.  It also                         furthers VPW program objectives to provide opportunities for                    women to advance their careers in science or engineering                        through research, and to encourage other women to pursue                        careers in these areas through the investigators' enhanced                      visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In this                        project, the proposed activities which contribute to the second                 objective include:  presentation of a series of guest lectures,                 establishment of a weekly seminar/support group for female                      graduate students (and post-doctoral fellows), and counseling                   of female students in a department where there are currently                    no female faculty.",
