 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop and empirically test models of the                   location of production within countries, as a way of shedding                   light on the forces driving international trade and investment.                                                                                                 The theoretical part of the research will use models of                         imperfectly competitive markets in which there are increasing                   returns to scale to analyze the processes leading to geographical               concentration of production.  This will involve modeling both                   concentration at an aggregate level - the division of countries                 into densely populated \"core\" regions and less dense                            \"peripheries\" -and the emergence of high geographical                           concentration of the production of many manufactured goods and                  some services.  The models will borrow techniques from both the                 new trade theory and the new growth theory.  Key themes will be                 path dependence, i.e., dependence of eventual outcomes on initial               conditions, and the observation that the qualitative character of               economic geography depends in predictable ways on a few key                     economic parameters, such as transport costs, scale economies,                  and the nonagricultural share of employment.                                                                                                                    The empirical research will use US Census data and comparable                   data from other countries (especially Europe) to test these                     models and compare interregional with international                             specialization and trade.  A central project is to use US data to               compute indices of geographic concentration for a large number of               industries, and then to compare these indices with industry                     characteristics in order to discriminate between alternative                    explanations of concentration.  A second project will use                       historical evidence to test for the kinds of qualitative changes,               critical mass phenomena, and other nonlinear features predicted                 by the theoretical models.                                                                                                                                      This project is important because it attempts to integrate                      economic geography with international trade theory.  With this                  study, we will be better equipped to understand the likely                      effects of the 1992 economic integration in Europe and the US-                  Canada Free Trade Agreement.",
