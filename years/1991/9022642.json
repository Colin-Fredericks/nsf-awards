 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops an axiomatic intuitive learning model that                can be used as an alternative way of selecting an equilibrium                   from a class of dynamic games, where the conventional approach                  like strategic stability is often ineffective.  The conventional                rational expectations equilibrium is often ineffective because it               is founded on a strong \"rationality\" assumption.  Each economic                 agent must perfectly foresee all others' strategies and beliefs                 without prior communication or coordination.  One alternative to                the conventional approach is called \"rationalizability\".  The                   rationalizability literature develops solution concepts that are                intuitively more plausible than the conventional approach, but                  admit too many outcomes to be an effective solution concept.                    Another alternative is to develop axiomatic learning models with                very specific assumptions about the behavior of individual                      economic agents.  The contribution of this project comes from                   developing axiomatic learning models that capture the intuition                 of rationalizability and make precise predictions about the                     outcome of economic problems.                                                                                                                                   The project develops an axiomatic intuitive learning theory and                 uses it to generalize the Coase theorem for durable good                        monopolists, an important economic theorem about monopoly                       behavior.  The theory is also used to determine the conditions                  under which learning will lead to cooperation.  Finally, the                    results obtained in the first two parts of the project will be                  applied to  alternating offer bargaining models, bargaining where               each party can stop the learning process once and for all by                    accepting the offer.",
