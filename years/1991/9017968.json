 "awd_abstract_narration": "Taphonomic alteration of foraminifera from Quaternary                      siliciclastic deposits in the northern Gulf of California will be               quantified through field and laboratory studies of test resistance              to abrasion, dissolution, bioerosion, and transport.  The close                 juxtaposition of Holocene and Pleistocene deposits will allow the               evaluation of those processes involved in the transformation from               living foraminiferal biotas through near-surface sediment                       assemblages to preserved fossil assemblages.  The benefits from                 such an approach include:  1) The identification of test                        morphotypes which predominate within assemblages accumulating under             particular environmental regimes.  2) Testing of the preservability             of taphonomic signatures.  3) When combined with data on the                    relative abundances of living species and test production rates,                the determination of the relative contributions of population                   dynamics and taphonomic processes to the formation of sediment                  assemblages.  4)The determination of test characteristics which                 confer resistance to destruction has important evolutionary                     implications and should lead to the better understanding of the                 morphological constraints on inhabiting particular environments.                The above information will be integrated with that obtained                     previously from Holocene carbonate environments at Jamaica,                     resulting in the development of broadly encompassing taphofacies                models for microfossil assemblages.  As these models are based upon             test morphotypes, rather than particular species, they should be                applicable to numerous environments and time intervals.",
