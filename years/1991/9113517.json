 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Raymond Thompson, Ms Jenny Adams will                collect data for her doctoral dissertation in Anthropology.  She                will continue her study of prehistoric ground stone implements to               gain insight into the functions which they served.  Employing                   concepts derived from tribology she will replicated tools used by               prehistoric Southwestern U.S. groups and employ them in different               tasks such as grinding corn, seeds and bone.  These will be                     repeated with different types of lithic raw material.  The polish               and abrasion which results on the stone surfaces will be examined               with both macro and microscopic techniques in an attempt to match               use with wear type.  Preliminary work with sandstone implements                 has yielded positive results.  In conjunction with this research,               Ms Adams will review the ethnographic literature to determine the               range of uses to which ground stone implements have been put.                   She will also use the experimental results to analyze a large                   series of prehistoric tools recovered in archaeological                         excavations of the Point of Pines site.                                                                                                                         Over the last several decades, archaeologists have made great                   strides in the analysis of flaked stone artifacts.  Through study               of edge damage and experimental replication, they have determined               the uses to which many prehistoric tools were put and these                     insights have permitted more detailed reconstructions of                        technology and lifestyle.  Almost no work, however, has been done               on ground stone even though such artifacts are routinely                        recovered in many parts of the world.  Ms Adam's project will                   help to fill this gap.                                                                                                                                          This research is important for several reasons.  It will develop                a methodological tool which will be used by archaeologists in                   many different situations.  It will provide new insight into                    prehistoric Southwest adaptations and will assist in the training               of a promising young scientist.",
