 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to support a graduate student for two years               to thoroughly research the Indonesian geodetic archives of the                  Dutch period in West Java and the archives of the Netherlands                   Geodetic Commission in Delft, and to perform a strain analysis                  across the Great Sumatran Fault System using historical                         triangulation data located in these archives and ongoing GPS                    measurements.  This work will be coordinated with two Indonesian                colleagues who will also be using the triangulation and GPS data                as part of their doctoral studies.  These data will provide                     important constraints on the decoupling of oblique convergence                  west of Sumatra into subduction normal to the margin between the                Indian-Australian and Eurasian plates and right-lateral faulting                parallel to it.  Specifically, this comparison will enable us to                measure horizontal strain rates both along the Sumatran fault to                outline sections of differing fault behavior and far from the                   \"fault, in the southwest to constrain the partitioning os shear\"                \"throughout the forearc, and in the northeast to study the                      accumulation of elastic strain across the Sumatran Fault system.                In addition, these data will provide valuable information on                    earthquake-and fault-related processes in this very seismically                 active region.  These data are particularly valuable since the                  Dutch often resurveyed parts of the triangulation network after                 earthquakes.",
