 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of the hydrogeochemistry of layer 2 of the oceanic crust                are of primary importance for gaining a more thorough                           understanding of alteration reactions occurring in the crust and                geochemical fluxes associated with exchange between the ocean and               layer 2. In both cases the composition of the fluids trapped in                 layer 2 as formation waters is critical to modelling and flux                   calculations. Ocean drilling allows such fluids to be directly                  sampled. Unfortunately, the drilling process often disturbs the                 fluids in a hole requiring a sampling plan that involves a return               to the site after the fluids have come to equilibrium. Although                 such return visits have been done by the drillship itself, other                techniques are being perfected to allow return sampling by                      submersible (France) and by regular research vessels (United                    States).                                                                                                                                                        The present award will continue support to Dr. Gieskes for such                 studies. He has recently participated with the French in a re-                  entry program in the Atlantic. Funds in the this award will                     support analyses and publication of the results from this cruise.               Additionally, he will undertake the design of a new sampler to be               deployed in drillholes from a re-entry vehicle under construction               at Scripps Institution. This system will deploy the samplers                    from a vehicle navigated on a cable from a surface vessel,                      eliminating the need for a costly submersible or drillship.",
