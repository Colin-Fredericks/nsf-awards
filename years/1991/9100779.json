Ten                                undergraduates will participate with at most four from                          Rensselaer and six from other, primarily undergraduate and                      women, institutions in the Northeast.  Candidates will be                       sought from all fields of science and engineering and they                      will have completed their junior year, although a few                           sophomores may be admitted under special circumstances.                              Regularly scheduled seminars and social functions during                   the summer will provide contact between the participants, as                    well as faculty.  In addition, the research groups hold weekly                  meetings, which discuss technical issues of the experiments or                  modeling studies.",
