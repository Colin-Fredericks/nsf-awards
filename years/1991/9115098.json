With                                 several networks interacting with each other they                               come somewhat closer to brainlike activities than                               do most other models.  There are risks, however, in                             this approach, as there are heuristic aspects of the                            formulas to be implemented and it is impossible to                              rigorously analyze the performance of these                                     heuristic due to the massive parallel and nonlinear                             nature of the networks.  This research will involve                             computational experiments with various problems                                 that are easily (either analytically or                                         computationally) solvable using conventional                                    dynamic programming to evaluate the potential,                                  and problems, of adaptive critic methods.",
