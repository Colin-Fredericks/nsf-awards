 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in enzyme biochemistry                 between William Stahl of the University of Washington in                        Seattle and Marta Antonelli of the Institute of Cellular                        Biology in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  The study will examine                     the role of specific sequences of isoforms of the catalytic                     subunit of the Na,K-ATPase in ouabain binding.  One important                   goal is to establish whether the C-terminus of the catalytic                    subunit is intracelular or extracellular.  In addition, a                       long term goal is to establish localization of isoforms with                    different ouabain binding characteristics by light microscope                   immunocytochemistry.  Dr. Antonelli has support for this work                   at the Institute through collaboration with its Director,                       Jorge Saavedra's immunocytochemistry group.  The have                           extensive experience in light and electron microscope                           immunocytochemistry.  Their methodologies have been utilized                    by Dr. Stahl in his laboratory.                                                                                                                                 The collaboration will provide an opportunity to make use of                    the excellent facilities in Argentina for localization of the                   Na,K-ATPase isoforms to provide insight into the structure of                   the cardiac glycoside binding site in different isoforms of                     the catalytic subunit.  This is complementary to studies in                     Seattle on expression of mRNAs coding for isoforms with high                    and low affinities for cardiac glycosides.  Brought together                    in this collaboration, these efforts will provide a broader,                    more comprehensive approach to understanding functional                         aspects of Na,K-ATPases.",
