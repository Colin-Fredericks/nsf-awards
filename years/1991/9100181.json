 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will complete ongoing investigations of the role of                dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in oceanic carbon cycles.  Speci-                fically, radiocarbon (14C) and stable carbon isotope (13C) ratios               will be measured in two DOC pools:  the fraction oxidized by                    ultraviolet (uv) radiation, and the fraction oxidized by high-                  temperature (HT) combustion.  These isotopic signatures, coupled                with total DOC concentrations (uv and HT) and the 14C, 13C and                  15N signatures of sinking and suspended particulate organic                     carbon pools, will further our understanding of the sources and                 rates of cycling of dissolved organic matter in the oceans.                                                                                                     Isotopic signatures (14C, 13C) and total concentrations will be                 completed for DOC in seawater samples collected in the north                    central Pacific gyre, the Sargasso Sea, and the Santa Monica                    Basin off Southern California.  Additional measurements will be                 made on samples to be collected in the Amazon River plume and                   from an open-ocean station in the northeast Pacific off Point                   Conception, California.  These latter measurements will be in                   conjunction with E. Druffel, WHOI, and J. Bauer, Florida State                  University.                                                                                                                                                     It is also planned to confirm the DOC-HT 14C measurements by                    other oxidation techniques, such as ultrasonication and Hg(II)                  complexation of chloride ion coupled with uv irradiation.                                                                                                       The goals of this project are directly related to those of the                  U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS).",
