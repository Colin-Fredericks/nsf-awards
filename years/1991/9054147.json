 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the workshops is to demonstrate the utility of                   computer algebra, to allow the participants hands-on experience                 using computer algebra, and to provide a forum for the creation and             exchange of materials developed for various mathematics courses.                An additional purpose of the workshops is to disseminate the                    information and materials gained from two years of experience in                using the computer algebra laboratory which was partially funded                by the NSF ILI Program. The workshops are designed for instructors              of undergraduate mathematics.  Participants learn to use the                    computer algebra system, Maple, and have access to a computer at                all times during the workshop.  Participants are expected to                    produce curricular materials relating to their own areas of                     expertise and all material is shared during and at the end of the               workshops.  A network is being formed for the purpose of sharing                materials produced by the participants subsequent to the workshops,             and to ensure continued communication between participants. //",
