 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will attempt to determine the essential                         properties of the coronal force field and its interaction with                  circumsolar dust, including ion drag and Coulomb drag from the                  solar wind plasma, sudden orbital changes during coronal mass                   ejections, interaction of the local magnetic field with the                     electric charge on the dust particles, and orbital changes due to               evaporation and sputtering.  These studies will attempt to                      determine whether these orbital changes give rise to the observed               dust \"rings\" around the sun, and how the distribution of dust                   relates to solar activity.  These relationships will allow                      observations of F-coronal dust, such as those to be carried                     aboard the Solar Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft, to be used                as an indicator of the coronal plasma environment.  Numerical                   simulations of the dynamical evolution of dust particles released               from comets and asteroids will be carried out.  These                           computations will form the basis for identifying the source                     distribution of coronal dust.  Calculations of the force field in               the F-corona, and the numerical techniques and analytical                       solutions developed and refined here, will provide powerful tools               in a wide range of non-Keplerian dynamical problems, such as                    cometary dynamics and disintegration, planetary accretion,                      stability of asteroidal satellite  orbits, and interrelations                   between the distribution of dust and solar activity.  This work                 also relates to studies outside the solar system, including stars               with dust envelopes, plasma-dust interactions in flare stars, and               dust escaping stellar systems into the interstellar medium.",
