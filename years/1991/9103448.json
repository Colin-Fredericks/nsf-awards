 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to transfer techniques for mitotic labeling                  of DNA sequences for light and electron microscopy to both                      meiotic chromosomes and nuclei.  \"Labeling\" will include                        replication labeling with BrdU of zygotene DNA (zygDNA) semi-                   conservative replication and pachytene (PDNA) repair synthesis.                 In situ hybridization of L1 and B2 sequences which hybridize                    to G- and R-bands, respectively, offer an opportunity to \"band\"                 pachytene chromosomes so that they can be individually                          identified and the relative involvement of R- and G-chromatic                   in synapsis and recombination can be directly studied.  The                     research will significantly increase the resolution of meiotic                  studies, provide powerful new tools for study of 3-D                            arrangement of chromatic within presynaptic nucleic to provide                  an understanding of how homologous chromosomes \"find\" one                       another.  In addition, it will allow study of the role of                       specific DNA sequences in initiation and progression of                         synapsis and recombination while determining where these                        sequences are located with respect to R- and G-bands of                         mammalian chromosomes.                                                            The project focuses upon gene making and chromosome                           structure.  It furthers VPW program objectives to provide                       opportunities for women to advance their careers in science or                  engineering through research, and to encourage other women to                   pursue careers in these areas through the investigators'                        enhanced visibility as role models on the host campuses.  In                    this project, the proposed activities which contribute to the                   second objective will include:  developing and coordinating a                   series of guest lectures by women in genetics, jointly                          sponsored by the Department of Human Genetics and the Office                    for Women in Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, with                 time allocated for female graduate students to meet with the                    lecturers and discuss careers in science; teaching a graduate                   course on Meiosis and on Chromosomes, Speciation, and                           Evolution; and participating in the departmental Journal Club                   presentations by faculty, and the Recombination Journal Club,                   as well as other departmental activities, including the yearly                  departmental retreat for students and faculty.",
