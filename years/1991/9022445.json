 "awd_abstract_narration": "This instrumentation award is for equipment to start a laboratory               in computer vision and image processing.  The research projects                 include projects on face recognition, image algebra, and digital                image processing for end-to-end systems.  The face recognition                  problem involves studying issues in detection, identification,                  classification, and analysis of human faces.  The image algebra                 research aims to develop the necessary efficient implementations of             algebraic operations necessary to perform common image processing               tasks such as magnification, shrinking, and connected component                 labeling.  The digital processing in end-to-end systems consists of             the necessary algorithms to obtain high quality images in the                   presence of noise form components such as lens and transmission                 lines.                                                                                                                                                          Research in vision encompasses a broad array of tasks.  This                    research project addresses three such tasks; face recognition,                  image algebra, and digital image processing in end-to-end systems.              Face recognition is an important problem with security                          applications.  It is a task that humans are particularly good at                and yet has proven very hard to computerize.  Work in image algebra             is useful in defining operations common to visual processing tasks.             Such tasks include the magnification, rotation, and labeling of                 image regions.  The implementations of these operations should be               as efficient as possible.  The processing of images using digital               techniques involves the use of many devices that may introduce                  noise or be subject to measurement errors.  These include the                   device that measures the intensity and color of the image, any                  lenses involved in the capture of the image, and transmission                   lines.  Each of these can be treated separately, but the proper                 treatment is to consider the system as a whole as a means to obtain             the highest quality images.",
