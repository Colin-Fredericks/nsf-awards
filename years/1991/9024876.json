 "awd_abstract_narration": "They propose a scheme to construct and characterize the structure               and properties of polymer grain boundaries in a controlled manner.              The essential idea is to carefully and systematically establish the             influence of well-defined, specific grain boundary defects on the               physical properties of polymers.                                                                                                                                Conventionally processed crystalline polymers have small                        crystallites (10-20 nm), which implies a large defect density in                the solid state.  Although this means that structural defects play              an important or even dominant role in polymer systems, it also                  makes it difficult to isolate the effect of a particular devect on              a macroscopically observed property.  However, the development of               solid-state and thin-film polymerization mechanisms have                        facilitated the synthesis of highly organized and ordered polymers.             These systems provide a unique opportunity to isolate and                       investigate in detail the structure of covalently bonded solids                 near defects and the effect of these defects on the properties of               the material.                                                                                                                                                   They will examine structure-property relationships in                           poly(diacetylene) thin films and crystals.  They describe                       procedures for growing  crystals of diacetylene monomers, joining               these together to make a grain boundary, and then polymerizing                  through the grain boundary by exposure to Co60 radiation.  With this            approach it will be possible to prepare \"polymer bicrystals\".  A                simple scheme for measuring the photoconductive response of these               bicrystals will be used, a transport property which should depend               on the structure of the boundary.  Structural characterization                  involving X-ray scattering and Transmission Electron Microscopy                 (TEM) will be also carried out.",
