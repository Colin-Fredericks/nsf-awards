 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brachylaena (Compositae) is a woody, dioecious genus of thirteen                species; it is distinct from other members of the Compositae and                is considered to represent a monophyletic assemblage.  Five of                  the species of Brachylaena are endemic to Madagascar and the                    Mascarene Islands while eight species are confined to the                       continent of Africa.  The PIs propose to test some of the                       proposed origins and affinities of the Madagascar Flora using                   Brachylaena as an exemplar.  The genus is distributed between the               two regions and it is widespread on the Island of Madagascar,                   suggesting an ancient affinity.  Several taxonomic problems such                as intergrading morphological forms have been recognized in the                 genus therefore, it is proposed that an initial phenetic analysis               be carried out to establish the limits of the groups.  The groups               obtained from this analysis will then be compared                               electrophoretically to determine the genetic variation within and               among populations of individual species and to estimate the                     genetic divergence among species of the genus.  Only two                        chromosome counts have been made for the genus but it appears                   from these that at least one of the species is tetraploid.  In                  addition to phenetics and electrophoresis, an analysis of                       restriction site data from chloroplast DNA will be undertaken in                order to produce a phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus.  This                 will be compared to a cladogram generated from morphology.  The                 distribution of Brachylaena, with certain species restricted to                 the continent of Africa and others endemic to Madagascar, will                  make it possible to discuss the evolution of this group in the                  context of the two regions and to relate this to known geological               events.  Furthermore, aspects of the biology and distribution of                this genus (i.e., woody, dioecious and tropical) make it an                     interesting and important group in which to study genetic                       variation within and among populations.",
