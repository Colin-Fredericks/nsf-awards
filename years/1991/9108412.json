 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the problem of writing parallel programs that            are simultaneously clear, portable, and efficient.  The initial focus           is on MIMD multiprocessors, including various shared memory and                 distributed memory architectures.  The approach separates the                   expression of a parallel algorithm from the machine-dependent details           that are necessary to achieve good performance.  A programmer first             writes an algorithm in a classic, explicitly parallel style assuming            there is unlimited concurrency and that objects are shared.  This               basic algorithm is then annotated with scheduling directives and data           mappings to yield an efficient program.  The annotations thus affect            the performance of the algorithm on a given architecture but they do            not affect its correctness.  A new, object-oriented programming                 language that supports this method has been developed.  This project            is refining the language and approach by examining additional parallel          computing problems, conducting experiments to assess its performance,           and determining the extent to which this approach can be applied to             existing languages and to SIMD architectures.",
