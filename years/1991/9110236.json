 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental question in macroeconomics is how should fiscal and               monetary policy be set, both on average, and in response to                     business cycle shocks.  This question is addressed in                           quantitative, general equilibrium models of business                            fluctuations.  This project studies models with shocks to                       technology and government consumption, models of nominal wage                   contracting and models with heterogeneous agents.  Models are                   also analyzed in which the government cannot commit to its future               policies.  The optimal policies in these models provide                         quantitative guidance on how fiscal and monetary policy should be               conducted over the business cycle.  For example, the results will               indicate how big the government deficit should be and how                       stimulative monetary policy should be in a recession.                                                                                                           Economic growth rates are substantially affected by the rate of                 adoption of new technologies and the rate of displacement of old                ones.  Typically, there is a long lag between the availability of               a new technology and the time when its use becomes widespread.                  This phenomenon is known as diffusion.  This project examines                   some of the principal factors determining the rates of diffusion                of technology.  The research provides a deeper understanding of                 the forces determining growth, the diffusion of new technologies                and the decay of old ones.                                                                                                                                      The properties of models of the monetary transmission mechanism                 are also investigated.  This part of the project should improve                 our understanding of the key features of the interest rate,                     output and employment effects of monetary shocks.",
