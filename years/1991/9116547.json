 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work contributes to scientific data processing technology                  through the development of an extensible toolkit of database                    operators to capture, clean and manipulate scientific data, and                 through the study of mechanisms for interactive, real-time                      scientific processing, such as parallelization and flow control.                This work builds on the experience of the research team in                      gathering and processing spacecraft data and in developing                      extensible database technologies as part of the Volcano project.                The team includes a graduate student in computer science who has                worked extensively at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space                  Physics (LASP) of the University of Colorado on spacecraft                      operations and data management projects.  The focus of this                     project is on the development of new database technologies which                can be accomplished by combining real-time and database query                   processing techniques.  The key results of this work will                       include:  (1) techniques for enhancing the responsiveness of                    database query operations, (2) tools to enable a scientist to                   capture and process huge amounts of scientific data such as those               received from a spacecraft, and to process these data                           interactively, and (3) an extensible toolkit of database                        operations (such as capture, clean, relate, manipulate, and                     display scientific data sets) to facilitate analysis of the                     complex data sets required to understand complex scientific                     issues such as global ozone depletion.",
