The program consists of an intensive \"hands-              on\" laboratory research experience performed under the guidance of              working scientists expert in amy of the traditional and modern                  areas of biological sciences.  It is designed to provide students               with their first exposure to the actual practice of scientific                  research in the hopes that the excitement and challenge of the                  enterprise will convince them to consider basic research in the                 sciences as a viable career choice.  In the spring each student is              matched with a research project proposed by a preceptor with an                 active research program in the students stated area of interest.                Upon acceptance, each student is provided with a reading list of                current publications in the selected area to provide the background             required for the proposed summer research project.  During the                  Program students are:  1) acquainted with current issues in                     biological research; 2) provided with the opportunity to acquire                and practice valuable scientific techniques and skills, many of                 which can be utilized in their future endeavors; 3) required to                 work independently toward their research goals; 4) encouraged in                cross disciplinary approaches to their projects by providing                    opportunities for interaction with other students and the whole of              the research staff at the Foundation; and 5) mentored in an                     educational setting which is maximally challenging and thus,                    fosters each student's exploration of future career choices in                  science.  In addition to the required written report detailing the              progress made in their individual research projects, each student               presents a short oral report to the Faculty and public summarizing              the results of their effort at a closing convocation and award                  ceremony.",
