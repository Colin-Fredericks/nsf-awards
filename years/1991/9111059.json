 "awd_abstract_narration": "In western democracies and, in particular, in the United States,                policy outcomes are functions of the interaction of the separate                executive and legislature.  Policy decisions are reflections of the             partisan and ideological composition of the two branches.  In this              context, divided government occurs as a result of voters' desire                to create checks and balances by moderating an executive controlled             by one party or point of view against a legislature dominated by                another party or perspective.                                                                                                                                   This sophisticated research explores several theoretical and                    empirical issues with respect to the growing trend toward divided               government both in the United States and in various other                       democratic nations.  First,  the research will examine the effects              on presidential candidates of knowing the policy composition of the             legislature.  Second, the study will consider the effects of                    divided government on the propensity toward and success of third                parties.  Third, the possibility that voter turnout may be used as              a moderating devise will be explored.  Finally, the robustness of               the results will be evaluated by examining the dynamics of divided              government in other countries, specifically in france.                                                                                                          When completed this research should greatly increase our                        understanding of the causes and consequences of divided government              in the United States.  It also should and provide valuable                      information on the operation of institutional checks and balances               that will be of use not only in the United States but especially                in new democracies as they make decisions about the types of                    institutions to develop.
