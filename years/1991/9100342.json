 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program has transformed                itself from a loosely-affiliated collection of sites to an                      integrated network.  Recent accomplishments include: equipment                  and software standardization; creation of an effective electronic               networking system; standardization in data collection and                       management; collaboration in ecological research including multi-               site experiments, and comparative analyses and syntheses                        addressing major ecological issues; development of the                          infrastructure for support of intersite activities; major efforts               to identify appropriate technologies and to train LTER scientists               in their application; and creation of long-term plans                           identifying network goals and action programs.  Collectively the                LTER Network has expanded its focus to include larger spatial                   dimensions (regional and global) in its long term research and                  assumed a leadership role in ecological research related to                     global change.                                                                                                                                                  The networked activity of LTER has allowed scientific                           collaboration that has spread far beyond the formal LTER Network.               This interest in collaboration with and by the larger ecological                community, and other research organizations and agencies, has led               to increased requests for the Network Office to provide research                coordination and communications not only within LTER, but to the                larger ecological community.  The LTER electronic mail forwarding               system developed at the Network Office, has been particularly                   effective in providing a simple means of rapid communication and                data exchange for ecologists.                                                                                                                                   This project will support the activities which facilitate                       collaborative research in the LTER Network.  Most of the                        resources will be used to support the infrastructure of the                     organized, electronically-linked group of ecological scientists                 working on multi-site research and synthesis within and beyond                  the formal LTER program.  Proposed activities include: (1)                      Development of on-line, long-term data bases, and operation and                 expansion of electronic networking; (2) Acquisition, archiving,                 and analytic use of an array of remote sensing imagery for the                  LTER sites; (3) Maintenance of the facilitating infrastructure                  and publication program associated with the Coordinating                        Committee and Network Office; and (4) Increased involvement with                other long-term research programs both domestically (e.g.,                      sponsored by agencies such as DOE, USDA, and USGS) and                          internationally.  Research and development efforts by the Network               staff will occur in areas of database management, remote sensing,               and geographic information systems.",
