 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sensory transduction is the process by which a receptor cell                    becomes activated physiologically in response to a particular                   stimulus.  In the olfactory system, some stimuli trigger the                    generation inside the cell of a class of molecule called a second               messenger, in this case a compound called inositol triphosphate,                IP3.  Recent experiments suggest this IP3 in turn binds to a                    protein in the cell membrane, and that protein then functions to                change the flow of ions through the membrane, and activate the                  cell by depolarizing it.  This IP3 receptor protein is thus a key               component of olfactory transduction, but relatively little is                   currently known about it.  This pilot Small Grants for                          Exploratory Research (SGER) project will utilize molecular                      biological techniques, instead of the more usual biochemical                    approach, to isolate clones of the receptor, for further                        biochemical and physiological analyses of the protein and                       its role.  The molecular approach promises a high yield of                      characterized protein.  If successful with this novel approach,                 the impact will be on cell biology in general, since IP3 is                     important in several membrane functions in addition to its                      central role in olfactory sensory transduction.",
