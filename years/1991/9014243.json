 "awd_abstract_narration": "In electromagnetic and optical propagation analysis,                            the forward problem denotes the calculation of fields                           and waves given the parameters of the media.  The                               inverse problem is to calculate the target or media                             parameters from given or measured fields and waves.                             In the past, study of the forward problem has been                              done extensively.  However there is a relative lack of                          systematic investigation of the electromagnetic and                             optical inverse problems because of the highly                                  nonlinear relations between fields and the media                                parameters.  With the use of recent Artificial Neural                           Networks (ANN), we have been successful in                                      developing efficient and speedy algorithms to solve                             nonlinear inverse problems in fields and waves.                                 Specifically we propose to apply and develop ANN                                algorithms and query learning techniques for the                                study of the following:                                                                                                                                         1.  Inverse problems in microwave and optical                                   scattering in remote sensing of agriculture and ice                             and snow will be investigated.  Multiple scattering                             effects of discrete random media and rough surfaces                             will be included.  The ANN algorithms and query                                 learning techniques will be applied to both synthetic                           data as well as satellite and aircraft remote sensing                           measurements.                                                                                                                                                   2.  Fast acquisition of design parameters in the                                parametric frequency selective surface designs based                            on neural network inversion will be investigated.                               Constrained inversion for iterative acquisition of                              2D/3D surfaces using bitmap representations will be                             included.  These techniques will also be applied to                             identify new surface elements that will provide                                 unconventional frequency responses.",
