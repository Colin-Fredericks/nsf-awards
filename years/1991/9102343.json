 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop fast algorithms for                the optimal feedback control of general continuous time                         stochastic dynamical systems.  These stochastic dynamical systems               include perturbations by both Gaussian and Poisson white noise.                 The computational treatment of the optimal feedback control of                  general, nonlinear, stochastic differential equations with Markov               noise in continuous time, including Poisson noise, is a                         particularly unique feature of this project.  The algorithms are                being tested on multi-state resource models, but are applicable                 to a wide variety of applications.  The numerical approach                      directly treats the partial differential equation of stochastic                 dynamic programming.  New data structures and algorithms, such as               finite element and multigrid methods, will be developed to                      alleviate both memory and computation intensive demands from the                \"curse of dimensionality\".  Purely parallel methods are being                   developed for scalable, massively parallel processors and massive               memory supercomputers.  Results give the optimal feedback control               variables and the expected optimal performance index in terms of                state variables and time.  Large scale scientific computing is                  essential for managing the computational and memory demands in                  the optimal control of large applications, such as aerospace                    dynamics, flexible structures, resources, economics and robotics.                                                                                               The implementation of advanced computational techniques, such as                parallelization, vectorization and optimal data structures, make                it possible to solve problems of larger dimension.",
