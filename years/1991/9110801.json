 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water quality and fisheries resources are dependent on the                 dynamics species interactions within fresh water lakes, yet                     little is known about how warmer temperatures (>25 C), in                       conjunction with food abundance, affect interactions of aquatic                 species.  This research will explore interactive effects of                     elevated water temperature, up to 30 C, and food abundance on                   species interactions in a model planktonic food web.  This three                trophic-level food web includes a primary producer, 2 crustacean                grazers, and one predator, each can be easily cultured or                       maintained in the laboratory.  Effects of temperature, food                     abundance, and interactions of these conditions will be evaluated               using a series of single and two-species experiments performed on               members of the first two trophic level.  Populations growth rates               of the primary producer, loss rates caused by each grazer                       species, and the fecundity and survival of each grazer will be                  evaluated in different temperature/food abundance treatments.                   Results of experiments will be used to parameterize a simulation                model which will project the outcome of species interactions                    under a wide variety of environmental conditions,  Subsequent                   research will test these predictions, extend the model to include               3 trophic levels, and investigate how rapidly cladoceran grazers                evolve in response to thermal selection pressures.  Results will                1) aid in biotic assessments of elevated temperature, 2)                        establish a model food web for evaluating environmental effects                 on species dynamics, and 3) allow evaluation of the relative                    magnitude of higher order interactions in communities that are                  environmentally stressed.",
