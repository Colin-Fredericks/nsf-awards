 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses acoustic impedance dynamics in porous                   material.  It continues work initiated on an earlier project                    which investigated the properties of flexible porous frames                     consisting of very long, very fine, man made fibers.  In this                   project, the effort is broadened to include a wider variety of                  porous materials, and a wide range of sound intensity levels.                   Work includes studies both of bulk properties and surface                       properties.  The research falls under three disciplinary headings               including (1) a comprehensive study of consolidated porous frame                dynamics using a new apparatus of special design, (2) further                   study of interactions between frame motion and fluid motion in                  the pores at high intensity levels, and (3) developing a better                 theoretical model for the frame that can account for a variety of               phenomena including internal resonances.  The ultimate objective                is to improve the understanding of the bulk properties of porous                materials in air in order to improve the design of porous                       materials and configurations for specific purposes such as noise                control.",
