 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks general psychological laws that can be                      understood as adaptations to universal characteristics of the                   world in which we have evolved.  Universal characteristics of our               world include, for example, the following:  Space is three-                     dimensional and Euclidean.  Objects have inherent properties that               persist over time despite variations in their momentary                         positions, conditions of illumination, etc.  Objects belonging to               a significant natural category, although differing somewhat among               themselves, tend to be similar enough to each other to form a                   compact region (having some location, size, and shape) in the                   abstract \"space\" of possible objects.                                                                                                                           Examples of psychological principles that can be shown to be                    adaptive in a world with such characteristics include the                       following three:  First, certain particular motions of an object                in space are psychologically favored in the sense that those                    motions (a) are judged simplest or most natural when physically                 presented, (b) are most likely to be experienced in the visual                  illusion of \"apparent\" motion, which arises when one object is                  suddenly caused to disappear and immediately to reappear in a                   different position, or (c) are most likely to be imagined when                  two similar objects in different positions must be compared                     mentally with respect to shape.  Second, colors have three                      degrees of freedom in the sense that any given color can be                     matched by adjusting just three knobs on a suitable color-mixing                apparatus.  Third, the probability that a response learned to one               stimulus will generalize to another stimulus decays uniformly                   according to an exponential function of the (properly defined)                  degree of difference between those two stimuli, while the time                  required to make a discriminative response indicating that the                  two stimuli are different decays according to a different,                      reciprocal (or hyperbolic) function of that difference.  Such                   laws cannot find their ultimate explanation in terms of                         neurophysiological structures, which themselves must be                         explained; they can however be understood as realizing an optimum               strategy in a world in which objects having biologically                        significant consequences belong to natural kinds.                                                                                                               Such results suggest that the mind operates in accordance with                  invariant psychological laws, not unlike the invariant laws of                  physics, provided that the psychological laws are formulated in                 terms of the unique \"psychological space\" yielding invariance and               not in terms of the \"physical space\" defined by physical                        measurement.  The psychological space is presumed to be related                 to the physical space by a psychophysical transformation that has               been shaped by eons of natural selection.",
