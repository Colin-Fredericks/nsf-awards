 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statistical agencies are pivotal in collecting and                         disseminating the data that guide the health and wealth of                      our nation.  In their mediation between respondents and                         users,  statistical agencies hold two mandates in tension:                      provide research and policy access to data and assure                           confidentiality.  If an agency fails to properly disseminate                    data,  its data collection is fruitless and wastes taxpayers'                   money.  If the agency fails to protect privacy of                               respondents, it cannot collect quality data - because of                        increased nonresponse and evasive response -- and it                            violates ethical norms.                                                              The objective of this research is to develop and                           evaluate statistical and institutional procedures that better                   provide confidentiality and data access.  The work will build                   on accomplishments,  evidenced by published work,  conference                   presentations,  and interactions with statistical agencies,                     under a current NSF grant.  The expansion entails                               constructing a conceptual model for research and policy                         access to data,  developing and evaluating options for                          informed consent in data sharing and record linkage,                            deriving and assessing statistical disclosure limitation                        procedures based on the concept of matrix masks for public                      use files,  evaluating other restricted access procedures                       such as licensing agreements,  and improving privacy control                    methods for sequential access to computer databases.                            Establishment data will receive special attention.                                   The proposed research will effect a significant                            extension of ethical guidelines,  administrative rules,  and                    legal specifications with respect to confidentiality and data                   access.  The issues addressed are becoming increasingly                         important not only for the individual but for society as a                      whole.",
