 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a cooperative research project in                       biology between Professor Burney J. Le Boeuf, University of                     California at Santa Cruz, and Professor Yasuhiko Naito,                         National Institute of Polar Research, Tokyo, and colleagues                     from their respective institutions.  The scientists will                        study diving behavior and foraging ecology of northern                          elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris.  Specifically they                     will study:  1) the development of diving in pups and                           juveniles, 2) measurement of swim velocity rates and feeding                    rates during diving, 3) location of foraging and routes taken                   at sea, 4) foraging energetics, and 5) the effect of weather                    variables on the free-ranging dive pattern.  Diving performance                 will be studied by attaching diving instruments (time-depth                     recorders, swim velocity meters, radio transmitters) to seals                   at Ano Nuevo, California, before they go to sea.  The U.S.                      and Japanese researchers bring complementary strengths to                       this project and Professor Naito's specifically-designed                        instruments will be critical to its success.                                                                                                                    The diving pattern of northern elephant seals--characterized                    by prolonged, continuous, and deep diving--is distinctive                       even among diving mammals.  Recent findings are challenging                     long held interpretations of diving performance.  These seals                   dive deeper than other marine mammals (maximum depth of 1250                    m), spend brief periods on the surface between dives (less                      than 3 minutes), and dive continuously for 3-8 months at sea.                   This collaborative study will clarify diving adaptations in                     pelagic seals.  The findings will have important implications                   for how seals partition oxygen stores during foraging, manage                   anaerobic metabolites, and cope with compression effects.                       The results of the study will have practical applications to                    fisheries biology and marine mammal management, and will have                   broad implications for foraging ecology, understanding the                      diving adaptations of aquatic vertebrates, and studying                         diving behavior and physiology.",
