 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with questions which arise from the             desire to compute canonical bases for associative algebras.  The                principal investigator will develop a theory of Groebner bases                  founded on a vector space approach.  He will study language-                    theoretic properties of a straightened basis and will use word                  combinatorics to simplify and bound algorithms.  Finally, he will               connect these new techniques to an older theory of p-filtrations as             well as push an earlier, successful search for crystal invariants               further.                                                                             Given a finite dimensional algebra, every element of the                   algebra can be written as a combination of a finite set of elements             which is called the basis.  This basis is not unique.  This project             is concerned with finding a basis such that there is an effective               method of determining what elements can be written as a combination             of this basis.  This work is an important step towards the use of               computers in this field.",
