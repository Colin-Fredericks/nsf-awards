 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to construct and analyze                a new allocation mechanism for semiconductor products by                        simultaneously determining specification levels and delivery                    priorities and to mathematically characterize and analyze the                   impacts on profitability of downgrading, complementarity, and                   substitutability of semiconductor products.  The essential idea                 of the model is that the producer offers a \"product line\" of                    priority classes.  The producer's allocation rule is such that                  higher priority classes are supplied with higher specification                  level chips regardless of production outcome.  The product line                 design and allocation rule allows the producer's profit                         maximization problem to be cast as a non-linear programming                     formulation.  In estimating supply quantity functions from actual               production data, the least square fit as well as kernel estimation              method and maximum penalized likelihood method will be employed.                For numerical profit maximization and subsequent sensitivity                    analysis, a standard non-linear optimization software will be                   utilized.                                                                            The significance of this research is that it simultaneously                aims (1) to establish a systematic method to determine the optimal              specification levels of semiconductor products from an economic                 perspective, (2) to improve the performance of semiconductor                    producers in on-schedule delivery of chips, (3) to better                       understand downgrading, complementarity, and substitutability of                semiconductor products with respect to profitability of products.",
