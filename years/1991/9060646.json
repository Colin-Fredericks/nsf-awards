 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the active control of noise for                          machinery.  In most cases, passive control, by means of                         acoustical hoods, is used to reduce noise.  Some                                applications include manufacturing machines in industrial                       environments, and heating, ventilating and air conditioning                     systems in office or residential spaces.  In passive                            control, the hood is designed to attenuate the interior                         sound field by providing for acoustical damping in the air                      cavity and for structural damping in the enclosure walls.                       The performance achieved using these techniques is limited                      by constraints of volume, weight, and cost.  On the other                       hand, the active control approach applies to the design of                      a closed loop feedback controller where issues of time                          delays, stability, and bandwidth are important.  This                           project's approach is to design an enclosure structure that                     is as close to a stiff membrane as possible.  Such a                            structure's response is dominated by supersonic structural                      modes.  Cancellation of exterior noise is obtained by                           minimizing the normal response along the enclosure surface.                     This approach will be tested and compared with existing                         active control strategies.  This approach's expected                            advantages include reduction of the number of surface                           sensors required to observe the response of the enclosure                       walls, and spatial filtering which insures rejection of                         excitation by shorter wavelength disturbances.",
