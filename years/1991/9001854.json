 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project provides support for twelve U.S.                     scientists to participate in the International Conference on                    Quantum Optics, to be held in Hyderabad, India January 5-9, 1991.               The conference's aims include interaction between scientists from               India, neighboring countries, Europe and the U.S., and                          encouragement of cooperative research.  The program covers recent               development in: squeezed states and nonclassical light; quantum                 theory of measurement and interferometers; cavity QED; photon                   statistics and optical phenomena; optical phenomena in superintense             fields; topological places in nonlinear and quantum phenomena;                  coherence theory; laser cooling and trapping of ions and neutral                atoms; new mechanism of laser action; resonance fluorescence;                   quantum jumps, optical bistability; and light induced drift.  The               Indian convener is Dr. G.S. Agarwal of the School of Physics,                   University of Hyderabad who is an active scientist in the field                 with a long record of successful collaborative research with  U.S.              scientists.  The invited U.S. participants are eminently qualified              and active scientists who can benefit from and contribute to the                conference.                                                                                                                                                     Scope:  This activity is beneficial to the Indian and U.S.                      scientists by enabling them to interact with colleagues from Europe             and India, as well as develop cooperative activities between                    scientists of the two countries.  It is likely the maximum benefits             will be for scientists from smaller Indian universities who have                few chances for such interaction.",
