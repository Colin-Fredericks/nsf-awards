 "awd_abstract_narration": "How can intelligent agents in strategic interaction achieve                     equilibrium?  This equilibration question lies at the conceptual                foundations of game theory.  Orthodox opinion since the early                   1960's has been that agents are rational and can be presumed to                 have sufficient endowments of common knowledge and sufficient                   computational ability to reach a Nash Equilibrium directly.  In                 the last few years support for this orthodox view has begun to                  unravel, due in part to the inability of game theorists to find                 compelling Nash Equilibrium selection procedures.  Many leading                 game theorists now believe that the equilibration question is                   best thought of in terms of an evolutionary process.  This                      project represents a first empirical look at the new evolutionary               approaches to the equilibration question.  The empirical work                   will help identify those aspects of evolutionary game theory                    which do in fact show promise for positive economics.                                                                                                           This is an empirical study of the process by which Nash                         equilibrium (or other coherent behavior) may be achieved by                     intelligent self-interested agents in strategic interactions.                   Building on recent theoretical extensions of the biologists'                    evolutionary games, this project presents populations of 6-24                   undergraduate subjects with chosen payoff (or fitness) functions                which embody interesting sorts of strategic interactions.  Each                 subject faces a given payoff function and interacts anonymously                 with a fixed population of other subjects over 10 to 100 decision               periods.  In each period each subject enters his choice at a                    visually isolated computer terminal after viewing a computer                    display of the population distribution by all subjects in                       previous periods.  The actual time paths of population                          distributions are compared to various theoretical time paths                    proposed by biologists and economists.  In particular, the                      project looks for convergence to Nash equilibrium and to                        refinements of Nash equilibrium.  The results should add                        significantly to the empirical basis of modern game theory, with                eventual applications in diverse fields such as industrial                      organization and international economic policy.",
