 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is detailed isotopic biogeochemical study of the               Jurassic marine Lower Oxford Clay.  Its goal is to understand                   sedimentary microbial processes and how they affect preservation                of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in organic and inorganic phases and              the relationship between those microbial processes and depositional             environments.  Effects of specific microbial processes and the                  environments in which they are prevalent will be identified.                    Results of analyses of organic-sulfur compounds in these rocks                  should provide new information on the role of these compounds in                the carbon-sulfur-iron system.                                                       Samples for this study were collected from active quarries in              central England.  The quarry exposures allowed acquisition of                   large, fresh samples of this immature, organic-carbon-rich mudrock.             The samples, representing all stratigraphic horizons and biofacies,             were obtained in collaboration with experts on the vertebrate and               invertebrate paleoecology of the Lower Oxford Clay.  Measurements               (i) will include carbon, oxygen and sulfur isotopic compositions                of the extensive and well preserved biominerals in this unit; (ii)              carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of the organic materials              preserved in the bones and shells; (iii) abundances and carbon-                 isotopic compositions of individual molecular fossils (i.e.,                    biomarkers); and (iv) abundances and sulfurisotopic compositions                of organic sulfur compounds and pyrite.  The results should provide             unique taphonomic information.",
