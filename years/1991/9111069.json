 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to study from a theoretical and                  empirical perspective how companies structure their debt.  For                  example, what determines whether companies borrow from banks or                 issue public debt; whether companies issue secured or unsecured                 loans; and whether they borrow short or long term.  This study is               important because it help us better understand the effects of                   financial regulation, financial distress, and macroeconomic                     fluctuations.  There are three topics to the project, two of which              are empirical.  The first will analyze the recent shift in Japan                away from bank financing toward public debt financing using a                   detailed firm-level database of Japanese companies.  The second                 part will develop a firm-level U.S. corporate debt structure and                analyze both how debt is determined and how debt structure affects              the ability of firms to respond to macroeconomic and industry                   fluctuations.  The third topic is a theoretical analysis which                  involves constructing a model that incorporates important aspects               of debt structure, such as the choice of how many creditors to                  borrow from and the assignment of security interests.",
