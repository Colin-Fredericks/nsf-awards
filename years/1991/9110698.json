 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to determine consequences of                   seed dispersal by birds to composition and genetic structure of                 shrubs in a tropical rain forest.  The research involves two                    phases.  The first phase (planning activities) will determine                   plant species diversity, seed density, and genetic relatedness of               seeds within droppings from five species of common fruit-eating                 birds.  Seeds passed by these birds are identifiable and the                    relatedness of seeds within droppings can be estimated using                    starch gel electrophoresis.  During phase two the consequences                  occurring with related or unrelated seeds to plant survival and                 growth will be examined through competition experiments using                   three light environments characteristic of tropical rain forests.                    In tropical rain forests, most seeds of understory plants                  are dispersed by birds.  This study will be the first to examine                relatedness of seeds in bird droppings and consequences to plants               of having seeds eaten and dispersed by different birds.                         Information on genetic and species composition of seeds in                      droppings of birds (planning activities) and results from                       competition experiments (phase two) will be used to develop                     models that predict genetic structure and composition of rain                   forest shrubs.  This research will contribute substantially to                  understanding tropical rain forests by testing ecological and                   evolutionary theories of plant-animal interactions.",
