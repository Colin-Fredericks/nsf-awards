 "awd_abstract_narration": "The monsoon forms one of the most important features of the                planetary atmospheric circulation, and the wet/dry seasonal pattern             dominates the climate over large portions of tropical and                       subtropical Asia, Australia and Africa (Webster, 1987a).  India                 lies at the heart of the classic monsoon region, and is the area                most sensitive to monsoon fluctuations.  It is ideally suited for               a hydroclimatic application of paleofloods, as monsoon-related                  storms cause the largest floods.  Slackwater deposits from floods               in bedrock canyons are direct evidence of discrete extreme                      hydrologic events rather than proxy indicators of average climatic              conditions.  We will develop paleoflood records on several rivers               in India to chronicle fluctuations in the monsoon intensity over                centuries to millennia.  The climatic implications of variations                in the monsoon extend far beyond the Indian subcontinent through                broad global teleconnections between the monsoon and other climatic             phenomena such as the El Nino/Southern Oscillation.  Our research               will address regional hydrologic effects of global change that                  directly impact the inhabitants of the most populous portions of                the Earth.",
