 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this internship is to develop a model-based               decision support system for aircraft requirements.  It is                       expected that the model base will be a 0-1 integer program that,                when solved, will provide a daily set of routings for the                       aircraft.  The primary objective of the model will be to minimize               the number of routings (and therefore the number of aircraft)                   required to cover all of the flight legs.                                            Much of the work for this project will involve extensive                   interaction with industrial planners in order to develop a good                 formulation for the model, and good interfaces with the system's                users, existing databases, and other problem areas.  In addition,               as a result of the principal investigator's interests, special                  attention will be given to the multiobjective aspects of the                    problem; for example, it may be desirable to consider tradeoffs                 between the number of routes required to cover all of the flight                legs, and the balancing of aircraft among the different airports.               It is expected that this project will lead to the examination of                other complex logistical problems.  These problems include those                related to flow planning, maintenance scheduling, crew                          scheduling, and the provisioning of spare parts for aircraft.",
