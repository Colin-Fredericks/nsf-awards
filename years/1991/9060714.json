 "awd_abstract_narration": "A software tool which presents analytical solutions of                          Laplace's equation offers several advantages over numerical                     techniques.  Students in many areas of engineering and physics                  will benefit from the opportunity to study parametric                           dependence of the solutions.  Aspects of potential theory that                  are difficult for numerical techniques, such as highly curved                   surfaces and derivative variables, are simple for analytical                    methods, so both analysis and design of new structures and                      devices will become more accurate. The principal obstacles to                   the use of analytical solutions have been the difficulty of                     matching the shape to a solution, and the need to perform a                     large number of tedious symbolic calculations using algebra                     and calculus.  These difficulties are overcome in the proposed                  work by implementing an interface which guides the user                         through a sequence of graphical menus leading to the desired                    solution in a variety of formats, including, graphs, computer                   subprograms, and word processing elements.                                                                                                                      Phase I of the project is devoted to working out the                            techniques which will enable the solutions of Laplace's                         equation to be generated using a computer based symbolic                        mathematics package (Mathematica), and to testing a minimal                     version of the program for the suitability of the interface                     for Junior level engineering students.",
