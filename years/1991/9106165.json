 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many regulatory genes of flies, mice, humans, and other metazoan                organisms share a specific sequence motif known as the homeobox.                A group of these genes share other characteristics as well,                     including their ordered arrangement in large gene complexes.  The               significance of these highly conserved patterns of organization is              unknown, but suggests that mechanisms for the genetic control of                development may be highly conserved, even while may involve                     processes not yet encountered in simple regulatory systems.  An                 example of such a highly ordered gene complex is the bithorax                   complex, which plays a key role in the determination of segmental               identity during development of fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.               The work described in this proposal contributes to the genetic and              molecular analysis of the bithorax complex, concentrating upon one              regulatory region:  the infra-abdominal-5,7 (iab-5,7) region of the             Abdominal-B domain.  This region, which is 60kb in size and located             3' of the gene it controls, is required for the proper development              of three specific segments of the fly.  Three major projects are                proposed: (1) Recovery of new mutations within the iab-5,7 region               using mutagenic agents which cause small deletions.  (2) Comparison             of the iab-5,7 region in D. melanogaster and a distant Drosophila               species, D. virilis, by sequence analysis and cross-species                     transformation experiments.  (3) Functional analysis of cis-                    regulatory elements within iab-5,7 using P-factor-mediated                      transformation.                                                                                                                                                 How regulatory genes such as the bithorax region of Drosophila                  control the genetic determinants leading to body morphology is a                fundamental mystery and the results from this project should give               us a little more insight into the process.***//",
