 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in astronomy                     between Dr. Steven Howell, Planetary Science Institute,                         Tucson, Arizona and Dr. Keith Mason, Mullard Space Science                      Laboratory, University College London. The objective of the                     proposed project is to investigate a previously unstudied                       group of cataclysmic variable stars which may be members of                     the Galactic halo.                                                                                                                                              The  standard picture of a cataclysmic variable (CV) is a                       close binary system consisting of a late type main sequence                     star which transfers mass to a white dwarf companion. The                       material that leaves the secondary forms a disk around the                      primary star.  The intersection of this stream and the disk                     gives rise to a \"hot spot\", which can provide a large                           fraction of the system light.  If the white dwarf has a                         sufficiently strong magnetic field, the transferred material                    will be disturbed and even the formation of the disk can be                     retarded. The only direct method of finding the true                            location of these cataclysmic variables is through distance                     determination. The investigators are analyzing spectroscopic                    data, using software which they developed jointly at the                        Mullard Space Science Laboratory, to model and deconvolve                       the contributions  to the data from the various systems                         components.  This procedure will allow them to derive a                         distance for these stars.  If these binary systems are                          really located in the Galactic halo, they should have very                      different properties from their well studied counterparts                       located in the disk.  The results of this study will make an                    important contribution to understanding the true nature of                      cataclysmic variables and how these populations differ, as                      well as to understanding the structure and evolution of our                     Galaxy in general.  The project will benefit from the                           complementary expertise of the two investigators in the area                    of theoretical interpretations of binary stars.",
