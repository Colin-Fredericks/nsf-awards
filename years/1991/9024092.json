 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Southern California will acquire several                      items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool                   of shared use equipment.  This equipment is maintained for                      use on or in association with the R/V VICKERS, a research                       vessel owned and operated by the University.  A part of the                     ship's operating schedule during 1991 is in support of NSF-                     sponsored research projects.  The instrumentation will also                     increase the capabilities of the ship and of the University                     to support research and engineering activities.  The                            instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                                       -Seagoing computer, disk drive system and other peripheral                       equipment for a shipboard data management system that is                        essential for real-time acquisition and display of large                        data sets,                                                                     -CTD system for obtaining detailed profiles of seawater                          conductivity and temperature as a function of depth, and a                     -Rosette sampler with Niskin bottles for collecting discrete                     seawater samples at various depths in the water column.                                                                                                        The instrumentation described above will increase the                           capability of the University to support NSF-sponsored                           research and engineering projects.",
