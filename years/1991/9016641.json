 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to understand how to design fast           and processor-efficient algorithms with an emphasis on algorithms that          are targeted toward fine-grain parallel architectures.  The approach            will be to solve mostly graph theoretic problems that arise from the            solution to more concrete problems such as finding approximate                  solutions to partial differential equations using the finite element            method.  Almost all of this work assumes that the underlining graphs            possess some further geometric or topologic structure, with the hope            of finding fast and processor-efficient algorithms for problems which           otherwise seem hard to parallelize efficiently.                                      Processor-efficient algorithms will be developed for constructing          graph separators which arise in sparse linear systems.  These                   separators will then be used in the construction of more efficient              direct and iterative methods for solving these systems.  The                    relationship between graphs obtained using geometric constraints and            those obtained using topological constraints will be studied.                        The bulk of the research will be in the design of processor-               efficient parallel algorithms for abstract machines that possess a              message passing architecture, such as the Parallel Random Access                Machine.  Many of the parallel algorithms that have been developed are          efficient and simple enough that, when machines are available that can          efficiently perform message passing, there should be substantial                speedups.  The next one or two generations of parallel machines will            be able to handle the large amount of traffic generated by the                  pointer-based algorithms.  Algorithms will be designed for the                  Parallel Random Access Machine model augmented with unit cost                   operations such as prefix-sum or scan.  Algorithms for the augmented            model should be simpler, and thus have a better chance of efficient             implementation on the newer machines.",
