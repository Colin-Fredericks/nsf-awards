 "awd_abstract_narration": "Competition among plants for resources such as water and                   light generally results in a size distribution in which there are               some large plants and many small, suppressed plants.  It is well                known that growing plants at higher densities increases the                     magnitude of competition.  From this, one would expect that                     traits that confer competitive ability would be increasingly                    favored as density increases.  The principal investigators                      suggest that this may not be true at very high densities.  Under                extreme competition, growth of all plants is very suppressed,                   resulting in smaller differences between large and small plants.                Consequently, traits that confer competitive ability may not be                 increasingly favored beyond some intermediate to high density.                  The investigators propose to determine the relationship between                 plant density and the favorability of traits that increase                      competitive ability by growing plants across a wide range of                    densities and comparing the performance of individuals with                     different traits.  They will also measure the same relationship                 in a field population to determine if natural densities reach the               threshold necessary for decoupling density and the favorability                 of traits that confer competitive ability.                                           Competition is recognized as a widespread, important                       ecological force.  Almost all agricultural plants, as well as                   those grown in natural environments, are strongly suppressed by                 competition.  This work will permit an assessment of the role of                density as a force shaping the evolution of traits that affect                  competitive ability in a natural environment.  Results will also                be of use to agriculturalists, particularly in determining the                  correct density at which to breed plants for enhanced competitive               ability.",
