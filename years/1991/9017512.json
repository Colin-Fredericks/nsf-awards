 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will involve a detailed mineralogical and chemical                 analysis of the clay minerals in numerous long sediment-cores (up               to 12m in length) which have been collected recently from Lake                  Malawi and Lake Turkana in East Africa.  By analyzing carefully                 the vertical changes in the clay assemblages and correlating                    these with changes in diatom contents, physical stratigraphy and                interstitial-water chemistry, we will a) document the timing and                degree of paleosalinity fluctuations of these lakes during the                  last several thousand years and b) examine the detailed processes               of clay-mineral diagenesis in alkaline lakes, especially the                    uptake of Mg in smectite phases and the transformation of                       smectite into illite under variable chemical conditions.  The                   data will be correlated with other proxy climatic indicators from               these lake basins and with previous studies elsewhere in East                   Africa to help document patterns of global climate change in the                Holocene.  Furthermore, since both rift-valleys and alkaline                    lakes are now recognized as important depositional environments                 in the geological record, an understanding of the behavior of                   clay minerals in these modern settings will help evaluate the                   role of burial diagenetic reactions for the generation and                      migration of petroleum in non-marine settings.",
