 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organisms face the common problems of avoiding death,                      harvesting and allocating finite resources to maintenance,                      reproduction, growth and storage.  It is the communalty of these                problems that provides the unifying basis for life history                      theories.  Many organisms begin life, reach maturity, reproduce                 once and die in the same year.  In contrast, humans and some                    female turtles postpone sexual maturity for over 15 years,                      exhibit repeated reproduction over many years, and have maximum                 life expectancies that approach 100 years.  Because of the                      logistical problems and the duration of study necessary,                        actuarial and complete life history data are almost completely                  lacking for most long lived organisms other than man.  The                      primary objective of the proposed research is to complete the                   documentation of life history traits of turtles on the University               of Michigan's, E. S. George Reserve in southeastern Michigan by                 examining the relationships among age, body size, stored energy,                growth rates, clutch size (number of eggs) and clutch frequency                 of individuals reproducing for the first time in their lives.                        In conjunction with the previous studies of three species of               turtles on the E. S. George Reserve during 26 of the past 36                    years, data collected during the tenure of the proposed research                will allow tests of current theories of the evolution of delayed                sexual maturity, and provide a basis for understanding age                      specific aspects of the biology of long-lived organisms that is                 critical for the conservation and management of such species.",
