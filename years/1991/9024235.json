 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an interdisciplinary effort on the study                        of diarthrodial joint biomechanics utilizing automated                          and adaptive nonlinear three-dimensional finite                                 element analysis (FEA) to describe the actual anatomic                          geometries and biphasic properties of articular cartilage                       on the joint surface.  Significant recent advances have                         been made in the development of: 1) mixture                                     constitutive equations to describe the behaviors of                             hydrated soft tissues; 2) finite element formulations for                       these mixture equations; 3) the boundary conditions                             between the synovial fluid and the articular surface;                           and 4) the determination of three-dimensional                                   anatomic geometry of joints.  What is now required is a                         comprehensive undertaking for the development of                                computational mechanics methods leading to an                                   automated and adaptive finite element numerical                                 model for the deformational response of diarthrodial                            joints.  Thus the fundamental studies will focus on the                         development of the 1) FEA of three-dimensional                                  problems utilizing the nonlinear finite deformation                             biphasic laws for articular cartilage; 2) automated and                         adaptive methods for the generation of                                          two-dimensional and three-dimensional meshes                                    required for the FEA to account for known singular                              boundary layer effects; and 3) interface for the ditigal                        stereophotogrammetric (SPG) anatomic data with the                              automatic mesh generation in our 3-D FEA meshes.                                These studies will provide significant advances toward a                        precise 3-D simulation of biomechanical problems                                related to diarthrodial joints, with realistic loading                          conditions, joint geometries, loads, and constituent                            material properties.  Ultimately, these fundamental                             studies can provide an understanding of the complex                             biomechanical behaviors of normal and pathological                              human joints, as well as the possibility of the                                 development of new interactive computer programs for                            imaging and diagnostic techniques to develop new                                clinical treatment modalities.",
