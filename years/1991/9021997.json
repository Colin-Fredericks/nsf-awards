 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to identify ways in which                     computer simulations can be used to expedite the design of                      reading and spelling instruction.  In many fields, computer                     models serve as surrogates for real-life situations.  By running                the models under various conditions, it is possible to evaluate                 theories and examine their utility, thus vastly increasing the                  likelihood that eventual real-life experimentation will be                      productive and cost-effective.                                                                                                                                  Only recently have methods been devised for simulating some of                  the basic operations involved in learning to read.  This research               will extend these models, developed by Terence Sejnowski and                    James McClelland, to incorporate more of the natural complexities               of reading than have been previously included.  For example, the                research will extend the models to study how the process of                     learning to read is affected by the way a word looks, the way it                sounds, by the number of syllables, by simultaneous practice on                 spelling, and by first learning rules for pronouncing letter-                   sound units within words (phonics).  The research will use these                computer models to guide classroom experiments.                                                                                                                 For over 200 years there has been controversy over the ways in                  which such factors influence learning to read.  As a result,                    \"compromise\" methods of teaching reading have been adopted and                  have proved ineffective with much of the population.  Survey data               have shown literacy in the United States to be at a dangerously                 low ebb, with fewer than 5% of our citizens reading well enough                 to handle college-level textbooks, for example.  Knowledge gained               by the use of advanced computer-simulation technology as a guide                to experimentation can help to put the practice of reading                      instruction on a sound scientific footing.",
