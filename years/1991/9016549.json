 "awd_abstract_narration": "The detection of the signs of specific diseases in earlier human                populations is a long-standing goal of physical anthropology.  By               so doing one can better understand the factors affecting our                    ancestors and guiding their development and adaptation.  The                    demographics of earlier groups, the social and biological                       responses to disease and the like can be clarified with such                    information.  In the past, however, there has been much                         uncertainty in the identification of lesions on the skeleton                    caused by specific diseases.                                                                                                                                    Salo and Aufderheide will use DNA technology to test the ability                to identify specific pathogens in ancient human remains from the                New World.  They will attempt to identify the DNA of M.                         tuberculosis in the mummified remains of New World individuals                  who exhibit skeletal and soft tissue signs of the disease.                      Secondly, if the DNA of the pathogen is found, they will seek to                determine if it varies from contemporary M. tuberculosis.  This                 may provide insight into the changes in the microbe over time.                  Tuberculosis is a good starting point as it has been established                in ancient mummies.  If successful, this technique should be                    extendable to other pathogens.",
