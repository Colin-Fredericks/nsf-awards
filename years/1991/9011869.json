 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although much of the concern about possible global warming has             focused on changes in temperatures, some climatologists, geographers,           and other atmospheric scientists have noted that substantial changes in         the amount, form, and timing of precipitation also may occur.  The              extent and duration of snow cover is one measure by which changing              precipitation and temperature patterns may be identified, and snow              cover is a variable for which many nations have historical data that            extends over decades.  Analyses of these historical data are essential          to help identify natural variability in snow cover, a pattern that              must be distinguished if changes in snowfall resulting from human               activities or other factors are to be identified.  This project will            integrate into a single, coherent database the daily measurements of            snow cover and related variables for roughly 1,000 observation stations         in the United States, Soviet Union, Canada, China, and several European         nations.  Records in the USA and USSR extend back to the early years of         the 20th Century.  These integrated data will be statistically                  analyzed to test hypotheses about the spatial and temporal variability          of snow cover and to differentiate random variability from long-term            trends.                                                                              The most valuable contribution of this project will be the                 integration of historical data into a single database, which will be            available for use by this investigator and by other scientists for a            wide range of inquiries into climatic variability and change.  The              project also will provide analyses of fundamental variations in snow            cover across the Northern Hemisphere during the 20th Century, thereby           enhancing general understandings of changing climatic patterns over the         last 100 years.",
