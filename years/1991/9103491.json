 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diagenesis will be examined for two large scale sequences in               eastern Tennessee:  1) one deposited in a ramp setting during a                 time of aragonite/high-magnesian-calcite facilitation in the Middle             to Late Cambrian, and 2) one deposited on a rimmed platform during              a time of low-magnesian calcite facilitation in Middle Ordovician.              An understanding of the relationship between diagenetic history and             sequence-stratigraphic framework will be developed by:  1) further              comparison of similar lithologies occurring in both sequences (eg.              oolite), 2) diagenetic studies of lithologies unique to one or the              other sequence (eg. subtidal \"flat-pebble\" conglomerates of the                 Cambrian), and 3) analyses of diagenetic history through measured               sections of both sequences.  Thin-section petrography (polarized                light and cathodoluminescent), coupled with analyses, as well as                isotopic analysis of microsamples (0.3-0.6 mg) of diagenetic phases             and other rock components will be used in all parts of the                      research.  The geochemical data will be used to model mass transfer             of chemical components to aid in understanding fluid flow during                diagenesis.  The long-term objective is to establish a diagenetic               framework (stratigraphy + diagenetic processes + time) comparable               in detail to the paleoenvironmental and sequence-stratigraphic                  framework previously developed, and to determine how the diagenetic             history of large scale sequences differ depending on setting and                geologic age.",
