 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rate and pattern ofdental development in early hominids is a                focus of controversy in current research in physical                            anthropology.  This controversy is part of the larger question of               whether developmental periods in early hominids can be                          characterized as more \"humanlike\", more \"apelike\", or distinct                  from either.  The prolonged developmental periods characteristic                of modern humans have been emphasized in many scenarios                         concerning the origin of various human physical, cultural, and                  behavioral traits.  However, recent research suggests that early                than modern humans, comparable to that of modern apes.  If so,                  brains, tool use, and social organization, will be affected.                    Rates of human dental development are well known, but existing                  standards of ape dental development are inadequate since the                    sample size is small, they are not from individuals of known                    chronological age, and radiographic information on the anterior                 dentition is lacking.                                                                                                                                           The objective of this study is to document the pattern and timing               of deciduous and permanent tooth crown and root formation in a                  cross-sectional sample of living chimpanzees of known age and sex               in order to provide baseline data for comparison with human and                 fossil hominid samples.",
