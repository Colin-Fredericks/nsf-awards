Ten students will work                individually or in small groups on projects in several areas                    ofmathematics.  The advisory staff includes two principal                       investigators, three faculty associates and a graduate assistant.               Participants will choose or design their own projects, prepare                  written reports on their activities and participate in                          mini.courses, which will be videotaped for distribution.  Ample                 computing facilities ranging from a MacIntosh laboratory to a                   Sequent parallel machine will be available.                                          Research topics will be chosen from a variety of areas of                  faculty expertise.  They include ergodic theory, graph theory                   and combinatorics, probability, number theory and commutative                   algebra.  The department is also nationally recognized for its                  research concentration on the mathematics of tomography.                             This award represents the principal investigator's fifth REU               site award.  Many of the 40 former participants are now pursuing                graduate work in science.",
