 "awd_abstract_narration": "The synthesis and properties of molecules in which two relatively               unreactive functional groups are forced into close proximity to                 each other will be studied. Particular emphasis will be placed on               in-cyclophanes bearing phosphine lone-pair electrons brought into               close proximity with aromatic rings. Other electron-rich groups,                such as olefins, amines, phosphine oxides, and silyl fluorides                  will also be examined. By balancing the forces due to                           intramolecular strain in these compounds with the nucleophilicity               or electrophilicity of the aromatic ring, it may be possible to                 obtain structures in which there is partial bonding between the                 groups in question. Such structures may serve as models for                     transition state structures in ordinary aromatic reactions. A                   second part of the project will involve the synthesis and study of              the physical properties of fullerene fragments. Each of these                   fragments will be a different segment of buckminsterfullerene                   (spherical C60).                                                                %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Robert Pascal at Princeton                         University. the main focus of the project is the synthesis and                  study of highly strained organic molecules, i.e., molecules in                  which some atoms are forced by steric constraints to occupy                     positions which lead to unnatural interactions with other atoms                 and to unusual bond distances and angles. Of particular interest                are the structure and reactivity of molecules in which two                      relatively unreactive functional groups are forced to be very                   close together. It is expected that the enforced proximity will                 lead to unusual reactivity for the groups involved,and to unusual               physical properties as well. In another part of this project,                   fragments of a recently discovered spherical C60 allotrope of                   carbon (other allotropes of carbon are diamond and graphite) will               be prepared in order to understand how C60 may be formed from                   carbon fragments.",
