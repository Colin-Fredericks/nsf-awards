 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the study of ultrafast processes                          in high temperature superconductors.  Femtosecond                               duration laser pulses will be used to study the                                 response times of simple high Tc superconducting                                electronic devices.  The goal is to investigate the                             possibility of using these high Tc materials in active                          ultrafast electronic devices such as switches and                               transistors at 77K.  Preliminary results have shown                             that the response times of Y-Ba-Cu-O                                            superconductors can be as fast as 1 ps.  In this                                research program, high quality in-situ                                          superconducting thin films will be deposited by pulsed                          excimer lasers onto various substrates and patterned                            into various calculated geometries.  Microstriplines                            will be used predominantly, although other structures                           will also be examined.  Additionally, the use of hibrid                         devices involving both superconducting and                                      semiconducting films will be investigated.  The                                 relaxation times after laser excitation will be                                 measured by optical as well as electrical techniques as                         a function of material parameters such as doping and                            crystallinity of the films.  The use of granular films                          and weak link junctions to increase the speed of these                          devices will also be studied.  Besides applications to                          ultrafast electronics, this project will also contribute                        to the fundamental understanding of nonequilibrium                              phenomena in high Tc superconductors.",
