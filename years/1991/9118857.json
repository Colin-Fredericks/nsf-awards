 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effects of genetics, environment, and aging all interact                    during the normal lifespan of an animal.  This exploratory                      project is the first attempt to study interactions among those                  three factors on a sensory system, hearing.  There is a unique                  opportunity to study auditory function in a group of several                    inbred and mutant mouse strains that are part of a study on diet                and longevity.  The auditory system will be tested non-invasively               during the normal lifespan of these animals, and tissues will be                preserved after death.  Relationships among physiology, anatomy,                genetics, diet and age will be evaluated by comparing data from                 the various subject groups.  The data will provide new                          information about the roles of genetics and diet in maintaining                 stability (homeostasis) or inducing change (plasticity) in the                  adult auditory system over extended periods of time.  There is a                large interdisciplinary potential impact of the results on                      auditory neuroscience, on sensory science in general, on mouse                  genetics and biology, and on development and aging research.",
