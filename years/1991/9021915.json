 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cornell University Portable Radar Interferometer (CUPRI)               is a 50 MHz system that has provided a wealth of data for the                   study of ionospheric plasma turbulence.  The CUPRI data sets now                include a variety of auroral and mid-latitude-E-region                          observations, F_region chemical release experiments, and polar                  mesosphere measurements.  Most of our observations have been                    coordinated with other instrumentation to provide as full a                     characterization of the media being probed as possible in support               of several segments of the CEDAR initiative.  The proposed three                year renewal will fund the continuing analysis and interpretation               of these extensive data sets, the completion of an upgrade of the               CUPRI digitizing sub-system to improve resolution, and the                      acquisition and study of three new data sets.                                        The first new data set  will be obtained from northern                     Scandinavia for multi-frequency study of polar mesospheric summer               echoes.  CUPRI will set up next to the EISCAT antennas and will                 provide the 3 meter component of this study.  Although several                  papers have been recently published on PSME, it is clear that                   more data is needed, particularly of the type that CUPRI and                    EISCAT can jointly obtain.  The second new data set is to be of                 mid-latitude E-region instabilities which are not at all                        understood as yet.  The third set will try to reproduce the                     remarkable mid-latitude F-region coherent echoes seen by the MU                 Radar.  If this latter effort is successful, then we would plan                 to add the power of the Arecibo incoherent scatter radar in an                  attempt to understand these intense turbulence upwelling regions.                    We plan to continue to involve students in CUPRI operations,               data analysis, and data interpretation: graduate students as part               of their thesis research and undergraduates as part of elective                 courses or project regions. ***                                                                                                                                                                                                                      //",
