 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program will investigate electron                                 transport in heterostructure devices with the goal of                           improving the performance of terahertz-frequency                                semiconductor devices.  Three specific types of two-                            terminal devices will be investigated; metal                                    semiconductor junctions, heterojunction barrier                                 diodes, and a high-electron mobility diode.  Metal-                             semiconductor junctions have been the workhorse                                 device in millimeter and submillimeter wavelength                               applications for many years, and continue to yield                              state-of-the-art performance at THz frequencies.                                The goals of our continued work on these devices                                will be to increase the operating frequency to the                              10 THz range and determine the fundamental limit                                to their maximum operating frequency.  The                                      heterojunction barrier devices will use the barrier                             between two III-V semiconductor materials to                                    control the current flow perpendicular to the                                   interface.  Since the composition and doping of the                             semiconductor materials can be varied over a wide                               range, the properties of the barrier can, to a                                  degree, be tailored to yield the desired device                                 characteristics for specific applications.  The                                 heterojunction barrier varactor which is a novel                                device that promises to greatly improve the                                     maximum frequency and output power of frequency                                 multipliers, will be extensively investigated.  As time                         permits, the effect of a heterojunction barrier on a                            metal-semiconductor junction will also be                                       investigated, by varying the design of the                                      heterojunction, the important properties of the                                 diode can be controlled, leading to greatly increased                           design flexibility and improved performance.  The                               high electron mobility diode is a fundamentally new                             two-terminal device in which the electron                                       conduction is in a two dimensional electron gas at                              the heterojunction interface.  Our previous NSF                                 grant led to the investigation of a prototype high-                             electron mobility varactor diode that exhibited                                 strongly non-linear capacitance-voltage                                         characteristics and large reverse breakdown voltage.                            Research on each device investigated in this grant                              will have three specific components; the                                        investigation of fundamental device physics, the                                study of the feasibility of the proposed device for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  (2)                                                                                                                                                                                                        scientific applications and the fabrication of                                  prototype devices to evaluate the theoretical                                   predictions.",
