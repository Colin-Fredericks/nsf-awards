 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to identify and                              characterize the active sites for hydrogenation reactions on                    supported metal catalysts and to determine the dependence of                    the concentration and activity of the active sites on the                       physical properties of the catalyst.  This involves                             determining whether hydrogenation occurs on the oxide support,                  the rates of transfer between sites on the metal and on the                     oxide, what the limiting steps in the process are, and how                      these factors depend on the properties and mode of preparation                  of the catalysts.  Temperature-programmed reaction,                             temperature-programmed desorption, isotopic labelling,                          transient isotope training, and infrared spectroscopy are used                  to study multiple reaction sites on supported platinum and                      palladium catalysts.  Substrates to be hydrogenated include                     adsorbed methoxy and adsorbed organics.  A series of catalyst                   preparations is used, with the catalysts characterized by                       hydrogen chemisorption, surface-area measurements, X-ray                        photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic absorption.                                                                                                              This project examines fundamental aspects of hydrogenation                      reactions in systems similar to those used in industry.                         Although the study is not directed to any particular                            application, it could lead to improvement in industrial                         hydrogenation in many contexts.  Such processes are common in                   the specialty chemical, pharmaceutical, food processing, and                    petroleum industries.",
