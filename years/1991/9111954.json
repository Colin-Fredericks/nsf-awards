 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Midkiff will conduct research on genetic and experiential                   antecedents of salt preference.  Her experiments will examine the               effect of sodium deprivation during gestation and lactation, with               periodic sodium repletion, on the long-term salt preference of                  rats.  Two genetic strains of laboratory rats will be used:                     Fischer-344, which do not spontaneously prefer salt solutions in                any concentration, and outbred Wistar rats, which prefer and                    copiously ingest salt solutions at hypotonic and isotonic                       concentrations.  Rats from both strains reared on a sodium-                     deficient diet will be compared with control animals receiving                  the same diet with 1% salt added.  This study is designed to                    determine whether early experience with salt can alter salt                     preference in adulthood.  Previous studies have not found any                   long-term alteration in salt ingestion as a result of early                     experience, although two studies have described an alteration in                water ingestion.  Dr. Midkiff's preliminary studies indicate that               long-term salt preference may altered, at least in Wistar rats,                 by post-weaning sodium deprivation and repletion.  Results from                 this study will be used to direct further research into the                     limits of behavioral change based on early experience, and into                 the genetic origins of salt preference.",
