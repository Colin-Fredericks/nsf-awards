 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues the numerical and analytical                       investigation of plate models and also studies finite element                   methods to approximate linear hyperbolic and convection-diffusion               equations.  The first area of study deals with the                              Reissner-Mindlin plate model, which determines the transverse                   displacement of the midplane and the rotation of the fibers                     normal to the midplane of a plate as the solution of a coupled                  system of partial differential equations with appropriate                       boundary conditions.  Unlike the biharmonic plate model, this                   model has a boundary layer, which is studied by developing and                  rigorously justifying an asymptotic expansion of the solution in                terms of powers of the plate thickness.  The investigator expects               to show how the strength of the boundary layer depends on                       particular physical boundary conditions used in the model and                   that for certain boundary conditions no boundary layer exists                   near a flat portion of the boundary.  Using these results, he                   will develop finite element approximation schemes that give                     higher rates of convergence in the interior of the domain and for               which the overall convergence rate may be enhanced by mesh                      refinement techniques geared to the exact nature of the boundary                layer. He also intends to study higher order models, derived from               pure displacement or mixed variational principles.  He will                     investigate analytical properties (such as boundary layer                       effects) by means of asymptotic expansions and develop                          approximation schemes that do not suffer from \"locking,\" a common               problem for the Reissner-Mindlin model that causes deterioration                in accuracy for thin plates.  Because all these models are                      approximations to the full three-dimensional model, an important                aspect of this research is to compare the predictions the various               models make about properties of the three-dimensional solution.                 Finally, the project involves the derivation of local error                     estimates for a finite element method for the approximation of                  linear hyperbolic and convection-diffusion equations.  The intent               is to show that the domain of dependence properties of the                      approximation scheme closely imitate those of the exact solution.               %%%      Plate models are two-dimensional mathematical models                   that greatly simplify the study of thin three-dimensional elastic               bodies.  They are commonly used by engineers to predict                         displacements and stresses of objects when various forces are                   applied.  The project aims to use a rigorous mathematical                       analysis to better understand the predictions of the models, to                 develop improved computational algorithms for numerically                       approximating the partial differential equations that comprise                  the model, and to compare the predictions the plate models make                 about properties of the three-dimensional object.  In particular,               a rigorous study is made of the boundary layer phenomena                        predicted by each model.  (The boundary layer is a region near                  the boundary of the object in which various physical quantities                 undergo rapid changes.)  Finally, the derivation of \"local\" error               estimates for a finite element method to approximate linear                     hyperbolic and convection-diffusion equations, which are used as                mathematical models in a variety of applications, will rigorously               show that certain important qualitative properties of the exact                 solution are closely imitated by the approximate solution                       computed by the finite element method.  This gives confidence to                the users of the method that the numerical results reliably                     predict the behavior of the physical quantities being modeled.",
