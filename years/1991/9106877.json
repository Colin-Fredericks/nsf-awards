 "awd_abstract_narration": "Higher organisms are dependent on precise cell to cell                          communication.  Cells communicate via specific receptors on their               surfaces.  One important receptor system in that for gonadotropin               releasing hormone (GnRH).  This receptor is found in the pituitary              gland at the base of the brain and controls, among other things,                the timing of the menstrual cycle.  An important, but incompletely              understood aspect of this cell to cell communication, concerns the              factors that control the number of receptors present on the cell.               If there are more receptors, the cell will manifest a greater                   response.  However, until recently, studying the synthesis of the               GnRH receptor has been difficult.  A variety of new techniques now              makes study of this area possible.  The planned research will use               a combination of approaches, including molecular biology and                    electrophysiology, to measure the level of the gene products for                the GnRH receptor in the cell and to investigate how that level is              controlled.  This will provide valuable information about the                   regulation of the amount of this receptor as well as other similar              receptors.//",
