 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prof. Ault is supported by a grant from the Experimental                        Physical Chemistry Program to isolate and characterize the                      important chemical intermediates which are produced during                      chemical vapor deposition processes by trapping them in an                      ultracold solid argon matrix and identifying their molecular                    structure using spectroscopy.  These studies are important to                   the understanding of the mechanisms involved in chemical vapor                  deposition, one of the primary techniques used for growing thin                 films and coatings used in the semiconductor industry for the                   fabrication of microelectronic devices and in solar energy                      conversion applications.                                                                                                                                        The unique capabilities of the matrix isolation technique will                  be exploited to isolate and characterize important chemical                     intermediates present during chemical vapor deposition (CVD)                    processes.  These results will enhance our knowledge of the                     chemical structure and bonding of these important, unusual                      chemical intermediates and will lead to an increased                            understanding of the homogeneous gas phase processes which are                  part of the reaction steps involved in CVD. The reaction                        pathways and intermediates will be examined for thermal and                     laser-induced CVD in III-V and II-VI semiconductor systems and                  also amorphous silicon.  Techniques auxiliary to matrix                         isolation will be employed as well, including cryogenic thin                    film formation, slow warmup spectroscopy, and gas phase                         infrared spectroscopy.",
