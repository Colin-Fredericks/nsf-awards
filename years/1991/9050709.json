 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to enhance the current status of                 design courses in biomedical and mechanical engineering by                      providing new equipment and techniques in prototype design.  The                new equipment and concepts to be introduced include:  computer                  aided machining (CAM), computer controlled data acquisition, and                prototype development by device testing.  This system will enhance              the current design course curriculum by providing the means of                  implementing design changes.  By using this system students may                 produce a prototype design, test the design, and make design                    changes by simply updating a computer file.  The successful                     execution of this project will result in abstract articles                      concerning the development of new techniques and laboratory manuals             to be made available to other institutions.  Students will benefit              by knowledge gained in using the new systems recently made                      commercially available, as well as through the additional amount                of practical design experience afforded by streamlining and                     automating the design process.  Most importantly, students will                 learn to improve and reinforce their designs, a process that is not             currently practical without the automated equipment.",
