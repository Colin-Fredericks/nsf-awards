 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goals of this project are to define the various senses in              which mathematics is applicable in the natural sciences and to                  establish whether or not the applicability of mathematics--in any               or all of the senses--poses a philosophical problem.  Recent                    philosophy of mathematics, where it deals at all with the                       applicability of mathematics, emphasizes metaphysical issues                    concerning the alleged gap between mathematical reality and                     physical reality.  Dr. Steiner is dealing with epistemic issues of              concern to physicists:  what Eugene Wigner has called the                       \"unreasonable effectiveness\" of (a) mathematical concepts and (b)               mathematical formalisms.  Unlike Wigner, however, Dr. Steiner is                focusing primarily on the role of mathematics in discovery:  (a)                how mathematical concepts allow physicists to make discoveries by               formal mathematical analogy; and (b) how mathematical formalisms                are, in the words of Heinrich Hertz, \"wiser than their                          discoverers,\" since they contain latent, unintended information.",
