 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Western legal institutions, the evolution of water rights seems              to follow stages of management regimes from open access through                 communal control to exclusive use.  This progression occurs as                  consumption increases in water-rich areas.  While there is                      empirical and theoretical support for such a pattern, to date this              observation has been made in western and well resourced contexts.               Drs. Buck and Gleason hypothesize that an alternative regime of                 correlative use--that is, having some rights, but not absolute                  ones--develops where resources are scarce, experience with central              authority strong, and public goods predominate.  Their study tests              this hypothesis in an arid region with Asian legal traditions:  the             Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya river basins of Soviet Central Asia.  The               research includes analysis of extant information on water rights                in the central Asian republics of the USSR, in-depth interviews                 with water users and managers in these field locations, and primary             data collection on legal, institutional, and environmental changes              in the region.                                                                                                                                                  Studying the emergence of water rights arrangements in Soviet                   Central Asia can enhance our understanding of the meaning of                    property rights and resources in the context of global change.                  Also, there have been few efforts to use collective goods theory                comparing the experience of communist and non-communist countries.              The fact that the Soviet system is currently in tremendous flux in              terms of legal, political, and economic transformations only adds               to the importance of this project.  The devolution of centralized               authority in the Soviet Union and the uncertainty surrounding newly             emerging governing arrangements make for a particularly timely and              critical research focus.",
