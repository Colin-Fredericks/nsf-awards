 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this US-Poland cooperative                             research project between Dr. Joseph Pesek of San Jose                           State University and Dr. Andrzej Stolyhwo of the                                Technical University of Gdansk is to further the                                development of the analytical capabilities of high                              performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE).  Furthering                       the development of HPCE should enable analysis of                               complex mixtures of biologically important compounds.                           The researchers intend to apply a parallel effort in two                        aspects of HPCE technology:  detector design and chemical                       modification of the separation capillary.  Their efforts                        to modify the laser light scattering detector (LLSD) to                         accommodate the conditions of the HPCE method could                             provide for universal detection of HPCE.  Because it is                         thought that some modified capillaries will be based on                         direct silicon-carbon bonds at the surface, the                                 researchers plan to use several reaction schemes. The                           more stable modified capillaries will be used for                               deactivation when electrophoretic mobility is the prime                         separation mechanism and to provide a partitioning                              medium when electrophoretic mobility cannot be used to                          achieve separation.  The results of this research should                        produce a high performance capillary electrophoresis                            technique with the versatility and reliability of gas                           chromatography.                                                                                                                                                 Funds for this project to further high performance                              capillary electrophoresis development are awarded                               through the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund II,                               Warsaw, in accordance with established guidelines.",
