 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a laboratory which provides the                           foundation for a course in biochemical engineering.  The                        biochemical engineering laboratory is comprised of four                         separate experimental modules providing direct experience with                  (1) Plant Tissue Cultivation, (2) Enzymatic Conversion of                       Biomass, (3) Microbial Fermentation and (4) Biological                          Wastewater Treatment.  In order to give students exposure to                    \"long-term\" project work, they are assigned to specific modules                 for the duration of each instructional quarter.  This addition                  significantly enhances the chemical engineering and science                     curricula by exposing students to topics within Biotechnology,                  providing cross-disciplinary instruction involving programs in                  chemistry and biology, and developing laboratory                                research/design projects.  Major pieces of equipment in the                     laboratory include gyratory shaker units, 5 L fermenters, large                 incubators and a laminar flow hood to be utilized for both                      microbial and plant tissue cultivation.  A biological                           film/activated sludge pilot plant unit is also provided for the                 wastewater treatment module in addition to circulating water                    baths for enzymatic hydrolysis experiments.Individual modules                   are also utilized in other laboratory coursework within the                     biology and chemistry programs.  Specifically, biology and                      chemistry laboratory curricula are being enhanced by                            fermentation and tissue cultivation capabilities afforded by                    the laboratory.  Biology coursework directed towards                            environmental science benefits from the biological wastewater                   treatment unit.  In addition, the biochemical engineering                       laboratory provides independent research projects for                           undergraduate students from both chemical engineering and                       science departments.",
