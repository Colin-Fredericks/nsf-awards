 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several key results were obtained in the Phase I study                          of an efficient acousto-optic resonator for GHz laser                           mode locking.  The results indicate that lithium                                niobate is one of the best resonator materials.  We                             believe that fabrication techniques can limit resonator                         gain at the higher frequencies.  This study also                                verified the closed loop electronic driver approach                             which worked well for lamp pumped lasers with cavity                            frequency below 200 MHz.  The diode pumped laser                                mode locking pulse width produced varied from 8 to                              13 picoseconds and appeared to be more stable when                              the cavity is shortened.                                                                                                                                        Phase II of the study will continue the work begun in                           Phase I.  We have improved our fabrication                                      techniques and will construct a higher gain resonator.                          The electronic driver concept will also be                                      implemented at the higher frequency.  Through joint                             activities with laser companies, we will determine the                          most stable cavity length of mode locked diode                                  pumped lasers.                                                                                                                                                  At the conclusion of this study, working mode locked                            systems that can provide stable pulses less than 10                             picoseconds wide will be completed for diode pumped                             lasers and for tunable solid state lasers.",
