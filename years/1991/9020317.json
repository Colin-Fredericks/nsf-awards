 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to advance ecological                    theory by starting from an empirical pattern of feeding types                   among six sawfly herbivore species, and developing a mechanistic                understanding of how the pattern relates to differences among                   species in their relationships with host plants, and natural                    enemies, and their resultant population dynamics.  The pattern                  involves a gradient of specificity in response to plant resources               from a highly specific shoot-galling sawfly to a more generalized               leaf-feeding sawfly.  Fourteen hypotheses address aspects of                    specificity in terms of within-plant variation, plant genotype,                 plan stree, plant age, and among plant species, in addition to                  the relative importance of induced plant defenses, herbivore                    competition, population stability, the role of natural enemies                  and three trophic-level interactions, and the distribution and                  colonization ability of the sawflies.  Methods will employ field                observations and experimental studies using potted willow plants                to investigate questions on life history characteristics of the                 species, the distribution and abundance of species, the                         relationships between female preference in oviposition and                      consequent larval performance, the colonizing ability of sawflies               and their parasitoids, and the role of induced plant defenses.                  This research is aimed at advancing knowledge by using a strongly               comparative approach on a monophyletic group of six sawfly                      species which range from species with stable population dynamics                to those that are more eruptive.  The mechanistic understanding                 of linkage among many traits of these plant-herbivore-enemy                     interactions is likely to yield an advance in ecological theory                 relating to such systems, with probable application to                          agricultural and forest systems.",
