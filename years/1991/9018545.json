 "awd_abstract_narration": "In particular strain of Drosophila melnogaster, hobo transposable               elements in the X chromosome are responsible for a high rate of                 mutations, and most of the mutations are associated with chromosome             rearrangements.  Two hobo elements at a time are involved in the                production of rearrangements, and our results suggest that the type             of rearrangements produced is determined by the orientation of the              elements--deleting the region marked by two elements in the same                orientation and inverting the region flanked by two elements in                 opposite orientation.  Also, one the hobo elements in the X                     chromosome is more active (active element) than the others (passive             elements) in rearrangement formation.  We propose to test these                 ideas by inserting the cloned hobo elements that can be mobilized               by the P transposase into a strain of the fly with colorless eyes.              The cloned hobo element is linked to a modified fly eye-color-gene,             so emergence of flies with pigmented eyes will signal the insertion             of the cloned hobo element.  Therefore, the inserted hobo sequence              can be transposed to a desired X-linked site by introducing a P                 transposase source and then eliminating it with another cross.  The             modified eye-color-gene is known for its sensitivity to the                     neighboring DNA sequences.  For this reason, changes in the eye                 color of the transformed flies may indicate the structural change               of the chromosome associated with the relocation of the inserted                hobo element.  The rearranged chromosomes detected in this manner               will be analyzed by cytogenetic and molecular methods.  The                     cytogenetic analyses include in situ hybridization of rearranged                and pre-rearranged chromosomes with a set of appropriate probes.                A sample of DNA sequences representing the rearrangement                        breakpoints will be cloned for molecular analyses to determine the              orientation of the hobo element in each of the rearrangement                    breakpoints.  The activities of the inserted active hobo element                will also be compared with those of the inserted passive elements.                                                                                              Information resulting from this study will enhance our                          understanding of the many ways whereby DNA structure can be                     modified and thereby modify gene expression.***",
