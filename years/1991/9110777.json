 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support preliminary research on the                         extent to which the pheriphytic biolayer of stream                              sediments mediates the transfer and transformation of                           polychlorinated biphenyls and to determine rates of their                       transformation and/or bioaccumulation and/or                                    transformation.  The research to be conducted will involve                      use of laboratory-scale artificial streams to assess                            interstream variability, to refine the technical protocols                      for determination of polychlorinated biphenyls in the                           sediment and periphytic layers, and to obtain preliminary                       data on the function of these layers in the transfer                            process.                                                                                                                                                        The proposal leading to this award was submitted in                             response to the Program Announcement NSF 90-121, Research                       Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards for Women                         Scientists and Engineers.  Results of this planning phase                       are expected to be utilized in developing a full research                       proposal for consideration of further support by the                            National Science Foundation.",
