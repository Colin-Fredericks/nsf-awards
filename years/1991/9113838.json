 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sociolegal scholars have come to recognize that understanding                   interrelations between legal and social processes requires an                   appreciation of global interactions.  There has been an imbalance               in transnational information flows in analyzing global processes                particularly in areas commonly classified as peripheral to                      modernized and industrialized countries.  The Law and Society                   Association, in an attempt to start correcting this imbalance, is               sponsoring a conference in Southeast Asia in the winter of 1991-92              with approximately 25 scholars, mostly Southeast Asians.                                                                                                        The conference will be held in Chiangmai, Thailand and will focus               on transnational dimensions of legal pluralism.  The conference                 has three purposes: (1) to build an intellectual foundation for                 future collaborative research between Southeast Asian and Western               sociolegal scholars by developing shared conceptual frameworks that             will enable scholars from different research traditions to                      appreciate and use each other's approaches, methods, and findings;              (2) to contribute to a developing globalist perspective on legal                pluralism by using a dual lens that considers both the influence                of transnational processes on local politics and epistemologies,                and the ways that local interpretive contexts reshape transnational             influences; and (3) to advance knowledge about transnational                    sociolegal processes in Southeast Asia by analyzing how various                 groups in the region have influenced each other in developing legal             responses to religious movements, demands for human rights, and                 international feminism.                                                                                                                                         By bringing transnational issues more explicitly to the forefront,              conference discussions will contribute toward developing a better               understanding of the origins and meanings of pluralism in Southeast             Asia and of the various interpretive contexts in which Southeast                Asian law and society can be viewed.  Conference papers and                     introductory essays will be published in an edited volume which                 will include a discussion of the theoretical issues involved in                 developing a globalist perspective on legal pluralism.  In addition             to contributing to our understanding of transnational sociolegal                issues, the conference will help to build and strengthen a                      community of international scholars.",
