 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new superconduction tunnel-junction receiver is being                    completed by the PI for use in ground-based measurements of                     stratospheric trace gases.  This receiver will operate in the                   260-280 GHz range with high sensitivity (low receiver noise                     temperature).  A separate 'back-end' spectrometer for this new                  receiver is not currently available.  This proposal seeks funding               for a commercially made dual acousto-opticspectrometer in a                     single economical package, having two simultaneously usable                     sections with different resolution and total bandpass.  This                    spectrometer would allow a flexible choice of high or low                       altitude mixing ratio retrievals, or a combined mid-mesospheric                 to low stratospheric coverage of appropriate species, and be                    fully portable in keeping with the intended program of field                    measurements in which the SIS receiver will be employed.  The                   acquisition of a new spectrometer, in addition to the aging                     filter-bank spectrometer now on hand, will allow flexible                       deployment of both receivers - e.g., one dedicated for 1 to 2                   years of round-the-year observations at the South Pole or another               remote site, while the other is used at one or more other field                 sites in connection with regular observations and the UARS                      correlative measurements program.",
