 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geophysical prospecting for mineral deposits depends on the                physical property contrast between various rock units and mineral               deposits.  A Broader understanding of the physical structure of                 the earth can be realized from rock physical data.  A small                     pocket sized instrument to measure the magnetic and electrical                  properties of rack samples under field conditions would be an                   immense aid to explorationists.  This need can now be fulfilled                 utilizing modern microelectronic technology.                                                                                                                         The research objective is to develop a small integrated                    meter for field use by explorationists.  Years of experience in                 physical property studies and instrumentation by our firm can                   make this realizable, resulting in the development of such a                    meter and demonstrate its scientific usefulness in geophysical                  exploration.                                                                                                                                                         The critical design must provide conversion of the outputs                 of magnetic and electric sensors for processing into meaningful                 geophysical data.  Innovative design will consist of a                          multiplicity of sensors independently attached to a master                      microprocessor controlled system that are interchangeable in the                field of for separately measuring the magnetic and electrical                   properties of rock samples.  Research will determine the best                   consistent with operational demands.  The effort proposed will be               directed toward solving these objectives.",
