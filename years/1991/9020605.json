 "awd_abstract_narration": "When highly active catalytic (C) subunits isolated from                         Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) interact                  with regulatory subunits to form intact ATCase molecules,                       composed of 6 catalytic and 6 regulatory polypeptide chains,                    there are striking changes in the C subunits leading to a                       dramatic decrease in enzyme activity.  Moreover, C subunits in                  the assembled complex undergo further extensive changes upon the                addition of substrates, leading a more active enzyme.  What are                 the structural and catalytic features which endow C trimers with                these special properties thereby causing the C trimer to differ                 markedly from most oligomeric enzymes?  Knowledge of the                        stability and possible fluctuations in structure would be                       invaluable.  What is the role of the long helix connecting the N-               terminal and C-terminal domains, each composed about 140 amino                  acids?  What is the significance of shared active sites in the C                trimer requiring joint participation of amino acid residues from                adjacent chains?   What role do interchain salt-links play in                   stabilizing C trimers and what is the role of distinct domains?                 What is the catalytic mechanism?  Answering these questions                     requires many different mutant forms constructed by site-directed               mutagenesis, determining the role of specific amino acids crucial               for catalytic activity and correct folding of the chains, using                 NMR spectroscopy to measure pK's of residues implicated in                      catalysis, analyzing the pattern of activity over a broad pH                    range to evaluate acid-base catalysis, studying isotope effects                 to elucidate the catalytic mechanism, and studying binding of                   transition state analog inhibitors.",
