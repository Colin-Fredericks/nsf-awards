 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new instruction-level parallel (ILP) architecture called XIMD is              proposed.  This architecture model can provide better performance               and efficiency for a broader range of applications than traditional             scalar uniprocessors including pipelined RISC.  The XIMD                        architecture employs multiple functional units and can support the              concurrent execution of a variable number of instruction streams.               The regularity and simplicity of its hardware implementation makes              it highly scalable and retargetable to accommodate diverse                      application code characteristics.  Currently, the XIMD architecture             model is being developed and evaluated.  A functional level                     simulator for a baseline XIMD architecture is being implemented.                Using this simulator the performance and efficiency of the XIMD can             be quantitatively analyzed.  A practical prototype XIMD machine is              also being designed.  Implementation feasibility and achievable                 performance using currently available parts are being assessed.                 Compilation methodology and techniques to support the XIMD                      architecture model are also being investigated.",
