 "awd_abstract_narration": "An experimental study of the single crystal constitutive equations              and polycrystal behavior will be carried out with emphasis on the               determination of grain interaction in the behavior of                           polycrystalline aggregates.  This will be achieved by measurements              of the local finite plastic deformation in each grain, as well as               global finite plastic deformation of the polycrystal.  Compression,             tension and biaxial compression experiments will be performed on                polycrystals with very large grain size (4-12 mm), thus making it               possible to determine local deformation in each grains.  Material               and lattice rotations will be measured using marked grid or small               strain gage rosettes and x-ray diffraction technique, respectively.             Test samples will be made from very high purity aluminum and each               sample may contain twenty to thirty grains in order to obtain a                 representative polycrystal behavior.  Experiments will also be                  performed on polycrystals (with regular or normal grain size) in                order to determine better constitutive models for finite plastic                deformation of these solids.",
