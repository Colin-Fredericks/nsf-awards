The award permits undergraduate students to participate in a                    research program in the materials field under the supervision of                faculty members actively engaged in research.  Students are                     recruited from  the student body at the State University of New                 York at Brockport, Erie Community College, and Monroe County                    Community College.  Strong emphasis is placed on recruitment of                 under-represented minority and economically disadvantaged groups.               Students are trained in operation and construction of scientific                instruments typically used for research in low temperature                      physics, planning of experiments, analysis of data,                             familiarization with the scientific literature, report writing,                 and oral presentation of results.  Funding is provided for                      participation by four students.  Research is performed on                       magnetic properties of rare earth doped fluoride glass systems                  with interest in spin glass systems.  The research is performed                 in teams of two students and one faculty member, and continues                  throughout the year.  Students present their results at national                conferences in low temperature physics.  The program enhances                   current research activities as well as adding to the number of                  scientifically trained individuals.  It is hoped that this hands-               on experience will serve as a stimulus to attract and retain                    highly-gifted students into careers in teaching and research.",
