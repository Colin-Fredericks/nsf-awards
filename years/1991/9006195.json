 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is to investigate how plant-associated               bacteria adapt to toxic levels of copper in the environment.                    Copper is an important bactericide used frequently for disease                  control on agricultural plants, and microbes associated with                    those plants are therefore exposed periodically to high levels of               this metal.  The development of copper resistance in plant                      pathogenic bacteria may pose a threat to the future use of copper               in plant disease control, and a better understanding of how this                resistance develops will be important for evaluating this threat.               In addition, knowledge of how plant microbes develop copper                     resistance may be useful in designing methods for detoxifying                   copper in contaminated wastewaters or for genetically modifying                 plants and beneficial microbes for increased tolerance to copper                in the agricultural environment.                                                     Microbial resistance to toxic metals such as mercury has                   been studied extensively, but copper resistance has received much               less attention.  Unlike many other heavy meals, copper is                       required by living organisms as a component of certain enzymes;                 at low levels it is beneficial, but at high levels it is toxic.                 The evolution of copper resistance in microbial populations must                therefore involve a balance between mechanisms to prevent copper                toxicity and the ability to maintain enough copper for cell                     growth.  Dr. Cooksey isolated copper-resistant bacteria from an                 agricultural system where copper compounds are routinely applied                to plants for bacterial disease control.  Genes encoding copper                 resistance have been cloned and characterized.  This proposal                   concerns the biochemical function of the cloned genes, their                    genetic regulation, and their relationship to homologous genes                  that have recently been detected in several bacterial species.                  Dr. Cooksey has hypothesized that the copper resistance genes                   have evolved from genes that produce normal copper-containing                   proteins.  These proteins may have been modified to bind more                   copper and prevent the toxic metal from reaching high                           concentrations in solution inside the bacterial cell.  Since                    copper is essential for growth, however, the resistance genes                   should be expressed only when toxic levels of copper are present;               Dr. Cooksey has shown that the resistance genes are copper-                     inducible, and this proposal addresses basic mechanisms of                      copper-inducible gene expression.",
