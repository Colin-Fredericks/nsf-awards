 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mary Ellen Rudin has exercised enormous influence on the field             of set-theoretic topology, especially since the publication of her              lectures on the subject at a regional conference of the American                Mathematical Society in 1972.  The occasion of her retirement -                 merely from teaching, not from research or the communication of                 knowledge - provides an opportunity to reflect on where the field               has been, where it is, and where it should be going.  The mechanism             proposed is a conference at which many of the invited speakers will             discuss precisely these questions for the subfields in which Rudin              has been significantly involved.  These comprise a large fraction               of the entire field of general topology.  Rudin's 1972 lectures set             the agenda for set-theoretic topology for more than 10 years;  this             conference, dedicated to Mary Ellen Rudin and her work, to be held              at the University of Wisconsin in June, 1991, should have a                     similarly stimulating effect.",
