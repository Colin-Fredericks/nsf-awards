 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific psychology has grown and produced a number of                        discrete domains of research.  Although the Psychology                          Department offers courses that cover these domains adequately,                  there are presently no laboratory sections which accompany any                  of its upper-level courses. In response to the growing need to                  introduce further experience in empirical, quantitative                         analysis of behavior, the Psychology Department is presently                    making changes that permit the addition of laboratory courses                   that expand on the foundations developed in the lower-level                     Experimental Psychology course.  The additional laboratory                      courses in learning and Physiological Psychology will allow the                 Department to better utilize its faculty members and existing                   equipment.Laboratories in Learning and Physiological Psychology                 often involve special techniques that require supportive                        equipment and instruments for their methods and procedures.  If                 this equipment is acquired, it would allow the Department to                    satisfy increasing student demand for laboratory experience in                  scientific aspects of psychology.",
