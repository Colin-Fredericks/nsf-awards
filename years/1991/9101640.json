 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many interesting optimization problems are nonsmooth, i.e. either          the function to be optimized or an associated constraint is not                 differentiable on some part of its domain.  The main goal of this               project is the design of efficient algorithms for some important                classes of nonsmooth optimization problems.  This is possible only by           taking full advantage of the structure which is present.  Because of            the lack of smoothness, standard algorithms are not applicable.                      The investigation primarily addresses three issues.  The first is          the optimization of eigenvalues of symmetric matrices which depend on           parameters.  Typically, solutions involve multiple eigenvalues which            are not smooth functions of the matrix elements.  Applications of               interest include the optimal design of columns and plates against               buckling.  The second major issue is the design of methods for a broad          problem class:  convex composite optimization.  By appropriate                  parameterization of the generalized gradient set it is hoped to obtain          efficient methods with superlinear convergence.  The third issue                concerns non-Lipschitz optimization problems involving eigenvalues of           nonsymmetric matrices.  For example, an important application arising           in the stability of control systems is to minimize the spectral radius          of a matrix.",
