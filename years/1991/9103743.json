 "awd_abstract_narration": "A closed aspherical manifold is a compact connected manifold               whose universal cover is contractible.  Let M and N be closed                   aspherical manifolds, and let F be an isomorphism of their                      fundamental groups.  Borel conjectured that F is always induced                 by a homeomorphism f of the manifolds.  The investigator, in                    collaboration with L. E. Jones of SUNY-Stony Brook, intends to                  try to settle this conjecture.  Partial results by the                          investigator and Jones were the main results of the previous                    N.S.F. grant (DMS-8801312).  The project also relates to problems               in differential geometry and algebraic K-theory; e.g., does Wh(G)               vanish for every torsion-free group G?                                               Manifolds are locally Euclidean spaces, which makes them                   very natural objects of study.  For example, the physical world                 in which we live has three space dimensions and (in some                        contexts) a time dimension, making it either a three-dimensional                or four-dimensional manifold.  Thus the instant project to                      understand better the structure of manifolds might even have                    cosmological significance.",
