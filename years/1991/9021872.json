 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Academic Research Facilities Modernization Program (ARFMP)                 award from the Research Facilities Office provides funds to the                 Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History for the replacement                of the Museum's Biochemical Systematics Laboratory which houses                 research and research training activities in the biological and                 earth sciences on the evolution of organisms.  The Biochemical                  Systematics Laboratory was constructed in 1975 and last renovated               in 1985.  The need for its replacement by an expanded facility is               well justified and cost-effective.  The replacement facility is                 designed for research and research training in the area of                      biochemical and molecular systematics.  The ARFMP grant of                      $103,992 and $360,258 provided by the grantee as cost sharing                   will be used to modernize these research and research training                  facilities.  The replacement facility will permit the utilization               of the Museum's extensive molecular data bank that is of                        importance to the conduct of cutting-edge research in the area of               biochemical and molecular systematics.                                                                                                                          This award contributes to the infrastructure of science by                      providing an improved environment for research and for the                      training of quality graduate students.  Los Angeles County Museum               of Natural History curators are collaborating with several                      universities in southern California to provide training in the                  area of systematics where shortages in professionals are                        anticipated.",
