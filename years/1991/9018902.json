 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant cells are unique, among eukaryotic cells, in that they                 contain two organelles, the mitochondria and the chloroplasts,                  thought to be derived from prokaryotic endosymbionts in an                      ancestral organism.  Most of the proteins in these organelles are               encoded in the nuclear genome and are synthesized in the cytoplasm.             These proteins are produced as precursors, with N-terminal                      extensions of their polypeptide chains known as transit peptides.               These precursors bind to receptors on the two organelles and are                transported inside, where the transit peptides are proteolytically              removed.  Although the two import systems are similar in many                   respects, the transit peptides seem capable of conferring complete              targetting specificity, in vivo, if they are fused to a \"passenger              protein.\"  Analysis of the structure of the two types of transit                peptides have revealed differences related to proposed domain                   structures.   The aim of this project is to determine what                      structural properties of the transit peptides confer targetting                 specificity, distinguishing them, if possible, from properties                  required simply for import into the isolated organelles.  In order              to do this, artificial transit peptide / passenger protein fusions              will be prepared and assayed for their ability to be imported into              isolated plant organelles and in transgenic tobacco plants.  The                prototype transit peptide sequences will be derived from a                      chloroplast pre-protein of pea and from a mitochondrial pre-protein             from Arabidopsis.                                                                                                                                                  The project addresses a very important problem in cell biology,              that is, intracellular compartmentation.  In order for cells to                 function properly, it is necessary that the macromolecules of the               cell be organized in such a way as to facilitate cellular                       processes.  This compartmentation is achieved through molecular                 specificity and recognition at the cellular level.  In the case of              the two organelles under study in this project, mitochondria and                chloroplasts, the macromolecular components of each consist of a                mixture of nuclear gene encoded and organelle-specific gene encoded             products.  The two organelles have striking similarities: they                  contain electron-transporting protein complexes and catalyze                    bioenergetic reactions; they contain specific DNA, RNA, and                     functional ribosomes; the internal spaces are separated from the                cytoplasm by a double set of membranes; and the mechanisms by which             nuclear-encoded proteins enter the organelles seem very similar.                However, nuclear chloroplast proteins do not find their way into                mitochondria, and nuclear mitochondrial proteins do not find their              way into chloroplasts.  The molecular mechanism which confers this              critical organelle specificity to the import process is unknown.                This set of experiments is likely to shed light on this important               question.",
