The panel will report on                scientific and technological opportunities, identifying and                     recommending areas in which investments of resources should be                  concentrated, and, as well, those of diminishing relative                       interest and promise.  It will address manpower, instrumentation,               facility, and funding issues, not only in the context of                        intellectual challenges, but also in the context of identified                  national needs such as science education; defense, energy and                   environmental applications; industrial and technological                        competitiveness, and appropriate aspects of human health and                    welfare.  Findings will be presented in a report which meets the                standards of the NAS, and which will be published by the National               Academy Press.",
