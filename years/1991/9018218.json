 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of several complex variables is a broad and active               area of research, and the subject has connections with many other               important areas of mathematics.  In the past two decades                        especially, very rapid progress has been made on a large number of              problems of the subject.  Rather than survey the field as a whole,              this Symposium will concentrate only on certain aspects, in                     particular, on the detailed study of the boundary behavior of                   holomorphic functions and mappings in domains in n-dimensional                  complex space, on the construction of smooth domains in complex                 space or complex manifolds which provide examples or                            counterexamples, and on the connection of complex analysis in                   several variables and harmonic analysis on nilpotent groups.                         This grant will partially fund a week-long Symposium on                    Complex Analysis to be held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison              from June 2-7, 1991.  In addition to the 15 invited hour lectures,              there will be opportunity for shorter talks, seminars and more                  informal discussions.  The Symposium will bring together leading                researchers and graduate students in the area of several complex                variables.  The texts of the invited lectures, as well as other                 contributed papers will be refereed and then published as a                     collection, so the results of the Symposium will be available to                the general mathematical community.",
