 "awd_abstract_narration": "During preliminary field reconnaissance in 1990, Dr. John Hoopes                located 22 prehistoric sites on and around Golfito bay, Costa                   Rica.  Ceramic and lithic artifacts indicate that these cover a                 time range from 500 B.C. to 600 A.D.  Among the most important                  discoveries were two large shell midden sites with excellent                    preservation of organic materials.  This is rare in wet tropical                regions. Each of these sites contained high concentrations of                   well-preserved mammal, bird, fish and human bone in addition to                 shell. Large quantities of charcoal and pottery were also                       present.  With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Hoopes                  will conduct excavation at both shell middens. He will collect                  samples of a wide variety of organic as well as inorganic                       remains.  A team of specialists has been assembled to analyze                   these and it will place specific emphasis on those aspects which                will permit reconstruction of prehistoric environmental and                     subsistence patterns.  Lake core sediments will also be collected               to allow placement of these sites into a broader                                paleoenvironmental context.  Finally, a preliminary survey of                   local caves and rockshelters will be conducted to search for                    sites dating to the earliest periods of occupation of the region.                                                                                                While considerable archaeological attention has been focussed on               the development of agriculture in temperate regions, relatively                 little is known about how human populations adapted in tropical                 areas.  Yet it is clear that chiefdoms and complex societies                    developed in such regions in Middle America and the goal of this                research is to learn about the subsistence base which allowed                   this to happen.  It is also known that prehistoric groups in the                American tropics utilized both root crops as well as maize, but                 it is not clear when the latter was adopted and the role it may                 have played in the development of social complexity.  It is not                 lack of archaeological interest but rather poor preservation                    which has hampered research and what makes Dr. Hoopes sites so                  important is the excellent preservation of both faunal and floral               remains.                                                                                                                                                        In addition to the regional knowledge which will emerge, this                   research is important because it will increase our understanding                of long-term human adaptations to the humid tropics.  It will                   also provide insight into how tropical forests may be used on a                 sustained basis.  Given the involvement of graduate students, the               research will contribute to the training of young scientists.",
