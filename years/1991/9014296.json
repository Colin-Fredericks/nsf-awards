 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will implement a dual-channel chopping photometer for                use on the completely renovated 0.76-m Keeler reflector at                      Allegheny Observatory.  A dual-channel chopping photometer is                   ideally suited to the observatory's needs because the primary                   interest is in colors in their photometry program.  Furthermore,                observations of stellar colors are insensitive to the conditions                of non-photometric weather, which is common at Allegheny                        Observatory.  According to record books at Allegheny Observatory,               there are an average of 120 nights per year which are suitable                  for dual-channel chopping photometry.                                                                                                                           Some astrometric target stars are variable; their light curves                  will be observed so that a search for any type of correlations                  between magnitude and astrometric position can be made.                         Photometric observations of stars in new astrometric regions will               provide the astrometric program with an efficient method for                    choosing appropriate reference stars.",
