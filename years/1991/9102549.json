 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator undertakes studies aimed at gaining an                    understanding of the global qualitative behavior of solutions of                some ecological models with delays or diffusions.  These fall in                three parts: (1) finite-dimensional systems of ordinary                         differential equations, (2) delay differential equations, and (3)               diffusive systems with time delays.  The principal themes of the                research are the fundamental problems of finding various criteria               for the uniform persistence of these considered systems, the                    global stability of steady states, and the existence of periodic                solutions and spatial patterns.  In particular, the investigator                will study some mathematical models of populations dispersing                   among patches in heterogeneous environments, where various kind                 of interactions will be considered. For systems with more than                  two populations, one of the main objectives is to find concrete                 conditions under which all populations will coexist in the long                 term.  For two-species interaction models, global stability of                  steady states, existence of periodic solutions or spatial                       patterns will be main concerns.      Time delays and space                      variations constitute integral components of most ecological,                   biological, physiological, chemical, physical, economic and                     atmospheric processes.  The planet as a habitat of mankind and                  other species has become too small to support an extravagant                    exploitation of its resources.  The damages are inevitable and                  usually occur with time delays in heterogeneous environments; no                experiments are possible to fully simulate these effects.  In                   order to better understand and control such processes, it is thus               necessary and important to study them mathematically.                           Unfortunately, current mathematical techniques are far from                     adequate to handle these numerous real problems.  The proposed                  research will lead to an improved understanding of the dynamical                interplay of the effects of time delays and diffusions.  In                     particular, the final results can be useful to a wide spectrum of               people like ecologists, engineers, system scientists and others                 who plan for a better management of the planet and life.",
