 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the development of a theoretical              framework based on which a software tool can be developed to                    program and design systematically bit-level processor arrays.  The              resulting software tool should be portable and explore fully the                parallelism at bit-level and word-level which current system                    software of bit level systems lacks or does not fully explore.  It              can reduce significantly the programming burdens on users and                   improve the situation that only a low percentage of the performance             offered by hardware is utilized because of the insufficient support             of system software.  The class of algorithms for which the                      theoretical framework is developed are frequently used in digital               signal processing, image processing and other scientific                        computations.  This project is divided into three steps: (1)                    expanding the conventional algorithm at word-level into bit-level               to explore the parallelism at bit-level; (2) analyzing the                      parallelism and dependence structure of these n-dimensional (often              four or five dimensional) bit-level algorithms (algorithms with n               nested loops); (3) finding time-optimal mapping into (k-l)                      dimensional (often two dimensional) bit-level processor arrays                  without computational conflicts based on the dependence structure.",
