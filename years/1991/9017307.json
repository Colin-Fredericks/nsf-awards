 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Arthur Jelinek will               conduct three seasons of archaeological research at the site of                 La Quina which is located in the Charente region of France.  This               important Mousterian site has been the focus of this group for                  several years and the results to date well justify continued                    excavation.  The site itself contains a series of stratified                    deposits which are extremely rich in both faunal and cultural                   remains.  Human skeletal material has also been recovered.  To                  date, approximately 6,000 lithic objects and 11,000 bones have                  been catalogued.  Over the next three field seasons, the team                   will expand the excavations in all levels.  Several approaches                  will be attempted to provide absolute dates for each level and                  archaeological materials will be analyzed to shed insight into                  Mousterian cultural and subsistence practices.                                                                                                                  Mousterian culture dates from the most recent part of the                       Pleistocene (Ice Age) and is associated with Neanderthal peoples                who were the immediate predecessors to modern humans.  In recent                years, these Neanderthals have been the subject of intense                      archaeological debate.  Some have argued that this group acted in               ways significantly different from the succeeding Upper                          Paleolithic groups and lacked the capacity for modern culture.                  Others argue that Mousterian industries and the behaviors they                  reflect are quite complex.  Unfortunately, little well collected                data exists to permit examination of the issue and in this                      context the site of La Quina is particularly important because of               the rich cultural materials it contains.  The large faunal                      assemblage should permit reconstruction of Mousterian hunting                   techniques and demonstrate how these changed and developed over                 time.                                                                                                                                                           This research is important for several reasons.  It will yield                  data of interest to a large group of archaeologists.  It will                   provide insight into the background from which physically modern                humans emerged and shed light on the process which led to this                  development.  Because Dr. Jelinek includes many students in this                project, it should aid in the scientific recruitment.",
