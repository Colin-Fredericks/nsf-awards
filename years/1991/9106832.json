 "awd_abstract_narration": "Renewed support for Ewing's research in sensing of                              neurotransmitters and related analytical chemistry comes from                   the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry                   Division and the Synaptic Mechanisms Program in Behavioral and                  Neural Sciences.  Research will include assembly of an                          electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometer, which will be                    used to identify and quantify lipids and phospholipids from                     intact cell membranes.  In addition, neuropeptides from single                  transmitter vesicles will be identified.  Mass spectral                         measurements will complement microelectrochemical detection of                  neurotransmitters for characterization of neural transmission                   and transduction.                                                                                                                                               %%%                                                                                                                                                             While a variety of small molecules are known to transmit                        signals from one nerve cell to the next, a variety of larger                    molecules are also important in understanding neurotransmission                 and nerve cell function.  Among these are fatty substances                      (lipids and phospholipids) in cell membranes, whose composition                 varies along the cell membrane and with the state of the cell.                  The use of mass spectrometry will allow identification and                      structure elucidation of small numbers of these molecules from                  single cells.  In addition, peptides (small chains or oligomers                 of amino acids) which transmit or modify transmission of                        neuronal signals will be identified and sequenced.",
