 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701001  WELLER    Tiger moths are known for their brightly colored adults and woolly bear larvae. These moths also have fascinating life history traits such as complex associations with toxic hostplants, extreme mimicry of wasps and other insects, and elaborate courtship sequences involving both scent and sound.  An understanding of the phylogenetic history of tiger moths is critical if scientists are to understand when, how and why these traits appeared.  For many groups of moths, however, phylogenetic histories are not, or are poorly, understood.    In this research, Susan Weller and doctoral candidate Rebecca Simmons will investigate the phylogenetic history of wasp mimicry and male scent structures in a group of tiger moths called the Myrmecopsis group (Euchromiinae).  The phylogeny of the group will be reconstructed from internal morphological characters not associated with mimicry and courtship. Data will be gathered by examining specimens borrowed from museums with major holdings. Once the phylogeny of this group is determined, the history of mimicry and courtship structures will be traced on this framework. This study should yield information leading to an understanding of how, when and why complex behaviors appeared in various groups of animals.",
