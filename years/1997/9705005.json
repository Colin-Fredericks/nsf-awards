 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705005  Calini    This project concerns the connection between completely integrable partial   differential equations and the topological properties of knotted closed   curves which arise from models of vortex filament evolution. The principal   investigator plans to show that questions regarding knot types, mechanisms   for knotting and unknotting, stability of knot formations and classification   of knots by means of standard representatives can be effectively addressed   in this context. The two main tools that will be used are the periodic theory   of relevant integrable equations (among which are the Continuous   Heisenberg Model, the focusing Nonlinear Schroedinger and the sine-  Gordon equations) with periodic boundary conditions, and the theory of   Backlund transformations. The PI will use constructive methods for   multiphase solutions to generate large classes of knot representatives and   will study a precise relation between their knot type and the associated   Floquet spectrum both theoretically and computationally. Backlund   transformations will be used to investigate possible mechanisms for   topological changes, to construct self-intersecting curves that represent   transitions between different knot types and to produce examples of knots   that are realized by curves with special properties (such as curves of   constant torsion).    Complex structures in the form of knotted and linked loops are present in   many phenomena of the physical world: tornadoes, plasma loops and   magnetic arches in stellar atmospheres display complicated vortex   formations; mitochondrial DNA is a coiled, often knotted, molecule;   bacteria strands are found to form tangled loops; links and knots are   observed in certain stable mixtures of chemical media. This project   concerns the connection between evolution equations whose structure is   well-understood and the properties of knotted loops which arise in the study   of vortex filament dynamics and DNA modeling. The principal goal of this   inve stigation is the development of the mathematical tools necessary to   effectively address questions regarding the mechanisms for knotting and   unknotting, the stability of knot formations and the classification of knots   and links. Such issues are gaining great importance in a number of applied   fields: for example, an understanding of the complex vortex structures in the   solar crown can provide information on how the sun's magnetic activity   affects the earth's climate, while topological changes such as loop creation,   knotting and unknotting appear to be at the heart of the replication   mechanism of the DNA molecule, a fundamental question in cancer   research.",
