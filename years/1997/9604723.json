 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604723  Handa         The hippocampus is a forebrain structure of the  temporal lobe, constituting an important part of the limbic  system and of the Papez's circuit.  Its general anatomy and  connections to other regions of the brain are well defined.  Functions that depend upon the hippocampus are recognition  of novelty, learning and memory.  Indeed it is believed that  this brain region serves as a spatial map that helps us  remember where we have been.   Recently, it has been shown  that the hippocampus contains a high concentration of  androgen receptors suggesting that testosterone may  influence this region of the brain.    Moreover, sex  differences in cognitive functions have been reported.  Despite recent data demonstrating that the hippocampus is a  major target for androgen and there are male-female  differences in spatial memory and in learning, few studies  have examined the neural mechanisms by which androgen can  alter hippocampal function or hippocampal cell parameters.  Recently, Dr. Handa showed that androgens influence  hippocampal function by altering the n-methyl-d-aspartate  (NMDA) receptors, which are important for glutamate  neurotransmission and the underlying sensitivity to  neurotoxic insults such as anoxia and chronic stress.  He  will now combine his expertise in molecular and cellular  neuroendocrinology with Dr. Beck's talents in  neurophysiology to carry out an integrative series of  studies to examine the effects of androgen on hippocampal  synaptic plasticity. They will examine the effects of  androgen on hippocampal cell morphology, NMDA receptor  composition and function, and enzyme activity.  The results  from these studies will provide new knowledge on the role  that steroid hormones play in modulating a brain region that  occupies a central role in regulating multiple non-  reproductive behaviors.",
