 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604321  Abbott    Today, 2.3 million couples in USA are infertile.  One third  of these cases are due to ovarian-related infertility in  women, and psychosocial causes of anovulation contribute to  20-30% of these ovarian impairments.  Cooperatively breeding  animals (animal societies in which more individuals than the  single breeding pair aid in raising the breeders' offspring)  provide unique models for the investigation of  psychosocial  control of ovulation in females.  Dr. Abbott and Saltzman  are studying a species in which mature, socially subordinate  females exhibit profound suppression of ovulation and  behavior.  This socially induced infertility is not due to  generalized stress and can be readily reversed, depending  upon a female's social status.  By employing specific  behavioral and physiological techniques, Dr. Abbott and Dr.  Saltzman will examine the neuroendocrine mechanisms by which  animals reverse their ability to reproduce.  Using state-of-  the-art  technology in push-pull perfusion, they will  measure gonadotropin releasing-hormone from the hypothalamus  to determine whether transitory elevations in release of  this important hormone mediates the behaviorally-induced  transition from the anovulatory state to the onset of  cyclicity.   The results from these studies will elucidate  the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying the  psychosocial control of fertility  in females.  This basic  knowledge will lead to a better understanding of  infertility.  The results are also important in conservation  efforts to help understand problems associated with  fertility in endangered species.",
