 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710483  Sosnowski  Ion implantation, an essential technology for the doping and fabrication of all Si integrated circuits, is now facing critical research and development challenges.  Principal amongst these is the production of ultra-low energy beams and the concomitant formation of ultra-shallow junctions.  The research challenges can be broadly defined into two areas (1) the production and transport of low energy beams and (11) determining the dopant range and defect production in close proximity to the surface.  The research described here will be carried out by a collaboration of NJIT, a university with expertise in ion beams and microelectronics research, Bell Laboratories of Lucent Technologies, a force in Si integrated circuit research and development, and Eaton, a leading manufacturer of ion implantation tools.    Boron implantation poses the most severe challenge for ultra-shallow junction formation because of its inherently large range and the phenomenon of transient enhanced diff-usion.  Large molecules such as decaborane, BlOH14, offer a unique way of performing ultra-shallow implantation without the use of very low accelerating voltages as the kinetic energy is partitioned proportionally to the constituent atomic mass.  Research at NJIT and Eaton will involve the construction of ion sources and beam lines to determine the optimum conditions for the generation and transport of these fragile molecules.  Concurrently, research at NJIT and Bell Labs will focus on the implantation of these molecules into Si, damage formation and electrical junction formation.  Analysis of the implanted samples will involve the dopant marker layer techniques that the Bell Labs group have used to unravel the mechanism of transient enhanced diffusion at medium energies.  A crucial aspect here will be to understand transient enhanced diffusion for these large molecules and equivalent atomic implantation at close proximity to the Si surface.    The benefits of this research will be manifested on several fro nts.  A fundamental knowledge of the mechanism of generation and stability of beams of decaborane will help define the road map for future generations of low energy implantation machines.  A knowledge of the range and transient enhanced diffusion of large molecule implantation, and equivalent atomic implantation, will help resolve fundamental questions regarding dopant clustering and defect production contiguous to the surface.  This information, which is essential for the design of future generations of devices, would be a milestone for implantation and defect research.  ***",
