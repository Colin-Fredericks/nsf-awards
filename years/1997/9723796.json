 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve cells use calcium ions to convert electrical signals  into biochemical changes within the cell.  Electrical  activity increases intracellular calcium.  Once inside the  cell, calcium acts as a messenger carrying information to  various parts of the cell interior where it acts to trigger  processes ranging  from gene expression to the release of neurotransmitters and  hormones.  Only during electrical stimulation, or during  certain pathologies, is the calcium concentration in the  cell elevated.  Under normal conditions the intracellular  calcium concentration is kept very low by a complex series  of pathways which  pump calcium out of the cell.  The objective of this  proposal is to study the modulation of three calcium  regulatory processes.  1)  Within the cell are specialized  organelles that take up, store and release calcium.  The  signals that regulate the coupling of electrical activity at  the cell surface to the release of calcium from these  internal stores will be studied.  2)  Another intracellular  organelle that can take up calcium is the mitochondrion, the  cell's powerhouse.  Using recently developed methods to  measure calcium within  the mitochondrion, factors that influence mitochondrial  calcium uptake will be determined.  3)  Calcium loads are  ultimately removed from the cell by pumps embedded in the  cell-surface membrane.  There are many genetic varieties of  these pumps. It is not known how these variants differ  functionally.  The functional characteristics of individual  pump variants, particularly their sensitivity to modulation,  will be determined.  To achieve these goals neurons will be  grown in culture (in a dish), and studied individually with  optical and electrophysiological instrumentation developed  by the investigator.  This work  will increase our understanding of how neurons process  information at the molecular and cellular level, and may  reveal new targets for drugs.",
