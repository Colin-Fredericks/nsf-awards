 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes a Capstone Experience for senior undergraduate geoscience students.  The major component is equipment for a networked Collaborative Computer Laboratory housed in the new sciences center.  The laboratory is the major resource for an integrated course including computer, field work, laboratory, analytical, and publishing experiences for undergraduate seniors in geology and anthropology.  This Capstone Experience has a strong interdisciplinary component (geology, environmental sciences, and anthropology) and involves other universities and K 12 students.  This project focuses on Maine and neighboring regions and builds on the strengths of the university and opportunities provided by Maine's geological and geographic setting.  The result of this project (MAINEly Geology) is an interactive, multimedia presentation of geological and anthropological aspects of Maine that is available as a World Wide Web site and published as a CD-ROM.  It is a geological resource for other institutions in the Nation, as well as for Maine's people, and represents a model of a student-centered, inquiry-based, active learning experience by undergraduate students.",
