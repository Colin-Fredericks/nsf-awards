 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Statler    A four-year effort in  research and educational activities in the  newly established astrophysics group in the Physics and Astronomy  Department at Ohio University (OU) will be carried out.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the new opportunities that  will be made available to graduate and undergraduate students and  to K-12 students and teachers in the region around OU.    The focus of the research component is the origin of elliptical  galaxies. Whether they formed through late major mergers of  spiral galaxies, by early multiple mergers of many small  protogalactic pieces, or by a combination of processes is  unclear. The evidence for or against any formation scenario is  ambiguous because it is not yet understood what observable  dynamical properties of the galaxies are necessary and unique  consequences of the possible mechanisms. But the distribution of  stars (and, where present, gas) in position and in velocity make  up a \"fossil record\" of the structural layers laid down in the  galaxy over time. A variety of activities in observation,  modeling, and numerical simulation are described with the intent  of reading and interpreting this record. Among these are a  groundbased observational program to map the stellar kinematic  fields of nearby ellipticals at unprecedented depth, spatial  resolution, and accuracy; a modeling program to determine the  intrinsic shape distribution; numerical simulations to identify  the stellar dynamical configurations implied by various formation  processes and to study the origins of kinematically distinct  cores; searches for hidden disks or other kinematically distinct  components; and spectroscopic and photometric Hubble Space  Telescope studies of ellipticals at moderate and high redshift.    The educational component comprises graduate and undergraduate  research, major revisions to the undergraduate astronomy  curriculum at OU, and two significant K-12 outreach initiatives.  A school visitation program will be carried out tha t will  bring  OU scientists into classrooms in the region to foster science  involvement and science literacy.  Visits will be coordinated  with teachers to blend the presentation into the existing lesson  plans; supplemental materials for teachers will be developed to  assist in class preparation. A summer research internship program  that will bring K-12 science teachers to OU and involve them  actively in research will be initiated.  One teacher applicant  per summer, for four summers, will be adopted as a junior member  of one of the Physics and Astronomy Department's research groups.  Firsthand experience with real science will contribute to better  science teaching in K-12 classrooms.",
