Proposal Number:  IBN-9723876             Neurochemical Analysis of Motivated Behavior                                  The long-term goal of this project is to explore how  chemical systems in the brain control motivated behavior.  Among motivated behaviors, ingestive behaviors such as  feeding and drinking have formed the focus of such studies.  To develop general principles to explain the control of  motivated behaviors, the results from studies on a variety  of behaviors (e.g., reproductive behavior, aggression) are  needed.  To date, little is known about the neurochemistry  of the motivational components of female mating behavior.  We have pursued studies showing a link between the  mesolimbic dopamine system and the control of the incentive  (e.g., reward) properties of female mating behavior, using  hamsters as our experimental model.  The studies in this  proposal are designed to further pursue this link between  neural dopamine pathways and female sexual behavior in three  specific ways.  First, we intend to continue microdialysis  studies demonstrating proximal relationships between female  reproductive function and extracellular dopamine levels in  the nucleus accumbens.  We have demonstrated that  experienced female hamsters show higher, and more sustained  extracellular dopamine levels during interactions with males  compared with inexperienced females.  As sensitization of  responsiveness is one property of dopamine neurons  repeatedly activated with drugs, we will explicitly test  whether this augmentation of nucleus accumbens dopamine  levels in experienced female hamsters reflects a sensitized  response of these neurons to stimuli received during mating  encounters.  This would be the first such demonstration of  sensitization of dopamine neurons resulting from the  expression of a naturalistic behavior.  Our second goal is  to provide a broader neurological perspective on the  relationship be tween dopamine and female mating behavior.  To date, the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum are the  only brain regions in which in vivo measurements of dopamine  during mating encounters have been taken.  We intend to  extend this analysis to other behaviorally-relevant  dopaminergic terminal fields, such as the frontal cortex,  medial preoptic area, and amygdala.  In the context of these  experiments we will determine the degree to which dopamine  in each of these areas is related to the expression of  female mating behavior or some other factor associated with  social encounters.  A key issue in the interpretation of  these behavioral findings centers around the degree to which  individual dopaminergic neurons project to multiple targets.  That is, do similarities or differences in dopaminergic  activity in each terminal field derive from the activity of  the same or different dopamine neurons.  This is an  unresolved issue for any species, and we propose to  determine quantitatively the degree to which individual  dopamine neurons innervate multiple terminal fields.  Together these studies will provide a framework for defining  how functional dopaminergic pathways regulate different  components of female reproductive behavior, providing a  basis for developing generalizations of the role of dopamine  in motivated behavior.",
