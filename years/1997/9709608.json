 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three principal investigators, Michael Reed and Harold Layton of the Duke Mathematics Department and Jacob Blum of the Duke Department of Cell Biology are continuing their research programs  which apply mathematical analysis and machine computation to specific biological problems. Blum and Reed investigate partial differential equations that arise in cellular transport processes and study  information processing in nuclei of the auditory brainstem. Layton  studies the physiological functions and regulatory mechanisms of the kidney. Several new research projects are underway with colleagues at other institutions including: new models for cell signaling; new applications of computational fluid dynamics to anguilliform swimming and microvascular flows; and the mathematical analysis of large time delays in ordinary and partial differential equations.    The purpose of this project is to increase the mathematical expertise that is available for the solution of biological and biomedical problems.  This is accomplished by training undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral  associates in the mathematical methods and modelling techniques which can give valuable information about biological systems. Strong efforts are made to develop research collaborations between mathematicians, these trainees, and biological researchers in industry, at medical centers, and in government laboratories.    Funding for this activity will be provided by the Division of Mathematical Science,  the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the Division Of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems.",
