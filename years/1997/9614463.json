 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614463  Chester         This research is for collaborative research between Columbia  and Texas A&M Universities on the failure processes in the New  Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) of the Central U.S. through  characterization of microearthquake clustering.  Earlier analysis  is to be extended to clustered events throughout the NMSZ.  Most  clusters are located near the kink in the central segment, or near  the junctions of that segment with other major segments.  The  spatial/temporal clusters occur over a range of depths of 4 to 9  km, display both strike and reverse slip focal mechanisms, and are  located both near and away from the segment junctions and the kink.   The goal is to provide the best physical model for the clustering  and give additional insight into 1) the relation of the static  stress drops of the larger ruptures to focal depths, focal  mechanisms, and locations near or away from the junctions, 2) the  mode of interactions among major fault segments in the NMSZ, such  as triggering of ruptures by seismic or aseismic preslip along  intersecting fault segments, and 3) the role of fluid involvement  in faulting processes.  This research is a component of the  National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***",
