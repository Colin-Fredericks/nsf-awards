 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to integrate a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer system, and associated computer and peripherals and data bases, with our existing laboratory equipment and educational program.  Students using this instrument are gaining experience in data analysis and spectral data base searching.  The addition of the GC-MS is affecting many laboratory courses beginning with the introductory level and continuing with those courses which follow in our curriculum. Experiments are designed in a manner commensurate with the educational level and laboratory skills of students in the particular course. There is significant impact on all science students but particularly on those science majors (Chemistry, Biology, Molecular Biology) who continue with courses such as organic and analytical chemistry. Also important though affected to a lesser extent are our smaller but significant programs with non-science majors, education majors, and high school students. The involvement of a high school teacher with adjunct faculty status at our institution is a unique feature of this project. Bayer (Elkhart, IN) and Plains Environmental Services (Saline, KS) serve as consultants for the environmental component of this project.  Results of this project will be presented in journals and regional scientific meetings.  *",
