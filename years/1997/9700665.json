 "awd_abstract_narration": "A method for the determination of the structure and composition of  solid surfaces in real time and in a spatially resolved manner is  the subject of this research project in the laboratory of Professor  J. Wayne Rabalais at the University of Houston.  The Analytical and  Surface Chemistry Program provides support for these studies of  scattering and recoiling imaging spectrometry (SARIS) for the real  time analysis of solid surfaces.  Development of modelling and  interpretive methodology is a focus of the present research, and  application to a wide range of surface analysis and thin film  growth problems is being carried out.  Completion of a new  instrument for SARIS studies is expected shortly, and applications  in several areas of materials science form the focus of the work of  this research project.  Real time, spatially resolved information  about the structure and composition of solid surfaces is crucial to  the understanding of a very wide range of important technological  problems, ranging from semiconductor device fabrication to  heterogeneous catalysis.  Ion scattering spectrometry is being developed as a method for the  real time spatially resolved analysis of solid surfaces.  This  research combines instrumental development, calculational modelling  for the interpretation of experimental results, and application to  a wide variety of important surface analysis problems to provide a  wide ranging project of significant technical  import.  Significant applications of this methodology in the  analysis of electronic materials are to be expected.",
