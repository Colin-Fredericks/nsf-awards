 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724118  Hyden    This dissertation enhancement grant supports a US graduate  student, Richard R. Marcus, working under the guidance of  Dr. Goran Hyden, Professor of Political Science at the  University of Florida, to do field research in Madagascar.  During the democratic transition in Madagascar, the  government instituted a country-wide conservation program.  Many international and local nongovernmental organizations,  including USAID and the World Bank, worked with the Malagasy  government in the formulation of the program.  It is  hypothesized that support for democracy in Madagascar is  contingent upon positive economic outcomes at the local  level.  Since donor-supported conservation programs have  such a far-reaching influence on local economies, local  people will only support democracy in Madagascar if  conservation programs lead to an amelioration in the quality  of life.  Further, it is assumed that the most successful  environmental institutions are those that incorporated the  concerns and attitudes of the local people, as expressed  through their fokonolona (local administrative units) and  community organizations, into the project.  Mr. Marcus will  visit villages in surrounds of Masoala National Park and the  Ankarana Protected Area.  In each of these areas, villages  influenced by Integrated Conservation and Development  Project (ICDP) policies and villages beyond the influence of  ICDP policies will be selected in an effort to study the  activities of donor-funded environmental institutions and  local organizations.  The strength of the relationship  between environmental activity and democracy will be  determined by studying the differences between the  activities and policies of the fokonolona involved in the  ICDP and a social/economic/demographic index, as well as the  democratic perceptions of the local Magalasy people.  A four-  step methodology, consisting of participatory appraisals,  interviews with local leaders, a survey, and a series of  follow-up interviews, will  be used during this study.  Staff  members at the Universite D'Antananarivo will collaborate  with Mr. Marcus on this project.    This study will make an important contribution to the  understanding of the relationship between international  environmental activity and local democratic attitudes in  Madagascar specifically, and political transition in Africa  generally. The grant will also provide support to enable a  promising student to establish a strong, independent  research career.    Funding jointly provided by the Division of International  Programs and the Division of Social, Behavioral and Economic  Research.    ***",
