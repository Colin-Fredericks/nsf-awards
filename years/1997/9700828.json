Bottlenecks arise due to the protocol stack, operating system and the I/O-network-memory subsystem.  It is also necessary to understand how novel applications make use of tight coupling and how mobile applications exploit the capabilities of high speed LANs for their computing needs.    This award will help to develop a two-semester course sequence, with appropriate laboratory exercises, that integrates into the curriculum new results relating to the design, implementation and use of high speed LANs.  In the traditional computer science and engineering curricula, the requisite information is only partially covered in a number of separate courses, making it difficult to understand the tradeoffs in the systems and applications design.    The main thrust in this project  will be to abstract out and convey the key concepts, reinforcing them with a series of laboratory exercises that involve the design of key hardware and software systems components that lead to a full working high speed LAN supporting one or more targeted applications.  Relevant topic will be gleaned from recent advances in the industry as well as the recent research literature.",
