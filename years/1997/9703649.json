The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Lisa M. Borland to work with Dr.  Constantino Tsallis at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas  Fisicas (CBPF) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Tsallis is a  distinguished member of the Brazilian scientific community,  who has an international reputation. The CBPF is one of the  top research labs in Brazil, housing over 70 researchers in  physics, as well as 150 graduate students.      This project involves the investigation of the dynamics of  systems with anomalous diffusion.  Specifically, they  propose to develop a theoretical framework ultimately  resulting in a procedure for determining the underlying  dynamics of anomalous stochastic processes of Levy-type  directly from experimental observations.  Once the  theoretical description is understood, they would implement  the theory as a computer code.  This would result in a  powerful tool to analyze the underlying dynamics of Levy-  type processes in nature.  ***",
