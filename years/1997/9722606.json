 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in relativistic heavy ions will be carried out  making use of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at  Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL).  The research will  include development of a specialized detector known as  PHOBOS for use at RHIC.  PHOBOS will provide a first look at  the behavior and decay of matter at the extreme energy  densities that will be created in gold-on-gold collisions  with energies of 100GeV/nucleon in the center-of-mass  system.  This work is aimed at characterizing the  hypothesized quark-gluon plasma which is created in such  energies collisions, and in which quarks and gluons are  thought to be deconfined, unlike the case in normal hadronic  matter.  In addition, research will be carried out at the  BNL Alternating Gradient Synchrotron facility.  This  experiment will probe the dynamics of hadron-hadron  interactions at lower energies than RHIC, where the details  of the interactions are better understood and where improved  understanding will permit needed extrapolations of the  behavior of ordinary hadronic matter of RHIC energies.       These data will extend our knowledge of matter to  energies and densities thought to have existed only in the  first microseconds of the early universe.  This topic is a  high priority within US nuclear science, as established by  the joint NSF/DOE Nuclear Science Advisory Committee in its  1996 Long Range Plan.  Education of students and postdocs is  a strong component of this experimental program.",
