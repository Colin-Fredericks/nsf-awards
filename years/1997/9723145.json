These receptors  are crucial components for transmission of  impulses across  the synapses between motor neurons and muscle cells. Located  on the subsynaptic surface membrane of muscle cells, AChRs  function as acetylcholine-gated ion conducting membrane  channels at the neuromuscular junction.  Like genetically  related receptors, each AChR is a complex comprised of five  separate membrane spanning protein subunits. The molecular  mechanisms by which AChR is assembled from its subunits is  still undefined, as are the pathways that target  AChR  to  restricted cell surface domains at postsynaptic regions of  the muscle membrane. Elucidation of these mechanisms will  lead to a more fundamental understanding of the regulation  of signaling across synapses.   The intracellular mechanisms  that direct the folding of newly made  subunits and their  subsequent assembly into pentameric  AChRs will be  studied  in cultured muscle cells that are genetically programmed for  efficient expression of these receptors on the cell surface.  An  alternative experimental system -  nonmuscle cells that  have been  transfected with the AChR subunits -  will be  utilized for the dissection of key regulatory aspects of the  assembly process.   Planned experiments are based on recent  findings that  AChR subunits  are folded and  assembled in  an intracellular compartment termed the  endoplasmic  reticulum (ER) with the participation of calnexin, an ER  resident molecular chaperone that interacts with newly  synthesized  polypeptide chains to prevent their aggregation  and misfolding, and  possibly to mediate oligomerization.  The proposed studies are aimed  at identifying  the  structural features that determine calnexin  binding to AChR  subunits and the m olecular mechanisms by which  calnexin  facilitates AChR assembly.       The concentration  of  AChR into high density patches  in the muscle  membrane region directly adjacent to nerve  endings is crucial for  efficient neuromuscular transmission  of impulses. Like the  intracellular assembly of AChR, the  formation and maintenance of high  density surface AChR  clusters under nerve endings requires highly  regulated  interactions between AChR and other proteins. The regulation  of the surface distribution of  AChR will be studied in  muscle cell  cultures, using an experimental approach that  combines biochemical  analysis of protein - protein  interactions and high resolution  immunofluorescence  microscopy. These studies will focus on defining  those  signaling pathways that direct the redistribution of AChR  into  high density patches in response to neuronal cues.  By focusing on the mechanisms that control AChR assembly and  surface topography, the proposed studies should provide  important insights into the regulatory pathways that  modulate the functional state of synapses. Moreover, because  several of the fundamental characteristics elucidated in the  case of AChR have proven applicable to other members of the  ligand-gated ion channel family,  AChR studies will be  valuable toward understanding the molecular  basis of  communication between excitable cells across synapses.",
