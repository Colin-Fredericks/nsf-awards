 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602466  Elser    This award supports U.S.-Japan collaborative research  between Dr. James Elser of the Department of Zoology at  Arizona State University and Dr. Jotaro Urabe of the Center  for Ecological Research at Kyoto University.  Dr. Elser will  be spending four months at Kyoto University in order to  develop a new perspective on ecological dynamics, ecological  stoichiometry.  Ecological stoichiometry focuses on the  relative elemental composition of participants in ecological  interactions in ecosystems.  Research in this area has  recently been applied in novel ways to a variety of  ecological phenomena in pelagic ecosystems, such as effects  of food-web structure on N and P availability in lakes,  links between consumer-driven N:P recycling and particulate  N:P and consumer N:P, stoichiometric constraints on animal  growth and production, contrasts between marine and  freshwater ecosystems, and the evolutionary ecology and cell  biology of body elemental composition.  Focus will be placed  on techniques and conceptual/theoretical frameworks for  study of the ecological stoichiometry of pelagic ecosystems.  The visit will build on the model that research cooperation  rather than competition yields synergistic benefits that  serve to advance understanding at an accelerated rate.    The U.S. researcher brings to this collaboration his  knowledge on large-scale field settings, including whole-  lake experimentation and patterns across large geochemical  and hydrodynamic gradients.  This is complemented by  expertise in the area of laboratory plankton culture and  physiological studies of growth by the Japanese researcher.  The project is expected to produce internationally  comparable data suitable for interpreting how stoichiometric  processes regulate ecosystem function across the world's  lakes.  This data will have direct application to areas of  domestic and international concern including fisheries  decline, eutrophication, loss of biodiversity and global  climate change.",
