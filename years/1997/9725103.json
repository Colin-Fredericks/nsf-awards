 "awd_abstract_narration": "A conference on Numerical Analysis and Domain Decomposition will  be held on January 23-24, 1998, at the Courant Institute of  Mathematical Sciences.   This conference will focus on current  advances in numerical analysis and scientific computing with  particular emphasis on domain decomposition, and important  applications of these techniques to areas such as computational  solid mechanics and fluid dynamics.  The conference promises to  bring together a very strong international field of senior  scientists with a large number of promising young investigators  from the U.S.  The conference provides a great opportunity to  promote areas of critical interest, primarily scientific  computing, scalable parallel algorithm development (including  domain decomposition) and fundamental research in numerical  analysis.  The continued national investment currently being made  in high performance computer hardware requires a similar  investment in and dissemination of the underlying mathematical  tools required to utilize this equipment.  Consequently, the  conference will yield strong practical benefits as wells as  theoretical ones.",
