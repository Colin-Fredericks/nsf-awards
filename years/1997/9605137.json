 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Lindgren  This grant will continue summer research program in  different areas of physics for twelve undergraduate students  with approximately one-third from U.Va. and two-thirds from  other non-Ph.D. granting institutions.  Projects cover a  broad range of experimental physics including nuclear and  high energy physics, atomic, molecular, condensed matter and  biological physics, materials and engineering physics  providing an opportunity for students with a wide range of  interest.  In particular, students will learn about using  electromagnetic probes to study quarks and nuclear behavior,  momentum analysis with magnetic spectrometers, scintillation  detectors, calorimetry, Monte Carlo simulation,  chromatography, infrared difference spectroscopy, age  measures of globular clusters, magnetic susceptibilities of  superconductors using SQUIDS, identification of misfit  dislocations in semiconductors, analysis of Rydberg states  using photodetectors and overlapping laser and atom beams,  infrared surface spectroscopy, two photon photodetachment of  negative ions, and oxidation-introduction time analysis of  electric cable insulation.  Students will conduct research  over a nine week period in the summer and give periodic  written and oral progress reports in regular meetings with  their colleagues for self and group critique.  ***",
