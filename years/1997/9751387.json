 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a Multi disciplinary Mechatronics Laboratory at GMI.  The proposed laboratory will benefit undergraduate students in two mechatronics and two other related courses.  Mechatronics is the synergistic integration of mechanical, control and electronics engineering and computer control for the design, manufacturing and control of products and processes.  Intelligent automobile suspensions, anti-lock brakes, robots, CNC machines and many consumer electronics are examples of mechatronic products.  Developing such products requires multi-disciplinary knowledge and skills.  Towards this end, undergraduate mechatronics courses have been developed at GMI.  Since these are multi-disciplinary courses, they require a laboratory that is fundamentally different from traditional mechanical engineering labs.  Experiments and projects for this course have been designed and planned in a sequence that will allow the students to acquire a complete mechatronic product design experience.  This laboratory will provide the students with cross-platform knowledge and skills necessary for today's engineer.  Upon completion of the laboratory, students will be able to design mechatronic products involving mechanical design, controllers, sensors, actuators, intelligent algorithms and interface.  *",
