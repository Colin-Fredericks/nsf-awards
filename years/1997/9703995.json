Thompson at the Graduate School of  Environmental Earth Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo,  Japan.  Dr. Thompson will work with Dr. Shang-Ping Xie,  Associate Professor in the Division of Oceanic and  Atmospheric Sciences, on a research project entitled,  \"Optimal Initial Conditions for Growth in an Intermediate  Ocean-Atmosphere Model of the Pacific that Generates the  Annual Cycle and ENSO.\"    This proposed research emphasizes the construction and  analysis of an intermediate- sized model of the Equatorial  Pacific that will reproduce both the annual cycle and the  inter-annual cycle of the atmospheric pattern known as El  Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).  ENSO is an irregular,  three to seven year sea surface temperature (SST) cycle, the  most well known aspect of which is the periodic and  anomalous warming of the South America coast, a pattern  referred to in the scientific community as El Nino.  ENSO  also acts as a predictor for other important seasonal  weather patterns, one specific example being the Asian  Monsoon,  which continues to cause either floods or droughts  in South and East Asia.  A minimal degree of predictability  for ENSO has been achieved through previous research, but  this research has been confined to the development of models  that reproduce either the ENSO cycle or the annual cycle.  No existing model has successfully reproduced both patterns  or predicted their combined effects.  As such, the purpose  of the proposed research is to develop this complex model  and apply optimal initial condition analysis to that model  in order to identify those structures which may lead to  large transient growth in the atmosphere.  ***",
