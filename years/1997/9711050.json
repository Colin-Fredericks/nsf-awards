The  conference gives an overview of the current state of development  and use of Godunov-type methods in science and engineering, and  it offers a perspective of their future development and use.  The  symposium brings together senior researchers who are experts in  the development and use of Godunov-type methods, junior  researchers who are currently making significant contributions in  this field, graduate students just entering the field, and other  interested individuals.  It also includes experts from application  areas.       Many important physical problems involve flow of a  compressible fluid; they can be described by differential  equations whose solutions have jumps in their values.  Computing  such a solution is usually difficult.  Godunov-type methods are a  class of methods that compute the solution by making particular  local approximations to it, moving the local approximations  forward in time, and piecing together these advanced values in  certain ways.  Extensions of the original method include higher  accuracy in time or in space, higher-dimensional problems,  problems with more complicated equations.  This meeting is devoted  to recent developments in Godunov methods, including not only  mathematical and numerical advances but also advances in  applications areas.  Examples are mesoscale meteorology, the  modeling of plasma flows arising in the heliosphere, and a  variety of engineering fluid flows.",
