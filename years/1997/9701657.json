The  nonlinear optical method is particularly attractive because  it possesses the long penetration depths characteristic of  most optical probes, and the intrinsic interface sensitivity  characteristic of all second-order optical processes.  The  research will vigorously apply our nonlinear tools to new  classes of scientifically interesting solid-solid interface  systems including hererofilm structures such as SiC/Si and  SiC/SiO2, metal/GaAs,metal/ZnSe,ZnSe/GaAs, II-VI-based  Quaternary thin films on InP,and III-N nitride-based thin  film structures.  Loosely speaking, high quality films of  these materials are required for the next generation of  electro-optic devices such as blue light emitters and  photodetectros.  The proposed investigations will encompass  a range of open ended polarization and frequency-dependent  investigations.  The polarization studies have the potential  to identify gross structural problems associated with the  growth of these thin films such as mixed phases, and  misorientation.  The frequency-dependent studies of the  solid interfaces, and in many cases of the bulk thin films  as well, will provide unique spectroscopic information about  these systems with the potential to reveal new information  about defects, band profiles, and strain in these systems.   %%%  When dissimilar crystals are abruptly adjoined, an  interfacial region is formed with physical properties that  are fundamentally different from those of the neighboring  bulk materials.  Since the microscopic characteristics of  the junction often play a prominent role in determining the  macroscopic properties of the material, the junction is  important to understand.  At the most basic level we would  like to understand how specific interfacial stoichiometries  bring about particular interfacial energy level structures,  band offsets, band profiles, and morphologies.  On a mo re  technological level, \"interface quality\" is known to affect  the properties of injection lasers and LED's, as well as  charge transport in photodetectors and microelectronic  circuits.  A roblem of great fundamental and practical  importance then, is to elucidate the role played by various  interfacial properties such as level structure in affecting  the properties of the material as a whole.  Unfortunately  the buried solid interface is difficult to probe by  conventional means because traditional optical  spectroscopies lack interface specificity, and traditional  surface diagnostics have a limited penetration depth.  The  proposed work seeks to employ second-order nonlinear optical  techniques to study these interfaces.  The nonlinear optical  method is particularly attractive because it possesses the  long penetration depths characteristic of most optical  probes, and the intrinsic interface sensitivity  characteristic of all second-order optical processes.  ***",
