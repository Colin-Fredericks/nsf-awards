 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714439  Gaffney  Characterizing the population structure of important  Antarctic species is essential to an improved understanding  of Antarctic ecology, and the successful management of this  ecosystem. The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) has initiated  a collaborative international effort (Project Gene Flow)  aimed at delineating population structure in several key  species (fish, squid and krill). A one-month cruise in the  Scotia Sea to obtain biological specimens and oceanographic  data is scheduled for November 1977, and this represents a  unique opportunity to apply both established and novel  molecular techniques to an important problem in Antarctic  resource management.    Four commercially and/or ecologically important species will  be the primary targets of the research: mackerel icefish,  Patagonian Toothfish, Antarctic Krill and the Seven Star  Flying Squid. A variety of molecular genetic techniques,  including some that are well-established and others that are  novel but extremely promising, will be applied to delineate  genetic population structure in these species. This research  will provide information on the whether separate \"stocks\" or  genetically different populations of these species exist in  Antarctic waters. This information will be useful in the  management of these species.",
