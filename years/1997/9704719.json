It  is cofunded by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences  directorate's Office for Multidisciplinary Activities.  In  particular, this grant establishes a resource center for  information on the availability of research opportunities for  faculty in predominantly undergraduate institutions with DMR  supported grantees.  The Council on Undergraduate Research has  developed databases of research activity and interests of  departments and individual faculty members at undergraduate  institutions under its National Information Center on  Undergraduate Research.  The grant will help foster exploratory  and reciprocal site visits to identify topics of mutual interest  which can then form the basis of Research Opportunity Awards.  The grant will help in intellectual growth of faculty at  undergraduate institutions and generate research opportunities  for undergraduate students in the general area of Materials  Research.  %%%  This grant from the Division of Materials Research is one of the  first awarded in its attempt to integrate research and education.  It is also cosponsored by the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  The grant will help in intellectual growth of faculty at  undergraduate institutions and generate research opportunities  for undergraduate students in the general area of Materials  Research.  ***",
