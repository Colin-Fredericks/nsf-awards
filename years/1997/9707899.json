Fossil wood can also provide environment  information independent of leaf physiognomy and other climate  indicators; and maybe an important source of information about past  precipitation variability.  Climate interpretations are hindered,  however, by our limited understanding of the way in which climate  affects wood structure.  This award supports a project designed to  examine woods from wet and montane tropical forest trees and to  construct a database relating climate to wood characteristics. The  project will systemize the characters used to describe wood,  particularly vessel size and distribution, which have been shown to  display climate sensitivity; and compare of woods from  forest/climate types to data from elsewhere in the world to  identify those characters most promising as climate indicators.   This work will also develop a multivariate model expressing the  wood:climate response that will permit detailed reconstruction of   quantitative climate estimates to be carried out on fossil wood.",
