 "awd_abstract_narration": "9622259  Aktan/Helmicki  This is a joint project with Tufts University and  Northeastern University focusing on exploring the role of  structural identification in transforming the current semi-  empirical practice to a rational knowledge-base, thereby  paving the way for effective and optimum infrastructure  designing operation and management.  Fundamental questions  pertaining to the use of structural identification for  bridge structures will be answered.  The research will be  primarily focused on structural identification in terms data  processing, quality assurance, damage evaluation, and  reliability evaluation.  The experimental and analytical  tools  that permit meaningful and practical applications of  structural identification are only presently emerging.  A  test bridge has already been instrumented  which is a 10  year old, 188ft long, three-span, two lane, integral  abutment, reinforced concrete-deck-on-steel-girders overpass  in the Cincinnati area to provide needed test data.  Another  bridge is under construction and is being instrumented  with  over 350 sensors.  Accelerations, displacements, rotations,  strains, temperatures, truckloads and environmental  conditions  will be monitored over the long-term by  intelligent monitoring systems.  In addition to active and  passive sensors, photogrammetric image processing  technologies will be used.  The structural identification  experiments will include: modal testing by impact, modal  testing by multi-imput forced-excitation, geometry-  monitoring, traffic-inputs and operating responses,  environmental inputs and ambient responses, static proof-  level multiple truck-loading, etc.  A wide variety of  structural identification approaches and analytical tools  will be studied.",
