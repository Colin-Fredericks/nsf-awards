Tsong of the Department of  Physics at Arizona State University and Dr. Toshio Sakurai  of the Institute of Materials Research at Tohoku University  in Sendai, Japan.  Dr. Tsong will be spending twelve months  at Tohoku University to conduct an in situ scanning  tunneling microscopy (STM) study of nitride thin films grown  by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).  The researchers will  attempt to identify the optimum growth temperature and the  most suitable nitrogen flux species for high quality MBE  film growth.  The results obtained during the visit will be  correlated with the low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM)  study of nitride growth with seeded supersonic beams in the  researcher's laboratory at Arizona State University.    The U.S. researcher brings to this collaboration his  knowledge of geometric and defect structures, atomic  composition, and adsorbate kinetics on the surfaces of  metals, alloys and semiconductors.  This is complemented by  similar knowledge of the Japanese researcher who has  specific expertise in the area of  STM.  His laboratory is  equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentation and his MBE-  STM system is one of only a handful of such instruments in  the world.  The project is expected to provide new  information of critical value to gaining new and deeper  understanding of fundamental materials science phenomena  associated with the epitaxial growth as well as other  related processing phenomena in a class of materials,  electronic/photonic, having high technological and economic  significance.  It is expected that the cooperation between  these laboratories should foster future collaborations.  ***",
