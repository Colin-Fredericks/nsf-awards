 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boss, Alan  AST 96-16093      Recent observational evidence indicates that stars form in  pairs, or as binary systems, rather than  singly, like our sun. Conditions required to form binary  stars are poorly understood, and most  theoretical modeling has concentrated on studying single  star formation.  Dr. Boss will rectify  this situation by carrying out research into the processes  that lead to binary star formation.  His program will improve understanding of the fragmentation  process which occurs during  protostellar collapse in molecular clouds, and his  theoretical models will include effects such as  mass accretion, orbital mergers and initial magnetic fields,  all previously neglected in theoretical  treatments, but recognized to be potentially important.  His  work will follow the orbital evolution  of the binary fragments for much longer times than is  typical in models, as the fragments interact  with the residual disk and cloud envelope.  Dr. Boss's work  is closely tied to observations, both  through the initial conditions of his models and through the  resulting calculation of line emission  from the protostellar fragments for comparison with  observations of star-forming regions.   His  results will also allow the determination of the minimum  mass of a protostellar fragment, which  has bearing on the discrimination between brown dwarf stars  and giant planets, and the  interpretation of recent observational detection of  companions to solar-type stars.  ***",
