 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729158  Nitsche    The goal of the present project is to perform numerical investigations to develop a   better understanding of vortex ring dynamics.  The case is considered in which a   vortex ring is formed by ejecting an amount of fluid from an opening.  In the first   part of the project, the focus will be on the initial formation process of   axisymmetric rings.  Viscous effects dominate the flow in an initial time interval   and affect the vortex trajectory and total shed circulation.  The effects of viscosity   by adapting a successful 2-dimensional Navier Stokes solver for high Reynolds   number flow to the axisymmetric case will be investigated.  Inviscid effects of the   flow using a vortex sheet model will also be studied in order to determine whether   present similarity theory predictions can be adjusted to better predict the initial   flow.  The second part of the project concerns 3-dimensional dynamics of vortex   rings formed at an opening.  The development of a numerical method to compute   3-dimensional vortex sheet separation at an edge will enable the study of the   stability of these flows, as well as the effects of nonaxisymmetric openings and   nonaxisymmetric forcing.  For this purpose, a 3-dimensional vortex filament   method will be developed which incorporates vortex separation at a sharp edge   and implements a fast summation algorithm to enable high resolution calculations.    Understanding the dynamics of vortex rings is essential to understand more   complicated flows such as those that occur in combustion processes, or in the   airborne vortex structures presenting a hazard to aircraft.  An inviscid numerical   model has been developed for axisymmetric vortex rings generated at a circular   opening.  This model was proven by comparison with experiment to recover   detailed information about the real flow.  In the present work, this model will be   extended to 3-dimensional flows, and will be used to study the stability of the   flows, the effects of non-axisymme tric openings and nonaxisymmetric forcing, as   well as the potential applicability of present theoretical results to predict the flow.    Several of these aspects of the flow are difficult to understand experimentally or   analytically, and the computations promise to give a deeper insight into the flow   dynamics. In order to perform this work, current numerical tools available for   2-dimensional flows will be expanded to 3-dimensions.",
