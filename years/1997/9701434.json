 "awd_abstract_narration": "Florence Thomas, PI        This program combines research in biomechanics with an  education component  linking public, K-12, undergraduate, and graduate education.  The research  addresses how the morphology of the predominate organisms in  a community  affects biological processes at the scale of the whole  community rather than  the scale of the individual.  Rates of nutrient uptake by  whole communities,  that vary in flexibility and morphology, will be measured  over a range of  water velocity in a research flume.  Comparisons of measured  uptake rates  with those calculated using empirically derived equations,  describing mass  transfer to non-biotic surfaces, will be made to  parameterize mass transfer  relationships for biotic surfaces. The results can be  applied to other  problems concerning rates of transport within communities,  such as feeding,  fertilization success, and the transport of other dissolved  compounds such  as pollutants. The education component of the program  includes: 1) the  development of an interactive display in a public aquarium  to interpret  flume experiments for visitors and K-12 education programs;  2) research  fellowships for minority students; and 3) incorporation of  biomechanics/hydrodynamics  into undergraduate courses.",
