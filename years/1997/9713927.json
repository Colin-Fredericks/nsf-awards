 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Marine Laboratory is a satellite campus of Duke  University.  Nicholas School of the Environment, located  on the coast of North Carolina near Cape Lookout and  180 miles from the main campus.  Its mission is research  and education in coastal oceanography, ecology and  policy.  Its serves researchers, educators and students  from Duke University and from many North  American  overseas institutions.  Many of these user institutions  have formed formal consortia with Duke University to  advance common goals, e.g., the Marine Science Education  Consortium (MESU), the Duke/University  of North Carolina Oceanographic Consortium (D/UNCOC) and  the NOAA Cooperative Institute of Fisheries Oceanography  (CIFO).  As a coastal field station serving a diverse  clientele, the DUML has the expectation and obligation  to provide its users with animal care facilities for  observational and experimental studies.  These  facilities must:        1) comply with the ever more rigorous USDA Animal                           Welfare  Act and DHHS policies related to the care and use of  laboratory animals.  2) provide the highest quality sea water for the                      maintenance of marine biota, and     provide sea water variously processed for research,  e.g., ambient, filtered, mixed salinity,  heated and chilled.    To meet its obligation, the Marine Laboratory will  repair, renovate and modernize its existing  running sea water and animal care infrastructure to the  functional status of a living resources  care system.    Repair, renovation and modernization will include the  following five elements:  1) four new 25m3   headboxes to gravity feed particle  and gas equilibrated sea water to eight  receiving stations in two separate systems,  2) a covering structure for a 1902  outdoor tank farm,  3) provision of fast sand filtered and cartridge filtered  sea water to two receiving  stations,  4) provision of chilled and heated sea water on a limited  basis to one receiving  station, and  5) renovation  of all animal care laboratories to comply  with American Association for  Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)  guidelines, both for vertebrate animals.",
