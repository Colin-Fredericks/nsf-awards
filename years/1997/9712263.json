Professor Miller and his students at Western  Michigan University will use a broad range of ultrahigh vacuum  surface tools to characterize these surfaces.  The chemical  modification of these surfaces will involve photochemically  initiating reactions of these carbon surfaces with a variety of  radical species.  This thrust offers promise in developing ways  to chemically modify the highly unreactive surfaces of carbon,  particularly in the form of diamond.  In addition to these  fundamental experimental activities molecular dynamics  calculations will be applied to better understand the chemistry  that occurs at these surfaces involving carbenes and radicals and  to develop simulations of these reactions that can be used in  undergraduate and graduate teaching settings.    The use of carbon materials in the semiconductor field is limited  by the unreactive nature of their surfaces.  In this work  photochemically initiated reactions that have been shown to be  feasible on both amorphous carbon and diamond surfaces will be  further studied to optimize the control of these chemical  reactions.  Successful chemical modification of these carbon  surfaces offers the potential to use carbon, especially diamond,  in a number of practical applications that require the  availability of particular surface functionalities including  microelectronic devices, materials requiring robust adhesion, and  semiconductors.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
