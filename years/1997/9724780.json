The  survey is being carried out in phases.  The first phase (now  complete) has produced assessments of (1) atomic, molecular,  and optical physics and (2) plasma physics as well as a  number of short reports on selected topics, including  cosmology and cosmic ray physics.  These assessments have  involved the corresponding divisions of the American  Physical Society and have had a significant impact on their  fields.  The second phase (now in progress) will produce  assessments of (1) elementary-particle physics, (2)  condensed-matter and materials physics, and (3) nuclear  physics.  In the third phase, special reports on areas such  as biological physics, computational physics, and education  in physics are being developed; in addition, and Overview is  planned.  The Overview will discuss the unity of physics,  its relationships with other fields, and its contributions  to meeting national needs.  This volume will take a fresh  look at the ways in which society reaps benefits from its  investment in physics.  The Overview will also explore such  issues as demographics, career paths, and education.  The  contents will include an executive summary written for the  non physicist, a summary of the studies of the various  branches of physics carried out in Phases I and II, a  discussion of the overall U.S. physics program, an essay on  \"Physics in a New Era\", and a number of other topics.  The objective of the Overview, in the broadest terms, is to  facilitate a recalibration of the goals of the field as a  whole.  The motivation for this undertaking is the rapidly  changing societal context for science.  Our society is in  the process of reexamining its goals as it enters a new  environment of reduced expectations for growth on the one  hand and enhanced opportunities for increases in  productivity and functionality on the other.  The physics  survey in general and  the overview in particular provide  means for the physics community to participate in this  process.  This Overview volume will be supported partially by this  grant.  ***",
