 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701428  Dahm    This is a renewal project covering four areas in the study of  electrons on liquid helium.  We propose a new route to the  ripplonic-polaron state, which consists of an electron self-  trapped in a surface dimple.  We suggest that ripplon-induced  weak localization of the electron occurs in the weak scattering  limit.  As the scattering, controlled by the holding electric  field, is increased, a transition to the bound polaron will occur  with possibly strong localization as a precursor to the bound  state.  The mobility of electrons in the low density limit will  be studied as a function of holding field, magnetic field, and  temperature.  We will attempt to observe weak localization by  thermal ripplons and the bound polaron state.  We further propose  to study plasma oscillations of quasi-one-dimensional electron  gas formed by confining electrons to helium filled grooves in an  insulating substrate.  We will also search for viscoelastic modes  in the electron fluid and study the pinned electron solid as a  function of coupling to pinning centers.  %%%  This a renewal project to study electrons bound to a liquid  helium surface.  In such a situation, the bound electrons form a  single layer which floats on the surface of helium.  This system  is the simplest two-dimensional system.  It has interesting  physical properties and some of its properties are analogs of  those which occur in three-dimensional (3D) systems.  The  parameters controlling these analogs can be varied through a  wider range and are more easily controlled than in three  dimensions.  We propose to study electrons on a helium surface in  an attempt to better understand the physics of systems of lower  dimensions and the physics of 3D systems which are difficult to  probe.  Our study will include the spatial localization of  electrons by random scattering, analogous to the localization of  electrons in some 3D semiconductors.  By increasing the  scattering rate we expect to find electrons trapped in surface   depressions, an analog of electrons trapped in a highly  compressible lattice in 3D.  We will study the pinned electron  crystal which is an analog of 3D sliding charge-density waves.  We also propose to study sound in a single rows of electrons in  an attempt to understand the physics of one-dimensional systems.  ***",
