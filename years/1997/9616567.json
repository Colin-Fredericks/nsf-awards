In this project, we demonstrate the importance of the problem of feedback compensation for improper dynamic systems from both a theoretical and practical perspective.  In doing so, we highlight specific applications which are described most naturally by improper models and develop some preliminary theoretical results for the case of a single-input, single-output plant.  Our results show clearly the striking differences between the improper plant case and the heavily studied strictly proper case.  We then proceed to frame our preliminary findings in terms of the few existing results in the literature where improper systems are discussed explicitly.  The importance of improper models becomes clear when one distinguishes between actual system behavior and the model which is chosen to describe that behavior.  In practice, every physical device exhibits decreasing gain at sufficiently high frequency.  Nevertheless, an improper model is sometimes still the most appropriate choice for analyzing a given plant, since the exact characteristics of the high-frequency roll-off may be difficult or impossible to establish and may occur well outside the frequency range of primary interest.  Also, a strictly proper perturbation of an improper model has higher order than the improper model itself and exhibits large separation of time scales, leading to difficult analytic and numerical problems.  Our main theoretical result states that, for an improper plant, stabilizing compensators are characterized not only by their effect on closed-loop poles but also by the high-frequency interaction of plant and compensator gains in the control loop.  The admissibility of this high-frequency loop interaction is determined entirely by the sign of the high-frequency loop gain.  This result is based on consideration of a large class of plant perturbations; it has no counterpart in the theory of strictly proper systems .  In the light of our results, some changes are required in those aspects of the literature which, at least superficially, pertain to the improper case.  For example, the celebrated Q-parametrization of stabilizing compensators does (at least nominally) apply to the improper plant case.  Our results demonstrate that a small modification of the theory is necessary, leading to a tightening of the constraint on the parameter Q.  A significant portion of our proposed research is experimental.  Several specific application areas are discussed in this proposal.  For example, certain problems in motion control of passenger vehicles lend themselves naturally to improper models.  We intend to pursue these problems in a laboratory setting with the intention of demonstrating the advantages of improper control design for certain important applications.  In the ECE Department at UW, we have a preexisting laboratory facility intended for precisely this kind of work.  Only small expenditures will be necessary for equipment, mainly in constructing non-traditional motion sensors.   We intend to carry out theoretical work which will extend the preliminary results discussed in this projectl to the multivariable case.  In principle, these results can be incorporated into most any area of control theory.  Some of the more interesting implications of our results are related to the well-established topics of Q-parametrization, robust stabilization, singular perturbations, singular systems, and H2 and H( optimality.  We propose to carefully develop appropriate generalizations of these theories to the improper plant case to the extent that time permits.  Simultaneously, we intend to verify the practicability of the results obtained relative to a variety of control problems by conducting real-time, hardware-based experiments in our existing laboratory facility.",
