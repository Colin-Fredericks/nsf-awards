In order to  understand, control and predict the results of a sintering  process, a close study of the process from a microstructural  point of view is required.  This project aims at process  simulations based on specific sintering and related  mechanisms rather than empirical, statistical functions.  To  model sintering from the mechanism point of view, the  investigators employ a combination of experiments,  mathematical models, and numerical simulations.  Among many  sintering mechanisms, the investigators have selected a  common one which often dominates the sintering process,  grain boundary diffusion.  They couple mass transport by  surface and grain boundary diffusion to form a complete  mathematical system.  This system involves high order  nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) and moving  boundaries.  To solve this system, the investigators use an  accurate and efficient numerical method for solving PDEs,  combined with domain decomposition and adaptive/moving  grids.  A parallel computation in the simulation algorithm  for both fine and coarse granularity level is also explored.  To verify and corroborate the simulation, the project  designs and carries out eight experiments.  Seven of these  target simple regular geometries of particles.  For  experimental reasons, Ni-coated W wires are used in most of  the experiments.  These experiments provide sound  comparisons with the mathematical models based on individual  mechanisms.  The experimental results will be compared with  the numerical simulations.  These comparisons will verify  and estimate the validity of the theoretical models.  After  comparisons based on these simple cases, the investigators  will conduct an experiment on the sintering of an irregular  cluster of particles where several mechanisms are involved  and coupled.  This experimental result will be compared with  the numerical simulation  of the enlarged complete  mathematical system.  %%%  This investigation provides a powerful tool for studying the  effects of sintering on the evolution of the microstructure  of a sintering material.  By combining experiments,  mathematical models and computer simulations, the results  will closely follow real world situations and better explain  the microstructural evolution during sintering.  The  simulation will help scientists and engineers to understand  better the properties of the sintered materials and to  optimize sintering process.  ***",
