 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stony Brook  This research has two foci.  First, the development of new   carbocyclization reactions will be carried out by probing cascade   tricyclizations, by trapping of the intermediates in   silylcarbocyclization (SiCaC) reactions and by testing the scope of   hetero-SiCaC reactions.  Second, a synthetic and mechanistic study of   homogeneous catalysis in supercritical carbon dioxide will be carried   out. Both higher reaction rates and greater reaction selectivity are to   be expected from this approach.    With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program and the Office of   Multidiciplinary Activities are supporting the research of Dr. Iwao Ojima   of the Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York, Stony   Brook.  Professor Ojima will focus his work on developing new and   efficient homogeneous catalytic reactions incorporating carbocyclizations   and carbonylations in conjunction with heterobimetallic catalyst systems.    The methodology affords synthetic chemists powerful tools for the   preparation of a large number of cyclic molecules.",
