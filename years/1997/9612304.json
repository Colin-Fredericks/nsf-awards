 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612304  Henley  This grant supports work on a variety of cutting-edge  problems in material magnetism.  In a continuation of a  successful program, the current project includes: (1)  discrete spin models in 2 dimension with interface  representations, (2) Application of semiclassical (path  integral) approaches to spatially finite spin systems and  (3) Spin order in highly frustrated Heisenberg  antiferromagnets.  These projects involve use of a  combination of analytical skills and numerical methods.  The  two specific projects where the original problems are long-  standing questions and which are expected to be resolved  during the present grant using some of the techniques  developed by this PI are: the ground state of an S=1/2  quantum antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice and  properties of SrCrGaO, a magnetic material with a two layer  Kagome sandwich structure.  %%%  This grant supports work on a variety of problems in  material magnetism that are both highly complex in that they  remain unsolved (after a half century of careful search for  solutions) so far and are derived from state of the art  questions in material magnetism.  There are magnets where  the interaction between individual spins (the constituent  unit at the atomic level) is strong but highly competitive  and \"frustrated\" in the sense that the neighboring spins  demand conflicting orientation for a specific spin.  These  materials become magnetic, if at all, only at very low  temperatures and then they often have strong anomalous  properties.  This project is a theoretical study of the  experimental properties of frustrated magnets that have been  reported recently.  ***",
