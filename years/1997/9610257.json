 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator works on a broad spectrum of  problems in finite model theory, which is the subject that  studies first-order logic and its extensions on collections  of finite structures.  He seeks to discover necessary and  sufficient conditions under which logics with fixpoint  operators capture computational complexity classes on  collections of finite structures.  Moreover , he  investigates the comparative expressive power of extensions  of first-order logic on collections as finite structures of  asymptotic measure equal to one.  He also studies various  aspects of logics with fixed finite number of variables,  including algorithms for satisfiability, and asymptotic  probabilities of properties expressible in such logics.  Progress on these problems will strengthen the connections  between logic and computation, and enhance the interaction  between logic, computational complexity, and asymptotic  combinatorics.  In a different direction, He continues  working towards the development of a structural  approximation theory for combinatorial optimization within  the framework of integer programming. The objective of this  investigation is to identify large classes of NP  optimization problems possesing approximation algorithms  with performance guarantees.***",
