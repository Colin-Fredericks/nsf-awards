 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702603  Torrents  This is an award to provide support for research, the primary  objective of which is to obtain a better understanding than now  exists of how immobilized enzymes can be utilized most  efficiently in detoxifying wastes that contain organic phosphates  of pollutional significance.  The investigator plans on screening  a series of protein immobilization supports with differing  degrees of surface activation characteristics to identify those  with a large capacity for adsorption of the enzymes and then  altering the enzyme to obtain maximum linkage between it and its  support.  A secondary objective of this project is to identify  the conditions under which the enzymes can maintain their  potential for activity when exposed to adverse environmental  conditions.    Results of this project are expected to provide insights into the  engineering design of processes to detoxify substance of  pollutional significance by use of immobilized enzymes.  The  proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF  96-115, \"Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program.\"  As  such, this award also provides support for the continuation of  this investigator's early development as an educator.  Her  education plan includes development of new courses that emphasize  the multidisciplinary perspectives that are inherent to the  practice of environmental engineering.  Her innovative approach  also is targeted toward leading students to, in effect, assist in  teaching themselves.  ***",
