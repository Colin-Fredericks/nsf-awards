 "awd_abstract_narration": "Automatic parallelization of object-oriented  computations is becoming increasingly important  with the widespread acceptance of object-oriented  languages such as Java and C++, and the adoption  of small-scale shared-memory multiprocessors as  the mainstay of enterprise computing. A key  problem that complicates the automatic  parallelization of object-oriented programs is  the pervasive use of irregular linked data  structures such as lists, trees and graphs. The  project will investigate a fundamentally new  analysis technique, commutativity analysis, that  is designed to automatically parallelize object-  oriented computations that manipulate linked data  structures.  The project will  focus on practical techniques such as the  generation of self-tuning code, or code that  dynamically changes its behavior  to adapt to changes in the execution  environment, and optimizations that reduce  synchronization overhead. It will also  investigate advanced analyses such as relative  commutativity analysis, which enables the  automatic parallelization of computations that  build linked  data structures, and replication  analysis, which enables the dynamic replication  of objects to eliminate serialization. The  overall goal is to develop techniques that  enable a dramatic reduction in the cost and  difficulty of developing software for parallel  machines.  Educational contributions include  the involvement of students in the research and  the development of a new class in program  analysis.***",
