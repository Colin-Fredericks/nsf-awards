 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9660146  Eubanks     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate transfer of rootworm resistance to corn via novel germ plasm.  Corn rootworm, Diabrotica spp., is the most expensive insect pest of corn.  Combined yield loss and pesticide treatment costs exceed $1 billion annually.  Larvae hatch from eggs deposited in soil and feed primarily on corn roots.  Root damage from larval feeding causes lodging, affects water uptake by the plant, and frequently causes up to 50% reduction in grain yield.     Tripsacum dactyloides, a wild relative of Zea mays, is resistant to corn rootworm larvae.  However, plant breeders have not been able to utilize resistance from Tripsacum effectively because corn-Tripsacum hybrids are male sterile and almost completely female sterile.  This problem can now be circumvented by a hybrid between eastern Gama grass and diploid perennial teosinte (Tipsacum dactyloides Xzea dipoloerennis), that is fully fertile and cross fertile with corn.  Developed by the principle investigator and referred to as Zea indiana, this hybrid is a genetic bridge that provides unprecedented opportunity to utilize beneficial Tripsacum genes in corn improvement.  Preliminary bioassays testing corn lines pollinated by Zea indiana indicate: (1) rootworm resistance is transferred to corn via this novel hybrid; (2) the effect is a combination of antibiosis and tolerance; (3) there is a gene for resistance that segregates in accordance with Mendelian ratios.   Statistical analysis in bioassays to verify resistance inheritance and DNA analysis to characterize molecular markers associated with resistance will provide necessary data to document feasibility of this novel genetic bridge to confer rootworm resistance to corn.  Results will further elucidate the mode of action and mechanism for inheritance of rootworm resistance.     If results confirm preliminary findings, a new approach to utilize genes from the wild relatives of corn for improvement of commercial corn line s will be confirmed.  The introduction of a high level of resistance to corn rootworm, a major pest of corn, will have significant commercial potential in reducing the need for chemical pesticides and increasing corn production.  This approach promises to be broadly effective, economically advantageous to farmers, and environmentally safe.  ***",
