 "awd_abstract_narration": "9753093  Barros     The objective of this project is to improve upon existing empirical techniques to quantify rainfall impact by investigating the basic mechanisms of wind-raindrop interactions in the atmospheric boundary-layer over surfaces of varying slope, aspect and roughness. Rainfall impact on exposed surfaces is one of the most critical agents of deterioration of buildings and infrastructure, and a trigger mechanism of extended soil erosion. The research approach is to assess rainfall impact based on the kinetic energy and angle of impact of raindrops, which are determined by atmospheric conditions (average wind conditions and dynamic stability parameters such as buoyancy and turbulent shear) and the intrinsic properties of rainfall (intensity and raindrop size distribution).   For this purpose, acoustic emission testing of rainfall impact will be conducted in the presence and absence of wind, while high-resolution photography will be used to study the pathways and transformations of raindrops moving through turbulent boundary-layers simulated in a large-scale wind tunnel. Ultimately, the goal is to establish a conceptual framework of the physics of wind-raindrop interactions to address a wide range of science and engineering problems, such as to estimate soil erodibility indices as a function of climate, or to define design criteria for building facades.   The support provided by the POWRE program will be used for the acquisition of an acoustic measurement unit suitable to monitor the impact of rainfall at various locations simultaneously, and to conduct exploratory wind-tunnel experiments at the Saint Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory, University of Minnesota. These experiments are essential to obtain the data necessary to perform an evaluation of the feasibility and potential success of the proposed research, before a comprehensive investigation to characterize the fate of raindrops in the atmospheric boundary layer can be pursued.",
