The co-investigators are Professors Shukla of the  University of Rhode Island and B.D. Agarwal, Indian Institute of  Technology (IIT), Kanpur.  The PIs will carry out research utilizing the  experimental facilities established under an earlier Special Foreign  Currency grant that supported the development of a dynamic stress and  fracture analysis laboratory at IIT, Kanpur.  The facility is now ready and  is being used for dynamic photoelastic experiments.  The focus of the  research is to further developments in the fabrication of transparent  composites and to conduct new investigations on the dynamic fracture and  damage growth in fiber reinforced composite materials.  The experimental  technique will utilize the principles of dynamic photography and  fractography.             Scope: This award will allow the PIs to continue the interesting work  begun on the characterization of composite materials under dynamic  loading conditions using the now completed experimental facility at  Kanpur.  The PIs have developed a unique technique for determining the  internal strain state of composite materials.  These materials are finding  increasing application, many of which will involve dynamic loading.  The  research will provide new fundamental information about composite  materials.  The benefits are mutual and the research results will be  published.           ***",
