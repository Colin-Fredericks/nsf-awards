 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the existence of fast fading and co-channel interference in wireless  communications systems, the problems of adaptive equalization and interference  suppression call for solutions that are beyond the reach of conventional schemes,  e.g., those based on least squares and least-mean-squares.  This research project  is applying novel adaptive signal processing techniques, referred to as Set-  Membership Adaptive Recursive Techniques (SMART), to resolve critical problems  that arise in advanced communications systems.  The novelty of SMART stems from  the following: (1) Their outcomes always satisfy a prescribed instantaneous bound  on the magnitude of the estimation error, which in adaptive equalization, is the  difference between the desired output and the filtered output.  (2) They are  characterized through a feasible set of parameters, which meet the specification  without requiring the existence of a true parameter.  (3) They update parameter  estimates selectively depending on the innovation of the input data.  This  feature leads to an adaptor sharing paradigm that significantly improves the  cost-effectiveness and data usage efficiency in adaptive signal processing.  In  simulation studies, SMART have exhibited superior performance and lower  computational complexity in applications such as adaptive equalization and  interference cancellation.    More generally, this project will establish a sound theoretical foundation for  Set-Membership Adaptive Filtering (SMAF), and explore the use of SMART in those  applications where performance requirements may exceed what traditional  algorithms can offer, e.g., modern multiple access communication systems.  We  anticipate that this research will advance the state-of-the-art in adaptive  filtering, both theoretically and practically, and significantly enhance the  performance of modern wireless communication systems.",
