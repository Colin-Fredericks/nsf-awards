 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is supporting Prof.   Yarkony at Johns Hopkins University over the next three years.  Yarkony's   research will focus on fundamental questions concerning the electronic   structure aspects of electronically non-adiabatic processes.   Of   particular interest will be the locus of points of the conical   intersection, particularly of two states of the same symmetry.  The   prevalence and impact of conical intersections will be studied in the   ensuing grant period to investigate their role in electronically   non-adiabatic processes.  A second basic question concerns the diabatic   bases routinely used to study the dynamics of non-adiabatic processes.    Although routinely used, diabatic bases exist only in an approximate   sense.  Line integrals of the derivative coupling can be used to   determine the size of the nonremovable part of the derivative coupling,   that is the portion of the derivative coupling that must remain even in   the 'most diabatic' basis.  Yarkony will use this technique to identify   systems for which the nonremovable part of the derivative coupling is   appreciable.  For these systems he will use the ab initio derivative   couplings to construct the 'most diabatic' basis and compare the results   with commonly used but necessarily approximate diabatization procedures.     This work is expected to provide fundamental insights to the nature of   diabatic bases.  The chemistry of molecules exposed to light, photochemistry, is   fundamentally different from the chemistry of ground state molecules.    The essential difference lies in the interconversion of electronic energy   created by the photoexcitation process into vibrational, rotational and   translational energy as the molecule relaxes non-adiabatically to the   ground electronic state.  Although non-adiabatic processes are   ubiquitous, occurring for example in vision, photosynthesis, and   stratospheric ozone degradation, many basic questions concerning   non-adiabatic processes need to be addressed.  One of the principal   drivers of non-adiabatic processes is a topological feature known as a   conical intersection.  Once thought to be rare occurrences attributable   to special, symmetry, properties of a molecule, it is now clear that like   non-adiabatic processes themselves conical intersections are ubiquitous.    Yarkony will use a unique system of computer algorithms developed at   Johns Hopkins University over the last decade to study fundamental issues   related to  conical intersections and the way they influence   non-adiabatic processes.",
