 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702661  Liu    This  experimental  CAREER  grant  project  focuses  on  the  effects  of  disorder  on  meso-scale  superconductors.    A  central research goal is to determine experimentally whether  a negative local superfluid density exists.  The experiments  will  make  use  of  e-beam lithography and  ultrathin  film  fabrication  techniques and a well equipped low  temperature  measurement  laboratory.  Some specific aims are measurement  of magnetoresistance and electric field effect in single and  arrays   of   mesoscopic  superconducting   bismuth   rings;  measurement of mesoscopic fluctuations in magnetic fields in  Auln   alloy  and  Bi  samples.   The  completion  of  these  experiments  will have a strong bearing on the  question  of  the negative superfluid density.  The proposed research will  be integrated into an education plan to help enhance student  learning and to train future scientists.  The education plan  is  designed  in  part to promote women's  participation  in  science,  which will be beneficial for science and its  well  being as a profession.  the fundamental knowledge which will  be  gained in this work will deepen our understanding of the  fundamental   nature  of  Cooper  pairing   correlation   in  disordered superconductors and may have significant  impacts  on several related fields.  The behavior of mesoscopic scale  superconductors  is also relevant in potential  applications  including sensitive sensors of electromagnetic radiation and  high performance low dissipation logic circuits.  %%%  This   experimental   CAREER  grant   project   probes   the  fundamental  changes in the phenomenon of  superconductivity  as  the  samples become very small or very thin, and as  the  superconducting  material itself  becomes  disordered.   The  questions   being  studied  are  made  more  important   and  interesting by the essentially quantum mechanical nature  of  superconductivity.  A focus of the work is to search  for  a  particular theoretically possible eff ect, called a  negative  superfluid  density.  The existence of such  as  effect,  if  proven  by work such as is proposed, would have implications  for related areas of science.  The long term outcome of such  research   could   include  the  development   of   improved  electronic  devices for detecting electromagnetic  radiation  and/or  for  making rapid calculations.  The education  plan  included  in this project integrates research and  education  and aims to promote women's participation in science.  ***",
