 "awd_abstract_narration": "9753086  Figueroa  The active population distribution of nitrifying bacteria is  difficult to study using traditional cultivation techniques  such as most probable number and selective plating.  This is  partially because nitrifying bacteria grow very slowly -  replicating once every eight hours under optimal conditions  compared to E. coli which replicates once every twenty  minutes.  Culturing techniques also require the disruption  of the biofilm structure and a loss of spatial distribution  information.  One relatively new microbiological technique  that can be applied to an intact biofilm sample is  Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization (FISH).  The application  of FISH to full-scale wastewater treatment systems is  limited.  This could yield important information that can be  correlated with performance and then used to quantify the  active population for process modeling and optimization.  Other techniques such as confocal microscopy and microprobes  may be applicable to intact biofilm samples collected from  full-scale trickling filters and may provide additional  information for process control.    The main research objective is to investigate the  application of relatively new microbiological and biofilm  techniques to characterize intact biofilm samples and  determine whether this information can be used to improve  process modeling and optimization.  Secondary objectives are  to develop new skills and collaborative relationships to  increase competitiveness for the use of these novel  techniques to quantify phenotypes and their distribution in  full-scale biofilm processes.  ***",
