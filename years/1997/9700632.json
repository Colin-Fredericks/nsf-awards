The funds will be used to  partially support a symposium to celebrate the centennial of  the discovery of the electron to be held at Central Michigan  University on April 9, 1997.  The symposium will feature  four distinguished speakers who will address various aspects  of the impact of the electron on science and technology, as  well as prospects for the future.  The symposium will be  broadcast live via satellite to high schools and colleges  nationwide.  Instructional materials that address the  content of the symposium will be developed in a separate  project and distributed to high school teachers.  %%%   This project is funded by the Divisions of Materials  Research, Chemistry and Physics.
