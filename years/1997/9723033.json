 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723033  Randall  Drumming on the ground to create mechanical vibrations is an  important means  of communication in open, desert environments, and is  widespread  among desert rodents. Both solitary kangaroo rats,  Dipodomys, from North  America and social gerbils, Rhombomys, from Central Asia  exhibit footdrummming  in the presence of predators. Because this behavior costs  time and energy and is  dangerous, it must provide some benefit. The objective of  this study is to  determine why desert rodents place themselves at risk by  footdrumming in the  presence of predators. Behavioral observations and  experiments with snake  and mammalian predators in the field will test predictions  that solitary  kangaroo rats footdrum to communicate directly to the  predator that the rat  is alert and the predator's chances of successful capture  are low, while  social gerbils footdrum to warn relatives and offspring of  danger. Results  of the study will contribute to our understanding of  footdrumming as a  unique form of mammalian communication and its function as  anti-predator  behavior in ground-dwelling desert rodents. The study should  lead to a  greater understanding of how predation acts as a selective  force on prey  behavior and contribute to recovery programs of endangered  species of  kangaroo rat.",
