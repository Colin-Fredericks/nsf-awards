This work will investigate how  certain cells are able to survive long periods of dormancy that  are induced by the removal of oxygen (anoxia). Under anoxia,  energy metabolism and development are shut down.         There are three specific research objectives for this  project. First, the rate of transcription (synthesis of  messenger RNA from DNA) will be measured in nuclei and  mitochondria isolated from active animals and dormant animals.  The PI's prediction is that transcription will be depressed  under anoxia, which would be consistent with the fact that  development ceases under anoxia in our experimental animal (a  shrimp embryo). Second, the stability of messenger RNA (mRNA)  under anoxia will measured. The PI's hypothesis is that  degradation of mRNA (a normal process in active cells) will be  is depressed during dormancy. Conservation of mRNA molecules  during dormancy might favor a quick resumption of protein  synthesis as soon as oxygen is returned. Third, the PI will  hypothesize that there is an oxygen sensor in the mitochondria  of these animals that can control the rate of protein synthesis  when oxygen availability is reduced. Experiments will be  performed to test whether or not the sensor is a home protein  (i.e., similar to oxygen binding proteins like hemoglobin).         The mechanisms by which cells withstand long bouts of  dormancy are apt to have important implications for numerous  cases where metabolism is unavoidably disrupted -organ and  tissue transplantation, acute blockage of blood flow to tissues,  and oxygen deprivation. From an ecological perspective, the work  should help explain how environmental stimuli that promote entry  into dormancy are linked to the required survival responses.                                           ,,. 1",
