 "awd_abstract_narration": "The curriculum in psychology has traditionally enjoyed a heavy emphasis on faculty student interaction.  However, the laboratories have not kept pace with the state of the field.  This project is broadening the emphasis on interactive learning while enabling students to explore issues which are topical and current.  Through the introduction of an eye-movement laboratory, the laboratory components in cognitive, sensation and perception, social psychology, industrial psychology, health psychology, and human factors are all being dramatically enhanced while the year-long introductory course is being greatly improved.  This equipment is having an exciting effect on student faculty collaborative research, as well as the Senior Research Thesis requirement, by opening up concepts and techniques that were previously inaccessible.  *",
