 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor James P.   Ferris studies the synthesis of ribonucleic acids on minerals. This work,   carried out in the Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer Polytechnic   Institute, focuses on clay mineral-mediated formation of phosphodiester   linkages between ribonucleotides.  Suites of RNA oligomers containing   random sequences of thirty to fifty bases with a high proportion of   3',5'-phosphodiester linkages are produced via RNA primer elongation on   montmorillonite clay.  These oligomers are tested for catalytic activity   in order to provide a laboratory demonstration of the transition from   prebiotic chemistry to catalytic activity as postulated by the RNA world   scenario for the origins of life.  Clay-catalyzed synthesis of homochiral   RNAs from racemic nucleotides is also explored, helping to shed light on   the origins of chirality.  Plausible activating groups for the synthesis   of RNA on mineral surfaces are chosen to represent those likely to have   been prevalent under primitive earth conditions, and inhibitor studies   are carried out in order to help direct the search for other minerals   with comparable or superior catalytic capabilities.  Many unanswered questions remain about the origins of life, beginning at   the very basic chemical level of how the first catalysts (materials which   facilitate the reactions of other molecules) evolved.  Professor Ferris   examines the role of clay minerals in catalyzing the formation of   molecules representing the possible precursors to life, focusing on the   synthesis of ribonucleic acids (RNA) which in turn may function as   catalysts for the synthesis of still more complex molecules.  These   studies also address the fundamental question of how life's molecules   acquired the unique structural feature of chirality, wherein many   biologically active molecules display a three-dimensional structure   distinct from that of their mirror image (just as a right hand differs   from a left hand).",
