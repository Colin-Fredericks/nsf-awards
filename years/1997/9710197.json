 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Jerry L.   Atwood, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri -   Columbia, carries out the synthesis of host compounds designed to bind   anions and to complex fullerenes.  Studies of calix(4)arenes,   calix(5)arenes, and cyclotriveratrylenes which have been metallated on   the outer pi faces contribute to a fundamental understanding of the   factors influencing the binding of anions.  Development of metallated   deep cavity analogs, which are constructed by versatile self-assembly   processes, affords enhanced anion binding agents.  Synthesis of   calixarene and cyclotriveratrylene hosts designed to match the size,   shape, and electrostatic requirements of specific fullerenes offer the   opportunity to devise fullerene-selective complexing agents.  Recent years have seen rapid growth in studies of the ways in which   neutral molecules and positively-charged ions may be specifically   recognized and bound by molecules designed for this purpose.  Such   studies have had a wide range of implications, including advances in   understanding of critical molecule-molecule and molecule-ion interactions   in biological systems as well as development of practical methods for the   separation and purification of materials.  Corresponding developments for   the binding of negatively-charged ions, in contrast, have been   comparatively slow to appear.  Professor Jerry L. Atwood, of the   Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri - Columbia, with   the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, synthesizes organic   molecules designed to recognize and bind anions through a combination of   specific chemical interactions.  Related systems offer the opportunity to   effect analogous recognition of various fullerenes (`Buckyballs`),   providing further insights into the nature of molecule-molecule   interaction as well as techniques for the separation and purification of   various members of the fullerene family.",
