New compounds which are  doubly substituted (using an OatlasO to guide the atom  selection) will be prepared and characterized.  In addition  the research advances from 2-17 phases to 1-12 and 6-23  phases.  In prior work neutron diffraction and Mossbauer  techniques were used to investigate  a large number of  magnetic alloy systems, and from this effort an \"atlas\" for  the location of substitutional atoms in the R2Fe17 lattice  was developed.   The details of the changes in Fe-Fe  bounding  were followed in this system and in interstitially  modified compounds.  It became clear that not all of the  effects on Curie temperature could be attributed to  magnetovolume effects, and associated theoretical modeling  contributed to better understanding of these compounds.  It  was observed that introducing interstitial carbon by  induction or arc-melting during the materials synthesis  leads to a modification of the substitutional occupancy  patterns, and this could result in enhanced stability of  interstitial compounds. This research is extended to novel  interstitial compounds in which the interstitial atoms are  incorporated from the gas phase (e.g., SiH4, B2H6) or from  the melt in which the interstitial atom is tightly bonded to  the substitutional atom (e.g., TiB, VC).  The research now  makes use of photoemission measurements of the electronic  density of states to compliment the other experiments and  test the theoretical calculations being carried out by  collaborators.  %%%  The substitutional-interstitial magnetic compounds under  investigation here show potential for magnet applications.  The research is building  improved understanding for optimum  design of the atomic structural of magnetic materials.  ***",
