From car factories to business offices to universities to homes,  the public depends on reliable electrical energy.  A power  delivery system consists of systems for the transmission and  distribution of the electric power from power plants to  customers.  Recently there has been renewed interest in the  distribution side of the power delivery system.  This interest  has stemmed out of an increased number of outages and reliability  problems relating to the distribution system rather than the  transmission system.  Current research on distribution systems  involves both planning and operational issues.  A overriding  concern is to increase the reliability of the supply of electric  energy by decreasing the time it takes to restore power after an  outage occurs.  Outage management involves the identification of  the location of outage and taking the necessary action or  actions, such as switching steps or repair, to restore power as  soon as possible to any affected customers.    The proposed long term research project for the Computer  Applications in Power System Operations Laboratory (CAPSOL) at  Michigan Technological University involves the integration of  numerical power system analysis, non-numerical power system data,  and the resource base of personnel and equipment to create a  comprehensive set of outage management techniques to optimize  restoration efforts during and after a storm condition.  Such  research should provide an increased awareness of the contrasts  between normal operations and storm operations and provide  increased performance in utility reliability.    The planning grant research activities involve three components:   initial research work and laboratory development, travel, and  proposal creation.  Background literature review will be used to  identify published algorithms for outage identification,  restoration, and prioritization; to identify the previous  approaches to integration o f intelligent system techniques to  storm management issues; and to highlight the applications where  intelligent system techniques can be either improved or increased  in the storm management process.  Research will focus on setting  up a complete topological network analysis package and a power  flow program.  By combining the knowledge gained from previous  work with utilities and the enhanced resources of the CAPSOL  laboratory, initial storm management algorithms can be developed.    The travel activities will permit interaction with experts in the  power engineering field from utilities, vendors and other  universities.  The PI also plans to write proposals to support  work on storm management issues seeking federal, state and  industrial research support.   ***",
