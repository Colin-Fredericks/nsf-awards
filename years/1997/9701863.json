 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Jim Hensley  Over the Top in TEaMS ( OTT) blends the efforts of an urban  school district and an array of partners in a long-range  project to significantly increase minority enrollments and  success rates in courses comprising the science,  mathematics, engineering, technology (SMET) pipeline.  The  Kansas City, Kansas Public Schools (KCKPS) is a minority  majority school district in the Kansas city Metroplex.  68%  of the students are minority, 54% being African American.  KCKPS students scored well below national averages on the  1996 MAT-7 and ACT.  Of 225 students in Algebra I at grade  8, only 15% were African American males.  OTT will double  minority enrollment in advanced math/science classes, double  minority enrollment in AP/IB science/math classes, increase  minority enrollment in grade 8 Algebra I to 75%, prepare all  students for success in Algebra II, prepare all students for  success in Chemistry I, significantly raise average minority  math/science scores on national achievement tests and state  assessments, complete a revised math/science curriculum that  reflects NTSA/NCTM standards, increase teacher knowledge and  use of research based teaching tools, and increase student  interest level and student confidence in science/math.  KCKPS will implement a set of interventions  intended to eliminate barriers and build  capacity toward minority quccess in SMET  pipeline courses.  These interventions include:  math/science curriculum reform and improvement  of K-8 science/math curriculum resources,  intensive staff development enrichment programs  outside the school day(summer, after school,  Saturday), tutoring programs, providing teacher  leaders in math/science at each school,  creating community partnerships for mentor  support, and developing counselors as pumps for  minority students into the SMET pipeline.",
