 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Description.  Based on the Convoy Model of social relations, this study is designed to assess continuity and change in the individual's network of relationships across the late adolescent transition.  Specific aims are (a) to assess changes within the adolescent's social network subsequent to leaving high school, (b) to examine the impact of temperamental adaptability and situational life stress on the post-transition network, and (c) to link functional changes in the network to post-transition adjustment.  A second wave of data will be collected from an ethnically diverse sample of 745 students surveyed in 1995, during their sophomore or senior year of high school.  It is proposed that alterations in the social network will be related specifically to the transition, that lower adaptability and greater stress will compromise the supportiveness of the post-transition network, and that network supportiveness will play a significant role in adjustment.  The results will enhance understanding of social network evolution through developmental time.  &&&  Project Justification.  The transition from adolescence to adulthood may be the most difficult period encountered normatively across the life span.  Factors associated with successful navigation of this important passage are the focus of this research.  Follow-up data will be collected from 745 adolescents who were surveyed initially in 1995, during their sophomore or senior year in high school.  The goals are to map the changes that occur in the adolescent's  social support system subsequent to leaving school and to learn how changes in the support system affect post-transition adjustment.  Adolescents who generally have greater difficulty adapting to changed circumstances and those with higher levels of life stress are expected to have less optimal support systems and poorer adjustment following the transition.  This study is unique in its inclusion of minority students and of `the forgotten half` of students who do not attend college.  The results will enhance our knowledge of the operation of social support across crucial life transitions.",
