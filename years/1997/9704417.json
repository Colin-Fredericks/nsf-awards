 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704417  Brady       The investigator of this project will study the geometric  and finiteness properties of kernel subgroups of the fundamental  groups of nonpositively curved cube complexes.  A combinatorial  version of Morse theory applied to cube complexes may be used to  analyze the finiteness properties of the kernels of right-angled Artin  groups.  Some of these kernels have remarkable finiteness properties.  A major goal of this project is to study the geometry and topology of  these kernels.  It is hoped that these groups contain examples which  distinguish between geometric and cohomological dimension, and  examples which distinguish between combable and automatic groups.  It  is also worth considering more general settings in which the Morse  theory arguments may be applied, and what information these ideas may  yield in the study of the coherency question for various classes of  groups.  Another interesting direction to investigate is whether the  Morse techniques may be combined with branched covering techniques to  produce examples of torsion-free groups that do not contain free  abelian subgroups of rank 2, and that are of type FP(n) but not  FP(n+1).       The main objects under investigation in this project are  piecewise euclidean cubical complexes.  These may be thought of as   constructed from regular euclidean squares and cubes, neatly stitched  together along their faces and edges.  Such complexes have symmetry  groups, which may be thought of as generalizations of the wallpaper  pattern groups, or of the 3-dimensional crystallographic groups one  encounters in the study of lattices in chemistry.  The main purpose of  this research is to examine subgroups of these symmetry groups.  One  technique is to introduce height functions on the cubical complexes  and to look at the subgroups consisting of all those symmetries that  preserve the `contour lines' or level sets of such functions.  These   constant-height slices often exhibit remarkable geometric patterns  that are far f rom obvious when one looks just at the ambient cubical  complex.  The subgroups of symmetries that preserve these slices have  very different algebraic and geometric properties from those one   encounters in the euclidean crystallographic world.  These examples  help deepen our understanding of the concept of geometric symmetry.   ***",
