 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632851  Knapp    A  long-term  ecological research program will be  continued  and  expanded at the Konza Prairie LTER site in  NE  Kansas.  Konza  Prairie, a pristine tallgrass prairie  is,  arguably,  the most intensively studied grassland site on earth. The 15  year old, broadly-based research program encompasses studies  from  the  population,  community, ecosystem  and  landscape  ecology  levels. These studies are linked by  a  theme  that  includes   all   the  major  abiotic  and   biotic   factors  influencing this ecosystem. Our central hypothesis  is  that  fire,  grazing  and climatic variability are  essential  and  responsible  for  the  structure and function  of  tallgrass  prairie.   In  contrast  to  many  other  grasslands   where  ecological  processes are constrained by a  single  resource  (e.g.,   water),  organismic  to  ecosystem  processes   and  dynamics  in tallgrass prairie are products of a variety  of  limiting resources (water, light, nitrogen). Variability in,  and  switching  among, these primary limiting resources  are  caused  by  both  present and historical fire,  grazing  and  climatic  regimes.  As  a  result of  this  complexity,  and  because  grazing and fire regimes are managed  in  grassland  systems  worldwide, data from the Konza Prairie LTER program  have  relevance  not only for understanding this  grassland,  but   for  broader  ecological  issues  such  as  stability  diversity   questions  and  interactions  between  land-use,  biodiversity  and  climate  change.  The  proposed  research  includes continuation of long-term fire and grazing  studies  as  well as short-term studies focused on key processes  and  mechanisms.  Proposed new research includes studies  of  the  effect  of fire season, a fire-treatment reversal experiment  in  which  watersheds  that have  been  annually  burned  or  unburned  for 20 years will have their treatments  reversed,  comparative  studies  of bison vs. cattle  as  the  dominant  grazers,  and  a  long-term   study  of  how  grazing,  fire,  climatic  variability and agriculture affect annual  carbon,  water  and  energy  budgets  in  tallgrass  prairie.  A  key  question  addressed by the latter study is  whether  or  not  tallgrass prairie soils are a sink or source for carbon  and  how  land-use (fire, grazing) and climate affects the carbon  budget.",
