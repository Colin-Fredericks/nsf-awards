 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603347  Ricker    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Professor George Ricker, Center for Space  Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and  Professor Katsuji  Koyama of the Department of Physics at  Kyoto University in Japan.  The joint research project  focuses on scientific preparations for the Astro-E mission,  a Japan/USA orbiting observatory scheduled for launch by the  Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) in Japan  during February, 2000.  The project will provide  powerful X-  ray spectroscopic capability through both a narrow-field  high spectral resolution microcalorimeter instrument (the X-  ray Spectrometer, XRS) and a wide-field, moderate  resolution, imaging spectrometer (the X-ray Imaging  Spectrometer, or XIS).  This project places emphasis on  development of the XIS.  The scientific objectives of the  XIS are two-fold:  (1) it will provide wide field imaging  and spatially resolved spectroscopy in support of  observations with the microcalorimeter-based XRS, which is  limited in lifetime by its cryogenics, and (2) it will  expand upon the broad range of moderate resolution  spectroscopic observations initiated by the Solid-State  Imaging Spectrometer (SIS) successfully flown on the Astro-D  mission.    This award supports the non-hardware tasks associated with  the experiment, which will be carried out with scientists in  Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo.  These tasks include XIS instrument  calibration and testing efforts.  As a result of the greater  telescope area and improved angular telescope resolution for  Astro-E, greatly improved sensitivity for the XIS is  expected.  Thus spectroscopic observations of fainter  objects, or exploration of more members of a given class can  be expected.  The power of the XIS, as a unique  observational tool, will be widely available to the entire  US and Japanese astronomical community.  Graduate students  and young postdoctoral scientists will participate in all  phases of the scientifi c and technical enterprise. It is  anticipated that a number of publications will result from  the collaboration.  Through the exchange of ideas and  technology, this project will broaden our base of knowledge  and promote international understanding and cooperation.  ***",
