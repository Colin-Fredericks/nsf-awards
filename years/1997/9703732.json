Such a magnetometer can  measure the magnetization of samples as a function of  temperature and magnetic field.  The proposed instrument is  extremely sensitive and therefore is appropriate for measuring  both bulk and thin film samples.  Its operation is almost  completely computer-controlled, so that it is capable of a high  throughput of samples, and the operating costs are rather low.    Several research groups at Notre Dame and one at Western  Michigan University will be the primary users of this  magnetometer.  In each case, the measurement capabilities of  the magnetometer will greatly enhance currently existing  research and make new experiments possible.  The research areas  are quite diverse, including:  Intermetallic cluster compounds,  high temperature superconductivity, metalloporphyrim chemistry,  colossal magnetoresistance materials, geometrically frustrated  magnets, and diluted magnetic semiconductors (including thin  films and superlattices).  This instrument will truly be used  in an interdisciplinary fashion since the above research  involves groups in three different departments.  Several other  research groups on the Notre Dame campus also have occasional  use for such a magnetometer and will be given access.  %%%  This award provides partial support for a SQUID magnetometer to  be located on the campus of the University of Notre Dame, where  no equivalent device currently exists.
