However,  there is evidence that one acquires information in the absence of  awareness.  This research will help determine the conditions  under which people can acquire multiple pieces of information  independently of awareness, as well as how much attention needs  to be allocated to each task in order for the information to be  transferred to a more permanent memory store.  By understanding  under which situations people best acquire such information, it  should be possible to determine how to present information to  maximize human learning.  An example of learning without  awareness comes from research with amnesic patients.  Although  amnesic patients cannot remember an earlier presentation of a  word, they use a word more often to complete a sentence when it  was in fact presented recently than when it had not been  presented recently.  This and related findings provide evidence  for priming, a form of implicit memory.  Implicit memory is often  contrasted with explicit memory.  Explicit tests of memory  include recall and recognition, and tap memory for facts and  events that are available as conscious recollections.  An  important contrast between implicit and explicit memory is that  they appear to be affected differently by the allocation of  attention.  If attention is divided between two or more tasks,  explicit memory suffers.  For example, if one watches the news on  television while talking on the phone, one will remember fewer of  today's news events than if one watched the news without  attempting to carry out another task simultaneously.  In  contrast, implicit memory has traditionally been thought to be  less dependent on attention.  One can carry out a familiar motor  task while at the same time carrying out a competing task that  requires a different set of mental activities.  For example, a  skilled typist can type while reading a familiar  passage.   Recently, it has been demonstrated that focussed attention is  needed for some tasks that tap implicit memory.  Specifically,  focussed attention is not necessary for learning single pieces of  information but is required for learning multiple items  simultaneously, such as that \"red\" and \"triangle\" go together.   In this situation, the person must attend fully to both of these  attributes and attempt to bind them in memory as a single object,  like a \"red triangle.\"  In such cases, cognitive resources cannot  always be shared with another task.  Under these and similar  circumstances in which separate items must be integrated and  stored in memory, cognitive resources from limited-capacity  short-term memory are required.  If cognitive resources are  overtaxed, learning will not occur.  The properties of the  information to be learned, such as its familiarity, affect the  ability to learn more than one thing at a time.  This research  will help determine the conditions under which multiple tasks can  be learned implicitly without hurting performance.  ***",
