Hill  Affiliation   University of Notre Dome      This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.   The principal investigator is Davide A. Hill of the University of Notre Game.  The objective of the proposed research is to seek methods for improving the mechanical properties of liquid crystal polymer(LCPs) by inserting filler particles with tailored shape and surface morphology.  Despite their outstanding thermal, chemical and dielectric properties, liquid crystal polymers have found limited application for production of three-dimensional structures.  A severe drawback of these materials is the ease of fracture along surfaces of strong molecular alignment.  Liquid crystal polymers have high tensile strength in the spinning direction but extremely weak lateral cohesion.  The introduction of filler material serves to anchor the chains and nucleate desirable orientation patterns in a liquid crystal polymer matrix.  Particle characteristics will be selected to engineer materials with controlled microstructures.    The importance of the research is its potential to influence the processing of liquid crystal polymers by improving the mechanical properties of these useful materials.  Such improvement in mechanical properties may open up new areas of applications, including use as separations media.  From a fundamental viewpoint, the research will advance the understanding of dynamic interactions and structure development in liquid crystal polymers.",
