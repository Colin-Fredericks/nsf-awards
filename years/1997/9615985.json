 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Dean M. Roddick, Department of Chemistry, University of Wyoming, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division for the study of the organometallic chemistry of   fluoroalkylphosphine transition metal complexes in acid and superacid   media. Preparative routes will be developed for new cationic   fluoroalkylphosphine-group 10 metal complexes, which incorporate weakly   coordinating anions, and for analogous neutral d8 metal complexes. Using   this inventory of compounds the general area of acid-mediated   organometallic chemistry will be outlined. Initially, the dimerization of   functionalized olefins, proton induced carbonyl insertion, ethylene/CO   copolymerization, and acid directed alkane functionalization will be   examined in acidic situations. Based on the results of this portion of   the project, the chemistry will be extended to solution and solid   superacid media.  Many important chemical reactions are carried out under acidic   conditions. However, organometallic compounds, which are important   laboratory and commercial catalysts and reagents, often are not stable in   acidic environments. This project targets a newly discovered class of   organometallic compounds that have remarkable tolerance for acidic   surroundings and aims at developing new types of metal catalysts that can   promote a variety of reactions in acid and superacid media.",
