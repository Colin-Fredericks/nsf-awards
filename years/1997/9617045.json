 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to extend investigations of viral diversity and the magnitude and variability of bacterial and algal mortality due to viral attack in the Arctic Ocean.  The PI proposes to extend these studies with emphasis on sea ice microbial communities for comparison with the underlying sea water.  Collection, fixation, and concentration of melted sea ice samples will be accomplished at sampling sites by deployment from US Navy submarine.  Subsequent analyses will be conducted in the laboratory.  Total counts of viruses and the frequency of viral infection in phytoplankton and bacteria in sea ice and seawater will be determined by electron microscopy on fixed samples.  To examine natural community diversity, concentrates of viruses will be purified and subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to separate viral DNA based on genome size.  From the number, positions, and staining intensity of different bands, the PI will estimate the diversity, genome sizes, and abundance of viruses in each sample.  Through coordination with other researchers, the PI will relate viral abundance, the frequency of viral infections, and viral community diversity to hydrographic and biological variables to determine those which may be important in regulating viral propagation in arctic sea ice and seawater.",
