 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Mars-Rock Special Research Opportunity activity   supports theoretical evaluation of mineral alteration in hydrothermal   systems by Dr. Everett L. Shock of the Earth and Planetary Science   Department, Washington University.  The project is funded by the Office   of Polar Programs, the Chemistry Division, and the MPS Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities.  Martian meteorites show isotropic,   petrological and mineralogic evidence for hydrothermal or aqueous   alteration of the martian crust.  The presence of thermaphilic microbes   in terrestrial hydrothermal ecosystems raises the possiblity that   subsurface life, independent of photochemistry, atmospheric chemistry,   and the presence of a surface hydrosphere, may exist or have existed in   hydrothermal environments on other planets.  In order to develop a   predictive model for crustal alteration on Mars, all petrologic,   geochemical and isotopic data on minerals and organic compounds in   ALH84001 and other martial meteorites will be used to examine various   pathways for the formation of carbonate minerals, polycyclic aromatic   hydrocarbons, and other organic compounds during water-rock reactions.    Rigorous, quantitative models of geochemical mass transfer based on   irreversible thermodynamics will be used.  The results will determine the   constraints on temperatures and fluid compositions required for mineral   alteration and organic synthesis.  Recent advances in the theoretical   geochemistry of hydrothermal systems and ongoing research in geochemical   bioenergetics will be used in developing the model.  The research will   involve conducting theoretical mass-transfer calculations that simulate   the reactions of aqueous fluids with a rock of the composition of martian   meteorites to establish the ranges of temperature and fluid composition   consistent with the deposition of carbonate minerals without the   formation of hydrous silicate phases.  The conditions leading to   carbonate deposition will be compared to those necessary for synthesis of   aqueous organic compounds from carbon dioxide.  Specific attention will   be paid to whether polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are compatible with   the alteration assemblage at metastable redox equilibrium.  The discovery of microbes capable of living in terrestrial hydrothermal   conditions raises the possibility that life may have existed in similar   conditions on Mars or other planets.  A theoretical model that compares   geological conditions to the requirements for organic synthesis will be   developed.  The result will be an analysis of the potential for martian   hydrothermal systems to support hydrothermal ecosystems.",
