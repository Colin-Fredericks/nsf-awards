 "awd_abstract_narration": "P. I.:  John Churchill    RFB&D is conducting a three-year project with funding from the National Science Foundation to develop a unique technology to integrate computerized text files with digital human voice recording.  This technology will make mathematics, science, and other educational materials accessible to print-disabled people.    The most widely used technology available to print-disabled people today for accessing information includes large print, braille, analog recordings and computerized text files.  Although analog recordings offer the sound quality of a human voice, searching for information is a difficult and time-consuming process.  Conversely, a book on computer disk has advanced search and retrieval capabilities but sound quality is restricted by the nature of synthetic speech.  The combination of the recorded voice and a computerized  text file will make mathematics and science materials more accessible due to the random access capabilities of both disciplines that digital audio offers in a more dynamic and robust format.    For the purposes of this project, RFB&D is employing several methods to achieve its previously stated objectives.  They are first and foremost working to develop a software that will integrate the computer text file with a digitally recorded human voice.  They will then create a nongraphically based user interface to help make mathematics, science and other technological materials accessible to print-disabled people via the computer.      Digital audio books will offer the best features of both audio and E-Text formats--the recorded human voice and the ability to search and retrieve information as needed.  This newly created reading system, which will run on a standard multimedia computer equipped with a sound card and CD-ROM, will revolutionize how print-disabled people read and obtain information.    Most important, digital audio books will, for the first time ever, allow print-disabled people to access mathematics, science and other technological m aterials through natural human speech using a personal computer.",
