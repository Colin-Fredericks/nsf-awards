 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project integrates innovative optical/digital diagnostic techniques, including particle image velocimetry (PIV) into the current senior-level Thermal and Fluid Sciences laboratory course.   The inclusion of PIV and other image processing techniques introduces students to state-of-the-art optical/image processing technology and enhances students' understanding of fundamental flow physics through hands-on laboratory experience.       The PIV technique not only provides a global visualization of the entire flow field, it also allows the flow data to be evaluated quantitatively and compared directly with the results predicted by relevant theories or principles.  Three experiments are specifically designed to take advantage of the unique capabilities of PIV and strengthen the curriculum.  Detailed laboratory manuals can be prepared and made available through the Intemet.  Additionally, the PIV image processing system provides real-time image acquisition and analysis to complement other traditional flow visualization methods such as smoke-wire, shadowgraph, and schlieren techniques.       Integration of modern optical/digital image processing techniques into this class increases students' interest by allowing them to visualize concepts that are otherwise difficult to grasp.  These courses showcase PIV demonstration experiments, both in the laboratory and through the use of full motion MPEG video format, to provide students with a better understanding of the lecture material.     *",
