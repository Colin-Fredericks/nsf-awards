 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bansil  9618467    This research will investigate the kinetics of phase  separation in physical and chemical gels and pre-gel  branched polymers with varying degrees of crosslinking.  The  work with the physical gels will focus on the role of  simultaneous phase separation and aggregation/gelation in  controlling the morphology of polymeric membranes prepared  either via thermal quenching or solvent exchange.  The  studies with chemically crosslinked gels will focus on the  effects of network elasticity and crosslinking on the phase  separation kinetics via the mechanisms of nucleation and  growth and spinodal decomposition.  Theoretical work based  on both linear and non-linear theory of spinodal  decomposition kinetics will also be done.  A novel SAXS  experiment is proposed to determine the growth in the size  of the precipitated particles in order to test the  applicability of nucleation and growth mechanisms which are  generally believed to be responsible for the formation of  Liesgang bands in gels, and to examine reactions under  conditions where instabilities lead to the formation of  stationary patterns, known as Turing patterns.    %%%    This work has both fundamental and practical implications,  since phase separation mechanisms play an important role in  determining the properties of composite materials.  Gels  provide a useful model system to investigate diffusion  controlled reactions, which has implications for a wide  range of phenomena in chemical and biological systems.    ***",
