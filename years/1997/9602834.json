 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Wistar Institute, founded in 1892, is the oldest independent institution in the United States devoted to biological research and training.  Located in close proximity to the University of Pennsylvania, the Institute has developed collaborative interactions with the university while maintaining its status as an independent, nonprofit, basic research organization.  Thirty-eight laboratories are housed in the facility, including research laboratories for the Structural Biology Program, established in 1991.  An important aim of the Program is to develop and apply technologies and methodological approaches to investigate biological macromolecules at every level of organization, ranging from atomic detail using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy to complex macromolecule assemblies.  Existing conditions of the facility prevent the optimal usage of space and specialized equipment contained in laboratories designated to accomplish this work.  Problems include: major deficiencies in the air condition system, including inadequate cooling, dehumidification, and temperature fluctuations;  2) unreliable cold room space; 3) poor layout and space design, and 4) inadequate plumbing that periodically floods the lab damaging equipment.   The ARI Program will provide funds to rectify deficiencies of space dedicated for the Macromolecular Interaction Complex of the Structural Biology Program. Specifically, four laboratories will be consolidated in contiguous space that can be designed for structure-function and biochemical studies and for required instrumentation. The renovated space will facilitate interactions with investigators and students, and  will support advanced technologies needed to conduct modern molecular biology research. This project  also complements the renovation of the Macromolecular Structure Facility,  a project  that was partially funded by the ARI Program.",
