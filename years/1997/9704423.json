 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embid  9704423       The investigator studies mathematical problems with  applications in geophysical fluid dynamics and reactive flows.  The two main topics of research are: 1.  Averaging over fast  gravity waves for geophysical flows. 2.  Front wave propagation in  reactive flows.  The investigator combines formal asymptotic  analysis and rigorous mathematical theory of physical models,  together with the numerical analysis of simplified problems.  In  the first topic he studies the limiting dynamics of several  geophysical fluid dynamical systems that include the rotating  shallow water equations and the rotating Boussinesq equations for  stably stratified flow.  In the physically relevant regimes of low  Froude number or low Rossby number the equations evolve with two  separated scales; the slow modes are associated with  quasi-geostrophic flows, and the fast modes correspond to gravity  waves.  The investigator derives simplified equations for the  limiting dynamics of geophysical flows at low Froude or low  Rossby number by averaging over the fast gravity waves.  These  limiting equations are applicable even when the flow is not in  geostrophic balance initially.  The investigator studies the  resulting simplified dynamics equations, which include in natural  and systematic manner the important effects of three-wave  resonant interactions of three fast gravity waves, or two gravity  waves and a vortical mode.  In the second topic he studies the  propagation of fronts in the presence of an underlying advective  velocity field.  This velocity field involves several space-time  scales, describing large variations both at the integral scale,  as well as rapid fluctuations at a scale intermediate between the  integral scale and the front thickness.  The investigator works on  the derivation and analysis of effective large scale equations  for the propagation of fronts in the physical limit of fast  reaction, slow diffusion, and fast velocity fluctuations at the  intermediate scale.  He applies  these results to study the  interaction of either premixed or diffusive flames with the  turbulent velocity field, and to study moist convection in  clouds.       The research on the limiting dynamics of geophysical flows  and the role of the fast gravity waves has potential applications  in atmospheric and oceanic sciences.  As the demand for more  accurate numerical weather predictions increases, it is necessary  to gain better understanding of the effect of the unavoidable  fast gravity waves that pollute all calculations.  Similarly, the  need for long range forecasting also requires a better  understanding of the accumulative effects of the fast gravity  waves.  Additionally, this work is relevant in the area of  stratified turbulence, where the simplified dynamics equations  can help to explain some of the universal features observed in  the velocity spectrum in the atmosphere and the ocean.  The  research on front wave propagation has potential applications in  combustion design, guiding the engineer in evaluating the  reliability of the simplified advection algorithms currently used  in flame front propagation.  This work is also relevant to cloud  physics.  Clouds are a key ingredient in the radiative balance of  the earth and also a key variable in the study of weather  forecasting and global climate.  Currently, in large-scale  numerical simulations of the atmosphere, the important effects of  the small-scale cloud physics cannot be modelled in detail.  This  work gives insight into ways of incorporating the small-scale  effects of the interaction of moisture and convective currents in  clouds into these large-scale calculations.",
