 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Coffin   CAA 9707100    The goal of this project is for the PI to obtain new skills in   geographic information systems (GIS) and landscape pattern analysis   while on a sabbatical leave at the University of New Mexico. The PI   will use these new skills, in combination with her established   expertise in simulation modeling, to analyze and predict plant species   dominance at ecotones, or boundaries between ecosystem types. The   specific objectives to be accomplished are: (1) acquiring GIS   expertise and familiarity with spatial data layers available for   grass-woody plant ecotones in New Mexico; (2) gaining a better   understanding of properties of ecotones and the importance of   spatially-explicit processes to ecotone dynamics; and (3) increasing   the PI's knowledge of pattern analysis and edge detection techniques   in landscapes. The PI will take a class in GIS, and will collaborate   with numerous investigators working at the NSF-supported Sevilleta   Long Term Ecological Research site. Acquiring this new expertise is an   integral first step for the PI to achieve her long-term goal of   developing a spatially-explicit modeling tool to understand and   predict responses of vegetation at ecotones.         This project has broad scientific importance for two reasons. First,   ecotones are among the most dynamic and important areas for landscapes   and regions, the spatial scales where global changes in climate and   regional changes in landuse are expected to have the largest impact  on plant communities and ecosystems. Currently we are lacking a  good understanding of how environmental factors, such as climate and   landuse, interact with ecological processes to produce patterns in   vegetation. A spatially-explicit, mechanistic tool is needed to predict   changes in vegetation patterns as the environment changes. This project   will allow the PI to develop such a tool. Second, this project will   provide the PI with expertise in a combination of quantitative   approaches tha t is not commonly found in ecologists. Furthermore, women   are under-represented in each of these areas. This combination of   different approaches will provide a unique perspective on ecological   problems, a perspective that the PI can transmit to future ecologists by   teaching undergraduate and graduate level courses as well as by   mentoring graduate students.",
