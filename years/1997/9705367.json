A  first  project  centers  on  study  of the  unexpectedly  large  spacing  observed between the two outermost layers on surfaces of  Ag  and  Cu,  at elevated temperatures in ultra high vacuum. Study of this  expansion effect will be extended to binary systems, and will  be  compared  with  recently generated theoretical  predictions.  The  second  major project is a study of initial stages of  oxidation,  the  first  1   -   10nm of oxide growth,  making  use  of  great  advances in surface analysis techniques that have been made since  classic oxidation studies. Emphasis is on the mechanism of growth  and  the  microstructure of the resulting oxide. A wide range  of  systems, including Si, Ni, Al, Cu, Ge and SiC will be studied.  A  variety of additional tools, including STM, AFM and photoelectron  spectroscopy  will  be  employed  in  the  project.  The  primary  experimental   tool   is  high-resolution   medium   energy   ion  scattering,  which can provide information on surface  structure,  growth mechanisms, and kinetics.  %%%%  This   experimental   research  uses  advance   surface   science  instrumentation to study at the atomic level the process of oxide  film  growth  on metals and semiconductors. Oxide  growth  is  of  immense  importance in wide areas of technology, for  example  in  the  silicon  technology  where  gate  oxides  are  central,   to  passivation  layers on metals such as aluminum. Previous  studies  have  been limited in the availability of experimental techniques  and  equipment,  leaving many questions on how oxidation  occurs,  especially  during the first few atomic layers. This experimental  study  will  depend primarily upon medium energy ion  scattering,  supplemented  by  other techniques including  scanning  tunneling  microscopy and atomic fo rce microscopy. Materials of interest  in  this  project are Si, Ni, Al, Cu, Ge and SiC. Results  from  this  research   may  include  unusual  new  effects  which  may   find  application   in   technology.   This   research    project    is  interdisciplinary   in   nature   and   involves   graduate   and  postgraduate  students who will be excellently trained  to  enter  positions in industry, government or education.  ***",
