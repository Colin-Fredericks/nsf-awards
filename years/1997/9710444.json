 "awd_abstract_narration": "C.P. Snow's Rede Lecture in 1959 declared that the humanities and sciences had grown so far apart that they had become `two cultures.`  In the decades since others have taken up the argument, contending that increased professionalization and specialization in science have widened the rift.    But concealed within many versions of the `two cultures` argument is an implicit assumption that `science` means `physical science,` or at least those sciences that most resemble the physical sciences in their methods and conceptual organization.  Throughout the twentieth century, however, there have been forms of science within the United States that are not easily categorized into either of the two cultures, and which have, in fact, served as an intellectual commons for meetings among researchers in various disciplines and for meetings among scientists and the lay public.  Natural history is perhaps the most powerfully resonant of such meeting grounds, though there are others.  Drawing on representative individuals selected from areas of biology and the social sciences, this study will highlight areas of scientific investigation that transcend or defy the two cultures.  The project will contribute to several fields within the history of science, particularly those areas of research in which scholars are examining relations between science and the polity, the nature of scientific change, and the development of theories at the intersection of the social and biological sciences.",
