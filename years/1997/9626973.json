 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  East  Pacific Rise (EPR) north of the Orozco  transform  fault  off the coast of Mexico provides unique opportunities  to  further  our understanding of the origin  of  the  ocean  crust  and the nature of the upper mantle.   This region  is  the  shallowest, most-inflated portion of the northern  EPR,  and  extends  the range of axial morphology  that  has  been  examined in detail by a factor of two, which allows the test  of  a  number of models relating axial morphology  to  magma  chambers,  volcanic  behavior,  and  hydrothermal  activity.  Second, this region allows a clarification of the nature and  origin of the chemical characteristics of the Pacific  upper  mantle.  Basalts recovered from the EPR differ fundamentally  in  their  distribution of chemical compositions from  those  recovered  along  the mid-Atlantic Ridge.    There  are  two  hypotheses  for  these differences:   (1)  that  the  mantle  beneath  the  EPR is ubiquitously \"veined\"  by  small  scale  heterogeneities  that  are a natural  consequence  of  plate  recirculation in the upper mantle;  (2) that hot spots under  the  EPR  are  smeared out and mixed in to the upper  mantle  more  efficiently than along the MAR.    The Orozco  anomaly  is  a  potential small hot spot track near the EPR.   If  we  find   that  it  is  a  hot  spot,  and  that  its  chemical  characteristics can explain the enriched MORB along the EPR,  then the second model will be supported.  If not, then model  (1) is more likely.",
