 "awd_abstract_narration": "Webb  9705595       The investigators and colleagues organize an international  conference on mathematical models in medical and health sciences  at Vanderbilt University.  The conference involves approximately  100 talks and 175 participants.  There are 11 plenary talks in  such areas as models of the HIV infected immune system, models of  normal and pathological blood production systems, models of tumor  growth and treatment, models of pancreatic function, wavelet  analysis and medical imaging, models of the emergence of drug  resistance, models of epidemiology, models of DNA and hereditary  abnormalities, and models of nerve impulse conduction.  The  conference has special sessions in cancer models, diffusive  systems in biology, epidemic models, models in immunology, models  of cell population dynamics, optimization and control in  biological models, medical imaging, and cure models in survival  analysis.       The scientific purpose of the conference is to stimulate  research in theoretical mathematical models in areas of biology,  medicine, and health and life sciences.  The focus of the  conference is to bring together mathematicians, biologists, and  medical researchers to a forum that promotes interdisciplinary  collaborations.  A major aim of the conference is to involve young  researchers and to stimulate their research goals and directions.  The participation of recent Ph.D. recipients and graduate  students is a substantial part of the conference program.  The  scientific and educational significance of the conference is  evidenced by the wide range of research topics presented, the  diverse participation of researchers from mathematics  departments, biology departments, engineering departments,  medical research institutes, and pharmaceutical companies, and  the active participation of graduate students and young  researchers.",
