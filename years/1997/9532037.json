 "awd_abstract_narration": "9532037  Riggs  The term very large floating structure (VLFS) is often used  to describe floating structures which are at lease an order  of magnitude larger than existing floating structures.  Implicit in the definition of VLFS is that the wave-induced  motions of these structures will be significantly affected,  if not dominated, by the flexible, deformational motion of  the structure.  This is in contrast to traditional floating  structures (such as a ship), the design and analysis of  which are usually based on the hydrodynamics of a rigid  body.  Potential applications of VLFS technology include  offshore waste treatment plants, electrical power plants,  water desalination plants, mariculture platforms,  oceanographic research facilities, airports, and military  bases.  Unfortunately, the field data and experience upon  which to base the design of a VLFS is limited to much  smaller structures.    It is the objective of this project to develop further the  analysis capabilities and the fundamental understanding of  the response of VLFSs to the ocean environment.  Because of  their size and complexity, efficient methods and simplified  models are required for their design and analysis.  The work  proposed herein builds on the existing technology base for  the analysis of large floating structures.  Such work is  required prior to the construction of any VLFS, and hence  the results will represent a significant advancement in the  state-of-the-art in offshore floating structure technology.  This research program proposed to:  1) improve existing  linear analysis methods; 2) establish simplified analysis  models to be used for design; and 3) develop a nonlinear  analysis methodology to determine the response to extreme  events.  ***",
