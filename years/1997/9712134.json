These structures consist of  interfaces, or membranes, which divide the material into  distinct volumes.  Such two-dimensional assemblies can form  a large variety of thermodynamic phases, such as closed  vesicles, lamellar or cubic crystals, and disordered  bicontinuous networks.  They also determine the architecture  of biological systems.  The objectives of this project are  to obtain a better understanding of (i) the equilibrium  thermodynamics, structure, and phase behavior of membranes  and other macromolecular assemblies, and, (ii) the dynamics  of complex liquids and the dynamical behavior of polymers  and membranes in solvent.  Both simulation and analytic  techniques will be used.  An essential component of this  research will be to develop and implement new algorithms for  the numerical simulation of the equilibrium and non-  equilibrium dynamics of these systems.  %%%  This project will employ advanced computational techniques  and theoretical analysis to study complex fluids.  The  systems to be studied are comprised of materials like water  and fatty acids.  These systems form all sorts of complex  structures which are not well understood.  They present a  significant challenge to the researcher.  These systems also  form the basis for biological materials which make up many  life forms.  ***",
