 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to transform a new modeling procedure into a general large eddy simulations tool for engineering and geophysical flows.  To accomplish this goal the following tasks will be performed.  The modeling procedure will be further investigated and validated for several non-stationary flows and flows with additional physical effects like rotation.  The performance of the model for high Reynolds number flows will be evaluated.  The model will be extended to the physical space representation and to general finite difference codes.  Finally, the numerical implementation of the model will be optimized in terms of the computer memory and CPU time.    The motivation for this effort is the fact that  numerical simulations of turbulence at very high Reynolds numbers require models to account  for small scales which cannot be resolved explicitly because of inadequate capabilities of current as well as future supercomputers.  In large eddy simulations (LES) several competing subgrid-scale (SGS) models are currently in use, e.g. the classical Smagorinsky model, several variants of the dynamic model, the structure function model, the renormalization group model, similarity models, etc.  While these models successfully capture some features of turbulent flows they often fail to predict other, equally important features.  For instance, correct  predictions of backscatter present  a significant challenge for all eddy viscosity models while similarity models usually under-predict SGS dissipation.  In addition, the existing models require the calibration of adjustable constants and various ad hoc averaging procedures which depend on simulated flows.  Deficiencies of the models may be traced to inadequate representation of nonlinear  interactions between resolved and subgrid scales in the modeling procedures.    The model to be utilized represents a new approach to the problem of subgrid-scale modeling in turbulent that makes maximum use of the knowledge of nonlinear interactions acquired  during last several years through the analyses of direct numerical simulations databases.  This model has several important properties which distinguish it favorably from the traditional models: it does not contain any adjustable constants; no wall functions are required; the modeled SGS stresses exhibit very high correlations (50 - 90 %) with the exact stresses for all six SGS stress components; mean and rms values of modeled quantities (stresses, SGS forces, SGS dissipation, etc.) are accurately predicted; significant local backscatter is predicted in a numerically stable manner without any averaging procedures; and all the SGS stress components have correct near-wall behavior.    The model has already been implemented and tested for turbulent channel flow and for isotropic turbulence in statistically steady state.",
