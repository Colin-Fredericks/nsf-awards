The  data acquired will allow study of 1) the channel creation process, 2) the  development of the return stroke and dart-leader diameter with time,  and 3) the evolution of channel microscale tortuosity.  These experiments  will yield unique data sets that are fundamentally new and that could be  critical in the testing of newly emerging models of different phases of  the lightning discharge.          The recordings proposed would be made from two separate sites.   A  distant  site (~ 1 km away) would be used to provide an overall record  of the luminous lightning components propagating along most of the  channel below cloud base.  A \"near  photographic site (80 m away) is also  proposed to record new details of the evolution of lightning channels  during the course of the discharge.  The totality of photographic records   obtained would correlate with and complement other data sets to be  acquired simultaneously by other researchers participating in this  campaign.          The distant-site recordings would document the creation of the  lightning channel by the initial leader process using a near-UV  photographic system;  this provides a superior rendering of the initial  phase of the discharge.  The near-site experiments would provide highly  time-resolved imagery of the cross-sections of lightning channels for the  same strokes, these records being attained from a vertical section only 8  mm in extent.  These close-up recordings would yield a direct  measurement of the luminous channel diameter as small as 6mm with a  time resolution of 0.9 ms.  Once 10-20 return stroke images are obtained,  attempts would be made to image the cross-sections of downward  propagating dart-leaders or dart-stepped leaders from a channel section  aloft as the dart-leader luminous  diameter has not been examined directly  before.  Framing photographs (4000 fr/sec) of the same field of view  would document the movement and geometric variation of the channels   on the microscale (~2 cm).          It is anticipated that the field observations could be acquired in a  single field campaign during the first summer of support.  The remainder  of the project would be devoted to analysis of the photographic data in  its own right along with use of these results in collaborative analyses with  other researchers.",
