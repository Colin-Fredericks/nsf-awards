 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9661572  Kalumuck    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project to be carried out by Dynaflow, Inc. is aimed at the development of an efficient cost-effective technology for treatment of water polluted with organic wastes including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by complete oxidation.  Such materials pose a major environmental health hazard at numerous industrial sites and laboratory facilities threatening air pollution and ground water contamination.  Complete oxidation by conventional means entails costly chemical treatment and often leads to carcinogenic end products, however.  The proposed research will apply hydrodynamic cavitation to induce oxidation in the bulk solution.  The novelty of this approach lies in the use of resonating cavitating jets to trigger wide spread cavitation.  The Phase I research will address the feasibility of the technique.  A detailed experimental investigation will be performed to assess the effects of jet type, operating conditions, and cavitation enhancement devices on the oxidation process.  The oxidation products will be chemically analyzed to provide a quantitative measure for the oxidation efficiency based on the power required.  Results will be compared with those of more conventional ultrasonic cavitation oxidation.  In the next phase of the research, scale up, optimization, and prototype issues will be addressed.   In response to a major national and international concern, the proffered technology for water treatment will provide a reliable cost-effective means for toxic waste handling and elimination of hazardous organic compounds such as dissolved VOCs resulting in safe end products.  ***",
