 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of this project grows out of curricular needs in Microbiology.  We will add 4 new exercises to our Microbiology laboratory which will focus on the major advances that have occurred in molecular techniques commonly used in modern Microbiology laboratories during the past 15 years.  The purpose of these new exercises is to demonstrate the common techniques that are now used in modern molecular Microbiology laboratories:  (1) fluorescence microscopy for identification of bacteria using either antibody of oligonucleotide probes labeled with fluorescent dyes, (2) electrophoresis of proteins and nucleic acids, (3) Western immunoblotting for protein identification, (4) ELISA for quick identification screening of specific antigens and (5) PCR for amplification of DNA for various identification purposes.  The laboratory model which will be used based upon the PI's extensive research experience using molecular Microbiology for the diagnosis of the fastidious, slow growing fish pathogen, Renibacterium salmoninarum.  This pathogen is excellent for use in the undergraduate Microbiology laboratory because it is a strict psychrophile, and is nonpathogenic to humans.         With the modernization of the Microbiology laboratory, we also have the opportunity to update our Cellular and Molecular Techniques course.  A new exercise will be introduced to the existing series of cloning procedures.  In particular, we plan to introduce students to PCR amplification in the context of the existing series of DNA exercises.          Purchase College undergraduates are required to do a two semester Senior Research Project.  The scope and conceptual sophistication of research projects available for student participation will also be considerably enhanced.  Several of our faculty have proposed use of the new equipment in new and ongoing projects designed for undergraduate student participation.         This project will enhance the conceptual as well as the technical training of students.  The use of direct f amiliarity with common techniques in modern Molecular Microbiology, Cell Biology, and Molecular Biology will greatly improve our student's preparedness for graduate programs, and/or for entering a highly technical, biotechnology workforce.  *",
