 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712688  Otaigbe    This GOALI research program investigates the role of  magnetic particle morphology, concentration and distribution  on the processing, and magnetization behavior of bonded  magnets. The heat resistance of bonded magnets can be  improved by selecting heat resistant binders and high  temperature polymers.  However, the use of high temperature  engineering polymers is limited by the oxidizing behavior of  the magnetic alloy powders at the polymer processing  temperatures.  Thermal stability of the rare earth magnetic  powders at the desired temperature ranges can be improved by  suitable surface treatments.  The energy product can be  improved by optimizing the fraction of magnetic powders and  careful control of the particle morphology and particle size  distribution.   A fundamental understanding of the  interaction between the polymer matrix and magnetic powders  is essential in developing suitable powder coatings to  improve the thermal stability of the powders.  Surface  coatings which are chemically compatible with the polymer  binder are investigated.  The study focuses on evaluating  various types of polymer binders, such as polyphenylene  sulphide (PPS) and liquid crystal polymers (LCP).  In  addition the rheological behavior of the polymer  binder/powder mixtures is studied for improving  processability.  Based on the experimental data obtained,  theoretical models are developed to predict the optimal  concentrations and distributions of magnetic powders.  The  project involves a collaboration between Iowa State  University and Arnold Engineering Company, a leading  manufacturer of magnetic materials in the United States.  The graduate student will spend three summer months at  Arnold Engineering assisting in elevated temperature testing  of the samples.  This project is jointly funded by the MPS  Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of  Materials Research.  %%%  Polymer bonded magnets are widely being used in many  automotive and nonautomotive appli cations.  A need exists to  develop bonded magnets with higher energy products that can  withstand operating temperatures of at least 180 C and  higher.  A key issue is the identification of suitable  magnetic powders and polymer matrices which can perform  satisfactorily at the desired higher temperatures.  ***",
