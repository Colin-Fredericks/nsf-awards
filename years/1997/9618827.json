 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop high performance iterative  techniques for solving general sparse linear systems of  equations.  Here, high-performance is meant in the double sense  of (1) intrinsically efficient and (2) designed for high-  performance platforms.  This research is motivated mainly by the  belief that parallel iterative methods will be fully accepted in  the applications world only if they are robust as well as  efficient for solving linear systems arising from typical  applications, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics.  For this  reason preconditioning techniques that utilize a high order of  accuracy will be emphasized.  These include the high level of  fill in complete factorizations such as ILUT and ILU(k).  The  most general framework of irregularly structured sparse linear  systems will be considered.  These matrices are partitioned and  mapped into a distributed memory multiprocessor system and the  systems are then solved with a preconditioned Krylov subspace  technique -- using a message passing library such as MPI for  communicating between processors.  There are three major issues  to be considered with care.  First, preconditioning techniques  developed specifically for distributed sparse matrices will be  investigated.  Second, techniques to reduce the impact of inner  products in Krylov subspace accelerators will be considered.  These inner products cause the parallel implementations to become  inefficient as the number of processors increases.  Finally,  independent of consideration of parallelism, robust iterative  solvers will be sought with the ultimate goal of improving the  current state-of-the-art.    On the preconditioners side, the methods to be developed are of  three types: (1) derived from a Domain Decomposition viewpoint  but adapted to general sparse matrices, (2) ILU with multi-  elimination (ILUM) and related techniques, and (3) Hybrid methods  derived from approximate inverse techniques. On the accelerators  side, hybrid techniques that lowe r the impact of inner-product  computations, as well as block Krylov methods will be  investigated.  ***",
