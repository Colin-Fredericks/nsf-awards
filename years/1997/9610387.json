 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kim  9610387    A central problem in the theory of automorphic forms is to decompose square integrable automorphic forms of a reductive group. While the continuous part of the spectrum can be deduced from the theory of Eisenstein series, the discrete spectrum is very hard to study. It is the purpose of Arthur's trace formula to study this part. However, the trace formula will not separate the cuspidal part from the residual part, and one needs to study the residual spectrum by computing the residues of Eisenstein series. Moreover, the first exotic example of the residual  spectrum of the split group G_2, which was discovered by Langlands and  further studied later by Moeglin and Waldspurger, was significant to Arthur in formulating his conjectures.  Computing residues of Eisenstein series is a very difficult problem and requires both the knowledge of the poles of corresponding automorphic L-functions, as well as handling very difficult computational combinatorics. These computations are already highly non-trivial even for rank 2 split groups.  On the other hand, Arthur's conjectures are aimed at parametrizing the discrete spectrum in terms of representations of a certain profinite arithmetic group. While parametrizing most of it requires the introduction of this hypothetical group, there are parts of it that can be parametrized by our existing knowledge. In particular, this is the case if the Eisenstein series is built out of minimal parabolics.  Moeglin proved that for split classical groups, the local components of the residual spectrum coming from the trivial character of the torus, are parametrized by the distinguished unipotent orbits O of the dual group and  Springer(O) , where  Springer(O)  is the set of characters of the component group that are in the image of the Springer correspondence. The PI verified that the same thing happens for the split group G_2 and plan to show that the same thing would happen for all split groups. The fact that the component group of the Arthur parameter for  G_2 is non-abelian explains the \"bizarre\" multiplicity condition in Moeglin-Waldspurger's work on G_2. The PI showed, in joint work with F. Shahidi, that for an arbitrary unitary character, the local components of the residual spectrum attached to certain unipotent orbits, are parametrized by the Knapp-Stein R-group of the character. In general, the Knapp-Stein R-groups are not enough. We have to combine the R-group and Springer(O). In this way, the PI plans to  show that the quadratic unipotent Arthur parameters  in the sense of Moeglin exhaust the residual spectrum coming from the torus.  The investigator will carry the above projects to quasi-split groups. A similar thing happens to U(n,n), but the global Weil group W_F comes into play. Therefore we expect that the action of the global Weil group will play a role in parametrizing the residual spectrum.  The groups U(n,n) and  E_7,3  all have a relative root system of type C_n, and the technique of symplectic groups will be applied directly.     This proposal is in the part of mathematics known as the Langlands program. The Langlands program is part of Number Theory. Number Theory is the study of the  properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest branch of mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have  furnished a driving force in creating new mathematics in other  diverse parts of the discipline. The Langland's program is a  general philosophy that connects number theory with calculus;  it  embodies the modern approach to the study of whole numbers. Modern Number Theory is very technical and deep, but it has had  astonishing applications in areas like theoretical computer  science and coding theory.",
