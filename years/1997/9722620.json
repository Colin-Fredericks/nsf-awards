 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT 9722620  Hickey      This U.S-Czech research project between William Hickey of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Vladimir Brenner of the Czech Institute of Microbiology, Prague, will characterize chlorobenzoate biodegradation genes (ohb): Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain JB2 and Pseudomonas putida strain P111.  The researchers expect that this examination of a key aspect of PCB mineralization will lead to a better understanding of the impact of PCBs on the evolution of metabolic pathways in soil bacteria.    The collaborative effort will involve isolation and characterization of the ohb genes by genomic library construction/screening, nucleotide sequence analysis and metabolism studies.  Recombinant PCB-mineralizing strains will be constructed by using a broad host-range suicide delivery system to introduce the ohb genes into biphenyl degraders isolated from PCB contaminated sites in the Czech Republic.  These strains will then be tested for efficacy in mineralizing PCBs in soil by using PCB mixtures.  Overall, results are expected to contribute insight in developing cost effective approaches for bioremediation of PCBs, an important class of environmental pollutants.    This project in metabolic biochemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.         ??",
