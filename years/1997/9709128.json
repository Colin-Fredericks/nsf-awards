 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project consists of two completely separate parts: a largely  analytical study of a particular nonlinear wave problem and a  computational and modelling study of orientation tuning in the  mammalian visual cortex.  The first part considers a particular  coupled system of nonlinear PDEs which the PI and M. Shelley  have already computationally shown to have finite time  singularities of \"pinching type\".  The system is a model for the  flow of a pair of immiscible irrotational inviscid fluids in two  dimensions.  The singularity, in which one of the two evolving  functions goes from being strictly positive to positive except  for vanishing at a point, corresponds to a strand of fluid being  broken in two.  Questions of existence and regularity of  strictly positive solutions will be considered, as will  energy-methods to prove a finite-time singularity.  In the  second part, the PI will work with experimentalists B. Shapley  and D. Ringach on various aspects of orientation tuning.  Providing experience in modelling and computation, various  models will be compared to experimental results, with the added  possibility of the computational results being used to suggest  further experiments.",
