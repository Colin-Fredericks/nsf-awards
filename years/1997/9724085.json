 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT                                  The major events of the cell division cycle, DNA synthesis  and mitosis, are triggered by 'cyclin-dependent kinases'  (CDK's): a family of enzymes whose activity and specificity  depend on their binding to various cyclins.  CDK activity is  also regulated by phosphorylation and by binding to  inhibitory proteins.  These regulatory proteins interact  with each other in a complex web of biochemical reactions  and feedback signals, to generate an orderly progression of  the cell cycle.  So far, characterization of this regulatory  system has been reductionistic: breaking the network into  its constituent pieces and determining which pieces  interact.  Rigorous mathematical methods are being developed  to assemble the pieces into a coherent model of the intact  regulatory system, so that predictions can be compared  qualitatively with experimental observations about the  physiology and genetics of the organisms. Using standard  methods of dynamical systems theory, the investigators are  constructing comprehensive, accurate, and predictive.  Mathematical models of the cell cycle in yeast cells and  frog embryos.    The human genome project promises to deliver a rich stream  of information about the genes and proteins that govern all  our physiological affairs. Complementing extensive research  on the 'informational' aspects of genome analysis (storage  and retrieval, sequence comparison, structural predictions)  this project addresses a new level of 'dynamical' questions:  how do molecules interact with one another in time and space  to produce the organized, functional behavior of living  cells? Appropriate mathematical and computational tools to  answer this question are being developed in the context of a  specific physiological problem: cell growth and division.  To understand how cell proliferation is regulated would not  be only a satisfying achievement of basic science but also a  breakthrough for clinical medicine.  When the  signals that  initiate or suppress cell division are understood, the means  to restrain the proliferation of cancer cells or to induce  the regeneration of nerve cells will become more apparent.      This work is being funded by the Computational Biology  (BIO), Signal Transduction (BIO), and Mathematical Biology  (MPS) Programs.",
