 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current project is for doctoral dissertation research on the  morphosyntactic and semantic verbal system of Tsafiki (Colorado).  Tsafiki is the native language of the Tsachila (Colorados), an  indigenous minority (2,000 speakers) of the tropical western  lowlands of Ecuador. The dissertation topic will accomplish two  goals: 1) present a thorough description of one of the major  grammatical systems of the language; and 2) explore a topic of  theoretical interest to the linguistic community.     Tsafiki is an under-documented language which belongs to a  little-described family of languages of South America,  Barbakoan-Paesan. A detailed description of the morphosyntax of  the verbal system will contribute greatly to both the  understanding of Tsafiki and knowledge about this family of  languages.     Tsafiki is of theoretical interest in that it has an interesting  system of verbal classification, incorporation of both subjects  and objects and perhaps, most importantly, a very elaborate  evidential (source of knowledge) system. This evidential system  is an integral part of the grammar. Much of the morphosyntactic  resources of the language are devoted to coding not only the  source of information but also the type of information and  whether the information falls into the category of cultural,  general knowledge or knowledge based on the speaker's own  immediate perceptions and internal states. The evidential system  interacts in some interesting ways with the person-marking  system, the tense-aspect system and the verbal classification  system. While evidential systems are attested in a number of  languages worldwide they also appear to be an areal phenomenon in  South America. They appear in Quechua, Aymara and languages of  the Amazonian basin. But very little descriptive or theoretical  work has been done on such systems. This dissertation will  advance the theoretical understanding of such systems.     The project has also been designed to benefit thr ee different  communities: 1) the academic community of the United States; 2)  the academic community of Ecuador; and 3) the Tsachila community  itself. Copies of all materials produced will be given to the  Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Ecuador and to the Tsachila  community. In addition, the materials will be used as a basis for  eventually producing bilingual materials, a dictionary and  pedagogical materials for the community.",
