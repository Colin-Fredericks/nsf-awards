 "awd_abstract_narration": "Riddle  9604358    Until recently, little was known about the molecular basis of dorsoventral (D/V) patterning in the vertebrate limb. The transcription factor Lmx-1 is expressed in the dorsal half of the vertebrate limb bud, and its expression confers dorsal pattern to tendons and muscles. As such, it offers a powerful tool to study this limb patterning. Lmx-l's ability to direct pattern formation is linked to its ability to regulate transcription: it contains zinc finger domains (called LIM domains) which are believed to facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a homeodomain (HD) which binds to specific DNA targets. As a first step in understanding how dorsal pattern formation is established, Dr. Riddle plans to identify the domains in the protein which are necessary for Lmx-1 activity. To accomplish this, he will generate mutant proteins lacking the HD domain, the LIM domains, or the carboxy teminus (a putative activation domain), and then misexpress them in the developing chick limb using a replication competent retroviral vector. The activity of these mutant proteins will be assayed in three ways: 1) their ability to dorsalize ventral cells (the normal ectopic Lmx-1 phenotype), 2) their ability to interfere with normal dorsal patterning (a dominant negative effect), and 3) their ability to form ectopic digits (also a normal ectopic Lmx-1 phenotype).  He will also determine which domains are sufficient for Lmx-1 function by generating chimeras with other LIM HD proteins and misexpressing them in the developing limb. Chimeras containing Lmx-1 DNA-binding domains will be used to determine whether proper DNA-binding is sufficient to activate Lmx-1 targets. Chimeras with Lmx-l LIM domains will be tested to determine whether the LIM domains are sufficient to confer Lmx-l-like patterning to another LIM HD protein.  While Lmx- 1 can confer a dramatic phenotype, the factors which it regulates are unknown. Therefore, a cDNA difference analysis protocol will be used to identify genes which are tar gets of Lmx-1 activity. cDNAs will be formed from mRNA isolated from Lmx-1- and mock-infected ventral limb buds and used in a PCR based-subtractive hybridization protocol. Potential downstream targets will be sequenced and their expression patterns defined as a first step in their characterization. Interesting cDNAs will be misexpressed in the limb to directly define their role in limb formation.  Finally, time permitting, Dr. Riddle will use the yeast two-hybrid system as a means of identifying cDNAs which encode potential Lmx-1 interactors. Wild-type Lmx- 1 as well as mutated forrns of Lmx-1 will be used as \"baits\" to identify factors which bind to the protein. All potential interactors will be tested for their ability to bind Lmx-1 specifically. The expression pattern and nucleotide sequence of these interactors will be determined as a first step in their characterization. The interactor will be misexpressed in ovo to define their affect on limb morphogenesis, These experiments will allow Dr. Riddle to further develop a model for understanding the molecular basis of D/V patterning in the vertebrate limb.",
