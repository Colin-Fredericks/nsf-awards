 "awd_abstract_narration": "9753091  Hastings  Recently, fisheries biologists, using ultrasound to count  the number of fish impinging on power plant intakes,  serendipitously discovered that several species of clupeid  fish respond to pulsed acoustic signals at frequencies from  80 to 140 kHz.  The mechanism for such detection is not  known, however, the auditory bullae, special air-filled  structures in the inner ear of this family of fish are  believed to play a major role.  Understanding the mechanics  of this unique biological system would serve two purposes.  First, knowledge of the mechanics for detection of  ultrasonic signals could provide the key to the development  of new and improved transducers for biomedical applications.  Second, since rather high power ultrasonic signals are being  used both to find clupeids and to divert them from power  plant intakes and dams, results of this research will  provide information on what sounds would be more readily  detected by clupeids and sound pressure levels that would be  adequate to modify behavior without harming their inner ear.    The objective of this study is to examine the mechanics of  the inner ear of a clupeid fish known to respond  behaviorally to ultrasonic signals, the American shad (Alosa  sapidissima).  This species will be experimentally evaluated  by measuring the frequency response of the swimbladder,  bullae membrane, and utricular otolith to both pulsed and  continuous wave ultrasound using a noninvasive, noncontact  vibration measurement system that has been used successfully  to measure frequency responses of the peripheral auditory  organs in the goldfish (Carassiiis auratus) and oscar  (Astronotus ocellatus).  Results of this study will be used  to develop a mathematical model for the dynamic response of  the clupeid auditory system to ultrasonic signals.  Such a  model is the first step in duplicating characteristics of  this unique biological system for biomedical engineering  applications.  ***",
