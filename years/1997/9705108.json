An emphasis  is  on  use  of  the  spectra  to study  the  doping-induced  and  superfluid  spectral  weights  and  their  relationship  to   the  transition  temperature.  Other  issues  include  the   non-Drude  midinfrared  absorption, the scattering of charge  carriers,  the  superconducting  energy gap and the effects  of  strong  external  magnetic fields.  %%%  This  experimental research project uses the absorption of  light  to  study the copper-oxide superconductors and related materials.  The measurements, in effect, count the number of mobile electrons  per  copper  and  determine how many of these condense  into  the  superfluid below the superconducting transition temperature. This  provides     important    direct    information     about     the  superconductivity.  The  measurements  are  done  over   a   wide  wavelength and temperature range, and include measurements  while  the sample is subjected to a strong magnetic field.  Results from  this  research may include unusual new effects or materials which  may find new application in technology. This research project  is  interdisciplinary  in nature and involves graduate  students  who  will  be  excellently  trained to enter  positions  in  industry,  government or education.  ***",
