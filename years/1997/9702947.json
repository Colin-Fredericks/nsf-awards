 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in this project seeks to address issues arising in two computationally challenging problems with great economic potential, namely the analysis of dental implants and supporting bone structure, and the modeling of complex time-dependent 3D viscous flows.  These applications will drive development of an integrated problem solving environment that can subsequently be used to solve many similar problems.  The overall goal of the research is the simultaneous optimization of the computational process with adaptive hp discretizations and the use of the most powerful HPC hardware available, namely massively parallel distributed memory parallel architectures.  This combination of technologies should allow realistic computer simulations of the complex time dependent behavior inherent in both of these problems, for the first time.  However, this goal needs several advances in the enabling technologies required for parallel adaptive methods - data structures, mesh partitioning, inter-processor communications, error estimation, adaptive mesh design strategies, and fast and stable solvers for adaptive grids in multiprocessor environments.",
