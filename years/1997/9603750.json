 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9603750  Knapp    These studies are concerned with 2 different types of cells  found in the brain:  nerves and oligodenrocytes.  During the  time that the brain is developing, oligodendrocytes make  connections with nerves and eventually wrap a fatty coating  called myelin around the long extensions of the nerve cells.  This fatty coating is very important since it functions to  insulate the nerve cells as in an electrical wire, allowing  them to send signals with speed and accuracy.  When myelin  does not form properly or when it is destroyed by injury or  disease, the nerves do not function properly and this  results in problems with movement, vision and many other  body systems.  Since this myelin coating is so important for  the function of nerves, it is critical that we understand  how nerves and oligodendrocytes recognize each other in the  developing brain and how they interact.  Some evidence  presented by the principal investigator suggests that there  are signals which are sent from nerves to regulate  oligodendrocyte development and behavior.  The basic goal of  these studies is to determine what these signals are and how  oligodendrocytes recognize and respond to them.  The  investigators propose to address 3 related questions about  the relationship between nerves causes oligodendrocytes to  synthesize particular proteins and then distribute them to  the correct place within the cell.  (Sometimes in order for  a protein to function properly it must not only be made in  sufficient amounts, but must also be put in the right  place.)  Based on our earlier findings, the investigators  have chosen to work with proteins which control the ion  distribution and electrical activity within cells.  The  second question is whether contact with nerves regulates the  distribution of the precursor to those proteins (this is  called mRNA).  The final question is whether the  investigators can identify specific chemicals on the  surfaces of either oligodendroctyes or nerves which serve as  signa ls to control protein mRNA production and distribution  in oligodendrocytes.  These studies will help us to  understand how nerves control oligodendrocyte development  and the formulation of myelin.",
