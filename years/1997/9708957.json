 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708957  This project will focus on constructing a \"smart\"  programming environment for Java that uses semantic analyses  to statically debug, validate, and safely optimize programs.  The principal investigators have already developed an early  version of such an environment for a dialect of Scheme. A  safe implementation prevents the misuse of primitive program  operations, such as taking the head of the empty list,  through a combination of compile-time analysis, run-time  checking, and automatic storage management. Safety, however,  is not a panacea: all safe languages defer checking some  preconditions until run-time. When a run-time check fails,  program execution is aborted. Hence, programmers try to  ensure that misapplications are impossible by analyzing what  forms of data can appear as input to each primitive  operation. Unfortunately, programmers are not very good at  this task and frequently make mistakes. The primary goal of  the proposed smart programming environment is to prove the  run-time checks required for safety never fail. This  property, called \"total safety,\"  is a much stronger  property than ordinary safety. For any interesting  programming language, total safety is undecidable;  nevertheless, semantic analyses like set-based analysis can  prove many of the preconditions checked at run time never  fail. Moreover, for any unproven precondition, an  environment can construct program \"slices\" identifying the  execution paths violating the precondition. Given this  information, the programmer can decide if the failing paths  are feasible and, if so, repair the code.  ***",
