 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702805  This project investigates the task of automatically determining  properties of the run-time behavior of computer programs before  the programs are actually executed. Optimizing compilers have  long motivated research in this area, commonly known as static  program analysis. More recently, there has been interest in using  program analysis to verify correctness or safety properties of  software before it is put into service. However, due both to the  phenomenon of accumulated imprecision, which is akin to  accumulated rounding error, and to the inadequacy of invariant  properties in the presence of loops and recursion, useful and  accurate program analysis is hard to achieve in practice.  This  project examines a new methodology for program analysis designed  to address these problems. This methodology is distinctive in  that it does not analyze execution states, but instead analyzes  the changes, called transfer relations, between those states,  thus enabling previously unsolved analyses of programming  constructs such as first-class functions, concurrency, pointers  and references, assignment, mutable data structures, and arrays.  The research investigates the application of these analyses to  urgent issues such as ensuring safety of untrusted foreign code  and increasing reliability of large software systems. The project  applies this research to an educational plan including course  development, mentoring of masters students, and the development  of an annual summer school on program analysis, including a new  text.  ***",
