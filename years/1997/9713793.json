 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GOALI project is a collaborative research and educational  effort between the University of Michigan and the General  Motors Research and Development Center. It targets the general  area of simulating the vibration and noise performance of an  operating engine, leading to design changes for noise  reduction. The specific research focus is on developing an  analytical tool for predicting the dynamic response of an  engine crankshaft-block system including the oil-film  hydrodynamics. Previous work on dynamic reduction and  lubrication constitutes the foundation of this effort. The  fundamental research concentrates in the areas of developing a  dynamic substructuring  methodology for capturing the local  flexibility of the cap and bulkhead of the block dynamics,  developing a new perturbation technique for solving the oil-  film Reynolds equation, developing a computational efficient  solution for the electrohydro dynamics (EHD) lubrication  problem, and developing a crankshaft-block-oil film coupling  algorithm. Applied research is performed in parallel by General  Motors Research and Development Center in applying dynamic  reduction to crankshaft and block dynamics, including the local  flexibility of the bearing caps and engine bulkheads, utilizing  a `hourglass control` method for developing the oil-film  fluidicity  matrices, and performing the numerical  implementation and validation for the crankshaft-block-oil film  coupling algorithm. The educational objectives are identivied  in the ara of joint advising, introducing new technology into  the University curriculum, and developing a short course for  engineers in the Industry. Substantial investment in the part  of General Motors is included in the proposed work in terms of  the paralled applied research effort, performing testing for  validation, time allocation for joint advising, and  collaboration in achieving all the educational objectives.",
