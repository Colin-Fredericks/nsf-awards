However, there are incomplete data for many Precambrian Cratons, and studies of potentially correlative orogenic belts, igneous and sedimentary provinces and structures in these cratons is needed to test reconstructions and to develop models Amazonia in South America is a key craton for late mesoproterozoic time, which may involve possible connections with the Laurentia-Baltica supercontinent, and the subsequent array of continental fragments after breakup.  This work will involve geochronologic, geochemical and field investigations of several areas in cooperation with Brazilian geologists.  Results are expected to facilitate analysis of supercontinent cycles and increase knowledge of the role played by the Amazon craton in the Laurentia-Baltica supercontinent.",
