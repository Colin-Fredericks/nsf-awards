This meeting will be held as a FASEB Conference at Copper Mountain Colorado, July 6-11, 1997.  The meeting is intended to bring together researchers who are employing molecular techniques to investigate diverse biological problems using ciliated protozoa as a model system.  In recent years, an invigorating number of young researchers have chosen to use ciliated protozoa in the labs.  This renewed interest directly reflects the important discoveries that have been with ciliates; eg. self-splicing RNA, telomerase, telomere structure, extensive DNA rearrangements, unusual use of the genetic code and behavioral mutants.  The great value of ciliates for studying difficult biological problems stems from their unusual geomic organization and life cycle.  However, these same unusual features make it extremely important for researchers to attend not only meetings in their own research area (eg. DNA replication, signal transduction, etc.) but also meetings where they can share information about the molecular biology of their experimental system.  The Ciliate Molecular Biology Meeting fills this critical niche.  Approximately 170 foreign and domestic scientists will attend the meeting and many of the conferees will be graduate students or postdocs.  The session chairs and speakers have been chosen based on the quality of their work and many are either female or junior investigators.  ***",
