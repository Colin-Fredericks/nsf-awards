 "awd_abstract_narration": "9660571  Lacefield  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project to be carried out by Academic Software, Inc.(ASI) seeks to provide single switch access to science software.  Utilizing WinSCAN--an innovative programmable single-switch control access interface lot PCs developed by ASI--in conjunction with existing high-quality science software, the project seeks to establish the capability of students with severe multiple disabilities to use this software to perform the same science activities in the classroom as their peers without disabilities.  Custom WinSCAN scanning control displays and detailed lesson plans for learning activities will be developed specifically for three selected science programs and for exploratory Internet access to science study.  These materials will be field-tested by mainstream classroom teachers and children with and without disabilities. Given evidence of the scientific and technical feasibility of the methodology in Phase 1, a fully and independently accessible set of supplemental science curriculum materials, lesson plans, and activities for children in grades K-5 covering a broad range of science topics and pursuits will be developed in the next phase of the project.  These materials will assist children with severe disabilities gain the hands-on experience needed to appreciate and gain confidence and competence in early scientific and technical training.  When fully integrated with curriculum materials, the single-switch access to science software will be of substantial value for early science education experiences for children with disabilities in kindergartens and elementary classrooms throughout the country.  Moreover, the materials will also benefit parents and children in homes which have access to inexpensive PCs and mass information utilities such as America On-Line.  ASI plans to market the modules through its own network of assistive technology dealers and to explore the interest of larger educational publishing houses which supply curriculum  materials and software to schools and school districts on a national basis.",
