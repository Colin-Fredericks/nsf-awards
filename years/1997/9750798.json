 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anatomy 1, the human anatomy course at Chabot College, is currently taught using cat dissection and models.  One human cadaver is used by almost five hundred students.  A student success rate of about 60% over the past five years and loss of specific groups of students within the three course health science sequence is an indication that we are not meeting the special needs of some of out students.  Some steps have been taken to address these issues including implementation of prerequisites for the course and a planned purchase of six computers and software to be shared by physiology and anatomy students.  In addition, the college has agreed to purchase three computers and sets of software for exclusive use by anatomy students.    The proposed project takes the next step.  The objectives of this project are to increase student retention and success in the anatomy course by making instruction as concise and direct as possible and by offering more opportunities for individualized instruction, increasing access to the Internet to promote student-based experimental inquiry, replacing cat dissection with computerized and cadaver dissection, and by enhancing histological studies with computerized micrographs.  The equipment needed to enable us to meet out objectives includes 5 Pentium computers with carts and security packages, 5 sets of CD-ROM software, and a LEICA-EWS software program.",
