 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award to the University of Central Florida supports the research of Professor Cherie  L. Geiger.  Within the field of environmental chemistry, the work focusses on the interactions and  byproducts of agricultural chemicals.  The objective is to understand the mechanism of degradation of  five commonly used agricultural chemicals under conditions found in a central Florida nursery and to  determine the chemical interactions of these five agrochemicals and their breakdown products. Foliage  and soil samples will be analyzed using high performance liquid chromotography and gas chromatography  using both a mass spectrometer and a photo ionization-electrolytic conductivity detector.    Findings from this research underpin further longterm study of the transport and fate of agricultural  chemicals in the environment. Benefits include better protection against catastrophic crop loss for  nurseries in the foliage industry and a more comprehensive understanding of the dangers to human health  and environmental contamination.",
