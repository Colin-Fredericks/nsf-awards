The science plan is focused on two areas: 1) gas-phase studies (including reaction kinetics and product determinations) of the hydroxyl radical reactions with oxygenated organic compounds (e.g., saturated alcohols and ethers); and 2) heterogeneous studies of the kinetics of the hydroxyl radical with four low molecular weight hydrocarbons (methane, n-butane, n-nonane and tert-butyl alcohol) in the presence of  chloride, nitrate, or sulfate particles.  This research will utilize a glass-enclosed photochemical reaction chamber and a combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for measurements of the chemical reactants and products within the chamber.  Complementary ab initio calculations will be performed to identify likely reaction pathways.  These gas-phase and the heterogeneous studies will improve the accuracy of urban air quality models by providing essential information about the photochemistry of oxygen-containing organic compounds and the gas-particle effects on reaction kinetics.    For the educational plan, the investigator will improve teaching methods for atmospheric chemistry by incorporating modeling activities within the classroom setting.  The environmental engineering courses the PI plans to develop are centered on aspects of problem-solving including: understanding a problem, describing its components, proposing a solution(s), and executing the solution. In addition, the PI has outlined a recruitment program to attract and retain underrepresented students in environmental science and engineering.",
