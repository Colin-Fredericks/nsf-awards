 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator (PI) is a mid-career professor of oceanography specializing in comparative endocrinology of fishes. The PI's training in comparative endocrinology and position at the Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island, enable the PI's laboratory to address two societal issues: (1) the urbanization of the coastal environment and the consequent potential impact of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on aquatic organisms, and (2) the collapse of marine fisheries and the unmet demand for seafood products. The PI's laboratory works on integrative organismal endocrinology and on comparative protein biochemistry, focusing now on the problems of vitellogenins in mouthbrooding fish, controlling the timing of metamorphosis in flatfish, and gastrointestinal differentiation in fish. The overall goal of the career advancement award is to acquire working knowledge in the area of molecular endocrinology during a research-oriented sabbatical leave at the University of Massachusetts. The proposed research aims to describe the spatial and temporal appearance of thyroid hormone receptors and retinoic acid receptors in flounder during metamorphosis. The PI will acquire familiarity with the techniques of RT-PCR-based differential display, generating molecular probes for receptors, in situ hybridization and dual-label in situ hybridization, and quantitative image analysis. Characterization of the molecular endocrinology of flounder metamorphosis provides a powerful foundation for examining responses to changes in the physical and chemical environment, including endocrine-disrupting chemicals. This working knowledge would strengthen the PI's service to agencies and journals in evaluating proposals and manuscripts and in outlining research initiatives; it would strengthen the teaching of endocrinology and physiology by permitting firsthand coverage of molecular endocrinology; and it would strengthen the role of the fish endocrinology laboratory in the new Coastal Institute where marine mo lecular oceanography is an organizing theme.",
