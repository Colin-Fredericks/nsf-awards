 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to purchase a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to support, improve and enhance undergraduate education at the University of Dayton.  The SEM will be used by undergraduate students enrolled in seven interdisciplinary, seventeen upper level and six introductory courses in Biology, Chemistry and Geology, and for B.S. thesis research in each department.  The SEM will provide students hands-on experience in obtaining valuable three-dimensional information about the external features of specimens and to thereby increase understanding of microstructure.  A fully automated, user friendly SEM will permit the following changes to be incorporated into the Biology, Chemistry and Geology Department undergraduate curricula:  1) addition of a new, team-taught, interdisciplinary and innovative electron microscopy course with a student research component focusing of technique in microstructure, 2) enhanced hands-on experience for students in upper level laboratories in each department, 3) opportunity for all students in introductory science majors courses to gain first-hand operation of the SEM, 4) use of the SEM in exercises for students in introductory non-science majors laboratories in an effort to instill greater interest in and understanding of science, and 5) ability to use the SEM for undergraduate research in each department.  Students will acquire knowledge in data analysis, instrumental \"know-how,\" and state-of-the-art training needed to enter the job market as competitive, productive scientists.",
