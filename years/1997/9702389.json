 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid advances  in computer  communication technology will  soon  enable a global information   network that will have an  unprecedented  impact on  our daily lives.  Two key  issues will need to be addressed  for this to be successful: integration of  services, and guarantees of  service  quality.  High speed  networks  will carry audio, video,  and  data  traffic from    many diverse  applications;   unlike traditional  networks, they  will need to provide  guarantees of Quality of Service  (QoS)  to  applications, as  required.  However, application-level QoS  requirements  are  best specified    in    terms meaningful    to  the  application,  while network level QoS  requirements are best specified  in terms meaningful to the network.  The problem is to map between the  two.  This problem is further exacerbated by the existence of multiple  intermediate protocol  layers  between the  application layer  and the  network layer,  as well as the  specification of service quality using  different  parameters at the various layers.   Thus a key challenge in  the deployment of high  speed networking systems is  the understanding  and development of accurate QoS transformation algorithms that request  the minimal  network  resources  to  satisfy a   specific  application  requirement.  Without such   an integrated, holistic treatment  of the  QoS  issues, application users  will not see the projected performance  increases and   may  end up  requesting  more  network resources  than  necessary.   This research  project  will address several  fundamental  questions on application  performance  in  high  speed  networks  that  provide  QoS guarantees, and   study the relationship between  network  level QoS  and application level QoS  in general.  Results obtained by  simulation and  theoretical analysis  will be  validated  empirically.  The  education component of  the career development  plan will include  mentoring activities for women and minority graduate and undergraduate  students with the  objective of encouraging them to pursue research and  higher education in the networking and  communications area.  Further,  a new course on QoS issues for applications will be developed with the  first offering  as  a  research  seminar.   A final component  of  the  education plan will be to  develop innovative laboratory exercises  on  wide area networking  technologies to enhance  classroom understanding  of concepts.
