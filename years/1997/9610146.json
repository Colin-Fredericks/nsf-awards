 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Robert H. Crabtree, Department of Chemistry, Yale University, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division for a study of novel types of hydrogen bonding   that occur between a conventional proton donor, an OH or NH group, and an   unconventional acceptor, an M-H or B-H bond (M = Re, Ir). Preliminary   data show that these bonds are short, strong, and bent at the MH or BH   unit. During this project examples of inter- and intramolecular   M-H...H-M' and M-H...M' complexes will be synthesized and the hydrogen   bonding in them analyzed using spectroscopic and kinetic data. Specific   issues that will be addressed  target include the stabilization of HF   complexes, restricting rotation in dihydrogen complexes by inducing   H-bond formation, perturbing the fluxionality rates of polyhydrides, and   increasing the rate of nucleophilic attack at CO. A solvatochromic method   will be evaluated for characterizing outer sphere H-bonding interactions.  Interactions between atoms and molecules are the most important phenomena   that determine the properties of matter. One type of interaction is   called 'hydrogen bonding.' Hydrogen bonding has been known for many years   and is responsible, for example, for many of the properties of ice and   liquid water. Recently, new types of hydrogen bonds that involve   metal-hydrogen units have been discovered. This project aims at   discovering general trends in these new types of hydrogen bonds and at   developing novel hydrogen bonding situations in order to effect useful   chemical transformations.",
