 "awd_abstract_narration": "This wide ranging research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, addresses the fundamentals of ion/surface interactions, with the goal of developing  and implementing surface analytical techniques.  During the tenure of this three-year standard  grant, Professor Winograd and his students at the Pennsylvania State University will carry  out measurements of energy and angle resolved distributions of atoms and molecules  desorbed from ion bombarded surfaces.  Postionization of the desorbed neutral species will  be used to develop molecular surface imaging techniques.  Theoretical modelling of these  processes will be closely coupled with the detailed experimental information obtained in these  investigations.  Applications of these methods to surface structural analysis, compositional  imaging of surfaces, and characterization of electronic materials will be stressed.  The use of ion beam methods to analyze surface structure and composition is the focus of  this research project.  Detailed measurements of the energy and angular distribution of  sputtered ions and neutrals will be coupled with theoretical modelling of these processes in  order to develop the understanding necessary to implement these methods as molecularly  sensitive surface imaging tools.  Applications to a wide range of problems in the areas of  electronic device manufacture, pharmaceutical discovery, and structural biochemistry are  expected as a result of this work.",
