 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706715  Lion  This is a renewal of support for research initiated under NSF  Grant No. 86-17408 and continued under 91-00209 to characterize  the role that transition metals have on hazards to environmental  health because of their toxicity, potential for bioaccumulation  and their persistence in the environment.  Chemical equilibrium  models integrated with mathematical models that resulted from  prior research will be extended in this project to account for  biological interactions with iron oxides that control iron  cycling and subsequent adsorption of environmentally significant  trace metals.  The research includes consideration of biological  processes that affect deposition of iron, the effects that  bacterial and algal cells and their extracellular polymers have  on adsorption of lead by iron oxides, and amelioration of metal  toxicity to microorganisms by the presence of iron.  The research  involves laboratory investigations with controlled chemical  conditions necessary to characterize important biotic and abiotic  components that will be used to guide field studies.    Results of this research are expected to be an improved  understanding from that which now exists of the behavior and fate  of metals that pollute and contaminate natural surface and  groundwaters.  Knowledge gained from this research and the  resultant mathematical models may be applied in engineering  design of processes and treatment systems for removal of metal  contaminants from polluted and contaminated natural surface water  supplies, groundwater, and from domestic and industrial  wastewaters prior to their discharge into the environment.  ***",
