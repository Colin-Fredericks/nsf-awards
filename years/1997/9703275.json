 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes the PI's research and education plans for the next  five years and beyond. One part of the research plan focuses on the the  design and analysis of network control algorithms for detection and  control of focused overloads that are stimulated by media events. The goal  is to design new network control algorithms which can dissipate these  focused overloads either by limiting the rate at which event related  requests are allowed into the network or by dynamically creating resources  to meet the demand. The other part of the research plan focuses on the  design of parallel and distributed server technologies.  The key aim is to  design the software and hardware architectures of the servers such that  they are scalable, fault-tolerant, and robust under network overloads and  instabilities.  The education plan focuses on developing new curriculum,  both at the undergraduate and the graduate levels with emphasis on  experimentation and prototyping. Furthermore, these courses will develop  the key areas of expertise that the industry needs to develop applications  for the next generation high-speed networks. The education plan involves  active participation in a few specific outreach programs both within the  university and the surrounding community. The goal of these outreach  programs is to ensure that the information is available to everybody and  to demonstrate the opportunities in a global information network.
