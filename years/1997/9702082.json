 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project develops an adaptive space-time finite  element methodology that allows for accurate and efficient  prediction of the dynamic response of complex structural acoustic  systems over a broad range of scales and frequencies - including  the mid-frequency range. The methods employ finite element  discretization of the time domain as well as the usual  discretization of the spatial domain. This novel approach to the  modeling of the temporal variables allows for the consistent use  of adaptive solution strategies for unstructured grids in  both  time and space: a technique which significantly improves the  efficiency and reliability of the resulting computational  algorithm over standard methods. By orchestrating the  distribution of mesh sizes and spectral orders in space-time, a  modeling technique is obtained which has significant flexibility  and scope. The educational plan enhances the learning process for  both undergraduate and graduate students through a comprehensive  array of innovative teaching activities and industrial exchanges.  Educational activities include development of a curriculum in  finite element analysis, setting up experimental, computational,  and multimedia laboratories for graduate and undergraduate  teaching, use of symbolic computing systems for innovative  teaching and learning, involving undergraduate students in  collaborative research projects, educational collaborations with  industry, and outreach activities including delivering short  courses and workshops over the Internet via video conferencing  and the World Wide Web.",
