 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates resource-bounded measure and its  implications for central questions in computational complexity.  Weak completeness will be further developed as a tool for proving  intractability.  Such strong hypotheses as \"NP does not have p-  measure 0\" (already known to have numerous plausible  consequences) will be studied with particular attention to their  reasonableness and explanatory power.  New applications of the  resource-bounded probabilistic method will be sought, and  relationships among randomized complexity, circuit-size  complexity, natural proofs, and one-way functions will be  carefully examined.  The underlying theory of resource-bounded  measure will be extended in order to apply it to a wider variety  of problems and probability measures.  This will include a  systematic study of efficient martingales and transformations of  martingales.  Applications of the extended theory to algorithmic  information, computational depth, machine learning and  prediction, real-and complex-valued computation, and the  computation of higher-type functionals will be investigated.",
