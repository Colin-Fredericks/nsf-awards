 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710314  Schmidt    This award funds research by the principle investigator on four broad topics in Number Theory. The first topic is linear recurrence sequences,  and research on this will necessitate refinements of the Subspace Theorem. The second topic concerns  Diophantine approximation both in the classical and in the power series context.  For the third topic, the PI wishes to contribute to questions connected with Artin's conjecture on p-adic forms, in particular bounds replacing the d^2 (which was proved wrong) in the conjecture, and information on the primes p for which the conjecture is actually true.  The fourth topic is a particular project on solution trees of congruences in one variable.      This research falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory.  Number Theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and  communication systems.",
