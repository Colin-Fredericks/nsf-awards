 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is supporting   Professor William Hase of Wayne State University for the next three   years.  In this research project classical molecular dynamics simulations   will be used to study the microscopic atomistic motion of individual   molecules and of chemical reactive systems, with the goals of comparing   with experiment and determining fundamental information about   intramolecular dynamics, energy transfer, and chemical reaction dynamics   and kinetics.  Since statistical theories are widely used to interpret   experiment, statistical calculations will be performed to compare with   the molecular dynamics simulations.  The specific problems chosen for   study are: (1) the kinetics of CH3 and H atom association with diamond   surfaces; (2) energy transfer dynamics in collision-induced dissociation   (CID) and surface-induced dissociation (SID); (3) the dynamics of   gas-phase nucleophilic substitution; and (4) direct ab initio and   semiempirical dynamics.   Classical molecular dynamics is expected to   give accurate results for these research problems and, given their   complexity, quantum dynamical calculations would be difficult.  In direct   dynamics, trajectories are integrated  `on the fly` by interfacing   electronic structure theory directly with the molecular dynamics   simulations.  This is a frontier approach for performing simulations,   which is directly linked to the computational power of modern computers.    Direct semiempirical dynamics may be used to study large systems for long   times (e.g. CID and SID), while ab initio direct dynamics may be applied   to small systems for short times.  An example of the latter is the   exit-channel and energy partitioning dynamics of trajectories as they   move from a potential energy barrier to products.   State-of-the art   vector and parallel processing  computer architecture will be used to   enhance the direct dynamics simulations.   In this research project molecular modeling and simulation is used to   study the motion of individual molecules and of molecular collisions   leading to chemical reaction and energy transfer.  Molecular simulation   methodologies have become sufficiently sophisticated that they are often   predictive, giving near-quantitative results.  The research to be   performed during the upcoming three year period includes applications  of   well-developed simulation methods to interpret new experimental results   and test theoretical models,  as well as the development of more direct   simulation approaches for studying large molecular systems.  The specific   simulations to be performed are of: (1) reactions leading to diamond film   growth; (2) mass-spectroscopy experiments of cluster fragmentation and   fragmentation of ions when they collide with the surfaces.  The latter   has been proposed as a procedure for sequencing peptides; (3) reactions   between ions and molecules; and (4) the fragmentation of highly energized   molecules.",
