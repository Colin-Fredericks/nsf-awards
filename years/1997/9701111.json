 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701111  Werner  Predation and competition are thought to be important factors that help determine the structure and composition of ecological communities. Past studies of the interaction of these two factors have found that taxa either compete well or resist predation well, but not both. These observations suggest that there is a tradeoff between the ability to compete and the ability to resist predation. Differences in predation risk and competitive ability are associated with differences in predator-induced and competitor-induced morphology of larval anurans including differences in tail fin depth and mouth size. Populations within one species of larval anuran differ in morphology and one can take advantage of these population differences in morphology to determine if populations are trading off competitive ability and predator resistance. This tradeoff can be further tested by generating more exaggerated differences in the morphological traits by making use of different magnitudes of morphological plasticity among the populations. Based on an understanding of competitive abilities and predator resistance among populations within a species, the relationship among anuran species within the same genus can be predicted and tested. The proposed work has important implications to evolution of local populations, species interactions within a community, and productivity-diversity relationships across communities.",
