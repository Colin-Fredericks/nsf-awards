This  technique utilizes Bragg and diffuse scattering over a very wide range  of  momentum transfer (Q) and yields the atomic short-range order  directly.  It goes beyond the approximation of perfect crystallinity  and allows the local structure to be solved on length-scales from 1-20  angstroms. This type of structural analysis will be applied to a  variety of transition metal oxides such as high-Tc materials, layered  manganites and nickelates and the colossal magnetoresistant  manganites.  In these materials, the structure can respond to the  electronic state and we will look for correlations between changes in  electrical properties and local structural effects.  In this way, the  nature of localized electronic states, such as polaronic, bipolaronic  and charge-phase-separated states, will be elucidated.  %%%  The great materials scientist F.C. Franck is reported to have said  \"crystals are like people -- it is the defects which make them  interesting\".  Indeed, many of the most interesting, and useful, new  materials exhibit a  high degree of atomic disorder; and it is often  the defects which give  them their interesting properties.  This  presents special challenges for solid state physicists and materials  scientists because of the difficulty of studying atomic level defects  in materials.  We will be using the  technique of atomic pair-  distribution function (PDF) analysis of neutron and x-ray diffraction  to characterize transition metal oxides; an important group of  materials which fall into the above category.  We will use novel data  analysis and modeling techniques, developed both by us and by others,  to extract quantitative  structural information from the data and  correlate these observations with the measured electrical properties.  A number of these material s show great technological promise, such as  the high-Tc superconductors and colossal magnetoresistant manganite  materials which may have an application in computer read/write heads  for  example.  We are attempting to understand the role that atomic  defects play in their interesting electrical properties.  ***",
