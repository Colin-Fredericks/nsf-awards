 "awd_abstract_narration": "9630167  Odom  The major strategies to yield permanent improvements in the quality  of science and technology research that will increase the  competitiveness of the State's major research universities for  federal and private sector R&D funds are: 1) the addition of new  tenure track faculty in targeted research areas, 2) graduate  student support, and 3) programs to increase linkages between  academic researchers and their industrial colleagues.  Three multi-  disciplinary research areas have been selected for enhancement  based on their scientific merit and potential for high payoff and  success.  They are:  Mechanics and Materials Research to Evaluate  and Improve the Strength of Structural Joints in Transportation  Systems; Fundamental Studies at Polymer/Material Interfaces: A  Junior Faculty Development Proposal in Optical Sensing; and An  Interdisciplinary Program in Signal Transduction.  Partnerships  with two other NSF-funded initiatives in South Carolina-the  Statewide Systemic Initiative (SSI) and Alliance for Minority  Participation (AMP) programs will also be established to increase  the number of minority students being encouraged to pursue careers  in science, engineering and mathematics fields.",
