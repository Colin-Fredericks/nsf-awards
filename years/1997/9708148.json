Most of the data reported in the  current literature have been generated by the technique of  Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS).  These data  suggest that:  (1) corrosion initiates well before it can be  detected optically; (2) delamination results from either a  loss of adhesion or corrosion at the polymer-metal  interface; and (3) delamination and corrosion rate can only  be estimated by EIS.  In order to achieve a better  understanding of underfilm degradation, it is imperative  that the correlation between electrochemistry, loss of  metal, and delamination rate is fully understood.  While a  correlation between electrochemistry and corrosion rate is  well established for non-coated samples, no accurate  measurement of mass loss beneath a polymer coating has been  achieved.  This FRG (Focussed Research Group) project  circumvents the problems associated with determining the  change in mass of a coated substrate by following the change  in the magnetic saturation of a polymer-coated ferromagnetic  sample.  Mass loss is assessed with a vibrating sample  magnetometer (VSM), which provides an unambiguous method for  determining the corrosion rate of a coated sample.  In  addition, the sample is monitored visually and with EIS.  When correlated to visual and electrochemical data, these  results should provide significant insight into the  evaluation of underfilm corrosion and assessment of coating  performance.  The current research should also be able to  distinguish between delamination resulting from loss of  adhesion or from corrosion.  During an experiment, if no  metal loss is recorded on the VSM but delamination is  visually and electrochemically detected, it can not be  associated with corrosion.  In this FRG project emphasis is  also placed on the development  of an in-situ/real-time  electrochemical technique (Fast Transient Technique, FTT) to  monitor solute uptake and the initial stage of coating  degradation. The grant is co-funded by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Materials  Research.  %%%  This project is expected to lead to an improved  understanding of both the reliability of protective organic  coatings and the use of electrochemical techniques (EIS and  FTT), thereby providing a basis for the selection of the  most suitable commercially available protective coatings.  ***",
