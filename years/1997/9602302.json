 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will be used to renovate laboratory facilities at the University of North Dakota, for high performance computing, material science, and environmental systems research related to transport and adsorption in heterogeneous materials.  Space dedicated to the Multiscale Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Research (MISER) group, consisting of members from the Chemical Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Geology and Geological Engineering Departments, and the Energy and Environmental Research Center will be renovated.  Current projects focus on environmental research related to groundwater monitoring, modeling and remediation, and the removal of toxic metals from flue gas by adsorption.  Other faculty use high performance computing to complement this work by developing algorithms that partition local and global interactions using novel procedures to obtain  optimal performance from vector and parallel architectures.    Located in Harrington Hall, the research laboratory as it currently exists, is inadequate to support the operation of high precision, scientific research equipment.  There is poor ventilation, and inoperable fume hoods that do not meet current safety standards. Once renovated, the lab will have a new drop ceiling, computer cabling, chemical resistant floor, storage cabinets, and laboratory benches.  Modernizing the research space will rectify deficiencies and make the laboratory ADA compliant. Establishing a central laboratory will result in significant cross disciplinary interactions between student researchers. This project will enhance the ability of MISER to attract additional extramural funding, increase the number of students, particularly  Native American students, involved in research, and  improve the quality of research and training available for all students.",
