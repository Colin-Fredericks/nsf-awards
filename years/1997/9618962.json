This collaborative effort also involves the New York State Education Department, Hofstra University, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and 20 school districts in New York.    The goal of this project is to develop models for the infusion of technology education into the elementary schools. To accomplish this goal, activities focus upon the integration of experiences in technology with contemporary approaches in mathematics and science in the elementary schools. Participants utilize exemplary curriculum materials and activities in technology education to enrich the elementary school experiences in mathematics and science.  The project is organized to enhance teachers' pedagogical abilities; strengthen their content knowledge in mathematics, science, and technology; and provide leadership expertise among the 20 three-person teams, each representing one of the collaborating school districts. Each team is comprised of a content specialist in mathematics, science, or technology and two experienced teachers, one from grades K-3 and the other from grades 4-6. These teams will participate in two years of sustained enhancement activities at The University at Stony Brook, Hofstra University, and Brookhaven National Laboratory. The MSTE Project will prepare teachers in the use of exemplary curriculum materials to provide instruction that highlights the rich relationships among the disciplines.    During the third and fourth years of the project, each of the 20 MSTE teams will conduct regional summer enhancement workshops and academic year meetings for 30 elementary school teachers from their local geographic areas. An Implementation and Resource Guide is being developed for use by leadership teams in their summer workshops for te achers in their local regions.    The MSTE Project will devote its fifth year to a statewide leadership development effort, preparing teams of teachers and content specialists from across the State of New York to serve as leaders in subsequent teacher enhancement efforts.",
