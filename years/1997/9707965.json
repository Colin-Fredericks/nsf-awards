 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT   Wodzicki     In this project Wodzicki shall study K-theory  and  cyclic  homology  of operator  ideals, and also the Hochschild homology of the algebra of bounded operators  on a Hilbert space with coefficients in  an ideal. In particular, he will study: determinants, regulators, higher analytic and topological index invariants, the commutator  structure  of  bounded linear operators  on a Hilbert space, and a connection with the K-theory of algebraic varieties.   This combination of topics naturally results  from  the  previous work  of the principal investigator.  The approach joins together several areas of mathematics with a special focus on  homological study  of  (noncommutative)  algebras  of  analytic and geometric  significance and on the development of suitable  homological  and homotopical tools.         The project touches upon  the  fundamental  directions  in  which modern  mathematics  is  developing  and  addresses  questions of fundamental importance and interest in mathematics.  As such,  it is a \"pure research\".  However, it may have a considerable impact in the future in such areas  as,  e.g.  High-Energy  and  Nuclear Physics.  The  current  project  is  a  natural  continuation and development of the principal investigator's  research  program  of last  15  years.   His  earlier  results obtained in this program  already find application in the recent work of several physicists (especially  those associated with CERN -- European Laboratory of Particle Physics in Geneve).",
