 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Strobel's research focuses on establishing a new methodology to   determine structure-activity relationships in structurally and   catalytically important RNA molecules.  Target molecules include a series   of nucleotide analogues with oxidatively labile 5'-O-(1-thio)triphosphate   substituents.  Individual analogues will be incorporated into RNA by in   vitro transcription to create a library of mutant RNA's, where individual   nucleotides have been randomly replaced by an analogue.   Individual RNA   mutants that exhibit activity in a particular biological system are   distinguished from those that do not.  Subsequent oxidative cleavage at   the thiophosphate group under mild conditions with iodine, and   comparative analysis of the active and nonactive analogues on sequencing   gels offers a straightforward means to identify the active chemical   group.   This methodology, called Nucleotide Analogue Interference   Mapping (NAIM), will be used to identify the chemical groups in RNA   relating to: (1) the interaction of 5S rRNA with ribosomal protein L25;   (2) the role of U6 snRNA in pre-mRNA splicing; (3) the autocatalytic VS   ribozyme from Neurospora; and (4) the interaction of alpha operon mRNA   with S4 protein.    Educational activities include developing a   bioorganic course emphasizing synthetic organic design and macromolecular   function, and involving both local undergraduates and minority students   in the research program.    With this CAREER award, the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   research and educational activities of Professor Scott Strobel of the   Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale University.     Professor Strobel's research is focused on developing a methodology,   called Nucleotide Analogue Interference Mapping, that will significantly   accelerate the process of identifying structure-activity relationships in   structurally and catalytically important RNA molecules.  Professor   Strobel's educational activities include developing a multidepartmental   course which will explore the use of organic chemical synthesis to   investigate and understand biological systems, and promoting an interest   in chemical research by involving both local and minority undergraduates   in the research program.",
