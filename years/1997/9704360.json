 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704360  Forman       Robin Forman is investigating the relationship between differential  topology and geometry, on the one hand, and combinatorial topology and  geometry, on the other.  He has already shown that many of the standard  ingredients of differential topology and geometry, such as Morse  theory, vector fields and their associated flows, and Ricci curvature  and Bochner's method, have combinatorial analogs that can be applied  to very general cell complexes.  This has led to new results in  combinatorial topology as well as to simplifications of some existing  proofs.  One current goal is to develop a combinatorial theory of  vector bundles and connections that is suitable for studying both the  classical question of combinatorial formulae for characteristic  classes, as well as the new invariants of knots and 3- and 4-manifolds  defined via the theory of smooth vector bundles and connections.       Combinatorics is the study of finite sets.  As a consequence, many  problems in combinatorics lend themselves quite naturally to  investigation via a computer.  A typical problem in differential  topology and geometry, on the other hand, seems to require an infinite  amount of data.  Forman's research is devoted to developing new  methods of reducing such problems to combinatorics.  In other words,  he is developing new techniques to solve problems in topology and  geometry that require keeping track of only a finite amount of data.  In particular, these techniques enable one to investigate these  problems via a computer.  Moreover, his work has also proved useful in  the opposite direction.  Namely, he has shown that many of the  standard techniques in differential topology and geometry can be  adapted to apply to problems in combinatorics, an approach that has  already proved useful in solving some of them.  ***",
