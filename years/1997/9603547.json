The Y-organs, in turn, are regulated by a protein hormone (MIH) from the animals' brain.  This system is comparable to human glands (testes, ovaries, adrenals) that secrete steroid hormones (testosterone, estrogen, cortisone) and that are controlled by protein hormones from the brain and pituitary gland.  The PI has found that crustaceans, like humans, make steroid hormones from cholesterol and that the cholesterol in blood is bound up in lipoprotein (HDL).  Accordingly, crustacean glands are being used as a simplified model to study how cholesterol enters cells, how those cells converted it to hormones, and how the process is controlled by the brain hormone.  The project focuses on how inflation is transferred from the cell surface, which contains receptors that \"recognize\" MIH and HDL, to the interior, ultimately to genes that code for enzymes responsible for hormone synthesis.  In particular, the hypothesis will be tested that informational signals are specialized lipids which cause (a) the activation of membrane enzymes, and (b) the release of intracellular calcium, both in turn responsible for activation of key enzymes in the path toward hormone synthesis.  A subset of questions centers on the probability that increased hormone synthesis can be triggered by rises of calcium in the circulation as well as by calcium already resident in the cell.  Methods include use of radioactive calcium as tracer and fluorescence indicators that detect release of intracellular calcium.  The research results will help to solve related mysteries in vertebrate glands.  Generally, this research contributes to knowledge of the biology of crustaceans and their insect relatives, economically important animal groups, and embraces the fields of neurobiology, endocrinology and development in addressing basic questions on neuroendocrine coordination and  control of steroid hormone secretion.  ***",
