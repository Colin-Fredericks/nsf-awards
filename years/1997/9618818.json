Two objectives are to enhance the  quality of existing environmental education courses and to infuse  concepts developed through the study of environmental science in  key areas of the existing science curriculum.  The project includes  a four-year series of summer residential Core Institutes, four for  high school and four for middle school science teachers.  Follow-up  and networking activities continues for the life of the project and  beyond.  A total of 400 science-teacher leaders are to be involved  in the summer Core Institutes.  A second tier of development is in  the format of 48 two-week Outreach TORCH Institutes, led by teams  of Core Institute teachers, working in collaboration with  colleagues from higher education at college and university sites.   These institutes are to engage an additional 1,440 classroom  teachers in summer programs and academic year assignments involving  a minimum of 100 contact hours of supervised work.  All activities  involve laboratory and field work, a range of student learning and  assessment techniques and emphasis on the use of computers and  technology for professional use, classroom use, and instructional  purposes.",
