 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706575  Holzwarth    This grant will support research on computational techniques  and their application to various materials systems.  The  computational tools are based on first principles techniques  integrating algorithms established in the literature with  various innovations.  They are based on the Car-Parinello  technique.  The density functional portion of the algorithm  uses a modified version of the projector augmented-wave  method, introduced by Blochl, which incorporates the  numerical efficiency of the pseudopotential approach while  retaining the important physical effects of an all-electron  calculation.  The completed code will be shared with other  researchers.    The simulations will include: a study of structural  relaxation in the (001) surface of cubic SiC; a study of two  interacting surfaces with a view toward an idealized model  of tunneling and force microscopes; a study of static and  dynamic point defects in calcium fluoride and related  materials which affect their use as radiation detectors and  optical windows; and, a longer term project to study the  interaction of water with metal surfaces.  %%%  The award will support research on both computer code  development and its application to various problems in  materials physics.  The code development will benefit all  researchers by being made readily available.  The  computational research will focus on problems having to do  with electronic and structural properties of defects in  solids and on the properties of surfaces.  ***",
