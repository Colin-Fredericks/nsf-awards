 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biewener  9701121           The effects of developmental duration on the ontogeny of  musculo-skeletal morphology and bone material properties in frogs  will be evaluated, expanding knowledge of these features to a broader  range of vertebrate species. Variation in developmental duration is  hypothesized to affect the morphology and material properties of the  hind limb bones and muscles and, consequently, the locomotor  performance of newlymetamorphosed frogs. The effects of variations in  developmental duration on the musculoskeletal system will be compared  in field collected frogs and experimental frogs raised at two  temperatures. Analysis of high speed videos of jumps from  field-collected and laboratory-raised frogs will be used to correlate  performance with musculo-skeletal morphology and bone material  properties. Musculo-skeletal characteristics will be examined through  a combination of histological sectioning, radiographs, four-point  bending, and asking. Ontogenetic and phylogenetic scaling of all  parameters will be used to understand the influence of age and size.         This study will assess potential trade-offs in the evolution of  developmental durations in frogs. Though rapid, larval development is  often ecologically advantageous, this study will evaluated its cost  to locomotor performance in terms of the morphological and  physiological capabilities of the musculo-skeletal system.",
