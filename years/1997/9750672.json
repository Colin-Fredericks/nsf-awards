 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is integrating mechatronics experiments in mechanical engineering (ME) laboratories and courses. The essence of mechatronics is the application of complex decisionmaking to the operation of physical systems. Although mechatronics provides many exciting challenges, it is extremely difficult to establish as a major or as an option in undergraduate education. This project is developing an integrated approach for the dissemination of mechatronics principles across the existing undergraduate curriculum using experiments. The operation of machines, processes, and systems is being covered with a focused perspective in specific courses such as freshman design, programming, computer-aided design (CAD), fluid mechanics, heat transfer, measurements, material science, and manufacturing. The existing ME laboratories are being enhanced with new equipment, including a thermal system, fluid control systems, robots, DC motors, stepper motors, model building kits, and toy trains. All these physical systems are being controlled by computers through suitable electronic interface, and are being tested by using general instruments such as an oscilloscope, function generator, amplifier, power supply, and multimeter. Using this equipment, several mechatronics experiments are being implemented for fluid, heat transfer, measurements, CAD, freshman design, control, and mechatronics laboratories. This project is generating the necessary thrust to modernize ME courses.  *",
