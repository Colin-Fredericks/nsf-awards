 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Career Advancement Award is supported by the Analytical and  Surface Chemistry Program.  Professor Ganske will spend a  sabbatical year at the University of California at Irvine working  with Professors Hemminger and Finlayson-Pitts studying the  heterogeneous oxidation chemistry of sulfur dioxide that occurs on  salt surfaces.  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and quadrupole  mass spectrometry will be used to analyze the products of these  oxidation reactions.  This work will expand on the experience  gained by Professor Ganske using diffuse reflectance infrared  Fourier transform spectroscopy to study these important reactions  in her own laboratory.  Following her sabbatical leave a new  quadrupole mass spectrometer is planned for new space in a science  annex at Pepperdine University.  This sabbatical will substantively  enhance the future research experiences of Professor Ganske and her  undergraduate students at Pepperdine University in the areas of  heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry.  The reactions of gaseous sulfur dioxide on inorganic surfaces is  important in many areas of air pollution caused by the burning of  fossil fuels.  In this work the oxidation of sulfur dioxide on  inorganic surfaces will be characterized using several techniques  new to Professor Ganske of Pepperdine University.  This experience  will be gained during a sabbatical leave at the University of  California at Irvine working with Professors Hemminger and  Finlayson-Pitts.  The aim of this project will be to develop  processes that efficiently remove sulfur dioxide from gaseous  samples in an economical way and to introduce undergraduate  students to this important research area.",
