 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coughenour  97-11627    Current projections of the effects of global climate change on terrestrial ecosystems are generated through simulations of climate-vegetation interactions at regional to global scales. However current models generally predict new equilibrium conditions and do not emulate process-driven transient conditions which could last for a long time, or even indefinitely if climate variability increases substantially. The models do not resolve vegetation responses to landscape structure, nor do they represent vegetation responses to herbivory by wild or domestic animals, or other human land uses. A major objective of this project is to evamate how much one can improve estimates or climate change effects on vegetation, ecosystems and people, by using process-oriented ecosystem-level simulauons. Current climate patterns will be used to drive three different types or models (quasi-equilibrium, SAVANNA-climate, SAVANNA-biotic), all parameterized to simulate extant vegetation conditions in the Serengeti Regional Ecosystem; a savanna system where soil, landscape features, human land use, fire and herbivore impacts all interact with climate to influence vegetation patterns and ecosystem state. Differences among models in predictions of responses to global change will be evaluated in terms of: (a) the accuracy of the models at predicting extant and as potential vegetation under current and doubled CO2 climate conditions; (b) the effects of considering herbivory, land-use  compared to climate alone; (c) the effects of spatial scale on the predicted responses  Supporting field and remote sensing studies will result in a better understanding of current vegetation in relationship to climate, soils, herbivory, and land use. The research will be relevant to natural resources policy in the East African region. The integrated modeling approach will have utility for government land management and planning, for famine early warning, for park and game reserve managers, and for pastoral peoples. The re search will contribute to the development of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVM's).",
