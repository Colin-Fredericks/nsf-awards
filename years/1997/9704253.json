The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Martha J. Desmond to work with  Professor Alberto Lafon Terrazas at the Universidad Autonoma  de Chihuahua in Chihuahua, Mexico.  The U.S.-Mexico Program  will provide 50% of the funding for this project.    Desmond proposes to examine populations and community  assemblages of grassland birds on wintering ground in  Northern Mexico.  She will look at data on life-history  characteristics which are unknown for many grassland birds  in winter habitats.  This is essential to understand how  these migrants are adapted to use habitats.  She will test  hypotheses related to differential migration due to  morphological size variation between sexes and inter-sexual  and age class competition for resources.  Many of these  species are showing significant population declines.  This  research will specifically examine the influence grazing by  domestic and native herbivores on habitat use by grassland-  adapted birds and test hypotheses related to habitat use and  community structure.  Information on the basic life history  characteristics on winter grounds is essential for  understanding community dynamics and evaluating potential  threats to these populations.    ***",
