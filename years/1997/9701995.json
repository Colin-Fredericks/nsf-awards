 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701995  Anastasio      The project will be conducted as part of  the NSF CAREER Program.  For his scientific research component, the investigator will study in situ photochemical mechanisms involving oxidation of halide compounds found as tropospheric aerosol particles.  Photochemical oxidant formation is known to occur in continental tropospheric aerosols, fog and cloud drops, and in marine waters.  However, the reaction mechanisms of halide oxidation are not well characterized.  These reactions are potentially important for the geochemical cycles of chlorine and bromine compounds present in the marine boundary layer.  Growing evidence has shown that these cycles include the oxidation of chloride and bromide in deliquescent aerosol species (such as HOX and X2, where X = Cl or Br).   These photoactive compounds can partition into the gas phase and photolyze to form Cl* and Br* radicals and as a result, can have important impacts on climate  (e.g. through the oxidation dimethyl sulfide) and on the concentrations of tropospheric ozone (e.g. through catalytic destruction).   On the educational plan, the investigator will develop graduate and undergraduate courses in atmospheric chemistry. The research project itself will involve undergraduate and graduate students and will be an early research opportunity and training experience.  Also, the investigator will broaden instructional and research activities relating to atmospheric chemistry topics to include other departments within the university.",
