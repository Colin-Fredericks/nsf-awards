 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Wenzl    A general procedure has recently been  found to supply fusion categories constructed from quantum groups with a C* structure. It is planned to continue this study in order to make some of the proofs more self-contained, and to include some additional cases not covered so far in the non-simply laced case. More importantly, it is expected that the understanding   of the C* structure in the quantum group context would also be useful to get a conceptual understanding of the asymptotic inclusions derived from these categories. Besides its relevance for classification of subfactors, it would potentially also be useful for getting  a better understanding of the algebra behind the Reshetikhin-Turaev-Witten type invariants of 3-manifolds connected with such categories. In related research, Wenzl's graduate student Orellana is studying Markov traces of Hecke algebras of type B.   For Hecke algebras of type A, such a study led to the construction of subfactors closely related to quantum groups of type A.  For type B, the situation is quite different. But preliminary results nevertheless suggest that one can also obtain subfactors from Hecke   algebras of type B.    The original motivation for Wenzl's research was the construction of examples of subfactors of a certain algebra, the so-called hyperfinite von Neumann factor of type II_1. By now, a lot of examples of subfactors are known, and a complete explicit classification seems to be out of reach. Wenzl's research  focuses on certain classes of examples with connections to other areas of mathematics and physics. The examples he constructed  are closely connected to the representation theory of quantum groups and Kac-Moody algebras, which in turn figure prominently in models in theoretical physics referred to as conformal field theory. The subfactors which would arise from his graduate student's work would be connected to Hecke algebras of type B and knot theory in a torus. Such   examples have the advantage that one can use addition al information for their study. In the other direction, we expect that operator algebra techniques can provide new insights to the related areas, such as it has already happened in e.g. knot theory, study of 3-manifolds or representation theory. This could be understood as part of von Neumann's program of using operator algebras as  a tool for representation theory and quantum physics.",
