 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Seton Hall University to renovate chemistry facilities for two research groups in the Department of Chemistry.  The investigative teams conduct a broad spectrum of chemical research from fundamental organic and inorganic chemistry to applied research in biochemistry and materials sciences in McNulty Hall, the site of the renovation project.  Built in the early 1950's, laboratories originally designed as undergraduate teaching laboratories, as well as the other spaces in McNulty have never been renovated.  Funds will be used to create to modern research facilities by  installing of new fume hoods and laboratory benches, upgrading plumbing and electrical systems, and configuring labs to comply with ADA regulations. Research personnel benefiting from the renovations include two professors, 10 graduate students, five undergraduates and one visiting professor.  The results of the renovations will be improved safety and working conditions of the research groups, allowing them to be more productive and to enhance all aspects of their research effort. Renovated facilities will provide better preparation and training for both undergraduate and graduate students at Seton Hall.",
