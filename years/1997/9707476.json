 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707476  Larsen    The proposed research would develop a technique for  continuously adjusting the interaction between charged  colloidal spheres.  The application of a rotating electric  field will induce a dipole moment in the dielectric spheres,  resulting in a net attractive interaction.  This attractive  interaction would be continuously tunable by varying the  voltage used to create the electric field. The quantitative  functional form of the induced interaction will be measured  using blinking optical tweezers.  This tunable interaction  will then provide unique opportunities for studying phase  transitions in the model system of colloidal spheres.  Notably, the technique could be used to help discern the  fundamental nature of two dimensional phase transitions.  Some experiments have indicated a continuous transition;  others demonstrate an abrupt transition reminiscent of three  dimensional transitions.  Recent studies (Marcus and Rice,  PRE 55 p.637, 1997) have suggested that the range and nature  of the interaction potential would allow for direct tests of  the influence of the interaction on the type of phase  transition which occurs.  %%%  The proposed research would develop a method for  continuously adjusting the interaction between tiny charged  spheres.  This interaction can be continually tuned by  exploiting the electrical properties of the spheres, namely  through the application of an electric field.  Such spheres  are a popular model system for studying melting and freezing  transitions such as ice melting to water.  The freezing  transition occurs abruptly at a specific temperature for  bulk samples of water for example, however, the nature of  the transition for a very thin film has not yet been  resolved.  Some experiments indicate that the transition for  the thin film is abrupt as in the bulk sample; others have  demonstrated that the transition is gradual, like jello  solidifying-it continually gets stiffer and stiffer.  Recent  studies have suggested that the thin fi lm transition depends  very sensitively on the form of the interaction between the  spheres.  By developing a technique to continuously tune the  interaction between the spheres, the influence of this  interaction on the thin film transition could be directly  tested.  ***",
