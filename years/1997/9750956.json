 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to achieve success, newly trained biologists and health care professionals need broad-based skills in addition to a solid understanding of biology.  These skills include independent and creative thinking, excellent written and oral communication, computer proficiency and problem solving ability.  The goal of this project to design a cell biology course which will incorporate the development of these skills.  Students will first be introduced to current concepts and experimental approaches in cell biology and then be allowed to explore on their own.  This will best be accomplished if students culture and perform investigations on mammalian cells.  Students will culture mammalian cells and study various cell organelles and cell processes.  While learning in these areas, students will also acquire laboratory skills in microscopy, spectroscopy, biochemical assays and electrophoresis.  They will use this knowledge and their toolbox of skills to perform a several week project of their own design.  Equipment to fully support such a teaching approach, such as an inverted fluorescence microscope, a computer-linked UV/VIS spectrophotometer, a dedicated CO2 incubator, a laminar flow hood and a high resolution video system are either unavailable or inadequate.  During the project students will be expected to search the primary literature for background information, design experiments, analyze data and present results to classmates via oral or poster presentations.  The course will prepare students for senior research projects, the capstone course in molecular biology, graduate school, professional school and careers as laboratory technicians.  The course design and outcomes will be put on internet newsgroups, presented at meetings and/or published in science teaching journals.  *",
