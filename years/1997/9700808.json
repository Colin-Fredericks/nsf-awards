The  research involves properties of systems with competing  length scales.  One of the important aspects of these  systems is the existence of an exotic phase with fractal  characteristics. The conceptual linkage through much of this  work is the relationship between localization (and many  phenomena related to localization) and the universal Fractal  fluctuations. The proposed systems under investigation  include quantum chaos models exhibiting dynamical  localization and classical driven oscillators with strange  non-chaotic attractors. These systems will be studied by  using a renormalization methodology developed recently by  the PI and her collaborators. The possible applications  include a microscopic model of friction and magnetic  properties of superlattices exhibiting giant  magnetoresistance.  %%%  This grant supports theoretical research of  a female PI.  The research on nonlinear dynamical systems involves  sophisticated mathematical techniques with active  participation by  undergraduate and graduate students.  It  is part of an internationally recognized program with long-  standing collaborations with colleagues from around the  world.  Her work has applications to several currently  active areas in materials; including microscopic models of  friction and properties of magnetic superlattices.  ***",
