 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706076    Stolz    Dr. G. Stolz of the University of Alabama at Birmingham will conduct a  research project on the appearance of \"localization\" in various classes   of random operators which arise in mathematical physics. Localization,  i.e. the existence of energy regions with dense pure point spectrum and  exponentially decaying eigenfunctions, has been found to be common to   most one dimensional models of disordered media. Dr. Stolz' research will  aim at a better understanding of mathematical models of multidimensional  disordered media. Specific goals include   (i) the extension of existing results on localization to models which  give a more realistic description of disordered media, such as alloys and  amorphous materials, than the models studied previously;   (ii) an intensified investigation of three-dimensional models based on  random point-interactions, which have potential of providing new insights  in high energy spectral characteristics and can also be used to study  physical properties of random surfaces and random polymers.    Disordered media are studied extensively in various physical disciplines  such as solid state physics, optics, and electrodynamics, as well as in  materials science. They comprise various types of materials, for example  alloys, crystals with impurities (e.g. semiconductors), and amorphous   solids. Random operators provide mathematical models of disordered media.  These operators can be studied by using methods from mathematical spectral  and scattering theory. They allow to describe and thus predict   conductivity properties and the characteristics of wave propagation in  disordered media. For example, the mathematical phenomenon of localization,  as studied by Dr. Stolz, characterizes insulators (electrical insulators,  respectively sound insulators, depending on the underlying physical model).  While a number of important results have been obtained for these models,  it will be the goal of future research to study more realistic models  and to get a b etter theoretical understanding of the underlying   phenomena from physics.",
