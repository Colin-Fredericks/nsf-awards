 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619584  This project is a renewal of NSF Grant CCR-9303383 with the  same title. Motivated by the tremendous variety of deductive  systems of interest in computer science and logic, general  meta-languages for their specification, often referred to as  logical frameworks, have been investigated by the researcher  and others. Work on the previous grant includes the design  of the logical framework LF and the logic programming  language Elf based on LF. Extensive case studies have  confirmed the wide range of applicability of the methodology  underlying LF and Elf and also pointed towards certain  limitations, which this project will address. The work  includes a language for modular presentation of deductive  systems and meta-programs, and refinements of the framework  to permit subtyping, linearity, and internal equational  reasoning. The project will implement these language  refinements, building on current prototypes and the core and  module language implementations for LF and Elf. It will also  continue to explore the use of LF and Elf and their  refinements as vehicles for representing proofs of meta  theorems about deductive systems; that is, their use as a  meta-logical framework. A number of case studies under the  previous grant indicate the feasibility of such  representations, but more theoretical and implementation  work remains to be done. In longer term plans, the project  will increase the degree of automation of carrying out such  proofs, taking advantage of the high level of abstraction of  the representations and the expressive type system of LF.  ***",
