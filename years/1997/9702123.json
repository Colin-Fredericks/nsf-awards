The primary goal of this research is to develop an  understanding of the effect that chirality has on the conformational order  of three-dimensional dendritic microstructures. The ultimate goal of this  research is the development of new materials for asymmetric catalysis and  chiral separations technologies.    The  initial  phases  of  this research are  a  systematic  study  of  the  structure/property relationships of a large family of  dendrimers  of  the  same  basic  structure  in an effort to elucidate  the  factors  governing  conformational  asymmetry and chiral microenvironments in  this  class  of  synthetic  macromolecules. The dendrimer systems proposed  for  study  are  based  on enantiomerically pure 1,2-diol linkages and benzyl aryl or alkyl  aryl  ethers.  These  materials  with  asymmetrlc  interior  cavities  and  functional  groups  capable of attractive interactions (hydrogen  bonding)  should  be  able  to selectively clathrate guests of a certain  shape  and  functional  group arrangement. Hence, host-guest interactions between  the  dendrimers and small molecules will be studied. These materials will  then  be   tested   for   chiral  discrimination  in  high  performance   liquid  chromatography (HPLC) and micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography  (MECC).  Selective encapsulation and guest binding will also be the  basis  for  the  development  of  these  materials  as  multi-site  reactors  for  asymmetric  catalysis. Reaction rate acceleration will result from  either  (a)  hydrophobic  binding of reactants in the dendrimer  interior  or  (b)  reaction  at  transition metal catalytic centers anchored on the  1,2-diol  linkages  of  the  dendrimer. Teaching: Fewer women  than  men  embark  on  c areers  in  the physical sciences. A woman's decision not  to  enter  the  sciences  is  rarely  made at the graduate, undergraduate,  or  even  high  school  level.  Research  has shown that very early  social  and  cultural  influences, rather than biological factors, steer girls away from science,  with  a sharp disparity in attitude towards science between boys and girls  occurring  between grades 4 and 8. It is proposed to address this  problem  by developing an outreach program to local elementary schools (grade 3 and  4)  based  upon providing encouragement of curiosity, hands on  scientific  experiences,  and positive male and female role models  with  the  aim  of  portraying science as an attractive activity/career opportunity for  girls  and  young  women to pursue. It is hoped that this heightened interest  in  science  will  help overcome the social, cultural, and curriculum  factors  which  currently contribute to girls' declining attitudes towards  science  through the junior high years.  %%%  This research program will result in an understanding of the effect of  chirality on the onformation of dendritic macromolecules and a new paradi  gm for the design of chiral dendrimers which can provide asymmetric envir  onments to encapsulated guest molecules. In addition, a new generation of  materials with applications in chiral chromatographic separations and  asymmetric catalysis will be prepared.  ***",
