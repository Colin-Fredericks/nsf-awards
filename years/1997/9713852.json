 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acquisition  of  a microwave plasma  chemical  vapor    deposition (CVD) system with capability for ECR  (electron    cyclotron resonance) source, in situ heater stage, and  DC    bias  will create a versatile CVD facility with capability    for   deposition  over  a  wide  range  of  pressures  and    temperatures.  Additional components including 12  channel    mass  flow  controllers, vacuum pump, traps, and  pressure    indicators/controllers  will  complete  the  CVD   system.    Furthermore, the 2 additional reactor chambers will  avoid    cross contamination because of the deposition of different    materials  by  Co-PIs  providing flexibility  in  cleaning    without  the reactor downtime.  The microwave  plasma  CVD    system  will  also be capable of enhancing chemical  vapor    deposition  of  hard-to-process and unique  nonequilibrium    materials/phases such as cubic boron nitride (c)-BN over a    range   of   temperatures  (including  moderate   to   low    temperatures) because of the ECR source and in situ heater    stage.         The  system  will  have  an  initial  capability  for    deposition    of    a    broad    range    of    high-tech    materials/coatings required for several research  projects    of  PI  and  Co-PIs.   This CVD system  will  be  used  to    synthesize   advanced  thin  films/coatings   and   unique    materials  including in particular: (a) Carbide,  nitride,    or  oxide  coatings on a broad range of fibers  to  create    engineered  fiber-matrix  interfaces  for  studying  their    roles  on  the micromechanics of crack bridging, fracture,    and  matrix  cracking behaviors in a number  of  research,    projects  on  fiber-reinforced  ceramic  composites;   (b)    Thermal/oxidation  barrier  coatings  on  superalloys  and    composites   for   aircraft/aerospace  applications;   (c)    Ceramic  thin films for electronics, sensor, and corrosion    protection  applications; and (d) Super-hard c-BN  coating    for cutting tool inserts because this material performance    better  than diamond coating for cutting iron-based alloys    and several US companies like Kennametal, MegaDiamond, GE,    and  Milacron  have showed interest in  c-BN  and  thermal    barrier  coatings.   While all of  these  are  interesting    materials,  only a few important ones, such  as  oxidation    resistant fiber coatings, c-BN, thermal/oxidation  barrier    (ZrO2/Al2O3) , and PZT will be synthesized initially.         An   interdisciplinary  team  consisting  of  several    faculty  from  the  Department of  Materials  Science  and    Engineering  and  a  Visiting Scholar will  be  using  the    proposed  microwave plasma CVD system to process  coatings    for  the  current  and future research projects.  Together    this  team has over 40 years of cumulative experience with    the processing of materials by CVD and characterization of    their  properties.  The availability of  the  system  will    enhance   their   capabilities  for  synthesizing   unique    inorganic  coatings  for applications in  fiber-reinforced    composites,    cutting   tools,   corrosion    protection,    electronics,  and environmental-related areas.   A  strong    interest  is  shown by a number of industries on  research    work that will become possible because of the availability    of this facility.",
