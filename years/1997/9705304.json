 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705304  Meyerovich  This project consists of two components.  One deals with the  physics of spin polarized quantum systems, specifically the  spin dynamics.  Here the anomalous zero-temperature spin  attenuation in polarized Fermi liquids, which is now well  established both experimentally and theoretically,  nevertheless needs to be brought under the umbrella of a  general theory of Fermi liquids.  There are plans to study  the nonlinear phenomena, e.g. close to the Castaing  instability.  In the second component, the PI plans to  develop a general framework for a study of boundary  roughness effects.  Much of this work is an extensive  development of a recent breakthrough formalism by the PI and  his coworkers where the boundary roughness is mathematically  expressed in terms of bulk distortions.  In details, this  research hopes to develop a description of particle flow at  very high Knudsen numbers and an exploration of random  boundary effects in microscopic models of friction.  %%%  A renewal to a distinguished mid-career PI, this grant  supports work on two different projects.  In the first part  the PI will continue his well-recognized study of highly  polarized systems, equivalent to materials in magnetic  fields of the order of hundreds of Tesla.  the second group  of problems involve random/rough surfaces and boundaries.  The PI has recently developed a mathematical formalism,  amounting to a major breakthrough in the description of a  wide range of problems.  The possible areas of inpact are  particle flow at very high speeds and low densities and/or  models for understanding material friction.  ***",
