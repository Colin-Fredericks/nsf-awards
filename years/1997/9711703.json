The contributions of long-term studies  to  our  knowledge  of  how  the ocean works are  numerous  and  far-  reaching. Yet, such studies are exceedingly rare-especially those  with   a  biogeochemical  focus.  The  OFP  time-series  is   now  approaching   its  20th  year.  It  is  one  of  the   very   few  oceanographic records spanning more than a decade  and,  by  far,  the  longest  time-series of its kind. The  OFP  time-series  has  provided  an  unparalleled record of secular changes in  material  fluxes  to  the  deep  ocean, and direct evidence  of  the  close  linkages  between particle fluxes and upper ocean processes.  The  OFP  record  remains  on  e of the main pieces  of  evidence  for  temporal  variability  in  ecosystem  functioning  and   in   the  efficiency of the \"biological pump\". The OFP time-series  is  now  becoming  long enough to begin to identify significant  long-term  trends in both the magnitude and composition of the material flux  which  appear  to be directly linked to variation  in  the  North  Atlantic climate system.         The project continues to share its resources- in the form of  sample material, data, ancillary shiptime, and use of the mooring  platform-  with a large number of researchers to make possible  a  diverse    range    of   detailed,   generally   process-oriented  investigations which have greatly expanded the scientific results  of  the program.  Synthesis of these datasets will lead to  major  and  fundamental advances in identifying the upper ocean controls  on the quantity and composition of material flux to the seafloor.  The  findings  will be of paramount importance for  understanding  and   predicting   the  ocean's  response  to  future,   possibly  anthropogenically induced, climatic change and for development of  global carbon flux models.",
