Solution pH  controls many chemical processes involving atmospheric sea salt. However, acid-base  relationships in sea-salt aerosol are very poorly characterized; estimates of aerosol pH  based on measurements and models range from <1 to >9.  Reliable measurements  would provide critical constraints in resolving the chemical cycling of halogens,  sulfur, nitrogen, and trace metals in the MBL.        The specific research objectives of this study are: (1) to sample size-segregated  marine aerosol during discrete day and night periods and to measure major ionic  constituents; (2) to estimate sea-salt aerosol pH as a function of particle size via direct  measurements in the field using micro-electrodes, measurement of total carbonate in  extracts, and ion-balance analyses; and (3) to assess related implications for aqueous-  phase and multi-phase chemical processes in marine air.       MBL air will be sampled during late April and May 1997 at the AEROCE  station on Bermuda. Aerosols will be collected with high-volume cascade impactors  over discrete, 12-hour, day or night periods. The concentrations of ozone, carbon  monoxide, black carbon, and radon, the ionic composition of bulk aerosols, the  physical and optical properties of aerosols, as well as site meteorological parameters  will be measured concurrently during all or some intervals, and routine air parcel  trajectory calculations will be available.   ***",
