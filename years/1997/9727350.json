The Division will conduct a 1O-week  summer research program for undergraduate students to  participate in research projects in the field of microbial  biochemistry and genetic regulation. In addition to their  research projects, students participate in a weekly student  faculty research discussion seminar series at which they  teach other about their projects, and in a weekly career  development series, which covers such topics as choosing  graduate programs, completing successful applications, and  interviewing. Three sessions each summer are devoted to  discussions of ethical issues in biological sciences.  Students will be recruited from a nation wide pool, with a  particular emphasis recruiting students who are interested  in careers in biological research and on recruiting  qualified minority students and women. Students will have  the opportunity to carry out projects in the laboratories of  any of 18 Division faculty members who are participating in  this program.         Students will also have opportunities to meet other  majority and minority research faculty and graduate students  in both academic and social settings. These opportunities  are provided by the program, by the individual laboratories,  and by the housing accomodations, which are in the dormitory  on the Medical School campus. Students receive a stipend,  housing, travel to and from program, and health insurance  for emergency illness and accidents.",
