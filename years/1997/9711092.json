 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a three year project to promote greater industry  cooperation in architecting and managing the global Internet  infrastructure.  It addresses global engineering concerns that are highly  dependent upon cross-ISP coordination, particularly those requiring  measurement of Internet metrics.  It addresses ISPs' emerging need for  technical meahnaisms to facilitate service guarantees and financial  settlements between providers.  Specifically, the CAIDA endeavors to:      identify, develop and deploy measurement tools across the Internet;    work with commercial providers to provide them with a neutral,  confidential vehicle for data sharing and analysis;    provide networking researchers and the general Internet community with  current data on Internet traffic flow patterns;    assist in the introduction/deployment of emerging Internet technologies  such as multicast, Ipv6, web caching, bandwidth reservation protocols, etc;  and    enhance communications between commercial Internet service providers and  the broader Internet communities.    The goal is to have both government and industry participate in the  project's creation and operation.  The project is envisioned as a  supporting framework for active tasks to be defined by researchers in  conjunction with CAIDA members.  Tasks will be defined through proposals by  CAIDA researchers to one or more CAIDA sponsoring members; jointly proposed  by CAIDA researchers and CAIDA sponsoring members; or solicited by one or  more sponsoring members of CAIDA.  It is expected that the government's  role in funding the project will diminish as industry support increases.",
