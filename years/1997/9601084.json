Chi-Wang Shu, Brown University, Division of Applied  Mathematics, and Li Yinfan, Department of Computational  Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences together with Lu  Ruxun, Mathematics Department, University of Science and  Technology, Hefei, propose to conduct research on various  projects related to development of numerical algorithms with  high order of accuracy.  The cooperation will be carried on  through exchange of visits and of students.    Finite volume method and finite element method are two of  the main classes of numerical methods frequently used to  solve differential equations arising from fluid dynamics and  other areas of computational physics and computational  engineering, such as semiconductor device simulations.  The  US and Chinese researchers in this project will jointly  study these two types of methods, compare their relative  merit in different situations, and apply the method to  computational fluid dynamics problems and other problems in  computational physics.  The US investigator's expertise in  finite difference method, and in applications in various  fields of computational physics is complemented by the  Chinese expertise in algorithm development and analysis.  The Chinese side also brings established research groups to  the project, providing an additional pool of research  support.",
