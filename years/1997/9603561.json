No other meeting  in  the field of herpetology bring together such a diversity  of  researchers and veiwpoints as does this  Congress.   The  Congress will be held in Prague, Czech Republic from  August  2  -  10, 1997.  The previous World Congresses have provided  avenues for presenting current, innovative, problem-oriented  biology  that  have contributed to the advancement  of  many  disciplines  of  science.   The  third  World  Congress   is  designed  in a similar multidisciplinary fashion.  As  such,  these   meetings  are  of  particular  value  to   students.  Individual  travel  awards  will  be  made  by  a  selection  committee  of  three  experts  (one  each  from  the   major  cooperating  U.S.-based societies, the American  Society  of  Ichthyologists   and   Herpetologists,  the   Herpetologists  League,  and  the  Society  for  Study  of  Amphibians   and  Reptiles).  The experience gained by student-participants at  this  conference  will help insure that researchers  in  the  United States remain at the center of international research  activity   concerning  general  advances  in  biology,   and  particularly advances in the biology of lower vertebrates.",
