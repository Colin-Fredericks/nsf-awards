 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed series of four workshops at four different geographical areas is to provide a financially-accessible opportunity for faculty, instructional support staff, and instructional computing administrators at two-year colleges and the lower-division of small four-year colleges to become familiar with current issues and obtain a working knowledge of some of the emerging technologies in instructional computing. This purpose will be achieved through a series of four two-day workshops and follow-up activities involving four groups of thirty participants each. Each workshop will focus on three specific topic areas: Emerging Technologies, Resource Management, and Instructional Methodologies. Within each topic area, emphasis will be placed ol providing detailed, specific, meaningful, applicable, realistic, achievable solutions to the issues being addressed. Laboratory facilities will be available to practice and reinforce the solutions being developed. Through contact with guest presenters, who are experts in the field, participants will become informed about the details of working implementations of the technology. Upon completion of the workshop activities, each participant will be required to conduct a local follow-up seminar to disseminate materials and knowledge gained from the workshop. These follow-up activities will provide means for participants to interact with local colleagues to discuss implementing  solutions at their institutions. The results of the project will be presented by participants as professional journal articles and conference presentations as well as posted on the World Wide Web. A prototype of the proposed workshop series was successfully conducted by the ACM two-year College Education Committee on February 16-17, 1996 as a three-part workshop at the SIGCSE Technical Symposium in Philadelphia.",
