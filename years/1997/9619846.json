 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the use of foveated geometries for  scientific visualization applications.  Two main motivations for  such geometries are (1) the analogy with biological vision  systems, and (2) their remarkably reduced pixel density that is  logarithmic in the radius of the visual field.  To compensate for  the loss of peripheral vision in foveated geometries, the  approach of active visualization is to allow the user interactive  control of several parameters of vision, including rapid saccades  and adjustable resolution.  These are new capabilities, to be  added to the more conventional navigational control.  Foveated  geometries will be a key to making current visualization systems  more robust, scalable and extendible.    The project will investigate three main areas:    - Algorithms and data structures for rendering and manipulating  foveated images.    - Wavelet theory and algorithms for a corresponding concept of  foveated multiresolution.    - Application of active visualization in \"thin-wire models\" of  computation such as the internet.      In a typical \"thin-wire\" visualization scenario, imagine an image  server with powerful computational resources, a client displaying  images with the the computational power of stock PC's,  and between them, a thin-wire.   In current visualization  applications, the bandwidth usage from client to server is  negligible but the bandwidth in the other direction is a severe  bottleneck.  In exchange for a modest amount of bandwidth going  from client to image server, active visualization is able to  remove this bottleneck.  Such a development can have major impact  on visualization.  ***",
