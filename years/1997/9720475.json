 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will undertake qualitative empirical research into the impact of remote-sensing satellites on the global knowledge structure, defined in terms of the distribution of power, rule-making, and authority.  For some, globalization and the so-called information revolution are propelling the world into a `post-internationalist` era in which `sovereignty-free` non-state actors challenge the state's power and authority.  For others, recent technological changes present no constitutive threat to the state-centric international system.  This project will address the question of whether  technological revolutions are precipitating a transformation in the structures of world politics by focusing on a difficult case: Earth observing satellites.  Earth observing satellites, representing both a primary medium for surveillance and a key information technology, offer an excellent arena for exploring the global knowledge structure.  They offer if not a least-likely case, then a not-so-obvious test case for the post-internationalist thesis since, to a greater extent than other information technologies, their roots are solidly in the domain of the scientific state.  The proposed hypothesis is that the information revolution is precipitating political transformation, and that developments in satellite remote sensing will provide confirming evidence for this shift.  Confirmation of the post-internationalist thesis for the strong case of earth-observing satellites would be especially compelling.  This POWRE grant will provide support for a Visiting Professorship at The George Washington University's Space Policy Institute.  The Institute is unique for its interdisciplinary research and teaching faculty devoted entirely to issues of space policy and technology, including satellite-based remote sensing.   NSF funding will do a great deal to enhance the investigator's overall research agenda and specific standing in her upcoming tenure review.   Her project has the potential for an important impact both in academia and in wider audiences.",
