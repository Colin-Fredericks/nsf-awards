 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604919  Eggleston    The R-marbled (R-mb) complex of r genes in maize exemplifies many features of epigenetic gene silencing in plants.  First, kernel pigmentation is inhibited irregularly in a pattern characteristic of transposable element action.  Germinal revertants confer strong seed and scutellum color and weak scutellar node color.  Unique among r alleles, in combination with dominant alleles of the a3 and pl loci, this allele permits variegated anthocyanin expression in anthers.  Even more remarkably, heterozygosity between R-mb and certain other r alleles on the homologous chromosome leads to heritable inactivation of the latter (paramutation).  No change in R-mb is observed.  Genetic linkage of Lc, a displaced copy of r not normally sensitive to paramutation, to R-mb leads to a gradual suppression of Lc expression.  Questions to be addressed in this proposal include:  How are the determinants of cis and trans gene silencing in R-mb organized and are they related? Is expression of gene sin R-mb itself suppressed by these determinants?  What types of molecular/genetic changes alter the potential for silencing? To study those questions, the   R-mb complex will be fractionated by intralocus recombination and the products analyzed by a of genetic and molecular methods.    Results from this work will lead t a better understanding of mechanisms of gene silencing and evolutionary forces affecting duplicated sequences in plants and other species.  The results also will elucidate some epigenetic, or non-Mendelian effects to be expected, and avoided or enhanced, during the use of transgenes in basic research and in crop and animal improvement.",
