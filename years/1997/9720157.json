 "awd_abstract_narration": "9720157  LUCAS  This award provides funding for establishment of an Alabama  Biomedical Implant Center that will integrate research activities  for 32 researchers from six Alabama universities.  Primary goals  for the proposed center include 1) basic research in biochemical,  biomechanical and cellular responses elicited by the surgical  implantation of a prosthesis or other material in the human body;  2) technology transfer from the universities involved to state and  national industrial partners; and 3) research/training and industry  internship opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate  students.  A developmental grant program will support pilot  projects to obtain preliminary data and enhance the research  competitiveness of collaborating faculty.  Workshops and a  newsletter are planned for dissemination of information about  center activities and research results. The center is also  anticipated to serve as a resource, providing laboratory facilities  and technical advice for developing medical device companies.    This center will be unique in its emphasis on integration of  biomedical and tissue engineering research efforts.  The  partnerships with industry and emphasis on technology transfer, as  well as basic and applied research, will contribute to both  economic growth and development and the quality of health care in  Alabama.",
