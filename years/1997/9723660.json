 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bode  9723660      During the last 10-15 years a great deal has been learned about the genes and processes  that regulate the development of an embryo into a functioning animal. One of the most interesting aspects of the accumulating knowledge is that a common set of regulatory genes   involved in a common, or related, set of mechanisms underlie many of the developmental processes of the metazoans studied so far. These common features raise interesting and important questions as to how early during evolution did these genes arise? Were they already present in the Ur-metazoan? What developmental mechanisms and developmental processes  did they participate in? And, to what extent were the mechanisms and processes invented early and conserved through animal evolution?        One approach to these issues is to study these genes and their functions in organisms that belong to groups of animals that arose very early during metazoan evolution, such as the cnidaria, whose members include jellyfish, sea anemones, and the freshwater hydra. Of these, hydra, is particularly useful since the developmental processes (pattern formation, control of the proliferation and differentiation of the several cell types) are well-understood. Further, a number of genes known to regulate developmental events in many vertebrates and invertebrates have also been isolated, and in part, characterized in hydra.      The overall aim of the proposed work is to determine if the genes and mechanisms underlying the development of the head of hydra are similar to those found in the development of the heads of vertebrates and insects. One such gene has already been found. Cnotx a hydra homologue, of the members of the Otx family has been characterized and shown to be involved in the development of the tentacles, a particular structure of the hydra head. There is also evidence that homologues of the Dlx and Emx families exist in hydra, or a close marine relative.   Genes of these families play important roles in the patterning of the  head in vertebrates and arthropods. The detailed aims are two. One is to examine in the role of the Coots gene in patterning of the hydra head in detail as well as to investigate its role in cell cycle traverse, a  role that preliminary evidence suggests it has. These efforts will be pursued with a variety of approaches including examining alterations of expression patterns during tissue manipulations and functional studies. The other is to isolate and characterize the role of other genes involved in head development in hydra. The focus will be on genes of the families mentioned above.",
