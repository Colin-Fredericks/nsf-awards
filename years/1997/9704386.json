The  defects of interest include intrinsic defects such as vacancies,  interstitials and anti-sites, as well as important chemical  impurities and simple complexes resulting from interactions  between them.  The purpose of the research is to understand the  electronic and vibronic structure of the ground, metastable, and  excited states of such defects, and to determine on a microscopic  scale the role they play in the electronic and optical properties  of this class of materials.  The emphasis in the renewed research  is toward the wide bandgap semiconductors, including II-VI  compounds, III-V nitrides, diamond, and SiC.  The rationale is  that relatively little is known about the defects in these  materials and there is good reason to anticipate surprises and  new important physics in their properties.  This is because of  competition between the increased recombination energy available  from the bandgap on the one hand, and the increased role of many-  electron effects due to the greater electronic localization on  the other.  Theory is pressed in dealing with deep defects, and  high quality experimental information will be useful to guide and  test new theory.  In addition, these materials are of  technological interest for their potential as visible and uv  light emitting and high temperature electronic devices.  Such  applications will require an understanding of point defects  greatly in excess of what little is now known.  A major  experimental approach will be to produce intrinsic defects by  2.5MeV electron irradiation for study by the ODMR and ODENDOR  techniques.  In some cases irradiation in situ at 4.2K in a  special ODMR facility will allow study of pristine Frenkel pair  defects (vacancy-interstitial close pairs) at low temper ature and  as they are slowly warmed.  %%%  This experimental project focuses on important atomic scale  defect structures that occur in crystalline samples of  semiconductors.  Such defects, which include vacant lattice  sites, additional atoms located interstitially, and chemical  substitutions (as for example As as an impurity in Si) are well  known to have important consequences on the electronic properties  of semiconductors.  Such point defects as As in Si introduce an  extra electron for electrical conduction (these are called donor  impurities); others introduce holes, and all point defects have a  \"scattering\" effect on the motion of electrons and holes when an  accelerating field is applied, tending to reduce the current for  a given voltage.  The present project makes use of an advanced  optically detected magnetic resonance method for study of various  point defects.  The work will focus on those \"wide bandgap\"  semiconductors which are now being considered for unique  applications for which silicon and gallium arsenide are not  suitable.  Possible applications of the wide bandgap  semiconductors are for visible and ultraviolet light emitting  diodes and for high temperature electronic devices.  The  semiconductors of interest include, for example, SiC  and GaN.  A  special aspect of the experimental work will be deliberate  introduction of point defects by electron irradiation.  This work  involves a postdoctoral  fellow who will be excellently trained  in the course of this research for a position in industry,  government, or academia.  ***",
