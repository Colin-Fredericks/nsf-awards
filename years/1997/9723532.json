 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723532  Satir    Regulative secretion in eukaryotic cells involves a large number of components that interact to control   membrane fusion and exocytosis via a signal transduction cascade.  In many systems, this cascade is   initiated by an increase in cytosolic Ca2+.  The targets of this Ca2+ increase are not completely   understood.  They probably include a phosphoglycoprotein, parafusin (PFUS), that is widely found from   protozoa to mammalian cells. In Paramecium  where PFUS has been carefully studied, a Ca2+-dependent   dephosphoglucosylation of the molecule is clearly correlated with exocytosis.  The possibility that PFUS is   a critical component of the secretory apparatus has now been enhanced by the finding that PFUS localizes   to the surface \"coat\" of the dense core secretory vesicles in Paramecium  and to the cell membrane prior to   exocytosis and that it changes its localization when exocytosis is induced.  Coat proteins are important in   many membranes to determine localization within the cell.  In this proposal we seek to explore the   function of PFUS  in membrane fusion and exocytosis, including a possible relationship of PFUS to   specific components of the 20S docking complex.  This function may have fundamental consequences for   the signal transduction cascade leading to exocytosis and secretory product release in tissues of   multicellular organisms.     The secretion of proteins from cells is an essential physiological process in cells as diverse as unicellular   organisms to organs of animals. This process involves the intracellular packaging of secretory proteins   into membrane-bounded vesicles that fuse with the cell's limiting membrane, or plasma membrane, to be   secreted into extracellular space. A conserved protein, termed parafusin appears to be involved in the   fusion of the secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane. The PI has found that the reversible attachment   of a phosphoglucose to the parafusin protein may regulate the fusion of the secretory vesicle  to the plasma   membrane. This type of modification of a protein is apparently unique to this protein. The regulation of   the attachment and removal of the phosphoglucose  is proposed as a critical step to regulate the secretion   of proteins from cells. This award will fund basic research in the functional role and regulation of   parafusin phosphorylation in protein secretion.",
