 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Abstract  Discrete Random Structures  The five-year project \"Discrete Random Structures\" will enable  the Principal Investigator to further consolidate his deep  involvement with undergraduate research.  He will lead eight  students each year in a series of meaningful mathematical  research endeavours, each designed to convince the participants  that there are undeniable links between several  sub-disciplines,  and that these bonds need to be recognized and exploited.  The  team-members' problems will emanate in areas such as  combinatorics, number theory, geometry, algorithms, and molecular  biology, but contemporary probabilistic methods and classical  analytic techniques will be used as integral tools in their  solution.  We expect that most participants will study recently  developed probabilistic techniques such as Janson's inequality;  the method of bounded and unbounded martingale differences;  Talagrand's isoperimetric inequalities; and the Stein-Chen method  of Poisson approximation in their effort to understand the  concentration in measure of a wide range of discrete structures.   The participants will be selected after a nationwide search, and  will spend two months at Michigan Tech University during the  Summers of 1997--2001. Based on the PI's track record over the  last seven years, it can be predicted that the student    researchers will work on an average of three problems, either  individually or in teams of two or more, and be able to make  significant progress on about two of these endeavours.  The  students' findings will be presented at national meetings such as  the Annual AMS/MAA Meeting, or at a carefully selected  Probability/Combinatorics conference.  As in the past, every  effort will be made to submit the students' papers to high-level  journals for possible publication.  We shall select students from  a broad range of colleges and universities, and are totally  committed to the vigorous recruitment of women, minorities and  disabled students.",
