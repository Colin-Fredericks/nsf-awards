The  experimental  research  entails  fabrication   of  semiconductor microstructures, in the form of wires and dots, and  the  measurement  of their electronic properties  at  millikelvin  temperatures.  Universal  statistics of conductance  fluctuations  are connected to quantum manifestations of chaos. The educational  components of the project involve finding successful ways to  use  advanced textbooks in the teaching of freshman physics,  and  the  integration of undergraduate students in laboratory research.  %%%  The research carried out searches for understanding of changes in  the  performance  of semiconductor microelectronic  devices  that  eventually  will  result from making the  devices  ever  smaller.  Smaller  devices  are  desirable  in  improving  the  speed   and  complexity of computer chips such as the Pentium chip, but it  is  expected further advances in the speed and complexity of computer  chips  will  eventually  be limited by  the  onset  of  different  physical  rules for electron behavior. The present research  will  contribute  to our understanding of this transition in  behavior.  The  work  may  also  suggest new device  designs  which  may  be  superior  in  the desirable limit of extremely small device  size  and  high  device  density.  The educational  components  of  the  project  relate  to novel methods in teaching elementary  college  physics  and  in giving undergraduate science students an earlier  exposure to laboratory research.  ***",
