The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Natalie M. Mahowald to work with Dr. Knut  Henning Rodhe at Stockholm University in Sweden.    Dr. Mahowald will construct and apply a coupled model for  the sources, entrainment, atmospheric transport and  deposition of atmospheric dust, driven by a combination of  results from  atmospheric general circulation and ecosystem  models for the last glacial maximum.  The concentrations of  mineral dust in ice-cores exhibit large variations between  glacial and interglacial periods with higher concentration  occurring during glacial periods.  Atmospheric dust may play  an active role in the control of global climate change on  the glacial-interglacial time scale.  Such control can be  brought about by the scattering of solar radiation back to  space, by altering nutrient balances in the ocean, and by  lowering the albedo of snow and ice surfaces.  ***",
