Most of the robust control research has been dominated by worst-(!a-,;e deterministic   formulations of the control analysis and design problems.  Despite the considerable successes of the worst-case   deterministic approach such as Hoo  16  and     12,13 control theory, most of the robust control analysis and   design problems involving real parametric and/or structured uncertainty remain open.  Analytical results, such   as the celebrated Kharitonov theorem  45 , apply to rather specialized problems.  For general and   comprehensive formulations such as the structured singular value theory --- u theory ---- analysis and design   problems have turned out to be. very difficult, and the focus of research has been on obtaining upper and lower   bounds on the quantities of interest.  Recent research on the computational complexity of robust control analysis and design problems indicates that   these difficulties are, most likely, inherent to the worst-case deterministic problem formulations rather than a lack   of ingenuity.  In view of these results, it appears we must abandon attempts to design deterministic algorithms that   perform well on every problem instance, and/or change the worst-case robust control paradigm  The focus of this proposal is on the design and analysis of randomized algorithms for certain very general   robust control problems.  A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that makes random choices during its   execution.  Randomized algorithms have received considerable attention in the last twenty years  33, 55    Surprisingly efficient randomized algorithms have been designed for problems in diverse areas such as number   theory  65, 73 , computational geometry  57, 9 , parallel and distributed computing  39 , pattern matching  37 ,   approximate counting problems  34, 35, 36, 74  etc.. We contend the successes of randomized algor ithms in   solving difficult computational tasks in such diverse areas, and the apparent shortcomings of our current   approaches to robust control are compelling reasons to focus research efforts on the design of randomized   algorithms.  Our research will take two directions.  The first will focus on the design of (Las Vegas type) randomized   algorithms which deliver the worst-case guarantees we seek in the traditional robust control paradigm, and, at the   same time, perform well (e.g. have short execution times) with high probability for every possible problem   instance.  The second will focus on the design of (Monte Carlo type) randomized algorithm that deliver   probabilistic statements of the form that a \"certain (stability/performance) property holds for most of the systems   in a prescribed set (given by uncertain parameters in compact sets, unmodeled dynamics given by balls in function   spaces, etc.) with a high degree of confidence.\"    We intend to investigate the application of randomized algorithms to a host of heretofore intractable robust   multivaxiable control problems including: 1) m analysis problem; 2) m synthesis problem; 3) fixed order m   synthesis problem; 4) reduced order Hoo. design problem; 4) Hoo model  reduction problem.    The focus of our education activities over the next four years will be on the design/development of four new   courses: an introductory course on randomized algorithms; a class on the application of randomized algorithms to   robust control problems; a class on linear matrix inequalities in control theory; a course on modeling and system   identification.  The introductory course on randomized algorithms will establish necessary background in the area   and will present randomized algorithms from various application areas.  It will play a vital role in preparing   students to implement such algorithms.  The follow up course on randomized algorithms will stress the application   of randomized algorithms in robust control and will present the la test developments in the area.  The course will   target graduate students who want to conduct research in this area.",
