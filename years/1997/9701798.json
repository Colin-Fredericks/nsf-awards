 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Highton, Thomas    The   Union  City  School  District,  a  special  needs  district  (Enterprise  Zone) with a total enrollment of 9,017 students  94%  of   which  are  minorities,  proposes  a  multi-year  effort  in  collaboration with Institutions of Higher Education,  which  will  increase the numbers of underrepresented minorities prepared  and  motivated  to  enroll in precollege SEM classes and  to  consider  SMETE   (Science,   Mathematics,   Engineering   and   Technology  Education)  by  enhancing teaching effectiveness in  science  and  mathematics  across  K-12  grade  levels.   The  proposed   pilot  project,  Science  and  Math Alliance for a  Successful  Habitude  (SMASH),   will   be  a  five  year  comprehensive   professional  development and assistance program for 315 elementary/middle  (K-  8)  and  50  secondary teachers, counselors, students  and  their  parents  with  a particular focus on: standards based  curriculum  implementation,    teachers    enhancement    and    professional  development, and raising counselors and parents knowledge of  the  bridging mechanisms that Facilitate educational transitions  from  one level to the next.  The  five  year systemic project will involve several components:  1)  a  needs  assessment to give direction  to  the  project;  2)  teacher  enhancement  to  develop  teaching  skills  and  content  mastery;  3)  standard  based curriculum implementation;  and  4)  teaching assistants component.  Through  the  meeting, brainstorming, discussion and decision  of  teacher-led  curriculum  sequencing and articulation  committees,  the   teaching  process  will  be  examined  and  new  strategies  deployed.   All  efforts will include full teacher participation.  In-service    training   workshops   will   be    provided    for  elementary/middle  (K-8) and secondary grade  level  teachers  to  continue   content  knowledge  and  to  explore  the   curriculum  standards.   The  project will facilitate a  continuing  dialogue  among K- 12 faculty throughout the grant period.  The university personnel will work with the classroom teacher  in  the introduction of hands-on activities and management strategies  and   provide  guidance  in  the  content  areas.   In  addition,  counselors  and parents will be also trained in hands-on  science  and  math  activities, and will be provided with  information  on  SMETE  precollege  initiatives and SMET career opportunities.   A  \"Tutorial Assistance\" program will be implemented.  A  summative  and formative evaluation process will  be  used  to  assure  project improvement from the date of initial activity  to  the  conclusion of our efforts.  Methodologies will provide rapid  feedback  to  assist in timely management intervention,  planning  and  decision making, especially to eliminate unnecessary student  failures.  This proposed project will build upon existing reform initiatives  already  taking place in the Union City school district  and  its  partner  sites.   Mr.  Henry  Cisneros,  Secretary  of  HUD,  has  designated  Union City as New Jersey's \"Campus of learners\",  one  of twenty-four nationwide.  Union City is a Thrust H district for  NJSSI  and has been funded for a NSF/NIIE project entitled \"Union  City On-Line\".  Its statewide -partner site, NJIT has several NSF  funded  initiatives such as Young Scholars Programs,  Females  in  Engineering Programs, Science and Math Education for the  Special  Education Population.  Upon  completion of the project grant period, the  district  will  have  developed an unique and meaningful curriculum not  only  on  the elementary, middle, and secondary levels, but will possess  a  standard  based  curriculum that relates to outstanding  post-  secondary education at prestigious universities.",
