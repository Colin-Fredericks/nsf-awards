 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non specialist faculty at universities and colleges have few opportunities to keep up with current research, and they are often required to teach subjects beyond their area of expertise. For these and other reasons they may be unable to offer up-to-date pedagogical techniques and disciplinary perspectives.         The Institute for Advanced Study/Park City Mathematics Institute (PCMI) seeks funding to enhance the expertise and teaching ability of undergraduate mathematics faculty. Specifically, the program seeks to expose faculty to cutting-edge research, impart new teaching methods, and strengthen their understanding of the mathematics enterprise as a whole.         The PCMI is an ongoing, NSF-funded program which seeks to better integrate the research and educational aspects of mathematics. For three weeks each summer it brings together undergraduates, graduate students, researchers, and high school teachers (approximately 180 persons) for collaborative activities. Undergraduate faculty would join this program with the  goals of honing their mathematical skills, exploring new educational technologies, and sharing their own expertise.         The PCMI intends to recruit teaching faculty who are motivated toward the reform and strengthening of undergraduate teaching. We shall especially seek individuals who are interested in disseminating what they learn, whether through publications, educational activities, or other means. The program makes a deliberate effort to recruit women and minority mathematicians, and to provide regular, objective evaluation of program activities.",
