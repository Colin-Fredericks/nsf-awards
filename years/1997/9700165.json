 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research project, chaos and bifurcation theory will  be used to analyze the nonlinear lateral and yaw stability  (commonly called `hunting`) of high-speed rail vehicles. A  major challenge in designing rail vehicles in general, and  high-speed passenger rail transportation in particular, is  the velocity-dependent dynamics of the vehicle. As velocity  increases, the vehicle becomes less stable, experiences  violent oscillations, and eventually derails. In addition to  safety concerns, hunting imposes significant operational  costs to the railroads. Increased hunting contributes to  more wheel and rail wear, causing millions of dollars of  damage to the nation's rail system each year. Through using  chaos and bifurcation theory, this research will investigate  and provide a better understanding of the effects of dynamic  nonlinearities on rail vehicle hunting. The nonlinearities  that will be considered include elements such as the primary  and secondary suspensions, the vehicle constraints, and the  wheel/rail interface. This research will also examine design  conditions that yield safer and more cost-effective  operation of rail vehicles at high speeds. The techniques  developed during this research will be applicable to the  design of general nonlinear systems, including high-speed  passenger and freight rail vehicles.",
