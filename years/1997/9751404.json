 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funds for the acquisition and development of laboratory equipment to revitalize the Physics Junior laboratory and Senior Capstone. These courses are pivotal in the undergraduate physics training as they help students make the transition from classroom-based instruction to laboratory-based learning. This project acquires experiments and apparatus to develop platforms in atomic and molecular, nuclear and particle, laser and optical, and solid-state and materials physics that use modern state-of-the-art setups. With such platforms, not only is it possible to more effectively teach experimental techniques and elucidate the usual ideas in these areas of physics, it is possible, for the first time in this physics department, for students to easily design and perform their own experiments. Such experiments enable students to pursue curiosity-driven learning toward understanding important effects not only in these areas of physics, but also into the physics of everyday phenomena. An added bonus of such experimental platforms is the ability to use this equipment to maintain and revitalize the physics outreach programs to high school students through the summer scholars program and to improve our new Research Experience for Undergraduate program.",
