 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pressure to use up-to-date technology mandates that network analyzer (NA) measurements be included in high-frequency (HF) laboratories for electrical engineers.  Therefore, this project enhances a HF laboratory through introduction of network analyzers and through representation of standing waves on the NAs by reprogramming the controllers to maintain this proven approach to teaching.  With the recent development of vector NAs that possess the capability of measuring both magnitude and phase, a new era in measurement metrology has begun.  NAs based on self-contained, microprocessor-driven instruments have, to some extent, taken over the role from manual measurements.  The ability to characterize a component in terms of magnitude and phase changes the methods used in design and development and, thus, how the student or practicing engineer thinks about and visualizes these processes.  Vector measurements are not usually covered in undergraduate HF and microwave laboratories, primarily because of cost and a reluctance by instructors to move away from slotted line techniques because of their intuitive visual representation of standing waves.  It is possible to emulate the classical standing-wave pattern on the NA display.  This requires developing new computer program modules.  Therefore, the intuitive advantage of the slotted line technique can be preserved even in the future laboratory environment provided through this project.    With new, low-cost NAs and customized displays, students can be educated in current measurement metrology employed in industry while teaching is based on intuitive concepts of standing waves.  This combined NA environment can be employed to enhance learning in laboratories that can serve as a model for future laboratory development.  *",
