 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues a line of research into the origins and development of the biotechnology industry.  The focus of that research has been on the varied and novel forms of collaborative arrangements that have linked universities, research institutes, venture capital firms, established chemical and pharmaceutical corporations and research hospitals with new science-based startup companies specializing in commercializing biotech discoveries.  In particular, our research tests the idea that, when knowledge and skills are widely distributed, the locus of innovation is found in a network of interorganizational relationships.  To stay current in a rapidly-developing scientific field requires that an organization have a hand in the research process.  Internal research capability is essential to evaluate the quality of research done elsewhere and to attract premier partners, while external collaboration provides access to news and resources that cannot be generated internally.  In our view, research breakthroughs occur through intensive interaction among participants from diverse scientific fields and institutional contexts.  To test these ideas, we have assembled a relational data base that allows us to examine patterns of collaboration in biotechnology.  Drawing on an industry reference source, Bioscan, annual reports, Security and Exchange Commission filings, and other reference sources, we have compiled a record of the formal, contractual agreements undertaken by dedicated biotech firms in the human therapeutics and diagnostics field.  The present study will use these data to examine high-speed learning and collaboration among such firms.  To do this we will continue our network analyses of relations among organizations,  and will add qualitative material based on face-to-face interviews as well as other quantitative analyses",
