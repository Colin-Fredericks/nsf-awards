 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701809  Templeton   Explaining species distributions is one of the major challenges in biogeography.  Historical and ecological factors may explain why some species are widespread while others have restricted distributions. This study will investigate two fruitfly species distributed through most of the dry areas in east South America.  Drosophila serido, a superspecies complex composed of at least 5 putative species, shows remarkable variation throughout this range.  On the other hand, D. buzzatii shows no sign of diversification.  How these patterns result from present forces such as population structure and past forces such as population history will be addressed by the analysis of DNA sequence variation (mtDNA and nuclear) across the range of these species.  The procedure to be used is new and should differentiate historical from ecological factors affecting distributions.  The methods developed will apply to species in general, to help understand basic forces  affecting the distributions of species.  Empirical studies such as this one are needed to test the validity of the assumptions.  This study will also provide information on the distribution of dry areas during past climate changes in South America, which is relevant to conservation.",
