A major source  of neuronal complexity arises from tight coupling between  neuronal oscillators that are integral components of larger  brain circuits.  These larger circuits then generate  purposeful, coordinated movement patterns.  Another source  of complexity is sensory input, which can alter the activity  of the oscillators.  The experiments funded by this award  are designed to advance the understanding of coordination  and sensory modulation of neural circuits underlying  movement patterns. The specific functions of sensory  feedback in setting the patterns of rhythmic activity in  nervous system circuits are determined. This information is  then combined with the results of experiments investigating  the way different circuits interact to generate larger, more  complex rhythmic movements. Computer models of nervous  system function are developed and tested based on the  experimental data. Because of the functional unity of  rhythmic movements in all animals, analytical tools  developed by, and insights gained from, this research will  be widely applicable to the understanding of the control of  movement in all organisms, including humans, and will  contribute to the base of information important for the  development of artificial movement control systems.",
