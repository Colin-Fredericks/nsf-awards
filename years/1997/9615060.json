 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hays, Burckle, & Isley  9615060  This award supports research to better define the chronology of  iceberg calving from Antarctic ice sheets back to oxygen isotope  stage 11 (364-423 thousand-years before present (ka)).  Re-  assessment of published data for sediments deposited during the  last 100 ka suggests deposition of ice-rafted debris (IRD)  increased dramatically at 17, 22, 63 and 84 ka in the Atlantic  and possibly the Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean.  The  regional extent of these IRD events will be tested, and others  will be identified for the last 500 ka by examining the sediment  record recovered in curated cores.  Age constraints will be  provided by biostratigraphy, chemostratigraphy (opal and  carbonate records) and oxygen isotope stratigraphy. However,  carbon-14 dates (using accelerator mass-spectrometry) will also  be acquired in critical cores.  The accumulation rate of  abiogenic sediment (63  m - 1 mm) will be assessed and its  lithology determined to derive IRD accumulation rates.  Preliminary mineralogical and geochemical analyses will attempt  to trace IRD to their source areas.  Findings will yield a high  resolution assessment of iceberg calving from Antarctic ice  sheets and allow insights to understanding such things as the  late Quaternary history of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.  This  study will also assess whether Southern Hemisphere ice caps  experienced melting episodes at timescales of 2-3 ka, as might be  inferred from records of atmospheric temperatures in Antarctic  Ice cores.  Furthermore, the timing of these Southern Ocean IRD  events will be compared with Heinrich Events in the Northern  Hemisphere.  Preliminary results suggest near-temporal  correlations between IRD deposition in the Southern Ocean and  Northern Hemisphere Heinrich Events 1, 2, 6 and an un-numbered  event at 84 ka.  For the two most recent events, Southern Ocean  IRD events appear to precede those of the Northern Hemisphere by  <3 ka.  A finding of strong temporal correlation bet ween iceberg  calving in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres would suggest  that external forcing rather than internal ice sheet dynamics  drove at least some of the Heinrich events.  On the other hand,  if Southern ocean IRD events preceded those of the Northern  Hemisphere, factors other than the North Atlantic salinity  oscillator must have impacted global climate at sub-Milankovich  timescales.",
