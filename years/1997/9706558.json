 "awd_abstract_narration": "Even in today's increasingly digital world, analog continuous time circuits are  needed in many applications.  Current approaches to analog processing are running  up against fundamental limitations.  Log-domain filtering is a relatively new  approach that offers wide dynamic range and excellent high-frequency response  using simple, low-voltage circuits.  Log-domain filters exploit the translinear  current-voltage characteristics of bipolar transistors or weak-inversion MOSFETS  to achieve overall linearity.  The basic signal processing elements can be quite  simple in form and their high-frequency performance can be excellent while  distortion can be low because most of the transistor non-linearities are  cancelled within the circuit.    This research has three major thrusts:  The first thrust is toward fundamental,  design-oriented analysis of log-domain circuits.  Design methodologies and  fundamental understanding of the limitations of log-domain filters are in an  early stage.  Fundamental analyses allow development of figures of merit for  evaluating and comparing log-domain circuits. The second thrust focuses on  developing new log-domain circuit topologies.  Based on an understanding of  fundamental limitations, new circuits are being designed to improve performance.   The third thrust is toward applications of log-domain circuits.  Integrated  circuits are being built and tested to demonstrate the usefulness of log-domain  circuits in practical applications.  Initial focus is on two application areas:  low-voltage wireless communications, to exploit the performance potential of log-  domain circuits and adaptive and biologically inspired circuits, to build on  their fundamental simplicity.",
