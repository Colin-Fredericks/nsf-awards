 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brian D. Marx    Abstract  This workshop's friendly and supportive academic atmosphere   brings together scientists from different nationalities, backgrounds   and experiences. The workshop will concentrate on various aspects   of statistical modelling, including theoretical developments,   applications and computational methods, and encourages papers   that are motivated by real practical problems and that make a   novel contribution to the subject. Theoretical contributions   addressing problems of practical importance or related to software   developments are also welcome. The scientific program is   characterized by having one hour invited lectures & tutorials   presenting new developments,contributed papers, posters and   software demonstrations. There are no parallel sessions.   Contributed papers should be suitable for a 30 minute oral   presentation (including discussion) and focus on motivation,   statement of key results and conclusions, and emphasize examples,   wherever possible. Papers and posters will be refereed by the   scientific committee and accepted papers and posters will be   printed in a proceedings volume that will be ready for the   start of the conference.     The first call for papers will be September 1, 1997 with a   closing date of February 10, 1998. Notification of acceptance   will be mailed by March 15, 1998.  Major professors should   encourage their students to attend this workshop. The program   is designed to allow plenty of time for discussion and   interchange between junior and senior scientists.  Additionally one paper session will be devoted entirely to  contributions from students. This session will be judged by   the scientific committee and an award will be given to the   winner of the Best Student Paper at the conference dinner   on Thursday evening (July 30, 1998).    The workshop language is English.",
