 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703805  Masri  Presently used actuators to generate control forces are generally  inadequate for limiting the response of civil structures under  strong earthquake shaking.  There is a critical need for a new  generation of actuators that have the capability of adequately  performing under strong ground motion which may induce  significant nonlinear deformations in structures.    The objective of this research is to develop an innovative semi-  active damping augmentation device for controlling the seismic  response of dispersed civil structures.  The control procedure  uses nonlinear auxiliary mass dampers with adjustable (adaptive)  motion-limiting stops, located at selected positions throughout  the structure, to inject an optimum amount of \"chaos\" in the  structures dynamic response by disorganizing the orderly process  of amplitude buildup.  The degree of the structure's oscillation  in the vicinity of each semiactive nonlinear actuator determines  the actuator's actively-controlled gap size and activation time.   By using control energy to adjust the actuator's critical  parameters instead of directly attenuating the motion of the  structure (which conventional active control methods do), a  significant improvement is achieved in the total amount of energy  expended to accomplish a given level of vibration control.    A sequence of analytical and experimental studies by means of a  bridge model to be provided with several innovative nonlinear  actuators and subjected to multiple-support earthquake excitation  by seismic shakers will also be conducted.  ***",
