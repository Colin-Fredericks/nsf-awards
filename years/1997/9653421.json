 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant application proposes a conference to be held at the University of Pittsburgh, in association with the Journal of Economic Education. The conference aims to advance the integration of new instructional technologies into the teaching of economics at the undergraduate level which, for reasons outlined in the project narrative, has been slow to take advantage of new and innovative teaching methods. The proposed conference will review recent applications of new technologies and ways of overcoming institutional and other obstacles that have slowed the pace of innovation. Presenters will be carefully screened to assure that the teaching methods discussed have either demonstrated effectiveness or built-in capabilities for monitoring contributions to student learning.      The conference proceedings will be disseminated in a topical issue of the Journal of Economic Education and abstracts of the papers will be available at the JEE's web site. The organizers propose to follow-up the conference by working with participants to apply and evaluate the teaching methods featured in the program.",
