 "awd_abstract_narration": "Martin  9701116    Evolution of parental care strategies is thought to be determined by  fitness costs and benefits associated with providing care. Avian  incubation is a form of parental care and energetic constraints are  thought to underlie intra- and interspecific variation in incubation  strategies. However, these conclusions are based almost exclusively  on single species studies which may reflect phenotypic rather than  genetic differences. Nest predation is an alternative explanation  that has been proposed as a potential selection pressure leading to  different incubation strategies, but critical tests are lacking. The  PIs propose to experimentally test the energetic constraint and nest  predation risk hypotheses in three sympatric species in the genus  Sitta. These species provide a model system to test these hypotheses  because they differ in opposite directions with respect to energetic  constraints and nest predation risk. The energetic constraint  hypothesis will be tested by experimentally modifying the nest  microclimate using warm and cold air pumped into nests. The nest  predation risk hypothesis will be tested through predator  presentation experiments. This experimental and comparative field  work advances understanding of the factors responsible for intra and  interspecific variation in parental care.    l                                 J",
