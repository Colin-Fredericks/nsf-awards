 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mukherjee    DMI-9615540       Laminated Metal Composite (LMC) provides a very high strength and exceptional fracture toughness for the transportatimn industry, in particular, for aerospace and high speed grould vehicle applications.  To realize its full potential applications, technical advances in near-net shape manufacturing is required.  The current state of knowledge regarding LMC is lacking in understanding of the microstructure and process characteristics of the formed LMC.  This research project investigates the process characteristics and the superplastic formability of multilayered laminated metal composites (LMC) which consists of aluminum-based metal alloy and metal-matrix monolithic layered materials.   The specific goal of this project is to understand the microstructure of the LMCs and to provide better control parameters in the manufacturing process.  The outcomes of this study could provide useful findings for die designs and a better furnace capabilities to carry out the effective forming operation.  This collaborative research project addresses fundamental issues on the characterization of microstructure of the near-net shape LMC manufacturing process.  The research project has a balance between theory and experiment, and will provide valuable findings for the laminated metal composite industry.",
