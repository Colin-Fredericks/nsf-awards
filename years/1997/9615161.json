It is  surrounded by actively spreading ridges except in the South  American sector.  Antarctica is the only glaciated continent on  the planet, and as such constitutes a unique element in the  Earth's environment.  The tectonic evolution of its plate  boundaries, and of features within the Antarctic plate,  controlled development of the seaways around and through the  continent prior to and during the onset of glaciation.  In  addition to its unique role in the present day planetary  environment and its classic one as the Okeystone of GondwanalandO  during Paleozoic and early Mesozoic times, Antarctica has played  an important role in global dynamics over the past 1.0 billion  years, and indeed throughout Earth history.    Because Antarctica is ice covered, few continent-wide compilation  maps have been attempted.  This award supports a project to  produce a set of digital geologic reference maps of the  Antarctic.  A new tectonic map of the Antarctic plate will  incorporate:  geological data, both from previously-published  maps, from new papers and from unpublished sources; and  terrestrial and marine tectonic data, including seafloor  structure derived from Geosat satellite gravity data, and  seafloor age and spreading history information.  Moreover, it  will be based on the sub-ice topography.  In addition to a  tectonic map, a series of reconstructions centered on Antarctica,  starting with the early Neoproterozoic and continuing through to  the Cenozoic will be produced.  These maps will be presented in  digital form on a CD-ROM, so that they can be easily reproduced  and used by others. The digital information will be compiled in a  format that will allow future data sets to be easily added to the  database and to allow old data to be easily updated, modified or  discarded.  Besides the maps mentioned above, the CD-ROM will  include digitized versions of updated ice-thickness and sub-ice  top ography maps, and an archive of available data as other  investigators wish to contribute.  Other data, such as  aerogeophysical and paleomagnetic data, would be covered with  separate chapters in the accompanying text and separate files on  the CD-ROM.  About 1000 copies of the CD and accompanying text  will be available for the cost of postage and handling.  Further  copies can be distributed for the cost of reproduction, postage  and handling.",
