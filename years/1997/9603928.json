 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  9603928  Bixby     The precise growth of nerve fibers (axons) to their targets during embryonic development is required for the normal functioning of the adult brain.  Axon growth is a highly regulated process, in the sense that numerous overlapping mechanisms must operate to ensure that it occurs correctly.  One major mechanism regulating the growth of axons involves two classes of enzymes that modify proteins inside nerve cells -- tyrosine kinases, which add regulatory phosphate groups to proteins, and tyrosine phosphatases, which remove these regulatory groups.  Addition or removal of regulatory phosphate groups has profound effects on the functioning of proteins inside nerve cells.  Of the two groups of enzymes, much less is known about the organization and function of tyrosine phosphatases than is known about kinases.  Dr. Bixby has identified two particular tyrosine phosphatases that are found in developing neurons, and which are likely to be involved in regulating the growth of axons in the brain and spinal cord.  One of these, called CRYP-2, is present on the neuronal cell surface, and has both an extracellular (receptor) domain and an intracellular (enzymatic) domain.  The other, called SHP-2, is an intracellular protein.  In a series of experiments, Dr. Bixby's lab will characterize which developing neurons have CRYP-2 on their surfaces, identify the proteins that bind to the receptor domain of CRYP-2, and examine the role of CRYP-2 in regulating axon growth from cultured nerve cells.  In a second group of experiments, Dr. Bixby will use recombinant DNA techniques to cause neurons to produce SHP-2 in abnormal amounts, or to inhibit the function of SHP-2, in developing neurons.  The consequences for axon growth of the abnormal production or the loss of SHP-2 will be assessed.  Results from this project will expand our knowledge of the ways in which axons grow by identifying specific molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating this process in the developing brain and spinal  cord.",
