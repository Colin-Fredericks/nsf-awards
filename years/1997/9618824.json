 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Mark Ediger of the Department of Chemistry of the University of   Wisconsin-Madison is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to perform experimental characterizations   of the glass transition in supercooled organic liquids which include a   number of  polyaromatic compounds such as anthracene, tetracene4, rubrene   and derivatives. Experiments are proposed to investigate the nature of   molecular motion in deeply supercooled organic liquids to probe the   nature of the liquid/glass transition. The questions that this research   will address are: (1) What types of molecular motions occur in deeply   supercooled liquids; (2) Is the supercooled liquid spatially   heterogeneous; and (3) how is this connected to the non-exponential   relaxation that is often observed. Optical, dielectric and NMR   spectroscopies will be used to answer these questions, and in particular,   how long-lived are the regions of different temperature, what is  the   connection between non-exponential dynamics and  heterogeneity, what is   the connection between heterogeneous dynamics and  the observed   enhancement of translation and  if  the anisotropic motion is the   responsible for enhanced translation.   In spite of the significant progress in the molecular interpretation of   the static and dynamic properties of the liquid state,  the properties of    liquids and the molecular motions which occur near the glass transition   temperature, are still not well understood.  The experiments being   conducted by Edgar are designed to shed light these problems, on the   anomalous rotational and transactional  relaxation, and the role of   spatially inhomogeneous dynamics in the glass transition.",
