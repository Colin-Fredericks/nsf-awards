 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706944  Lee  Proximity effect refers to blurring of the written pattern due to electron scattering in E-beam lithography and diffraction of light in optical lithography.  As the minimum feature size in a circuit pattern is continuously reduced as an effort to increase circuit density, the proximity effect has become a serious problem.  Without an efficient proximity effect correction method, the density (capacity) of a circuit pattern that can be fabricated will be significantly limited.  In the future, proximity effect correction is expected to be an essential step for nano-fabrication in E-beam and optical lithography.  Most of the previous schemes proposed for proximity effect correction are either not general enough for realistic circuits or too time-consuming to be used for large circuit patterns.  The main objective of this research project is to develop an integrated proximity effect correction scheme which can overcome the drawbacks of the previous schemes in order to meet the future need.  As the first step toward this goal, a hierarchical rule-based approach, named PYRAMID, to proximity effect correction in E-beam lithography was proposed earlier.  Its first implementation, PYRAMID 1.0, designed for homogeneous substrates has been completed.  PYRAMID 1.0 has been via computer simulation and experimentally demonstrated to be able to correct high-density circuit patterns with the minimum feature size down to 0.1 (m successfully in terms of CD control and correction speed.  In this project, PYRAMID is to be extended for non-homogeneous and/or nonplanar substrates, optical proximity correction, mask-making application, hybrid (shape and dose) modification for better CD control, non-rectangular primitives, and ultra large scale patterns.  Also, distributed implementation of PYRAMID software is proposed to utilize the computing power of a network of workstations which are readily available these days.  ***",
