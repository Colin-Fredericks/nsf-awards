 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619756  The basic goal of the project is to develop an automatic theorem  prover that can reason about properties of programs in high-  level, mathematical programming languages.  The theorem prover  will supply the results of its analysis to programmers by adding  hyperlinks to annotations and drawing diagrams to the program  text.  The annotations will describe sets of values; the diagrams  will explain the anticipated flow of these values.  Both can be  used to understand the program's behavior before it runs.  As a  result, programmers will be able to create programs that either  do not fail at all or only fail at a small, well-defined set of  program points.  While many of the basic properties of such  theorem provers are understood, it is an open question whether  they can be applied to programs of hundreds or thousands of  modules with mutual dependencies.  Hence, the central goal of the  project is to design a modular, scalable proof system, to prove  its correctness, to engineer a suitable programming environment,  and to apply the theorem prover to itself and its programming  environment.  ***",
