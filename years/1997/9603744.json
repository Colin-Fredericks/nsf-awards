 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603744  Schurr  Several problems concerning the structures and thermodynamics of supercoiled plasmids, bending- and temperature-induced perturbations of DNA secondary structure, and the dynamic bending rigidity of DNA will be investigated by a variety of modern optical techniques and simulation methods. Rotational, translational and deformational Brownian motions of particular DNAs and DNA/intercalator complexes will be assessed by time-resolved fluorescence polarization anisotropy (FPA), dynamic light scattering (DLS), a transient polarization grating (TPG) method currently under development, and a transient photodichroism (TPD) method to be developed.     DNA is significantly deformed by twisting and/or bending in many of its biologically important states, for example in supercoiled DNAs. The global (tertiary) structures of such supercoiled DNAs facilitate important biological functions, such as recombination, and the deformational strain energy stored in such molecules is used to drive important biological processes, such as the opening' of the double-helix prior to DNA replication. Understanding the contribution of deformational strain to the energetics and structures of such species requires knowledge of the DNA elastic constants for twisting and bending. Those same elastic constants also provide information about 'switching' of the local (secondary) structure of the DNA. It has been proposed that a regulatory protein might enhance the rate of gene expression via some alteration of the DNA secondary structure at its binding site and long-range (equilibrium) 'transmission' of that altered structure along the DNA to the binding site of the 'informationreading-proteins'. Since many proteins that enhance gene activity also bend the DNA in one way or another, there is some suggestion that bending of the DNA might be involved in secondary structure 'switching'. The research planned will investigate the twisting and bending elastic constants and the energetics of supercoiling over a wide range of  temperatures. It will also examine the 'switching' of DNA secondary structure that is induced by bending and other perturbations, and some of the factors that might control the secondary structure 'switching' equilibrium.",
