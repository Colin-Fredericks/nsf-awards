The  proposed purchase of an automated C-N isotopic analysis system  would greatly enhance the throughput and sensitivity for making  these measurements over what is currently available.  The PI and  his colleagues are experts in the use of such instrumentation and  have a proven track record of research accomplishments in this  area.  Thus the proposed l improvements would lead to a  strengthening of current research activities and lead to  enhancements in current graduate and post-doctoral education  programs and facilitate new research projects not possible  without modernization of the current facility at the University  of Hawaii.  In addition to the $40K of NSF support, $55K in total  funds have been approved by the University using an existing ONR  building fund to support this equipment purchase, thus  significantly increasing total funds to this project.",
