 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706864    Chang      In this project, Chang proposes to continue her study of a  fourth order differential operator called the Paneitz operator.  This operator, which arises naturally from consideration  in conformal geometry, is the standard bi-Laplacian operator   when restricted to domains in the Euclidean spaces. Four problems   are proposed to study the geometric and analytic properties of the   operator. The first is to investigate the geometric content of some  best constant in the sharp Sobolev imbedding result associated with   the operator, the second and the third are to study uniqueness and   regularity of some non-linear PDE naturally related to the operator.   The fourth is to study general conformal covariant operators which   Paneitz operator is a special example.  Mooers proposes to continue her work on analysis on incomplete manifolds,  specifically to investigate the behavior of the heat kernel on   manifolds with isolated metric singularities and to describe the  relationship between the heat kernel of these spaces and their geometry.      One of the most important topic in mathematics today is the study  of 4-dimensional metric spaces (3-dimensional space plus one-dimensional  time variable).  Such spaces arise naturally as the state space of   physical systems, and these systems can often be   described mathematically as solutions to differential equations.  The behavior of solutions is used to study and classify the  geometry of metric spaces, and thus possible physical systems.  Chang propose to study the geometry of 4-manifolds, metric spaces   that look locally like Euclidean space, via some analytic tool--namely   via a fourth order differential operator which leads to interesting and   challenging open questions both in geometry and analysis.    Mooers proposes to use the heat equation to study metric spaces with   isolated metric singularities, spaces that are manifolds away from an   isolated point, and with behavior at the point similar  to a black hole type anoma ly in space.",
