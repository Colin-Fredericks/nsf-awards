 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614747  Sahagian  Computed X-ray Tomography (CXT) has recently emerged as a particularly useful technique for non-destructive 3-dimensional analysis. We propose to develop CXT methods to determine vesicular properties of volcanic rocks, for future application to various geologic problems.  A number geological  factors control the final geometry and structure of observed vesicles in volcanic rocks. We will study the rocks to ultimately gain insights into volcanic processes and conditions. These include paleoelevation and paleoatmospheric pressure, vesiculation dynamics, magma and lava flow dynamics and eruption styles. In addition, the processes which control bubble growth can be better understood if the volumes, shapes, and other 3-dimensional characteristics of bubbles can be quantified. There are various methods for determining 3D characterizations of vesicularity. We propose to quantify 2D stereological methods so that their applicability to common non-spherical vesicle shapes can be delineated. The main tasks in the work plan will be to: Identify and reanalyze bubble size distribution data (from existing plastic casts); Conduct stereological analysis and CXT on the samples; Develop and apply software for CXT analysis and visualization; Compare CXT results with stereological results on the identified suite of samples. The results of the proposed project should provide useful tools applicable to a variety of scientific problems facing the petrologic research community.",
