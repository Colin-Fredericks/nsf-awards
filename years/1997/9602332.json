 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lewis and Clark College, a predominately undergraduate liberal arts college in Portland, Oregon, is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation of BoDine Hall.  Constructed in 1946, BoDine Hall is home to the Department of Biology.  The current configuration of the aging facility does not readily support research programs in molecular biology, cell biology, population biology and botany.  Funds will be used to consolidate a group of laboratories into modern functional lab suites, creating two large laboratories that will serve three faculty members and their undergraduate research students.  Existing walls that separate spaces into smaller compartments will be removed to create open labs with common spaces and facilities.  A small tissue culture facility will be established, and an underused dark room will be remodeled to serve a shared equipment room.  In conjunction to the renovation effort, funds will be used to replace the Department's dilapidated greenhouse. By increasing opportunities for interaction among students and faculty, the renovated labs will foster an active and collegial research environment.  With the duplication of space and facilities being reduced, available research space will be efficiently utilized.  It is anticipated that a revitalized research environment will appeal to and entice more students to become active researchers, thus promoting the College's mission in science by ensuring that graduates are knowledgeable concerning the methods and ideas of modern science.",
