Under this Program, the  National Science  Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,  the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Office of Naval  Research are jointly  evaluating and supporting research of high priority to the USWRP.        It is well documented that the utility of raw observations  and numerical  model output can be greatly enhanced by statistical  post-processing.  Recent  advances in numerical modeling and the installation of new  observing systems have  created an opportunity and a need to redesign existing  post-processing techniques  and to develop new techniques.   The Principal Investigator will  design, construct,  and test new statistical post-processing procedures that will  capitalize on the  emerging ensemble technology and will minimize the effects of  changes in  operational numerical models on statistical post-processing  procedures.  He will also  construct an advanced observations-based statistical forecasting  system for providing  reliable probabilistic short-term guidance on high-impact weather.   The observations-  based system will capitalize on high-frequency observing platforms  such as  WSR-88D Doppler radars and satellite information.  A primary tool  of the proposed  work will be the application of general additive models that allow  for certain non-  linearities in statistical regression relationships.        It is expected that the resulting techniques will yield  significant lead time  advances in forecasts of sensible weather parameters and provide  much-needed  probabilistic guidance for short-term decision making during  high-impact weather  events.      ***",
