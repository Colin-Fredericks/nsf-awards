 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rosen  9704935       Sulfide corrosion of concrete in wastewater collection  systems occurs when microorganisms in anaerobic films below the  water surface produce hydrogen sulfide.  The sulfide evaporates  into the atmosphere and redissolves in moisture that has  condensed on the portions of the pipe above the wastewater.  Microorganisms in this environment convert the sulfide to  sulfuric acid.  The acid reacts with calcium hydroxide and  calcium carbonate in the cement, producing sulfate minerals and  causing the concrete to corrode.  The investigators develop a  mathematical model of the corrosion process that is tuned,  tested, identified and validated via field data and laboratory  experiment.  The effort includes the analysis of the model  equations (which take the form of a system of coupled partial  differential equations with moving or free boundaries) from the  point of view of well-posedness (existence, uniqueness,  regularity of weak, strong, local, global solutions, etc.) and  the sensitivity of solutions with respect to parameters.  It also  includes the development, analysis and testing of efficient,  convergent and robust numerical integration schemes for numerical  simulation, parameter estimation and control.  In addition to  using available field data to verify the model, a laboratory  test-bed to provide additional data for model verification and  parameter estimation is designed and fabricated.  Electrochemical  techniques applied to instrumented concrete samples are used to  (i) characterize the concrete structures using electrochemical  impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and (ii) sense the diffusion  profiles of corrosive species.  Correlation of the results of  these two studies allows investigation of relationships between  concrete microstructure and diffusion processes.  Computational  schemes are developed to use the field and laboratory data to  identify unmeasurable parameters that appear in the model, and to  test corrosion slowing control schemes based upon the model.        Sulfide corrosion causes millions of dollars in damage in  the U.S. each year.  Attempts have been made to control sulfide  corrosion in sewers.  Most try to prevent the release of hydrogen  sulfide into the pipe atmosphere.  Strong base has been used to  kill the biofilm, and cleaning has been used to remove it.  The  addition of trace metals precipitates the sulfide, preventing its  release to the atmosphere.  However, the biofilms are tenacious,  and grow back rapidly, requiring additional treatment.  Any  anti-biofilm treatment is constrained because it must not damage  the similar microorganisms that are the basis of the wastewater  treatment system.  Chemical precipitation requires continuous  treatment.  Any effort involving chemical addition must contend  with the very large volumes of water flowing through wastewater  collection systems: no matter how cheap the chemical, the  colossal amounts that must be purchased and fed into the system  are expensive.  Thus an effort to first understand and to then  interrupt (i.e. control) the corrosion process is needed, and may  provide the only possible remedy for some cases.  The results of  the study should yield a deeper understanding of the corrosion  process, and provide a powerful tool for engineers to use in the  design of concrete wastewater systems and in the formulation,  testing, tuning and evaluation of corrosion abatement procedures.  The model and results should  guide improvements in protection  techniques where sulfide corrosion is a problem, and provide  insight into the corrosion processes of other concrete structures  and the substantial damage caused.  They could also potentially  reduce maintenance costs.  The modeling ideas developed as a part  of this project should be transferable to other corrosion  problems, and the analytical and computational techniques that  result should be of use in the area of moving boundary problems,  their analysis, numerical solution, identification and control.",
