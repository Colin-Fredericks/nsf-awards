These developments when combined with changing requirements of industry for the capabilities of engineers and different patterns of engineering research, have prompted faculty members at Virginia Tech to propose a four and one half day workshop entitled \"International Workshop on Engineering education Reforms with Emphasis on Electric Power Systems.\" The workshop will be held in Grenoble, France, in December, 1997 and will bring together faculty members and graduate students from universities in the United States, Japan, Korea, Singapore and the Middle East, with representatives of industries, EPRI, ABET, and FEANI to discuss these developments.  Invited presentations have been solicited and proceedings will be issued.  In addition to support from NSF, support from European universities and regions is anticipated.",
