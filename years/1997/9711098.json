 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS9711098 51st Session of ISI, Istanbul  Abstract    The American Statistical Association (ASA), an affiliate of the   International Statistical Institute (ISI), requests funds for   approximately twenty (20) travel grants for the meetings of the 51st   Session of the ISI to be held in Istanbul, Turkey, from August 18-27,   1997.  The ISI holds its biennial meetings in capital cities around the  world, in odd-numbered years.  Of the approximately 500 United States   residents who are members of the ISI, about 60 percent attend the   biennial meeting.  The ISI meeting includes meetings of the Bernoulli   Society for Mathematical Statistics and Probability; the International   Association for Survey Statisticians (IASS); the International   Association for Statistical Computing (IASC); the International   Association for Official Statistics (IAOS); and the International   Association for Statistical Education (IASE) Thus, this will be an   umbrella meeting with sessions of interest for thousands of statisticians.  Further, the meetings bring together individuals from various areas of   statistical research.  Papers cover theoretical statistics and many   areas of application including engineering and the behavioral, social,   physical, and health sciences.  Copies of individual papers are made   available during the meeting and proceedings of the biennial sessions   are published.  Examples of some of the presentations by recipients of   past NSF travel grants include \"The Role of Electronic Communication in  Statistics Education,\" \"Object Oriented Methods in Statistics--  Graphical Construction and Editing of Plots,\" and \"Time Series   Applications in Astronomy and Meteorology.\"    The travel grants will provide partial support to defray transportation  costs for a limited number of individuals, who will be selected by a   committee of ASA members.  Of primary importance to the ASA is the   emphasis placed on encouraging younger statisticians to participate in   the meeting.  ASA proposes to awa rd approximately twenty grants, with   the majority of the funds supporting individuals who received their   Ph.D. in 1988 or later.  The ASA encourages applications from all   qualified individuals, especially women and minorities.  ASA affirms   the policies of the NSF in this regard.",
