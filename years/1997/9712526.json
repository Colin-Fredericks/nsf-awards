 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  objectives  of  this planning  grant  are  to  identify  important  human-interface  design  issues  associated  with  complex  multisensory  interface, to  identify  quantitative  measures  to  assess  performance in environments  that  use  these  interfaces,  and to develop projects  using  advanced  interfaces   in  the  rehabilitation  community.    Possible  applications  include  virtual  reality  therapy,  web-based  quantitative  assessment,  and the  interfacing  of  medical  devices with telecommunications to provide care in the  home  (tele-care).   The methodology will be to explore  potential  advanced  interfaces from a human computer interface  design  perspective  and  also  to explore methods  for  quantifying  performance  in  such  environments.   Two  tasks  will   be  accomplished  during the time frame of the  planning  grant,  assessing interface hardware and designing evaluation tasks.  Theoretical models of the human as an information  processor  can  help  to  approach the evaluation of input  and  output  devices  for  2D and 3D tasks.  A conceptual model  will  be  developed to identify and assess the important parameters of  these  devices.  In particular, the human control loop  will  be  focused  on  to  optimize human  performance.   Advanced  interface devices may include 3D mice, hand/finger trackers,  head  and  eye  trackers,  and  haptic  interfaces.   Haptic  interfaces   are  of  particular  interest   such   as   the  interaction   of   force  and  visual  feedback   on   human  performance.  Classic human performance methods will be used  to  test  the  interface devices.  A test  battery  will  be  developed  to  evaluate the appropriateness of using  simple  tasks  for  assessment of performance.   Measures  of  motor  control  will be tested using a movement time task based  on  Fitts law and classic teleoperator tasks such as \"peg in the  hole\" will be used to test manipulation capabilities of  the  interface devices.",
