 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Colorado State University to acquire two state-of-the-art NMR  consoles to upgrade existing 300 MHz NMR Spectrometers and retrofit the AC consoles to  upgrade the IBM WP-270 MHz NMR. This equipment will enhance research in a number of  areas including the following: (1) metallobiochemistry of co-enzyme B12-dependent  ribonucleotide reductase, (2) development of methodology for synthesis of modified  oligonucleotides, (3) synthesis of unnatural nucleoside   analogs based on cyclobutenone  chemistry, (4) formamidines and other chiral carbanions, (5) synthesis and application of highly  fluorinated weakly coordinating anions, (6) quinocarcin mechanism of DNA cleavage and (7)  bioorganic and bioinorganic chemistry of vanadium and phosphorous.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.",
