 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to explain how the characteristics of research organizations,  and their departments and laboratories, facilitate or hinder the making of major discoveries in  biomedical science.  The project focuses on four types of research organizations (universities,  free-standing research institutes, medical centers and industrial firms) in three countries (Britain,  France and Germany) during the past century.  Drawing on a four-year pilot study of U.S. research organizations, the investigators  propose that the following organizational characteristics are critical for making major  discoveries: diversity and depth of scientific expertise, quality of scientific personnel,  differentiation of research into separate departments, integration of scientific diversity,  hierarchical coordination, and leadership capacity for effecting the necessary integration.  The  central insight is that major discoveries tend to occur in organizations that facilitate intense and  frequent interaction across diverse fields of knowledge.  By extending the research to Europe, the investigators can test the validity of findings  from the U.S. pilot study in contexts that offer considerable variation along the major  dimensions of the proposed theory.  To test the theory the project will rely on Qualitative  Comparative Analysis, a method that systematically examines the logical interrelationships  among categorical variables.    The project addresses two central problems in the organization of science: how might  research organizations be structured to facilitate major discoveries and how can organizations  change to accommodate changes in scientific knowledge?  The project also builds intellectual  connections between the literature on organizations and research in the history and sociology of  science, suggesting new avenues for investigation.",
