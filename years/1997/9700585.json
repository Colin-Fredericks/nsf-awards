 "awd_abstract_narration": "Banuelos   9700585   The Principle Investigator will  investigate  several concrete open problems in    different areas of analysis where probabilistic ideas and techniques have already had   considerable success and where he believes further progress is possible. These include 1)   applications of martingale inequalities to investigate the  operator  norm of the Beurling-  Ahlfors operators in two and several dimensions, 2) the use of Brownian motions to   investigate sharp bounds for the fundamental frequency and fundamental gap of the   Laplacian in Euclidean domains, and 3) the use of asymptotic expansions for Wiener   functionals to investigate the asymptotic expansion in the trace of Schrodinger operators   and  how the signs of the coefficients in such  expansion depend on the sign of the   potential.    Probability Theory has its roots in various fields of applied sciences and hence it should   not be surprising that modern stochastic analysis draws many of its technical tools from   several distinct areas of mathematics.  What is often far from  obvious  is that probabilistic   ideas and techniques can be effectively used to investigate problems and applications   which on the surface do not seem to be related to probability at all. The problems   discussed above fall in this category.  The Beurling-Ahlfors operators are (singular)    integral operators which describe regularity (smoothness) properties of solutions to   various nonlinear  equations arising from, among other topics, elasticity.  The computation   of their operator norms is a fundamental problem with many applications.  On the surface   this operator  appears to be very far from probability.  The Principal Investigator, in   collaboration with G. Wang and A. J. Lindeman, has successfully used the theory of   martingales (fair games) to study this problem.  The first part of the project describes   various new probabilistic approaches for further work in this direction.  Bounds  on the   fundamental frequency and fundament al gap of the Laplacian operator are basic quantities   in the theory of vibrating membranes. The trace of Schrodinger operators plays a   fundamental role in  various problems in mathematical physics related to, among other   things, scattering theory. Here, too, the connection to probability is not transparent. In the   second part of the project the PI proposes to use the theory of Brownian motion and   stochastic calculus to investigate several open problems in this areas. It is expected that   these investigations will lead, as it has happened many times in the past, to new and   surprising applications of probability to analysis, geometry, partial differential equations,   and the application of these subjects to mathematical physics. Several students will most   likely participate in these investigations.",
