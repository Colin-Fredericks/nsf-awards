The ease with  which we perceive 3-D layout and carry out visually-guided  navigation belies the underlying complexity of these tasks.  The  primary stimulus information for determining scene layout is  binocular disparity (the differences in the two eyes' images  which creates the sensation of depth seen in, for example, the  Magic Eye Stereograms) and motion parallax (differences in the  speeds at which images stream across the retina when a person  moves the head).  Binocular disparity and motion parallax are  provided in retinal coordinates, but the positions and  orientations of surfaces must generally be determined in body-  centered coordinates in order to guide appropriate actions of the  limbs and torso.  Similarly, the information needed to judge the  direction of an object's motion (or one's own motion) is  contained in the changing pattern of light falling on the  retinas, but motion direction must generally be estimated  relative to the body in order to be useful in guiding motor  responses to objects in the scene.  This research will examine  how comparisons of the two eyes' images are used to determine  surface orientation and curvature and to determine the direction  of an object's motion.    This research will be important to our understanding of human  space perception, but it may well also have practical  consequences.  First, biological systems have evolved robust  mechanisms for estimating surface orientation, shape, and  position and for estimating object velocity.  A better  understanding of how biological systems perform may lead to  better algorithms for mobile robotic systems.  Second, the  perception of an object's motion relative to the self is crucial  for action, including the control of a motor vehicle.  Thus, a  better understanding could lead to improved procedures fo r  assessing driving and flying capability.  Third, a better  understanding of the retinal and extra-retinal information used  in the perception of 3D layout and motion may well aid  construction of virtual reality displays.    ***",
