 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, extends  Professor Grassian's earlier research work on surface photochemistry into the field of oxide  surfaces.  During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, thermal and photo-driven  chemistry on oxide surfaces will be examined using techniques ranging from infrared and  optical spectroscopy on high surface area powders to electron spectroscopic studies of single  crystal samples.  The interaction of nitrous oxide with zirconia surfaces forms one focus of  the project.  The interaction of small molecules of atmospheric importance with model  mineral aerosol surfaces will also be explored.  Results of these basic studies will be of  interest in developing an understanding of catalytic and environmental processes occurring on  oxide surfaces.  Light-driven surface reactions are of interest in a variety of technical applications.  For  example, the reaction of nitrous oxide on zirconia surfaces may be of importance in the  environmentally benign synthesis of synthetic fiber precursors.  The basic research supported  in this project addresses the detailed mechanisms of surface photochemical reactions such as  this one.  In addition, small molecule reactions on model mineral aerosol surfaces will be  examined, with possible application in our developing understanding of tropospheric  mechanisms of air pollution generation.",
