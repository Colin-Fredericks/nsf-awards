 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at research and development of a new formaldehyde detector using recently introduced antimonide based near infrared diode lasers operating in the 2   3 micron region. The targeted specifications are a sensitivity of 0.1 part per million and an accuracy of 10% (at 1 ppm) for real time (1 second response time) measurement of formaldehyde in combustor exhaust. This sensor technology is readily adaptable for high sensitivity measurement of other key combustion pollutants including CO and NO. As a known carcinogen and contributor to air pollution (especially in urban air), formaldehyde emissions from automotive exhaust are now regulated in California. Formaldehyde emissions from combustors in electric power plants and municipal incinerators are also being targeted for regulation. In Phase I, the feasibility of the proposed diode laser based formaldehyde monitor will be demonstrated by constructing a prototype sensor and measuring trace concentrations of formaldehyde in turbulent combustor exhaust. The formaldehyde detection sensitivity in the combustor exhaust will be determined and the feasibility of commercially developing such a sensor will be evaluated.  Direct commercial applications of the research are expected to include improved instrumentation for real time measurement of numerous pollutant gases, including formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide. Additional applications include toxic gas detection for gases used in semiconductor fabrication.",
