 "awd_abstract_narration": "OPP 9615252  Ashworth    Abstract    The Meyer Desert Formation crops out in the Oliver Bluffs region  of the Dominion Range in the central Transantarctic Mountains,  latitude 85 degrees South, about 500 km from the South Pole.  The  site is on the Beardmore Glacier near the margin of the Polar  Plateau.  The polar desert climate is too cold and too dry to  support higher forms of life.  This award support studies of  fossils that will be extracted from siltstones containing wood,  and from peat and marl deposits discovered in 1995.  Fossils  discovered in earlier studies include: pollen, wood, and leaves  of Nothofagus (southern beech), seeds of 4 species of vascular  plants, stems and leaves of mosses, leg parts of a flightless  beetle, valves of ostracodes, shells of gastropods and bivalves,  and a fish tooth.  A cushion of a woody vascular plant in its  original growth position demonstrates that the fossil assemblage  is in situ and not transported to the site.  The diverse  organisms represented by the fossils lived at latitude 85 degrees  South during a time when the Antarctic ice sheets were smaller.  Stratigraphic evidence suggests an environment that included a  lake with vegetation-covered moraines, near a glacier margin.  There is a question of how warm temperatures were at the site.  Studies of the Nothofagus fossils suggest a harsh climate at the  limits of plant growth.  That interpretation, however, does not  agree with the diversity of organisms represented by fossils.  Also, the occurrence of fish in the lake indicates that it did  not freeze to the bottom.  The Magellanic Moorland of southern  South America, with a mean annual temperature of at least 23  degrees Celsius higher than the Oliver Bluffs location today, is  a possible analog for the paleoenvironment.  Biogeographically,  the organisms also seem to have closer evolutionary links with  southern South America.  Based on 250 kg of sediments collected  at the site in 1995, a series of paleontological and geochemical  s tudies will be undertaken to determine how warm the climate was.    The question of when these organisms inhabited the Beardmore  Valley is very important to answer because of the question of  stability of the ice sheets.  The best estimate for the age of  the sediments is Pliocene based on transported marine diatoms.  This implies that the existing configuration of the Antarctic ice  sheets is a relatively recent feature, developing during the  Quaternary.  Other evidence from Antarctica and the Southern  Ocean suggests that the polar ice sheets are much older and that  the landscapes of the Dry Valleys region have not changed much  since the Miocene.  The Pliocene is known for its globally high  sea levels and warmer climates in the Arctic.  Did this warming  cause a major disintegration of the Antarctic ice sheets during  the Pliocene or did they remain stable?  This question is  especially important to answer in regard to our present concerns  about global warming.  The Pliocene age that has been assigned to  the Meyer Desert Formation, with its in situ fossils of  terrestrial organisms indicating much warmer conditions, is  critical to this question.  The age needs to be confirmed and a  series of exploratory projects will be undertaken to attempt to  date the deposits using the biostratigraphy of the fossils of  terrestrial organisms, amino acid analysis of the gastropod and  bivalve shells, and argon/argon analysis of crystals growing  inside the seeds.    The fossils are very important to test hypotheses about Southern  Hemisphere biogeography.  These hypotheses have attempted to  explain the distribution of related organisms between South  America, Australasia, the Subantarctic Islands, and Antarctica  but until now they have been untestable because of an absence of  Neogene terrestrial fossil data.",
