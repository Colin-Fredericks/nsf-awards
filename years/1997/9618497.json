 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry  program, Professor Clark Landis of the University of   Wisconsin, Madison will  undertake the development of new computational   and experimental tools for elucidation of solution structures of   organometallic molecules.  Valence bond, molecular mechanics and ensemble   calculations will be used to model transition-metal catalysts and their   reaction pathways.  2D NMR studies will be used to correlate the   theoretical models with the structures and reactivities of the molecules   in solution.        New methods for the determination of structures of transition metal   organometallic molecules in solution will be studied.  The computational   methods developed will allow for the determination of structures using   molecular mechanics methods that are specifically tailored to include   parameters for transition metals.  While such calculations are widely   used for small organic molecules and proteins, the inclusion of   transition metals requires the development of new parameters to describe   the force fields around the metal atoms.   Consequently, these   calculations are still emerging in their ability to computationally model   the structures of organometallic molecules.  Algorithms derived from this   work will be made readily accessible to other researchers, who are   expected to use them to understand catalytic activity and shape   interactions involving transition metal ions.",
