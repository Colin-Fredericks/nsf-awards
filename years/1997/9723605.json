 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723605  Zeiger    This research proposal focuses on blue light perception and transduction in guard cells, and its role in   stomatal function.  Guard cells sense internal and external signals in the leaf environment and integrate   them into regulated stomatal apertures that control leaf gas exchange.  The blue light response of guard   cells belongs to a large family of blue light responses which are central to plant adaptations and   acclimations to their environment. The identity of the chromophore(s) mediating blue light sensing in   higher plants remains unknown.  Recent work with hy4 and nph1, two Arabidopsis mutants for blue light-  dependent inhibition of stem elongation and phototropism, has provided evidence for a flavoprotein   mediating blue light photoreception.  Both mutants however are reported to have normal stomatal   responses to blue light, indicating that guard cells might have a distinct blue light photoreceptor.  Recent studies have identified the carotenoid, zeaxanthin, as a  putative blue light photoreceptor in guard   cells.  The blue light sensitivity of guard cells increases with their zeaxanthin content, and inhibition of   zeaxanthin formation by dithiothreitol (DTT), inhibits blue light-dependent stomatal opening, without   altering opening stimulated by guard cell photosynthesis.. In the proposed experiments, the blue light   responses of guard cells from wild type Arabidopsis leaves will be characterized, and compared with that   of the zeaxanthin-less mutant, npq1.  This mutant has a defective violaxanthin de-epoxidase and is unable   to accumulate zeaxanthin.  Since the de-epoxidase gene appears to be a single copy gene, it is anticipated   that npq1 guard cells will also lack zeaxanthin.  We have recently confirmed that guard cells from npq1   are devoid of zeaxanthin. Gas exchange experiments with intact wild type and npq1 leaves will be used to   establish whether Arabidopsis stomata have a typical response to blue light and whether the response has   been  altered by the lack of zeaxanthin in npq1.  Guard cells in enzymatically cleaned epidermis will be   used to study the stomatal response to blue light in isolated guard cells.  Initial experiments have just   shown that npq1 guard cells fail to open in response to blue light under a red light background. If detailed   studies support this initial funding,  the mutant will be used to test whether the inhibitor of zeaxanthin   formation, DTT can mimic the genetic lesion in npq1. Other experiments will investigate a possible role   of Ca2+ as a second  messenger transducing blue light sensing at the guard cell chloroplast to a H+   ATPase at the guard cell plasma membrane.  Patch clamp experiments in the whole cell configuration will   be used to measure blue light-induced electrical currents at the guard cell plasma membrane, over a range   of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations shown to alter proton pumping activity in guard cells.  Isolated guard   cell chloroplasts will be used to test whether blue light elicits Ca2+ fluxes across the chloroplast envelope   that could account for in vivo changes in cytosolic  Ca2+ concentrations.  We will also investigate   whether transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the Ca2+ indicator, aequorin, can be used to   characterize Ca2+ fluxes between the chloroplast and the cytosol. The proposed research has significant   potential for the conclusive identification of a blue light photoreceptor in guard cells and a mutant for   stomatal responses to blue light, and for the detailed characterization of the sensory transducing cascade   of an important blue light response.    Plants perceive light in several wavelengths that control growth, orientation and development. Blue light   perception and how it is signaled to mediate downstream effects has been a controversy. At the heart of   the controversy is what pigment absorbs the perceived light and transmits the information downstream.   Dr. Zeiger has obtained mutants of the pigment zeaxanthin synthesis and the mu tants exhibit effects that   indicate that this pigment is responsible for perceiving blue light. With this award Dr. Zeiger will use   mutant and wild type plants to analyze how zeaxanthin blue light photoreception signals opening response   of guard cells mediating gas exchange in leaves. Other studies will focus on how zeaxanthin   photoreception induces calcium fluxes in cells that mediate intracellular signaling. This research is   important because it addresses one of the most basic aspects of how plants function by responding to light   in its environment.    ***",
