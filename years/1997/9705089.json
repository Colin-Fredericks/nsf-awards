 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brattkus  9705089    The goal of the proposed research is to develop and analyze asymptotic  models which describe the spreading of thin solid films on solid   substrates. Models are based upon a slender-body approximation  that is valid for rapidly spreading films which nearly wet the underlying   substrate. The asymptotic technique has been tested on a simple model   of liquid phase epitaxy where the dominant mechanism of film growth is   solidification. Approximate solutions representing steady planar   spreading have been compared to numerical solutions of the exact problem.  We find that the boundary conditions at a contact line may be applied  directly to the asymptotic equations describing the spreading film   even though the slender-body approximation is not valid there (this is due   to the presence of a weak gradient singularity). For steadily spreading  films these contact angle conditions select the spreading rate.  The asymptotic equations are used to test the linear stability of a   planar film and it is found to be stable.    The technology behind thin film deposition is of principal importance  to the development of new and more compact semiconductor devices.  Moreover, this technology is unusual in that it is extremely sensitive   to frontier research in materials science. We propose to  examine the conditions that are applied at a tri-junction between a solid   film, its nutrient phase, and its substrate, and determine the role that   these contact conditions play in influencing the rate of growth and the   morphology of spreading solid films. Our preliminary results suggest  that contact conditions significantly influence both. A basic knowledge  of the connection between the contact conditions and the growth and  morphology of thin solid films will aid in controlling the deposition  process.",
