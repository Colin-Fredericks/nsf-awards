 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to develop and implement an innovative, introductory-level (second year) multidisciplinary course on The Social Dimensions of Science geared specifically for prospective SEM researchers and teachers who have strong science and math backgrounds. The course will be designed to accomplish two primary objectives: 1) help students become aware that science does not occur within a vacuum, but operates within a context that is shaped by a complex array of factors relating to societal, cultural, political, economic and personal aspects; and 2) provide this awareness through a curriculum that provides traditional academic instruction and a \"field experience\" in which students relate these factors to work by active scientists, as well as to the scientists' personal experiences. The course will involve an interdisciplinary examination of various aspects, as well as a field project in which students link the academic content with the real, going scientific/technological practice of scientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Through such linkage, they will gain an appreciation of how science operates in a \"real world\" context and be more effectively prepared for the scientific and technical environments of the future.  The Social Dimensions course seeks to address the limitations of typical undergraduate SEM curricula, which seek primarily to impart a disciplinary-based foundation and technical skills, but do not prepare students for the real world in which science has a history, functions in relation to society's values and activities, derives its support from patrons who perceive its product as beneficial, and is carried out by individual human beings who are absorbed and preoccupied by their work and who operate within or against socially-mediated \"paradigms.\" While most universities, including Stony Brook, have general education requirements intended to broaden students' perspectives, they tend to offer a spectrum of choices from which science students rarely find courses tha t fill their need to understand their own discipline. The proposed course seeks to fill this gap. The course is innovative in its establishment of partnerships with scientists outside of the university to serve as teachers and role models. In its emphasis on social issues, its should be especially beneficial to women and minority members. Moreover, since all of the BNL scientists are women, the students will gain insight into the unique position of women in SEM environments and into ways successful women have responded or accommodated themselves to these environments.   Other related objects are: 1) to train a cadre of Stony Brook faculty and BNL scientists in key disciplines (SEM, Philosophy, Political Science, Sociology, History) who endorse the interdisciplinary thrust of the proposed course, are knowledgeable of the issues being addressed by it, and are capable and committed to teaching it; 2) to foster and facilitate ongoing collaborative teaching and mentoring arrangements with scientists at BNL and other regional research/development establishments in ways that use their unique perspectives and personal histories and enrich the scientists' experiences as well as those of the students; and 3) to create a model, using a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach, that can be readily integrated into the regular Stony Brook SEM curriculum and replicated or adapted for SEM students at other universities.",
