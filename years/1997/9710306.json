Unfortunately, there are few  examples of such quantitative correlations for the case of  glasses and amorphous materials.  Therefore, to strengthen the  link between the structure and propertieslperformance a first  meeting of glass researchers from universities, industry and  govemment laboratories is proposed with the purpose of  establishing the practical implications of glass structure.  This  Conference will be organized under the auspices of the University  Conference on Glass Science series to take advantage of its well  established structure and low costs.  It is endorsed by the  American Ceramic Society and partially supported by industry.  Students and young researchers will be particularly encouraged to  participate in this interdisciplinary activity by offering them  scholarships.  The new information presented and generated at the  Conference will be published in the most widely read archival  Joumal on the subject.  %%%  This conference will attempt to to draw closer linkage between  research on the structure of glasses and the properties that  result from that structure.  It will be held at Lehigh  University, Bethlehem, PA on June 17-20, 1997.  ***",
