 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  96-61025  Mroz     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project will investigate a new family of ternary carbide compounds which have initially shown an interesting combination of ceramic and metallic characteristics. These materials exhibit a set of characteristics that blends the ductility, shock resistance and  machinability of metals with the refractoriness, oxidation resistance and strength of ceramics. These new compositions have been initially evaluated, however they have not been reproduced elsewhere. In order to learn more about these materials, and at the same time, further evaluate structure/properties relationships, a research program based on compositional variations is suggested. The project will evaluate the specific lattice sites within the structure as they relate to the material characteristics by exchanging specific elements with related elements. This will provide changes in atomic size and or valence potential. The formation of extensive solid solutions in this composition range, which will allow for determination of characteristics as they relate to changes made in atomic composition is anticipated. These materials will be characterized and compared to earlier work from the original  researchers responsible for discovering these materials. In addition, the project will  begin to evaluate and prioritize commercial opportunities for this material as they relate to the properties and characteristics obtained from sample materials.   Applications for this family of materials are expected to be wide ranging.  Early analysis suggests that replacement for graphite parts will be a large market that can be satisfied by the improved electrical and wear performance of these materials.  Other applications might include electrodes, heaters, seals and wear parts, and engine components.  The total value of the markets that may be serviced by this material is quite large due to the pervasive nature of the technology.  ***",
