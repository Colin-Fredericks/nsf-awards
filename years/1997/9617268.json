 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)   award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program   and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Office of Multidisciplinary   Activities (MPS/OMA) supports research by Professor Richard D. Ernst of   the Department of Chemistry of the University of Utah to investigate the   catalytic properties of pentadienyl and cyclopentadienyl compounds of   titanium and zirconium.  Fundamental chemical structures, such as agostic   interactions, which may lead to selective C-C bond formation and   cleavage, will be studied.  Edged bridged pentadienyl complexes, which   will be prepared, are seen as precursors for metal film depositions,   material syntheses and complexes with the metals in higher oxidation   states.  Studies will also be done on the configurational stability of   chiral complexes.  Complexes with cyclopentadienyl and edge-bridged   pentadienyl ligands will be investigated in collaboration with the Dow   Chemical Co. as catalysts for olefin polymerization.            Under the GOALI program this academic/industrial collaboration will   provide graduate students with experience in moving new catalysts they   have developed into an industrial trial.  Organometallic complexes of   titanium and zirconium will be investigated as catalysts, coupling   reagents and materials precursors.   Complexes with cyclopentadienyl and   edge-bridged pentadienyl ligands will be investigated in collaboration   with the Dow Chemical Co. as catalysts for lengthening hydrocarbon   chains.  As part of its committment under the GOALI program, Dow will   provide materials, facilities, and personnel to adapt the process to   industrial reactor conditions.  Dow will also cover travel costs for Dr.   Ernst and his students involved in the project as well as stipend   expenses for the visiting graduate students.",
