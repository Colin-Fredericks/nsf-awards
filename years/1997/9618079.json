 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rational choice models of elections predict that candidates adopt similar, centrist platforms in order to win elections.  While this theoretical finding is very robust, it has received very little empirtical support.  This is particularly true for research on congressional elections.  This project is developing a theory to explain candidates' position taking during congressional election campaigns.  The theory predicts that candidates will diverge significantly on election day due to the polarizing effects of primary elections and limits on changes in policy positions -- both of which have been ignored by earlier spatial models.  To evaluate this model, candidates' locations are operationalized using NOMINATE, a well-known statistical procedure based on spatial theory.  This measure is validated with Political Action Committee (PAC) contribution data by examining which types of PACs donate to candidates.  Both types of data have temporal components that produce estimates for candidates over time.  The new measures improve previous ones as they can be estimates for both incumbents and challengers.  Finally, these measures test predictions derived from the theoretical  model.",
