 "awd_abstract_narration": "Augsburg College's Physics Department has a long-standing research program and a strong record of preparing undergraduates for graduate study in physics and engineering.  As strong as this research and educational effort has been and continues to be, it is significantly hindered by the inadequacy of space for advanced laboratories used for research and research training activities.  Space used for research is scattered and suffers from general deterioration and inadequate electrical, cooling and ventilation systems,  limiting the effectiveness of the department's research program.  To remedy this situation and further strengthen the education impact of physics research, Augsburg College, with assistance from the National Science Foundation will renovate the ground floor of Science Hall for the department.  Constructed in 1948, the facility with its deficient plumbing, HVAC and electrical systems cannot support state of the art experimental work.  Current configuration does not comply with ADA regulations, thus limiting access to physical challenged individuals who are interested in conducting research.  By consolidating the department in one location, faculty will be able to perform research in Magnetospheric, Heliospheric, Atmospheric and Atomic, Molecular and Optical physics in a conducive environment.  Enhanced research opportunities will assure the professional capability of faculty and encourage collaborative approaches to physics research.  Increase training opportunities will be available for more students who envision a career in the discipline.",
