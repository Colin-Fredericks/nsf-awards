 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Laurence Bartram and Paola Villa will conduct three seasons of archaeological/paleontological research at the cave site of Bois Roche which is located in the Charente region of France. Based on previous work the investigators have determined that it served as a den for hyenas during the last Ice Age. In addition to large amounts of bone, it contains hyena coprolites and juvenile hyena bones. Although a few worked stone artifacts are also present, it appears that humans played a negligible role in the faunal accumulation. The goal of the research is to excavate a large faunal sample with fine scale horizontal control and develop criteria which serve to characterize a hyena derived faunal assemblage. The team will:  test the hypothesis that significant spatial patterning exists in hyena-generated bone accumulations; develop methods to distinguish bone tools from hyena-gnawed bone; evaluate current methods for quantifying archaeofaunal bone assemblages;  determine whether hominids occupied the cave at other periods of time; and provide training for American and French archaeology students. Analyses will include comprehensive study of taxonomic, skeletal part, bone modification, and examination of spatial data including conjoining. Sedimentological and palynological analyses will elucidate site formation processes and electron spin resonance dating will be conducted on tooth enamel.  The earliest evidence for human occupation of caves in Europe dates to over 100,000 years ago and stratified caves with abundant stone tools and faunal remains have played a crucial role in archaeological investigations. Through analysis of food remains researchers can gain insight into prehistoric diet, hunting ability and spatial organization of activities. However the problem arises since caves are often alternatively occupied by humans and other species such as hyena and cave bear. It is surprisingly difficult to assign faunal remains unambiguously to collector species and to gain information on human behavior it is necessary to do so.  Bois Roche is one of the few cave sites in Europe where one can be reasonably that hyenas are the responsible agent. Through their research Dr. Bartram and Villa can determine what constitutes a `hyena signature` and the criteria they develop can be employed by archaeologists not only in Europe but also in other parts of the world.",
