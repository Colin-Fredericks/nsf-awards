 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of a matrix assisted laser desorption ionization  time-of-flight mass spectrometer is supported by the Analytical and  Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities.  Professor Hercules and his students at Vanderbilt  University will use this instrument to study problems such as the  characterization of diverse polymer systems, the rapid qualitative  and quantitative analysis of thin-layer chromatography plates, the  quantitative analysis of FKBP binding proteins to better understand  its role in calcium homeostasis, and the detection of aflatoxins.   This instrument is central to this research program and it will  replace a failing fifteen year old instrument.  A replacement mass spectrometer is being purchased with the  capability of doing highly sensitive and selective analysis of  complex organic and biological materials.  The materials being  studied cover a wide range of polymers and include important  biological compounds such as the binding protein FKBP and the  highly toxic aflatoxin B1.  A very broad range of applications and  methods of analysis will be developed using this instrument.   Important components of this mass spectrometer include matrix  assisted laser desorption ionization sample introduction and time-  of-flight mass analysis.",
