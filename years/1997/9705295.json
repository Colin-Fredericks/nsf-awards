The  discovery that the phase diagram of mixtures of 3He and  4He  is  radically altered by a low density aerogel medium was rapidly  followed by studies of pure 3He in aerogel. These studies  reveal  that  the phase diagram of the superfluid phases is substantially  modified, altering the stability of the A and B phases as well as  creating  a  new  normal-to-superfluid transition  even  at  zero  temperature.  The role of aerogel as a collection  of  impurities  introduced  into the superfluid will be explored by altering  the  density and correlations of the aerogel. The PIs will also  study  effects  of  other disordered porous media on the  quantum  phase  diagrams.  Experimental  tools include  NMR,  heat  capacity  and  ultrasound   in  addition  to  sound  and  torsional   oscillator  measurements  to  characterize the nature of the superfluid.  The  PIs will design new aerogels specifically tailored for studies of  superfluid 3He and mixtures of 3He and 4He. Very low temperatures  will  in  many instances be critical for the exploration  of  the  phase diagram of pure 3He.  %%%  This  Focused  Research  Group  grant  supports  a  comprehensive  experimental and theoretical study of the effects of atomic-scale  disorder  on  the nature of quantum-mechanical states,  including  superfluid   states,   which  are  preferred  by  liquid   helium  (isotopes  of  mass three and four atomic units) at  temperatures  close to absolute zero. Superfluids flow with no resistance  from  the  surrounding  medium or container. In the  case  of  electron  superfluids,  i.e.,   superconductors  such  as  lead  below  its  transition temperature, this means electrical current  flow  with  no  resistance. Superfluid states a re found in nature  in  helium  isotopes  and  electron  systems at  low  temperatures,  and  are  believed  to  taken on by neutrons in neutron stars.  Superfluids  permit  classes  of  electronic  devices  called  Superconducting  Quantum Interference Devices (SQUID's) which are the world's most  sensitive  detectors  of  magnetic field.  SQUID's  are  used  in  advanced  medical practice in commercial electrocardiographs  and  magneto-   encephalographs,  which  permit,  respectively,   non-  invasive  detection  of  heart and mental  disorders.  Superfluid  helium  put into rotation acts like a gyroscope: it has  recently  been  demonstrated that such a gyroscope will allow detection  of  rotation  at an unprecedented level of sensitivity. The  research  carried out under the present grant explores the effects of  atom  scale disorder on such superfluid states, and may have beneficial  effects on technology involving sensor devices as mentioned,  and  more  broadly,  even  to include present and future  versions  of  microelectronic computer technology.  ***",
