 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award form the Synthetic Organic Program will support a series of   three annual `workshops on Organic Synthesis and Natural Products   Chemistry.`  These workshops have the dual purpose of (1) providing an   effective forum for informal discussion among young industrial and   academic scientists on current research in topical areas of  organic   synthesis and natural products, and(2) assisting the Program staff in   identifying emerging areas and researchers.  This process, in turn, will   aid the Program in long-range planning.The specific goals of the   workshops include:1) Providing an environment for the dynamic exchange of   ideas in organic synthesis and natural products chemistry among a small   group (about 20) of active young researchers in these fields. 2)    Encouraging an attitude of cooperation among individuals working in   related areas, and thereby, avoiding duplicative efforts.3)  Stimulating   participants to study new problems  and methods in synthetic and natural   products chemistry.4)  Creating an atmosphere in which the scientific and   social interaction among participants will be both stimulating and   pleasant.",
