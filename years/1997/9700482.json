The  project  will  concentrate  on  doped silicon, but will  include  work  on  quasicrystals and perovskites. Three complementary spectroscopies  will   be  used.  First,  previous  work  on  electron  tunneling  measurements  of the single-particle density of  states  will  be  extended  down  to  0.1K and to more insulating materials,  where  observation  of  strong  interaction effects  such  as  multiple-  electron  excitations  and spin correlations  will  be  possible.  Second,  noise  spectroscopy will be pursued to characterize  the  random  charge  fluctuations in disordered  solids..  Third,  the  finite frequency electrical conductivity will be measured through  the  microwave  regime (0.05 to 20 GHz) in  order  to  probe  the  transport  density  of  states.  This  frequency  range   is   of  particular interest because some existing DC conductivity results  suggest the presence of a correlation gap of width 8 to 12 GHz.  %%%  This  experimental  research  project  uses  three  complementary  techniques  to  study the effects of the  Coulomb forces  between  electrons, and between electrons and charged impurities,  on  the  conduction  behavior  of disordered electronic  conductors,  with  some  emphasis on the important semiconductor silicon. Electrical  conduction  in  silicon results in part from dopant  atoms  which  contribute a free carrier, and in this process the impurity  site  also  becomes  charged. The random distribution  of  the  charged  impurity  sites  alters the motion of the free carriers  in  ways  that  are  of  interest  in  this study. Experimental  techniques  include   electron   tunneling  spectroscopy,  electrical   noise  measurement,  and  finite  frequency  conductivity  measurements.  Results  from  this research may include unusual new  effects  or  m aterials  which  may  find new application in  technology.  This  research project is interdisciplinary in nature and involves both  graduate  and  undergraduate students  who  will  be  excellently  trained to enter positions in industry, government or education.  ***",
