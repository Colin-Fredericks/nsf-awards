 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  96-60079  Owen     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is feasibility study of a proposed Coastal Ocean Processes Sensor (COPS) array of fiber-optics linked sensors.  COPS uses video holography and wavelet-transform optical correlation to record and analyze ocean particulates.  COPS integrates a number of small, rugged sensors and, once deployed, sensors can be added.  Each sensor can be relocated within the reach of its fiber link.  Detailed characterization of particulates is central to understanding the subsea environment.  COPS measures particulates at a variety of scattered sites with a collection of holographic sensors linked to a central data processing unit on shore.  The objective of the research is to build and test a breadboard COPS sensor and fiber links.  Each COPS sensor records a 3-D field of particulates for wavelet analysis and classification.  By the end of Phase I, there will be a detailed COPS design. Workers will record video holograms of particulates through fibers to show hardware feasibility.  They will use wavelet processing to analyze mass and fluid transport and show software feasibility.  The next phase of the research will include sea trials.   The commercial applications of this Coastal Ocean Processes Sensor, include studies of marine aggregate particle dynamics; these dynamics involve biological processes and mechanisms, as well as the chemical/physical processes that affect aggregation.  Other applications include environmental surveying, aquaculture, ocean waste disposal monitoring, engineering turbidity, mine tailing monitoring, and underwater lidar.  Government applications include a variety of naval coastal sensors.  ***",
