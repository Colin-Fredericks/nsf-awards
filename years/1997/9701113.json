 "awd_abstract_narration": "The career development plan outlined in this proposal focuses on the   integration of the research and teaching objectives of the principal   investigator.  The research project addresses a number of important issues in the    design and interconnection of optical networks.  The ultimate goal of the proposed work is to develop viable solutions   for a seamless nationwide all-optical network infrastructure.  The educational component includes development of graduate-level   courses on all-optical networking and on internetwork architectures   and protocols, integration of topics on lightwave technology in    existing graduate and undergraduate introductory network courses, and   active involvement of undergraduate students in network projects.    In an all-optical network using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM),   information is transmitted as optical signals throughout the path from   source to destination.  By using multiple concurrent channels, each on a different wavelength,   WDM has the potential to exploit the enormous information-carrying   capacity of fiber and deliver an aggregate throughput that is several   orders of magnitude higher than it is possible today.  Given the installed base of optical fiber, and the maturing of optical   component technologies, it appears that current network technologies   will eventually evolve to an all-optical infrastructure.  The deployment of such an infrastructure will cater to the needs of   emerging bandwidth-intensive applications.  However, large scale interconnection of optical networks raises a   number of fundamental and challenging problems that require novel and   innovative solutions.  As part of his career development plan, the principal investigator    proposes to address a number of these issues, including multiple   access in broadcast-and-select WDM networks, traffic scheduling of   unicast and multicast traffic, interconnection of photonic local area   networks, architectural issues in wavelength routed backbone networks,   dist ributed control, and issues related to the interaction among   subnetwork and backbone protocols.  Our work is expected to further our understanding of the   characteristics of optical networks, and to provide insight on how to   overcome some of the limitations of the technology.  The objective is to produce an analytical framework that will make it   possible to evaluate alternative architectures and protocols.",
