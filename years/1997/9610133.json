 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to conduct an experimental and theoretical investigation into the behavior and design of concrete beams reinforced with three-dimensional (3-D) prefabricated fiber reinforced plastic spatial reinforcement cages.  3-D spatial reinforcement cages, most conveniently fabricated from pultruded grating components, will require innovative research in the areas of manufacturing, design, modeling, analysis and construction economics.  Based on results of a recently conducted pilot study it appears that 3-D FRP reinforced beams have significant structural potential due to their ability to fail progressively in a pseudo-ductile manner.  They also appear to have significant construction potential due to their prefabricated industrialized manufacturing that could yield construction cost saving because of reduced labor costs.  The research will focus on the following items:  Development of new integrated 3-D FRP pultruded reinforcement cages, characterization of mechanical properties of 3-D pultruded reinforcement cages, optimization of elements for 3-D reinforcement cages, design and analysis of concrete beams reinforced with 3-D FRP cages, and a study of the construction productivity and economic benefits of the use of 3-D FRP cages.",
