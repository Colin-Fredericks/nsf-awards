 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a career development plan that incorporates a balance  of research and educational activities.  The principal area of research  proposed is lossless image compression.  The goal is to develop lossless  image compression techniques that integrate lossy and lossless compression  in a single frame-work, providing state-of-the-art lossy and lossless  compression.  Such techniques will be of great value for specific  applications like teleradiology and the World-Wide-Web, and for  applications in ``network-centric'' computing in general.  Part of this  research will involve collaborative activity of an international nature.    Also proposed in the research plan is the development of near-lossless  image compression schemes that give quantitative guarantees about the loss  in reconstruction.  Near-lossless compression techniques can result in  significant reduction in bit-rates while preserving the integrity of  scientific images with respect to the post-processing operations that are  typically carried out on such images.   Collaboration with earth and space  scientists will be an integral part of this activity.    The educational component of the proposal addresses the broader field of  multimedia communications. The main objective of the educational plan is  establish a multimedia communications laboratory that supports education  and research activities of a multidisciplinary group of students and  faculty.  A sequence of multidisciplinary courses in multimedia  communications are proposed to be developed.  Also proposed are a series of  activities like summer internships, departmental colloquia, research  experience for undergraduate site, etc. that go above and beyond the normal  academic year faculty responsibilities.  The objectives of the educational  plan are in tune with department needs and priorities and well integrated  with the research goals of the PI.",
