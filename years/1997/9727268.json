 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727268  Keoleian  Conventional electricity generating systems based on fossil  and nuclear fuels are not sustainable because of the finite  nature of these fuels and the environmental impacts related  to their use.  Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are  rapidly emerging as an important application of a renewable  energy technology.  BIPV systems are an integral part of the  building envelope and thus serve multiple functions  including weather protection, structural, aesthetic, and  electricity generation.  Despite the inherent advantages of  BIPV in roofing and facade applications, they are currently  limited by economic decision-making that ignores social  benefits and costs.  A comprehensive assessment of the full  energy, environmental and economic benefits of BIPV systems  has not yet been conducted.  The purpose of the proposed  project is to develop a life cycle design model and computer  software tool (the Photovoltaic Building Integrated Design  and Policy Assessment Tool, PV-BIDPAT) for evaluating the  full benefits and costs of BIPV technology relative to  conventional electricity generating systems and the building  materials that they displace.  PV-BIDPAT will enhance the  design, planning, and policy making capabilities of key  stakeholders who influence the future implementation of BIPV  technology.    Life cycle inventory models for BIPV and functionally  equivalent conventional systems will serve as a foundation  for comparative energy, environmental, and economic  assessments.  The inventory component of PV-BIDPAT will  consist of a set of modules representing a variety of BIPV  technologies (amorphous silicon, crystalline,  polycrystalline, CdTe, for example) and another set of  modules for characterizing the displaced building materials  (fiberglass asphalt shingles, galvanized metal roofing).  The inventory model will be coupled with a life cycle cost  model comprising economic and policy modules that will  account for the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act  (PU RPA), current Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)  rules, and existing and proposed emissions allowance trading  systems.  The cost model will assign monetary values to  social costs from pollutant emissions and environmental  damage associated with electricity generation.  PV-BIDPAT  will compute the following metrics: pollution prevention  factors for air pollutant emissions, water pollutant  effluents and solid waste; energy payback time and  electricity production efficiency; life cycle costs  including social costs.  Life cycle inventory model  parameters will be measured for amorphous silicon BIPV  products, using data collected from United Solar, and for  the displaced fiberglass asphalt shingles and standing seam  metal roofing materials.    PV-BIDPAT will be applied to and tested on two existing  sites (South Face Energy Institute - PV shingle in Atlanta,  Georgia and the National Association of Home Builders,  National Research Home Park 21st Century Townhouses - PV  standing seam metal roof in Bowie, Maryland) and three  proposed installations (Dana Building of the School of  Natural Resources and Environment - new roof for building  renovation, Art and Architecture Building - PV shingle demo,  Nichols Arboretum Urban Environmental Education Center  historic structure relocation and renovation).  The results  from these cases and other simulations will highlight the  advantages of amorphous silicon BIPV for different policy  and economic scenarios.    This interdisciplinary research project will be undertaken  by a University of Michigan team from the National Pollution  Prevention Center, the School of Natural Resources and  Environment, and the School of Architecture and Urban  Planning that will bring together expertise in life cycle  design and assessment, PV technology, building design,  environmental economics and energy policy.  This team will  collaborate with United Solar and the Solar Energy  Industries Association (SEIA) and a multi-stakeholder  Advisory Committee.   ***",
