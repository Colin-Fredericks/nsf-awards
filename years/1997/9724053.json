 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724053  Pruett-Jones  This research involves ecological and behavioral studies of  a group  of passerine birds in Australia, the fairy-wrens. These  species are endemic  to the Australian mainland and exhibit a variety of  interesting patterns of  behavior, the study of which will help us understand  evolutionary processes  and social behavior in non-human species.  Fairy-wrens are  interesting because  individuals live in large social groups and the offspring  from one  generation remain in the territory and assist the parents in  raising young  in successive breeding attempts.  Also, despite the close  social ties  between individuals in the same group, individual males and  females  generally mate with birds in other social groups.  This  extreme complexity  and difference between social interactions and reproductive  patterns in  fairy-wrens offers a unique opportunity to study the  evolution of animal  societies. In our study of reproductive patterns, and of the  sex ratio of  offspring, we are using the technique of DNA profiling  (i.e.,  fingerprinting) and microsatellite analysis.  Separate from  the specific  species under study, this research will also contribute to  the field of  molecular biology and the refinement of techniques that have  applicability  in human research.  This study will be conducted in mallee  scrub habitat in  South Australia, one of the most threatened habitat types in  Australia, and  it will further our understanding the ecology of this  important ecosystem.  This study will contribute to the conservation of mallee  habitats and  provide information critical to the management of mallee  bird species.",
