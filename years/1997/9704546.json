Continuing work on the MHD dynamo problem  will focus on the dynamical fate of intense small-scale magnetic  structure creating duing the kinematic phase of fast dynamo action.  This question is important since observations of galactic magnetic  fields indicate that the equilibrated fields have no dominant  small-scale structure. A second project deals with separation in the  corner region of Prandtl-Batchelor flows within a domain (such as a   rectangle), where the Euler limit has boundary stagnation points. The   breakdown of boundary layer theory due to the presence of  boundary stagnation points can be investigated in the limit of  large Reynolds number R by imposing wall data which is within  close to that of the  Euler limit with core vorticity 1. A third con-  tinuing study deals with an experiment in non-Boussinesq convec-  tion at high Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers and an analysis of the  large-scale motion which occurs in this flow.  In a new research initiative, we will study analytical and numerical   modeling of high-lift mechanisms in flapping insect flight, with  particular emphasis on hovering. We will study by simulation the  shedding of vortices from a sharp edge in time-dependent 2D Navier-Stokes  flows at Reynolds numbers of several thousand. We shall analyze the   significance and implication of the Kutta condition, the optimal use  of shed vortices in the production of lift, and applications  within conical symmetry to 3D flapping motions.    The Universe is pervaded by magnetic fields, threading through  galaxies, and surrounding stars and planets. However, the origin of  these fields is not well understood. In particular the galactic fields  pose many unanswered questions. This reseapch concerns the dynamo theory of  this magnetism. This unifying theory proposes that all fields  originate from amplification of a seed magnetic field developed during  the big  bang. The process of amplification, dynamo action,  resembles the laboratory dynamo effect but is more complicated because  it occurs in free fluid motion, usually turbulent motion. Our research  is attempting to understand the processes underlying this  amplification and the structure of the fields which result, especially how  this structure is developed by the natural processes available in turbulence.  Other parts of our research program deal with aspects of classical  fluid dynamics of importance in the convective flows within planets  and stars. It is flows of these kinds which are often  responsible for the dynamo effect. For example, convection within the   Earth's fluid core is believed to drive the Earth's dipolar magnetic  field. A new initiative in our research program will deal with the  fluid mechanics of insect hovering flight. Our ilterest  is in utilizing lifting mechanisms of flapping insect hoverers in the  design of small unmanned airborne vehicles. These mechanisms utilize   vortices which are shed into the fluid near the flyer, and interact  with it so as to augment the lift. We shall study the basic  process of shedding of vorticity from surfaces, the optimization of  the resulting lift, and the numerical simulation of the flows in two   dimensions. Important three-dimensional effects will be modeled using   conical symmetry of the flow field.",
