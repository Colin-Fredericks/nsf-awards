 "awd_abstract_narration": "CMS 97-28623  Dobry  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award is  funded to support research on the development of a new  constitutive relation for sands and other granular media,  based on some recent particulate mechanics findings by the  PI.  These findings reveal some simple and very powerful  connections between behavior at the  article contact level  and the desired constitutive relation.  The new relation is  based on the force-deformation model at the contact between  two spheres developed by the PI, and it will be implemented  through a computer program.  A preliminary assessment  indicates that the new relation will naturally predict the  stress-induced anisotropy, volumetric contraction upon  unloading, and densification during cyclic loading observed  experimentally.  Parametric studies will be performed with  the computer program, and the predications will be compared  with available experimental results.  Finally, ways will be  explored to incorporate, also on the basis of fundamental  particulate mechanics consideration, other effects currently  not included in the relation, like dilation and anelastic  behavior during consolidation.  The new constitutive  relation should have significant impact on the analytical  modeling of static and cyclic loading of granular media,  given its fundamental particulate mechanics grounding as  well as its power and simplicity.  ***",
