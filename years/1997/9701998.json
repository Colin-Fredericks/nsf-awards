The research  component is comprised of a study of the connection between  theory and experiment which aims for a coherent  understanding of the basic mechanisms and universality  classes determining the morphology of interfaces moving in  porous media.  The influence of disorder and fluctuations on  surface morphology will be investigated.  The research has  implications for oil recovery and environmental research.    The educational part of the award involves utilizing the  world wide web for improving graduate courses.  A  comprehensive database will be developed of instructional  materials available on the web.  Effective incorporation of  this material into the curriculum will result in a virtual  meta-course.  %%%  This is a CAREER award to a new faculty member and, as such,  involves both research and education.
