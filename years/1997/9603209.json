 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603203  Shinozuka    This award supports the participation of American  scientists/engineers in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Civil  Infrastructure Systems Research to be held in Hawaii from  April 1-3, l997.  The co-organizers are Professors Masanobu  Shinozuka of the University of Southern California and  Makoto Watabe of Keio University in Japan.   This seminar  will provide a forum for identifying and comparing common  issues, for promoting cooperative research between the two  nations and formulating action plans involving the following  themes of study; science of aging and deterioration, health  monitoring and condition assessment, renewal engineering,  socio-economic issues, institutional effectiveness and  productivity, and research coordination.    Civil infrastructure systems (CIS) provide the societies'  basic ability to transport people and goods, to deliver  clean water, electric power, gas and liquid fuel, to  facilitate communications, to mitigate the impact of natural  disasters, and to serve many other functions for the  enhancement of the welfare and freedom of the general  public.  Accelerating rapid growth of the societal  activities and resulting demand for CIS is suppressing the  rate of new construction and retrofitting of existing CIS.  Both the U.S. and Japan share common problems of CIS and are  in need of cost-effective strategies for planning, design,  construction, maintenance and retrofit of  their respective  CISs. The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts  in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their  own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative  projects.  ***",
