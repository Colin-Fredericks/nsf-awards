 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Dwight A. Sweigart, Department of Chemistry, Brown University, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division for the study of chemical reactions effected by   the coordination of the manganese tricarbonyl moiety to aromatic ligands   and for the development of systems that contain a redox switch to   activate or deactivate remote metal centers. The ability of coordinated   manganese tricarbonyl fragments to activate aromatic ligands will be   exploited to prepare a wide range of monoarenes and heterocycles.    Examples include functionalized centropolyindan hydrocarbons and   stereoselectively derivatized prochiral arenes. Arene ligand exchange   will be extended to bimetallic complexes of conjugated polyarenes   containing a variety of metals. Concentrating on hydroquinone and   catechol complexes, the redox properties of the metals will be evaluated.   The studies will converge into the design of systems in which metal-metal   interactions can be electrochemically switched on or off. Drawing on the   reactivity of the manganese tricarbonyl fragment, reductive insertion   reactions into sulfur-carbon bonds will be developed, with an emphasis on   processes related to HDN and HDS.   This project will concentrate on developing several applications for   manganese metal complexes. The first of these aims at the synthesis of   selected types of organic molecules and at the use of manganese   containing species to break carbon-sulfur bonds in thiophenes. This study   is significant because the removal of thiophenic materials is important   to the desulfurization of fossil fuels and manganese is especially   attractive for this application because of its low toxicity and relative   abundance. Another major activity is the development of systems in which   the transfer of an electron to or from a metal atom will control the   behavior of a second metal center. This will have relevance to several   areas including the control of conductivity and optical properties in   metal containing materials.",
