 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708057  Chang    An interdisciplinary master's graduate program is under  development at the Materials Research Center at Northwestern  University which will prepare educators for teaching  Materials Science and Technology at the high school and  junior college levels.  A total of six masters degree  students will be jointly supported by the NSF and  Northwestern University for a period of four years.  A multi-  disciplinary team of Northwestern faculty members act as  project mentors, and participating industrial partners act  as advisers.  Graduate students in this program take courses  in science, education, and engineering with a core of  materials related subjects.  In addition to course studies,  students engage in a year of hands-on research and gain  active teaching experience in regional colleges or high  schools.  The students also participate in organizing summer  institutes with participants from colleges, high schools,  and regional industries. This program is linked to existing  educational programs of the Materials Research Center like  the Research Experience for Science teachers (REST) program  and the Materials World Modules (MWM) program.  In addition,  a network will be formed to cooperate with other innovative  graduate programs at Northwestern University and elsewhere.  This education grant is funded through the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Materials  Research.  %%%  This grant promotes novel opportunities for students to  prepare for academic, industrial, government and non-  traditional roles (such as communication, business,  leadership, ethics, mentoring) and assists in integration of  research and training with curricula.  ***",
