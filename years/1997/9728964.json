 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to continue at MIT the work begun under the NSF funded Collaborative.  TEAMS-BC. In this proposal we request funds specifically to develop the MIT Teacher Education Program (TEP) into a full Teacher Certification Program FCP) during the academic years 1997-99.  We are requesting $124,900 for the first year and $93, 360 for the second.  This project is a continuation of work begun at MIT under the TEAMS-BC Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation.  Courses designed or revised under TEAMS-BC will be further developed and integrated into a full Teacher Certification Program. In particular, we will concentrate on revisions of our second semester education course so as to prepare students to meet the competencies required for Massachusetts State Certification. We will also add to this course an emphasis on educational technology and a focus on effectively understanding the  lives and learning of inner city youth. To further these goals, the MIT Provost will support the appointment of  two new members to the TEP staff, each a 1/2 FTE: Maurice Page, a mathematics teacher at our primary internship site, Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School (CRLS), and a current MIT faculty member to be drawn from the Schools of Science or Engineering",
