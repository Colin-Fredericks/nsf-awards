 "awd_abstract_narration": "Konza Prairie Research Natural Area (KPRNA) is a 3,487 ha  tallgrass prairie preserve managed as a biological  research station by the Division of Biology, Kansas State  University.  Over 120 projects, involving KSU researches  from 14 Departments and 5 Colleges, and 65 visiting  researches from other institutions, are being conducted  on the site.  KSU research on KPRNA is supported by $5 M  in extramural funding from 15 government agencies and  private foundations.  Current facilities include a large  renovated stone ranch house and barn that serve as  research and educational headquartes,a small laboratory,  30 km of fencing, 17 km of maintained gravel roads, fire  management equipment, and 60 watershed treatment units  (avg. size 0.55 km2) maintained under different long-term  prescribed fire and gazing treatment combinations.  Ungulate grazers are managed within a 949 ha bison  enclosure and handling facility, and a 325 ha cattle  enclosure.  The replicated watershed-level grazing and  prescribed fire treatments provide the infrastructure for  over 80% of the research on the site.  The overall  research on KPRNA, the numbers of visiting (non-KSU)  scientists, and the number of small plots maintained for  their research programs have all grown significantly in  the last decade. Therefore, a three phase development  plan for KPRNA was initiated including 1) producing a  long range Master Plan, II) stabilizing and renovating  the existing facilities and equipment, and III)  constructing new laboratory, support facilities, and  living quarters for visiting scientists. Phases I and II  are essentially completed.    This project will begin Phase III and focuses on  enhancing support facilities for visiting scientists.  Specifically, the project to increase laboratory space  for visiting scientists and to support the purchase of a  special purpose tractor needed for maintenance of both  the long-term watershed-level treatments and the greatly  increasing numbers of small plots established by  co llaborating and individuals visiting researchers. The  expansion of experimental plot research on KPRNA has  resulted from an increasing conceptual focus on key  questions regarding 1) underlying processes and  mechanisms driving large-scale community and ecosystems  patterns and change, and 2) assessment of their  generality across grasslands and other terrestrial  ecosystems via cross-site studies. Concurrently, matching  funds will be used to install  onsite computing  facilities and T1 computer line connection to the KU  campus, and to construct a new building to house fire  management equipment.  The completion of this proposed  work will significantly enhance the KPRNA research  capacity, laboratory and computing support facilities for  visiting scientists and students, and data management and  communication system. These improvements will facilitate  further in collaborative cross-disciplinary research on  grasslands and other terrestrial systems.",
