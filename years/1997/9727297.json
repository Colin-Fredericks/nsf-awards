 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727297  Considine  The steel industry provides a classic example of an evolving  industrial ecosystem, recycling large amounts of by-product  gases and more than half of industry output.  Further  environmental progress depends upon new technology adoption.  Integrated steel producers are adopting new technology to  compete with scrap-based minimills.  In addition, both  industry segments face more stringent standards for  emissions of toxic air pollutants.  In meeting these  economic and environmental challenges, steelmakers must  choose among several new technologies, including new iron  feedstocks, coke oven designs, and iron and steel making  technologies.    This proposal addresses an integrated assessment of new  technology adoption in the steel industry.  Analysis will be  based upon a revised and expanded version of the  mathematical programming model of the steel industry  developed by the PI.  The new framework will include a life  cycle assessment (LCA) of steel production from virgin ore  and primary fuel to the plant gate, estimating pollutants  for each process at each stage of production.  This  information will be very valuable to steel-using industries  conducting LCAs of their products.  The model will also  endogenously estimate optimal rates of steel scrap recycling  and investments in new steel-making technologies.  This  model will be used to estimate how the industry responds to  carbon mitigation policies, including taxes and permits, and  examine how these policy impacts interact with toxic  pollution control policies.  This project could be very  useful for more aggregate integrated assessments of global  climate change policies. This project will provide insights  into the tradeoffs between cost and environmental  objectives, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, toxic  discharges, and acidic residuals.",
