 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal covers a broad range of topics. Future  projects include understanding physics opportunities  presented by recent and forthcoming solar neutrino  experiments, exploring the role of neutrinos in supernova  dynamics, investigating consequences of quantum dissipative  tunneling in nuclear reactions, exploring phase transitions  in nuclei with multi-fragmentation, as well as developing  new mathematical techniques to address the physics questions  arising in these studies.  Observed solar neutrino flux is  deficient relative to that predicted by the standard solar  model. Neutrino oscillations in the presence of matter and  magnetic fields were invoked to explain this deficiency.  We  will be studying a new aspect of the neutrino transport in  matter, behavior of neutrino oscillations in stochastic  media.       There has been much progress in our understanding of  supernovae. Explosion models are improved and supernovae  were proposed as a site where heavy elements are created.  Neutrinos have a significant impact on these phenomena.  Dissipative tunneling is especially important for low-energy  fusion reactions.  These reactions are not only of interest  to nuclear astrophysics, but they also provide new insights  into the reaction dynamics and nuclear structure.  Multi-  fragmentation is the statistical emission of fragments from  a nuclear system, which is undergoing expansion under the  influence of thermal pressure and nuclear binding. It is a  probe of dynamics of phase transitions.  The theoretical  research proposed will be done in intensive collaboration  with experimental groups in the U.S. and abroad.",
