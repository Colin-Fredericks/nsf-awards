The main focus of the work will be on the theory of  electrons interacting via singular interactions caused by  proximity to critical points and for systematic comparisons  of the results to experimental data.    For the past forty years the central concept on which metal  physics is based has been Landau's Fermi Liquid Theory,  which holds that at temperatures or energies much less than  the Fermi energy, the physics of metallic interacting  electrons is isomorphic to the physics of non-interacting  electrons.  One of the key experimental achievements of the  past decade has been the demonstration that many classes of  materials (including the high temperature superconductors,  many heavy fermion materials and several transition metal  compounds) exhibit low temperature behavior which is  metallic yet is inconsistent with Fermi Liquid Theory.  The  physics of these non-fermi-liquid metals is not at all  understood.    This grant will study this important problem based on the  controversial assumption that non-fermi-liquid behavior in  metals is somehow related to critical point fluctuations as  might be observed in an equilibrium phase transition.  %%%  This theoretical award will study the properties of metals  which are not explained by the theoretical foundation  established many years ago.  Many materials of current  interest, such as the high temperature superconductors,  exhibit metallic behavior which cannot be explained by  present theory.  Consequently, new physical foundations need  to be established.  Successful completion of this project  will have wide impact on the way we interpret the behavior  of metals and other materials.  ***",
