 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723830  Downs  The biosynthesis of thiamine in Salmonella typhimurium serves as a good model system to address pathway integration since several metabolic pathways impinge on thiamine synthesis and several pathway redundancies have been discovered. These redundancies include the THI pathway for formation of the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine that is the focus of this work. This project seeks to genetically and biochemically characterize steps in the THI pathway for the conversion of aminoimidazole ribotide to hydroxymethyl pyrimidine by: i) identifying mutants defective in this pathway, ii) sequencing the loci affected by these mutations, and iii) initiating studies to address the biochemical role of the respective gene products. The inhibition of this pathway that occurs when cells are grown with fructose as a sole carbon source will also be addressed. To accomplish these objectives, modern chemical, biochemical, molecular biological and genetic techniques will be employed. Results of this comprehensive study of the biochemical, genetic, and regulatory components of the THI pathway will provide insights into a number of areas related to pathway integration.    A fundamental question in cell biology is how metabolic pathways are integrated and controlled to produce a balanced, efficient metabolism. The long term goal of this research is to gain a molecular understanding of regulatory and metabolic interactions amongst pathways using thiamine synthesis in the bacteruim Salmonella typhimurium as a model system. Understanding of such metabolic integration underlies efforts to predict the response of cells to environmental change and developmental switches, efforts to develop metabolic modeling systems and efforts targeting metabolism for rational drug design and/or production of small molecules. Ultimately this work will contribute to the understanding of global metabolic strategies that S. typhimurium uses to survive in its natural environment. These strategies are expected to be representativ e of those used by other cells to respond to developmental and environmental stimuli.",
