 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technological  advances  in  the  last  few  years  have  brought  automatic  speech  recognition where it can now  be  deployed  in  limited,  real-world  applications.  However,  serious  obstacles  still  remain in satisfactory recognition of spontaneous  speech.  Casual  dialog  exhibits a large amount  of  variability  in  the  pronunciation  of  words.   Humans  have  little  difficulty   in  transcribing  such  speech, but automatic  transcription  suffers  badly  because  of  the  inability  of  recognizers  to  properly  consider  nonstandard pronunciations.  This must be addressed  to  make  systems  robust  to a conversational speaking  style.   The  investigators  propose  to  examine alternate  pronunciations  of  words  in  Switchboard, a large corpus of conversational  speech,  and  develop  statistical  models for predicting  the  variations  based on cues in the acoustic, phonemic and linguistic context of  a  word.  Alternate pronunciations are viewed as perturbations of  the  canonical  ones  and,  to  predict  likely  variations,  the  researchers propose to use phonemic environment, lexical  stress,  syllabic  structure,  part-of-speech, phrase boundary  locations,  the  realization  or deletion of neighboring phones,  etc.   They  shall apply complementary nonparametric and parametric techniques  for  building  predictive  models  with  the  goal  of  improving  accuracy in a speech recognition system.  This effort addresses a  significant  obstacle  in  automatic recognition  of  spontaneous  speech  and,  in the process, gains fundamental understanding  of  the causes, mechanisms and extent of pronunciation variability.",
