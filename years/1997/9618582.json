Miller  Affiliation:                              University of Utah      This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The principal investigator is Jan D. Miller of the University of Utah.  The research will be carried out by the University of Utah in collaboration with Shell Chemical Company.  The objective of the proposed program is to adapt atomic force microscopy (AFM) to the determination of interparticle forces between particulate suspended in wastepaper deinking systems.(wastepaper pulping and deinking flotation systems).  Importantly, the results from such research will establish the aqueous solution chemistry for effective deinking of wastepaper, particularly laser-printed and xerographic wastepaper's.  On this basis, it is expected that a simple reliable and relatively inexpensive flotation technology can be developed.    Technology development for the deinking of wastepaper, particularly laser-printed and photocopied office waste, has become an important environmental and process issue for the paper recycling industry.  The development of a novel, inexpensive, and more efficient process for utilization of waste paper from modern printing processes is needed.  Such development will be facilitated by fundamental surface chemistry research to establish a basis for technology innovation.",
