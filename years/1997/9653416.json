 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chance is a quantitative literacy course developed by the Chance Project at Dartmouth with the help of faculty from other colleges and universities and support from the National Science Foundation. The goal of this course is to prepare students to better understand and critically evaluate current news that involves concepts from probability or statistics. Because Chance deals with new information and involve issues from a wide range of disciplines, it can be a difficult course to teach without support. To assist those wishing to teach a Chance course the Chance Project maintains a Database on the Web. The project also provides a tri-weekly electronic newsletter that abstracts current chance articles and provides discussion questions appropriate for a Chance course or any other probability or statistics course the instructor wishes to enhance by including real world examples. The Chance project has also developed new teaching methods and activities to assist in understanding key probability and statistical concepts that are required for understanding typical chance news.    The purpose of this workshop is to acquaint teachers with the Chance course, the resources available to help teach a Chance course, and to give the participants the experience of preparing and carrying out a typical Chance class.",
