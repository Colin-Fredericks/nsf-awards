 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712347  Mishler      Bryophytes are a group of three distinct lineages (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts) that are thought to constitute the remnants of the earliest evolving groups of land plants. There are an estimated 23,000 species of bryophytes, with new species continuing to be described from tropical regions of the world. Because of the small and haploid (single set of chromosomes) nature of the vegetative stage of growth, select species of bryophytes serve as convenient laboratory models for basic studies in physiology, genetics, and ecology. A major limitation in the use of bryophytes as study systems for evolutionary and ecological processes has been the lack of basic taxonomic knowledge of many groups, particularly in the tropics. With assistance from colleagues in the U.S., Australia, Malaysia, and elsewhere, Prof. Brent Mishler at the University of California-Berkeley has designed a multidisciplinary program of study and training that focuses on the large tropical family of mosses, Calymperaceae. Field collecting in Asia and Australasia will augment existing herbarium collections, and provide materials for molecular (DNA) sequencing to complement morphological and anatomical studies, as well as mating tests in the laboratory. Laboratory studies include new technologies of electron microscopy, DNA sequencing, and morphometrics, to add new characters for taxonomic discrimination and phylogenetic resolution. A monographic or species-intensive emphasis will focus on the genus Mitthyridium and parts of the larger genera Calymperes and Syrrhopodon.    Training at undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate levels is an aspect of the program, along with extensive field work, mostly in southeast Asia and the South Pacific, areas of high species diversity. Collaboration with specialists in Malaysia like Dr. Haji Mohamed and in the U.S. like Drs. Daniel Norris and William Reese extend the field and herbarium experiences for all the students involved. Training in modern DNA sequencing for popu lation-genetic and phylogenetic studies provides students with skills that are highly marketable. Products of the research will also be made available in electronic formats over the Web, capitalizing on UC-Berkeley's extensive resources in modern technologies of science dissemination.",
