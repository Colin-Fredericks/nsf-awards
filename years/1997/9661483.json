 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9661483  Hwang     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an efficient data structure for r-set solids that can then serve as the core to develop a compact, embeddable 3D geometric engine for applications such as 2D to 3D legacy engineering data conversion, feature interpretation, geometric reasoning, simulation based design, and medical systems modeling.  This research will contribute to the science and engineering base in the representation of non-manifold solids.  It will also provide a much needed toolkit for applications requiring embedded non-manifold solid model representation, manipulation, and reasoning.  Traditional manifold boundary representations cannot represent non-manifold solids which result naturally from some regularized union or difference operations between two manifold solids.  Manifold solids are not closed under fundamental solid modeling operations; r-set solids are.  Recent research in sufficient topological information requirements for r-set solids provide concrete design requirements for r-set boundary representations.  Advances in combinatorial analysis provide techniques to systematically identify an efficient data structure based on the design requirements.     Many CAD/CAE/CAM and Medical Imaging 3-D applications in industry and academic research need a compact, embeddable 3-D non-manifold geometry engine that current commercial solid modeling systems are not designed for.  The final product of this research targets that market.  ***",
