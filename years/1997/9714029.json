 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the development of a theoretical scheme for automated tolerance control of discrete mechanical part setup planning in numerically controlled (NC) machining.  The proposed tolerance control scheme is based on graph theory.  The features of a part are represented by means of vertices while the parametric and geometrical tolerances assigned among the features are represented by edges.  The entire design specifications of a part is  represented by a hyper graph or tolerance graph.  Hence, an optimal setup planning problem is transformed into a graph search problem.  An optimization algorithm will be developed based on analysis of the minimum setup errors according to the respective setup methods.  Characteristics of NC machining are incorporated within the tolerance graph.  Finally, the proposed research will be implemented into a computer program and will be integrated with a computer aided design system.      If successful, this research will yield two major contributions:  (1) It will establish a theoretically sound foundation and scientifically rigorous base for tolerance control in process planning, and (2) It will develop a tolerance graphing technique that will eventually replace the limited tolerance charting technique.  With the help of a tolerance graph, planning related tolerance control problems can be solved effectively.  As a result, precision parts could be produced at reduced cost.  The proposed tolerance control algorithm would provide a practical approach for process design and analyzing currently existing process plans.  Specifically, by using a tolerance graph, one can (1) select appropriate setups, locating datums, and operation sequences to minimize tolerance stackup, (2) calculate operational dimensions and tolerances for machining cuts, and (3) simultaneously deal with tolerances along all axes.  As an additional benefit, this research adopts a science-based approach to solving tolerance control problems.  Science-based approaches are much more easily computerized to facilitate the realization of computerized tolerancing.",
