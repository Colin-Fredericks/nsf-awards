 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will initiative a process for integrating emerging  perspectives relevant to several NSF-based initiatives that revolve around  the development and broad application of network-based information systems.  The NAS/CSTB will organize a roundtable to bring togehter executives from  NSF and other federal agencies, private foundations, and other sources of  private sector research support to facilitate interactions and possible  collaboration.   Its near-term goal is to foster information exchange and  promote broader and more effective development of support for relevant  research programs across key public and private sector organizations.  In part this activity is convened to maximize the potential and new  National Science Foundation Knowledge And Distributed Intelligence  initiatives including knowledge networking, learning and intelligent  systems, as well as the multi-agency Next Generation Internet, digital  libraries, and universal access initiatives.  Many relevant research  programs rooted in information technology also embrace a variety of  scientific and engineering disciplines, which complement computer science  and engineering with insight into how people do or might use information  technology.",
