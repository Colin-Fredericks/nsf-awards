 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will produce two videos as follow-ups to the highly successful video and workbook, Academic Integrity: The Bridge to Professional Ethics, funded in part by the National Science Foundation. The premise underlying Academic Integrity was that teaching engineering ethics in the abstract to engineering students is ineffective because the students have no context for the ethical problems faced by professional engineers. Academic Integrity shows four short vignettes, acted out by students of the Duke Drama Program and professionally directed and videotaped, in which students find themselves in complex ethical situations familiar to all students.  From a discussion of these ethical problems, using a workbook as a guide, instructors bridge the gap to professional engineering ethics during class discussions. This videotape is being used in nearly 300 universities and colleges in the United States and overseas. The users have asked for another tape with the engineering ethics scenarios provided in the workbook. Instructors feel that first showing the academic integrity video, engaging the students in a discussion, and then showing and discussing a follow-up vignette with the engineering ethical problem, would be most effective in helping them teach professional ethics.  Furthermore, though the original tape was produced with engineering in mind, many science instructors have found the tape useful. Therefore, the project will develop two follow-up videos and workbooks, one for engineering and one for science. The two new videos will be produced by the same team, using semi-professional actors and Duke University facilities. Two teams of advisors, one for engineering and one for science, will oversee the project. The same production procedure will be used. The Principal Investigator will write multiple scenarios involving professional engineering and science for each of the four vignettes shown in Academic Integrity and obtain feedback from the advisors. Based on their comments and preferences, eight scenarios will be chosen. Once the rough films have been produced, the advisors will again have a chance to comment on the tapes before they are duplicated and produced. The advisors will also test the current video and workbook in their classes, as well as drafts and rough cuts of the new videos.  Project results will be demonstrated at professional meetings and mailed to the chairs of science and engineering departments; the world wide web will also be used to disseminate and evaluate the results.",
