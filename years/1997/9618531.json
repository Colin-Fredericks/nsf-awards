 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618531  Bright    The Conference on Classroom Assessment in Mathematics project addresses this area of K-12 mathematics through two conferences, in sequence:  (1) the first is a small, working conference for 32 core, invited participants, to be held in late spring 1997 in Raleigh/Durham, N.C; and (2) the second is a large, dissemination conference for approximately 250 teachers and leaders of K-12 mathematics, to be held in Washington, D. C., in April 1998 during the week of the national NCTM meeting.   Those participating in the working conference include researchers, acknowledged experts in the field of assessment, and practitioners, who are to address the issues surrounding quality classroom assessment in mathematics through position and working papers prepared in advance of the conference.  Conference proceedings are to be edited following the working conference and widely disseminated during NCTM Week.  Collectively, the conferences and proceedings identify research issues and implementation strategies that support quality classroom assessment as a tool for greater student achievement in mathematics, and produce recommendations to begin addressing the issues.",
