 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is providing opportunities for Missouri undergraduate mathematics faculty to review and consider the implications of emerging secondary and undergraduate curriculum reform/materials. Four conferences serve as the forum in which faculty can learn about and discuss reform. In two of these conferences, teams of high school mathematics teachers and college faculty are participating to further systemic efforts at mathematics reform across multiple levels.  Significant follow-up activities are taking place to encourage and support reform efforts across the state that will help faculty and teachers develop and implement curriculum changes in both new and existing courses.  The specific objectives of the project are facilitation of:    1.  College/university mathematics faculty in their review of NSF-sponsored undergraduate curriculum materials and the development of related instructional materials for courses they teach.    2.  Discussion and study of undergraduate curriculum-related issues including new mathematics content, new instructional approaches, and emerging technologies.    3.  College/university mathematics and high school mathematics faculty and teachers in their review of NSF-sponsored secondary curriculum materials and the development of related instructional materials for courses they teach.    4.  Discussion and study of secondary curriculum and examination and revision   of Missouri mathematics teacher preparation programs.    Monographs generated from each conference are being provided for each participant and each mathematics department chair in the state of Missouri.",
