The projects involve research and development aspects of micro-mobile robots, robots that can cooperate to \"play\" soccer against another robot team--an innovative research project promoted internationally by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society.  A robot soccer game is played on a court of 140 cm X 90 cm by two teams of autonomous mobile robots, each of which must fit in a 7.5 cm cube.  A team consists of 3 to 5 robots.  Participants will work on micro-robot structures, computer vision systems, onboard-robot processing units and peripherals, local motion and sensing, inter-robot communication, computer simulation, and game strategies.  The program is designed to train students to become research-minded and to think independently while gaining technical and ethical experiences.  Students will be exposed to cutting edge research in various technical areas including robotics, artificial intelligence, distributed computing, real-time systems, and computer organization.",
