 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619843  This research project lies in the area of developing expressive  type systems for programming languages. Expressive type  disciplines enable more programs to typecheck, and thus support  more diverse styles of programming. Constrained types are a new  type form that is particularly rich, but many research challenges  must be solved before they will be practical.  Constrained types  are studied with the aim to increase type expressiveness, as well  as to apply constrained types to program analysis: these types  have recently been shown to be isomorphic to well-known flow  analysis algorithms performed by compilers. The project will  explore this flow-types duality to (1) Systematize and add rigor  to flow algorithm descriptions; (2) Improve the precision of type  systems; (3) Develop and implement improved type inference  algorithms; (4) Improve the quality of flow analysis algorithms;  and (5) Improve the usefulness of typed intermediate languages in  compilation. Successful completion of the research will  contribute to the quality of (1) Programming languages, by  developing richer type systems; (2) Compilers, by enhancing the  quality of optimizations possible via better program analyses;  (3) CASE tools, by developing both richer algorithms for type  inference and a rich suite of flow-based tools to elucidate  program function.  ***",
