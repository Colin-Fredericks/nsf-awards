 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to improve our laboratory curriculum by the addition of laboratory exercises in developmental neuroscience to several classes: (1) the newly-developed Introductory Methods in Neuroscience course; (2) the newly-developed Methods in Developmental Psychology course, and; (3) the  existing Investigating Developmental Biology course. The laboratory additions will allow students to investigate developmental aspects of behavior and biology and will provide opportunities to experimentally manipulate early nervous system development. This will strengthen our interdisciplinary approach to  neuroscience by mixing psychological and biological investigations of development at both the introductory  and advanced levels.            Our course additions will employ the requested physiological recording equipment to monitor  developmental changes in muscle and eye coordination as well as EEG and evoked potentials. Behavior  monitoring equipment will be used to examine developmental aspects of complex cognitive and memory  processes and to investigate behavioral reactions to experimental manipulations.  Microinjection equipment  will be employed to investigate the mechanisms of embryonic development of nervous systems in model  organisms.  In addition to use in formal laboratory classes, the equipment requested will see further use by  undergraduates in Junior and Senior Honors research, independent research during the academic year, and summer projects. The instrumentation will thus allow us to fill important gaps in our current curriculum  and, as a result, broaden the scope of undergraduate research at Kenyon.     *",
