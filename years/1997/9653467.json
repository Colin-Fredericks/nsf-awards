 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) proposes a three-year plan to improve the teaching of undergraduate microbiology at the nation's two- and four-year institutions. This proposal will also support new faculty and/or postdoctoral fellows with a commitment to undergraduate teaching. The proposed program builds on previous experience of the Society in supporting undergraduate faculty.    The project will:  Increase faculty members' understanding of recent advances in the microbiological sciences and their familiarity with the Society's core content recommendations for the first course in microbiology; increase the number of faculty who are able to incorporate active learning into their classroom and laboratory instruction; improve the career development of new faculty and postdoctoral fellows who are considering academic careers which will involve significant teaching of undergraduate students; and facilitate sharing, disseminating, and evaluating resources available to improve the teaching of microbiology in the lecture hall and the laboratory.    The project will culminate in  a forum (the Undergraduate Microbiology Education Conference) for the development, dissemination, and assessment of effective learning strategies for the teaching of the microbiological sciences at the undergraduate level.  Activities prior to the forum will increase access to this forum by faculty from two-year and/or minority-serving institutions who might not otherwise be able to participate due to financial, disciplinary, or geographic barriers.",
