 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rowan College of New Jersey is one of nine institutions that consist of the State College system, serving a majority of students from the southern region of the State. This award from the National Science Foundation will be use for infrastructure improvements to Bosshart Hall, the science building at Rowan.  Erected in 1961, the facility is home to the Departments of Biology, Chemistry and Physics.  However, existing conditions, including dispersed research and training space throughout the building,  severely impacts research programs by limiting the time assigned to conduct experiments.  Combined with increased usage due to the growth in scholarship and enrollments,  Bosshart Hall  cannot support research activities.  This project will  improve the environment by consolidating research and training activities in dedicated laboratories.  Renovations will include: redesigning lab spaces for more flexibility, modifying the plumbing system to accommodate required equipment, installing new workbenches, cabinets, and fume hoods, and providing gas and vacuum services.  As a result of the infrastructure modifications,  a total of eight laboratories will be established: three labs for biology (microbiology, tissue cell and histology), three labs for chemistry (organic and inorganic, synthesis, polymers, and two labs for physics (lasers, superconductivity and magnetic properties) respectively.   The increased functioning of these areas will permit investigators to concentrate on research that will enlarge both faculty and student productivity.  With renovated facilities, the science departments which currently have a large representation of students who traditionally have not participated in the sciences, will be able to provide additional training opportunities for students.",
