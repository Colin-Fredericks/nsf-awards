 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708221  Insana  Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) techniques are to be developed  to detect early changes in renal microstructure that  ultimately lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).  QUS  involves analysis of echo spectra in frequency channels  corresponding to scattering from various anatomical scales  to measure the size, number density, and collagen content of  essential tissue microstructures.  These are among the first  techniques for analyzing histological properties of tissues  in vivo and noninvasively.    The incidence of ESRD in the United States is increasing  geometrically.  Average medicare costs were $46,117 per ESRD  patient  for a total of $9.5 billion in 1992.  A definitive  diagnosis of progressive injury leading to ESRD is now based  on clinical findings and biopsy; that often occur late in  the disease process.  Currently no test exists to establish  the presence of early kidney injury or to identify  populations at risk for whom prevention of progressive  injury should be attempted.  This investigation will examine  the potential of QUS as a safe, inexpensive, and noninvasive  method for early detection of renal injury caused by several  common conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and  cystic kidney disease.  This three-year, multidisciplinary  research project aims to develop new biomedical  instrumentation, experimental techniques, and models of  disease processes.  If QUS can successfully identify  patients at risk for ESRD, the potential to prevent disease  would be improved, the net cost of treating the disease  would be reduced significantly, and the quality of life for  those patients affected would be improved.  This research  program is part of a new graduate-level Biomedical  Engineering Program at the University of Kansas.  ***",
