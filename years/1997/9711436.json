 "awd_abstract_narration": "9711436  Register  This project revolves around materials - semicrystalline  block copolymers - which exhibit characteristics of both  semicrystalline homopolymers and conventional amorphous  block copolymers.  These materials can develop structure  over a range of length scales, from the unit cell structure  of the crystallizable block, to the microdomain length  scale, to the spherulite scale.  Two complementary classes  of materials and phenomena are proposed for investigation:  1) crystallization templated by fluid mesophases, and 2) new  polymers with a defect-free crystallizable block.  The first  case builds on a recent discovery that in at least some  cases, the well-known mesophases formed by block copolymers  (e.g., cylinders and spheres) are able to restrict  crystallization to within a particular part of the mesophase  (e.g., crystallization within cylinders, where the cylinder  diameter is a few tens of nanometers), even for materials  where the matrix remains fluid during crystallization and  the material is crystallized under conventional processing  conditions.  The objective here is to determine the  conditions under which the melt mesophases are effective at  templating crystallization, and to elucidate the mechanism  and origin of this restricted crystallization.  In the  second case, new polymers made by ring-opening metathesis  polymerization (ROMP) of cyclobutene and norbornene will be  studied.  Hydrogenation of poly(cyclobutene) yields a linear  (unbranched, high-density) polyethylene.  Finally, by using  a very active saturation catalyst, it will be possible to  saturate the norbornene block as well as the cyclobutene  block.  Such materials would thus be crystalline-crystalline  diblocks, where the possibilities for structure formation  and the tailoring of material properties are quite diverse.  %%%  These semicrystalline block copolymers are principally  intended for use as melt-processible rubbers, where unlike  conventional vulcanized rubbers, they can be recycled   (simply remolded into new articles).  In comparison with  existing melt-processible rubbers, these new polymers offer  higher temperatures (e.g., automotive applications),  improved optical clarity (e.g., medical applications), and  excellent resistance to oil and solvents.  ***",
