 "awd_abstract_narration": "DNA computing is a new interdisciplinary research area that  bridges the gap between computer science and biochemistry.  The  potential strength of DNA computing lies in the high memory  capacity of DNA molecules and the intrinsic massive parallelism  of biochemical operations.  In 1994, it was demonstrated that it  is possible to engage DNA in combinatorial computation through  well-established biochemical techniques.  The ultimate goal of  this four-year project is to establish the foundations of DNA  computing while tackling important issues through research and  education activities.  The following topics are investigated:  Establishing theoretical models for  DNA computing. Development  of computational models, data structures and high-level  operations for DNA Computing. Development of a complexity theory  for DNA computing.  including trade-offs among resources and  reducibility.  Development of DNA computers algorithms that are  more efficient than algorithms on existing computers. Educational  plan:  An interdisciplinary undergraduate course on DNA  computing.  The course will be teamtaught.  The objective of the  course is to introduce students to the basic principles of liquid-  phase DNA chemistry and to the relevant notions in computer  science.  In the last third of the course, students will be  divided into teams to work on team projects based on research  related problems.",
