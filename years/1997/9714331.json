 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  award  funds an initial exploration of a theoretical  basis  for visual image structure, to aid in supporting queries to image  archives.  Digital image archives are proliferating, which raises  the  question  of  how  to retrieve specific  images  from  them.  However,   while  queries  are  naturally  posed  in  high-level,  functional terms, the realizations of such queries are  based  on  low-level image operators. An intermediate-level theory of visual  structure is necessary to close this gap, which is precisely what  this  research  addresses.  Based on an  interpretation  of  edge  elements  as  tangent  estimates, it is  derived  from  geometric  measure  and  complexity theory.  Viewed from below,  the  theory  provides   an   organization  for  edge  elements  according   to  dimension.  They  are either bound into extended  (1-dimensional)  groups,  into  (2-dimensional) structural classes  that  abstract  different   types  of  texture,  or  (0-dimensional)  orientation  discontinuities.  Viewed from above, the  representation  induces  equivalence  classes  of structure, such  as  bounding  contours,  texture  flows  for hair and grass patterns, and  ``T''-junctions  for  points of occlusion. Thus queries involving forests  can  be  differentiated  from  those involving fur patterns  or  turbulent  water,  and  multiple, overlapping objects can be separated  into  components.  Furthermore, images and drawings  can  be  segmented  from pages of text.",
