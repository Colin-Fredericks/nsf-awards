 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robert Whetten of Georgia Institute of Technology is supported by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in his studies of gold   nanocrystals passivated by a monolayer of n-alkylthiol(ate) groups.  The   major objectives of this work are to (a) determine the structure of a   passivated nanocrystalline substance; (b) quantify the solubilities and   miscibilities of a mixture of molecular nanocrystals; (c) develop a   technique for generating beams (and thus mass spectra) of nanocrystals   with the passivation layer intact; (d) study the etching and annealing   processes; (e) determine the energy-level patterns of small metal   particles of previously determined structure; (f) measure the kinetics of   annealing, etching, adsorption-passivation in nanocrystalline processing;   and (g) create conducting arrays from molecular nanocrystal solids.    Finally, these studies will be extended to cesium iodide nanocrystals   passivated by alkyl-chain organic acids/salts.    These studies will have a tremendous impact in the area of materials   research.  Nanometer-scale single crystallites can be prepared in such a   way that they retain a near-ideal structure yet are stable against   dissolution or further growth, even when in contact with each other.    This stability is due to the adsorption of `surfactants` that form   compact and ordered monolayers on the crystalline surfaces.  With   techniques developed in Whetten's lab, he is able to make a beam out of   these nanoparticles and then mass-select them, necessary steps for full   characterization of these materials.",
