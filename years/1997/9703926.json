 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rydelek  9703926    This award supports a collaborative research project between  Dr. Paul Rydelek of the University of Memphis and Dr. Kazuo  Hamada of the National Research Institute for Earth Science  and Disaster Prevention (NIED) in Tsukuba, Japan on the  physics of the earthquake process.  Dr. Rydelek will spend  one year working on this project in Japan.  NIED offers  extensive data on earthquakes collected from a comprehensive  network of strong motion sensors, conventional short period  seismometers and newly developed broadband seismic sensors.  The principal investigator will use the Japanese seismic  data to test and refine a recently developed non-fractal  model of earthquakes.    Understanding the geophysical processes which result in  earthquakes is critical to our efforts to mitigate the  destruction and loss of life caused by these natural  disasters.  This project will combine the expertise and data  of U.S. and Japanese laboratories working on earthquake  research.  The project is supported under the Science  Fellowship Program between the National Science Foundation  and the Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership.  ***",
