 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the computational complexity of finding  approximate solutions to NP-optimization problems through an  investigation of the structure of complexity classes in the  bounded query hierarchy.  Many questions about these complexity  classes remain open.  For example, it is not known whether a  polynomial time Turing machine using a linear number of oracle  queries to an NP-complete set can recognize more languages than  one which uses only log n queries. Recent works have established  close connections between NP-approximation problems and the  bounded query hierarchy.  As a result, there is a direct  correspondence between open questions of whether finding an  optimum Traveling Salesman tour can be reduced to finding a 2-  approximate tour (one that has at most twice the length of the  optimum tour).  If such a reduction were possible, it would imply  that there is no significant difference in the complexity of  finding approximate versus optimum solutions for many NP-complete  problems.  This would drastically alter the present understanding  of the nature of NP-completeness.  The conjecture motivating this  research is that such a reduction does not exist.  However,  currently, its existence is not known to violate any of the  common intractability assumptions (e.g. that P  NP or that the  Polynomial Hierarchy does not collapse). The goal of this project  is to solve many of the outstanding open questions about the  bounded query hierarchy.",
