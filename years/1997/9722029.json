 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award for US-UK cooperative research in physical experimental chemistry   involves David W. Pratt of the University of Pittsburgh and W.G. Richards and J.P.   Simons at Oxford University.  The objective of their research is to study supramolecule   assemblies of enzyme catalytic sites and bound substrates, including structure and   properties of the supramolecule assemblies and interaction among its components.    Enzyme and enzyme substrate mimics, designed to model the behavior of the enzymes,   serine and cysteine proteases, will be studied in experiments using laser-based electronic   spectroscopy and other techniques.  They will also use the enzyme mimics to investigate   selective binding of xenon at enzyme catalytic sites, thereby providing insight into its   potential as a site specific stain in magnetic resonance imaging.  The US investigator and his group bring to this collaboration expertise in characterization   of enzyme structures using theoretical techniques.  This is complemented by British   expertise in enzyme mimic preparation and characterization using ab initio techniques.    These studies will provide new information about molecular interactions which are   responsible for enzyme function.",
