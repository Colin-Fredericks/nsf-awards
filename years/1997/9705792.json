In these non-invasive methods one attempts to determine  the internal parameters of a body by making measurements at the boundary  of the body. An example of this is \"Electrical Impedance Tomography\". In  this case the measurements at the boundary are current and voltage  measurements, and one would like to determine the conductivity of the body.   The PI plans to consider the case of anisotropic conductivities and  non-smooth isotropic conductivities.  Another important unsolved problem  is whether one can effectively characterize all the possible outcomes of  voltage and current measurements for conductivities. The proposer plans to  investigate analog inverse problems arising in the mechanics of materials.  In particular one would like to determine the elastic parameters of an  elastic body by making measurements of displacements and tractions at the  boundary. The PI plans to consider the case of transversally isotropic  materials and also materials with residual stress.        The PI plans to consider several inverse boundary value problems arising  in applications. In these non-invasive methods one attempts to determine  the internal parameters of a body by making measurements at the boundary  of the body. For instance, electrical impedance imaging systems apply  currents to the outside surface of a body and record the voltages that  result. This data is used to reconstruct and display an approximation to  the electrical conductivity inside the body. The electrical conductivity  of lung, air, blood, cardiac muscle, breast tissue, and breast tumors are  all different. For this reason electrical impedance imaging is being  tested as a method for monotoring heart and lung function as well as  screening for breast cancer. Other application of this inverse method is  non-destructive evaluation of materials, in particular in the detection of  internal cracks and corrosion in planes. T he design for these imaging  systems involve the analysis of forward and inverse problems for partial  differential equations.",
