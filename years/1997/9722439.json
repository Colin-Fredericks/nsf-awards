 "awd_abstract_narration": "This international collaboration between the PI and Gerhard Michler at the Universit\u00aat   Gesamthochschule Essen will develop a better fit between network-based parallel   architectures and applications.  The U.S. personnel are experts in computer architectures,   while the German group's expertise is in algebraic applications.  The interaction   collaboration between the two groups will result in ways to restructure underlying   algorithms and better support software for parallel computations, as well as generate   methods to reduce the current communications overhead between workstations.  Lessons   learned in solving problems associated with applications for parallel and distributed   systems will benefit many other applications areas.  In addition, flexible, stable, efficient,   and user-friendly parallel systems will greatly benefit the computational infrastructure of   science and engineering.  Through this project, the U.S. group will gain access to a highly   respected computer algebra group, and to the knowledge in the German national   computer-algebra focus program administered by the German equivalent of NSF.",
