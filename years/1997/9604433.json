 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inside the nose of mammals, the sheet of cells that contains olfactory   receptors also contains many sustentacular cells.  The function of these   sustentacular cells is not well understood, but their secretions may modulate the   handling of odorant molecules in the moist coating of the epithelium.  There now   an active interest in how functions of receptors in chemosensory tissues are   influenced by such peri-receptor mechanisms.  This limited study is a Minority   Research Planning Grant that uses molecular tools to identify gene expression,   and so clarify mechanisms by which the proteins produced by these cells are   regulated.       Results will have an impact on chemosensory research by laying groundwork   for further analysis of this important class of cells.  By helping to establish an   independent career for a young investigator, teacher and mentor from a group   that remains underrepresented in science, this award also will have an impact on   the infrastructure of science and education.",
