 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project seeks to determine the applicability of using transient stress waves generated by short-duration elastic impact to nondestructive evaluation of masonry structures.  A preliminary study has established the feasibility of using transient stress wave propagation techniques for evaluation of masonry and laid the basis for the work to be performed.  The objectives are to:  <fontfamily><param>Symbol</param>=85 </fontfamily>demonstrate how acoustic properties of brick, block, mortar, and grout affect the impact-echo response of masonry structures;  <fontfamily><param>Symbol</param>=85 </fontfamily>show the effects on impact-echo signals due to cores in brick and determine if it is possible to test walls made from brick with cores;  <fontfamily><param>Symbol</param>=85 </fontfamily>show the effects on the impact-echo response due to the shrinkage cracks at the interfaces between brick and mortar;  <fontfamily><param>Symbol</param>=85 </fontfamily>determine if stress wave techniques can be used to establish the degree of mortar joint completeness in brick walls; and,  <fontfamily><param>Symbol</param>=85 </fontfamily>determine if voids in various types of masonry structures, such as voids in grout joints between brick wythes, concrete masonry cells, or in brick pavement systems, can be detected.  These objectives will be accomplished through the use of finite element simulations of stress wave propagation in models of masonry components and structures, extensive laboratory testing on masonry specimens with flaws placed at known locations, and field testing on masonry structures where the results obtained nondestructively can be verified by invasive testing.  This research will provide a fundamental understanding of how stress waves can and cannot be used in the nondestructive evaluation of masonry structures.  It will result in applications where stress wave techniques can be used for flaw detection, quality control, and in pre- and post-event studies.  The results of this research will also help address the pressing need to develop techniques for nondestructive testing of masonry.  Currently, almost all evaluations must be conducted using test methods that in some way damage the structure.=20 With success in this research, impact-based stress wave techniques will be an important tool for structural engineering consultants in evaluating masonry structures.",
