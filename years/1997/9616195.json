 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616195  Suppes  Donor organs used for heart, liver, kidney, or other  transplants have severely limited storage times.  Typically,  the operation must be performed within 24 to 48 hours for  the best opportunity of success.  The proposed research will  perform fundamental research which could directly lead to a  method for successfully storing or even freezing these donor  organs at lower temperatures without loosing organ viability  for transplants.  These new storage methods would be a  direct result of fundamental data of the impact of high  pressure on tissue.    The proposed research will investigate the impact of high  pressures, rates of pressure changes, thermally induced  freezing, and pressure induced freezing on the viability of  red blood cells and bovine sperm.  The proposed program  should be considered as a Small Grant for Exploratory  Research since little if any cryobiology has been performed  at the proposed high pressures.  The proposed funding is  sufficient to determine if further investigation is  warranted.  ***",
