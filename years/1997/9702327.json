 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9702327    In this project, a novel strategy for enhancing growth rates of solid particulate products of combustion is tested.  The technique involves the irradiation of the effluent stream from a dirty combustion system by an intense acoustic field; this enhances the aggregation of the soot and facilitates its subsequent collection. Also, interesting flame dynamics occur when the flame is embedded in the acoustic field.  The coupling of the combustion processes to  the acoustics are determined.  Control of flame properties by tuning the acoustic field is attempted.  Diagnostic's track soot production from the flame through the acoustic field.  Soot morphology is determined by sampling and  scattering measurements, impactor measurements characterize the soot size distribution, and effects of the acoustic field on local flame properties are followed by  flowfield, temperature, and species measurements in the flame zone.  Computations complement the experimental work.    The benefits of clarifying soot-growth physics are significant.  Most practical large-scale burners use turbulent nonpremixed flames which potentially produce large amounts of soot, and the impact of reducing the soot number concentration from the flame is environmentally significant.  Current regulations do not require characterization of particulate size distribution in emissions, but recent fundings on health risk factors many change this.",
