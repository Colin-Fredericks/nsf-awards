 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9603542  Baas    Neurons are the principal cells that make up the nervous  system.  They  consist of a rounded cell body and two types of elongate  extensions.  One  type of extension is called an axon while the other type is  called a  dendrite.  Axons are specialized to transmit information,  while dendrites  are specialized to receive information.  In order for the  neuron to extend  axons and dendrites, it must elaborate within them complex  arrays of  cytoskeletal elements.  These cytoskeletal elements provide  architectural  support for axons and dendrites, and also act as railways  for the transport  of substances from the cell body down their lengths.  One of  the most  important of the cytoskeletal elements is the microtubule.  The microtubule  is an intrinsically polar structure, and as a result of this  polarity, the  microtubule can direct the types of substances that are  transported into  axons and dendrites.  Fundamental to the differentiation of  axons and  dendrites is the establishment of very different microtubule  arrays in each  type of process.  Axonal and dendritic microtubules differ  in many respects,  including how they are organized relative to their polarity.  The axonal  microtubule array has been extensively studied, but the  dendritic  microtubule array has received far less attention.  The  overall goal of this  grant application is to elucidate the cellular and molecular  means by which  the dendritic microtubule array is established, and how it  becomes different  from the axonal microtubule array.  The proposed experiments  involve direct  observations within living neurons as well as high  resolution studies using  the electron microscope.",
