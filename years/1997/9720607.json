 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is funded through the Professional Opportunities for  Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program as a Visiting  Professorship Activity.    This proposal is for a visiting assistant professor position at  the University of Iowa. Under this award, the PI will spend six  months at the University of Iowa next Spring and Summer. The host  institution will provide financial support for some of the PI's  salary, and she is requesting half of her current salary from NSF  POWRE funds.  The invitation for this visit is important for the  PI because there she can extend her current research through  collaboration and discussions with well-known scientists in the  areas of numerical analysis, computer science, and astronomy.  The PI's areas of research are Numerical Methods for  Particle Transport Problems and Numerical Methods for  Large-Scale Eigenvalue Problems.  Particle and radiation  transport problems arise in many astronomical phenomena, such as  the solar wind, radiation in the outer layers of the sun, and the  behavior of dust clouds and nebulae illuminated by stars.  (Dust clouds are considered to be the birth-place of stars.)  Eigenvalue problems enter into particle transport problems as a  way of solving criticality problems; that is, determining for  what parameters there can be a self-sustaining reaction.  This is of crucial importance in the areas of nuclear reactor  design, and also in the initiation of nuclear activity in stars.    The PI has developed new algorithms (sequential and parallel)  for solving transport equations and eigenvalue problems.  Transport equations are integro-differential equations, and the  study of these equations can be fruitfully extended by deeper  understanding of how the integral and differential terms  interact.  However, the new applications areas will lead to new  equations, and to significantly new methods and ideas.  The astronomical applications incorporate a number of new  phenomena such as reaction terms, and strong interactions between   the particles (or radiation) and the medium through which the  particles move.    The anticipated outcome from this project will be a deeper  understanding of the mathematics arising in differential-integral  equations which are related to transport phenoma, better  sequential and parallel algorithms for equations in the related  applications areas, and improvement of techniques  available to astronomers for simulating and studying the activity  of stars and the sun.",
