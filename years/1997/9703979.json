 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703979  Tonner    This award provides support for a new type of microscope to be  developed, that has surface sensitivity, very high spatial  resolution, and performs spatially resolved x-ray absorption fine-  structure spectroscopy (XAFS).  This instrument will use the  recently invented methods of aberration-corrected electron optics  to improve the performance of x-ray photoelectron emission  microscopy (X-PEEM) by an order of magnitude.  The aberration-  corrected X-ray PEEM, or AX_PEEM, will be used in a number of  different research programs.  These include element-specific  magnetic domain microscopy, polymer-metal interface studies,  surface reactions on mineral substrates, and surface reactions on  single-crystal substrates.  These applications will use the  technique of nano-XAFS, which the AX-PEEM makes possible.  %%%  This instrument will perform core-level \"spectro-microscopy,\" a  new technique for the non-destructive mapping of chemical domains  at surfaces.  Specifically, it will be able to take a sequence of  images as a function of the energy of the incident radiation.  The resultant data can be interpreted as a set of XAFS spectra  from individual areas on the sample, or as images of the chemical  composition of the near-surface region of the sample, as derived  from the spatially varying XAFS spectra.  The new instrument will combine high voltage electrostatic  electron microscope lenses with an electron-mirror aberration  correction scheme.  The completed instrument will be a compact,  ultra-high vacuum compatible assembly, that will be installed in  a portable surface science chamber.  The nano-XAFS technique is  of interest to a widely interdisciplinary research community,  ranging from surface science to biophysics.  To meet these varied  needs, the system is designed to be easily installed on a number  of different synchrotron beamlines in the U.S.  ***",
