 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9612378  Ban   This Small Business Innovation Research Project is to design and build a radically new prototype reactor capable of deposition of OLED materials on large area substrates.  In Phase I a new method for the large area, low cost growth of organic light emitting devices (OLEDS) was successfully developed using a patented process of Organic Vapor Phase Deposition (OVPD).  The potential of OVPD was developed by producing an efficient green Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED), consisting of OVPD deposited TDP and vacuum deposited Alq3 films.  This represents the first step in large batch processing of \"small molecule\" and possibly polymer based OLEDS, devices of great importance for emissive color flat panel displays. This type of reactor can be scaled up to produce large area, full color flat panel displays continuously.  In Phase II the extensive expertise gained in OLED materials and reactor and process design expertise will be combined.   The commercial potential in this type of display market may be enormous (estimated at over $20 billion/year).  The technology proposed is unique in its approach to producing low cost OLED based flat panel displays in high volume.    ***",
