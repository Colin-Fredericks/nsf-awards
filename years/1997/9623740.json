 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9623740  Pritsker    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build the Factory-in-the-Computer, abbreviated by F=>C, which provides information to improve the management of a company's value-added chain.  F=>C will assist manufacturing managers in understanding of the performance implications of manufacturing-related business process changes due to customer pressures.  Management needs, not technology innovation, will drive the design of the F=>C.  To accomplish this, the model of a generic manufacturing company, developed in Phase I, will provide a classification of business data and decision processes related to the software capabilities of the F=>C.  The classification system provides a means to identify business processes and to build sample problems demonstrating how they will be resolved.  At the conclusion of Phase II, reference models will be available for describing applications of the F=>C, templates for marketing and sales procedures related to the F=>C will be available, and a prototype F=>C will have demonstrated how management needs are met in manufacturing organizations with the new software tool.    Manufacturing industries are investing heavily in programs for improved manufacturing practices.  This commitment has created a software market estimated at $2.3 billion/year. The F=>C  concept is expected to contribute significantly to this market because it directly relates manufacturing change to changing financial conditions of a company.",
