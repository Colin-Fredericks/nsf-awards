 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9712608  MORFORD  Many middle and high schools encourage students to use graphing  scientific calculators to assist in mathematics and science  courses.  They are used widely in higher mathematics (Algebra I  and above) and in the physical sciences.  These calculators  perform scientific functions and have built-in screens to display  graphs of analyzed data.  They are valuable tools both for  students and teachers.  Unfortunately, graphing scientific  calculators are not accessible to visually impaired students.   The Interactive Scientific Graph Analysis Project (ISGAP) will  investigate strategies for the design, development, and  evaluation of technology that will provide better access for  visually impaired students to graphs and scientific expressions.   Investigations will be conducted for the purpose of identifying  and testing economical materials and procedures that will provide  real time interactive independent comprehension of two  dimensional graphs by visually impaired students.  The project  should increase the knowledge base regarding interactive graph  analysis and interactive scientific calculation for visually  impaired people.  The project will involve visually impaired  students, teachers, and parents in all phases of the research  project.  Training will be required so students and teachers  understand how to operate this new technology.  Online help  assistance will be designed into the system from the beginning.   The project will begin with the development of customized  software that will run on a PC.  Off-the-shelf peripherals will  be used to keep final product costs low.  Specific project  objectives are:  (1)  Determine ISGAP requirements and design  user interfaces, (2) Interface peripherals and design and develop  software, (3) Design, develop, and test functions for  interpreting graphs, and (4) Field test and evaluate product.   This project should significantly impact the ability of visually  impaired students to succeed in math and science courses.  A  su ccessful conclusion to this project will lead to production of  an economical hand-held device enabling visually impaired  students to have increased equity with their peers.",
