 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smith  9727796      Quantitative evaluation of the global carbon budget, including  identification of sources and sinks, will be crucial to our  understanding of future climatic and anthropogenic impacts on the  global biosphere. To date, models of the global carbon budget have  been unable to balance the amount of CO2 released by fossil fuels  and modification in land-use with the amount of CO2 remaining in  the atmosphere. Of particular concern is the lack of information  regarding the spatial and temporal dynamics of the carbon exchange  properties of the terrestrial versus oceanic portions of the  biosphere, although it has been suggested that the terrestrial  biosphere has acted as a net sink for the uptake of CO2 because of  imbalances in photosynthesis and respiration due to annual  variations in climate. The principle objective of the research  will be to identify the annual source/sink dynamics in  globally-important ecosystems that are represented in the Rocky  Mountains and northern Plains. Identification and quantification  of potential terrestrial sinks for CO2 is necessary for predicting  future changes that may occur in the global environment. The  estimation of net CO2 exchange from vegetative surfaces using  remote sensing techniques provides a fundamental data-set for  computing the global carbon budget and the existence of carbon  sinks that may ameliorate the impact of continued, anthropogenic  release of carbon compounds into the atmosphere. However, this  approach may also become valuable as a method for establishing  physiological status (e.g. photosynthesis) and, thus, the health  and vigor of both native and agricultural ecosystems on a global  scale. The PI proposes a research plan that characterizes  principal ecosystem types of the northern Rocky Mountains and  Great Plains. These selected ecosystem types (conifer forest,  shrublands, mixed grass prairie and several agricultural types)  are excellent representatives of large parts of Earth representing  16%, 18%,11% a nd 16%, respectively, or a total of 61% of the total  usable land area of the globe.      For some time now, carbon budgets of different ecosystems have  been evaluated using measurements of the exchange of CO2 within or  above the representative vegetation. These studies require  expensive and labor intensive measurements that are affordable  when only a small number of geographical locations are monitored.  Thus, a substantial sampling problem is inherent in the current  leafand canopy-level process submodels, which precludes an  accurate coupling with atmospheric circulation models and ultimate  extrapolation to broader geographic scales. In the current  proposal, aircraft measurements of eddy transport of water vapor  and C02 exchange will be combined with isotopic data to estimate  CO2 fluxes on an annual and seasonal basis. Results will be scaled  directly up to the northern Rocky Mountains and northern Great  Plains with regional, digital coverage's together with GIS methods  and ecosystem modeling techniques in order to produce a regional  estimate of carbon fluxes for a significant portion of North  America. Incident sunlight, precipitation, soil and plant  moisture, air temperature and humidity will be monitored  concurrently with CO2 flux measurements. In addition, the  capability for measuring natural isotopes of carbon and water  provides an accurate and reliable method for estimating the  component sources of CO2 that comprise measured values of net CO2  flux . Net fluxes will be partitioned into a balance of particular  sources (i.e. atmosphere, plant photosynthesis and respiration,  soil respiration, etc.), according to differences in  discrimination between stable isotopes contained in each  environmental component (e.g. leaf and soil organics; leaf, stem,  and soil water, etc.). Overall, these results will will provide  the groundwork for testing process models that extrapolate  globally. Both \"topdown\" and \"bottom-up\" approacheswill be  compared by using measurements taken sim ultaneously at the plant  level, above the canopy (eddy correlation tower), and with  aircraft sampling. Although we will be focusing on the more  difficult problems of spatial heterogeneity within this region,  the applicability of our results from this region should be  important for extrapolating to similar ecosystems across the globe  (e.g. Asian continent).",
