The purpose of the proposed work is to develop, implement and test adaptation mechanisms which are modeled after their biological counterparts.  The centerpoint of the project is the development of adaptive \"neuromorphic\" VLSI (Very-Large-Scale-Integrated) devices.  Neuromorphic devices are similar to common computer chips but they are designed and operated in somewhat different regimes (analog variables instead of digital, subthreshold voltages instead of suprathreshold, and parallel processing instead of serial) which gives them properties much more similar to those of nerve cells than can be claimed of standard computer chips. While neuromorphic circuits have been designed and fabricated for about a decade, this work is one of the first to systematically incorporate learning and adaptation into that technology.  This is accomplished by making use of recently developed design techniques (''floating gates'') which for the first time allow storage of learned values for periods of time (years) similar to the lifetimes of retention mechanisms encountered in animals and humans.  Furthermore, while most of the previous work was concerned with the processing of sensory information (good examples being the \"silicon retina\" and \"silicon cochlea\"), this project also includes motor control and thus closes the behavioral loop, from sensory input to motor output which then again influences sensory input.  The adaptive neuromorphic devices are integrated in a realistic model of the eye-movement control of primates (monkeys and humans), which is one of the best understood biological sensorimotor systems.  Different mechanisms of adaptation and learning have been studied in monkeys and humans and the performance of the adaptive control system is evaluated by comparing with experimental data.  The development of a hardware model for eye movements promises significant insights  into the function of an important sensorimotor control system.  Understanding human (and primate) eye control in the real world and how it adapts to changing situations may lead to the development of practical tools, for instance, for target detection and pursuit.  More importantly, however, synthesizing a complex behavior will help us understand this and other behavioral patterns to a degree which is impossible to achieve with analytical methods alone.",
