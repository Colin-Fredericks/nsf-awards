 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614919  Smyth    This grant provides $29,000 as one-half support of the costs of  acquiring equipment to upgrade the X-ray diffraction (XRD)  facility at the University of Colorado.  Specifically, the  equipment that will be purchased will upgrade both the single  crystal and powder XRD instruments at Colorado.  Two diamond  anvil cells, a pressure measurement spectrometer, a high  temperature, vacuum crystal mounting system, a Pentium PC and  NIST Crystal Data file will upgrade the single crystal XRD for  high-P/T XRD studies, while upgrade of the powder XRD will  include a new computer and automated control software and the  JCPDS powder diffraction CD-ROM database.  A spare Mo anode will  also be purchased.  The PI's contributions to understanding the  crystal chemistry of hydrous, high-pressure phases of silicates,  notably -spinel, is of fundamental importance to understanding  the global water cycle including mechanisms of water transport to  the mantle within subduction zones and its effect on arc  volcanism. These upgrades will greatly improve the high P/T XRD  capabilities of one of the few remaining single crystal XRD  facilities in the U.S. that is devoted to the Earth Sciences.  ***",
