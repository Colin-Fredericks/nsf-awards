 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9660570  Pei      Recently, stimulated emission from polymer light-emitting materials and devices has also been of considerable interest. Based on new results demonstrating both polymer light emitting diodes ( LEDs) in microcavity geometries and photo-pumped stimulated emission using luminescent conjugated polymers, attention has now focused on efforts to realize electrically pumped polymer laser diodes. These efforts are hindered, however, by the fact that the luminescent conjugated polymers which have been the subject of the most intense investigation lack either sufficiently high photoluminescent efficient or carrier mobility (or both). In other candidate polymers, self-absorption, photo-induced absorption, or electro-induced absorption at wavelengths in the emission region prevents any stimulated emission. In this Phase I proposal, the synthesis of a series of luminescent conjugated polymers as candidates for evaluation against well-defined criteria is outlined. The polymers will be processed into high quality thin films for use in the fabrication of polymer light-emitting devices or to investigate photopumped stimulated emission.              Optoelectric devices based on \"plastic\" semiconductors promise efficient, low cost devices which mimic the function of inorganic semiconductors but enjoy the benefits of being made of plastic: easy processing , mechanically flexible and durable. The market for the compact coherent light sources is large and growing.  ***",
