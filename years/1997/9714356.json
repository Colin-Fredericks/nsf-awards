 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is at the meeting point of theory and   experiment.  The isomerization and fragmentation reactions of small   hydrocarbons will be probed. Reactions for which rates, activation   parameters and mechanisms will be examined include: cis-trans   isomerization of ethylene-1,2-d2; structural and geometric isomerizations   of cyclopropane-1,2-d2, cyclopropane-1,2,3-d3 and cyclobutane-1,3-d2,   plus numerous methyl- and ethyl-substituted cyclopropanes; geometric   isomerization and elimination of molecular hydrogen from   cyclopentene-3,4-d2; isomerization of a number of bicycloalkanes; and   thermal decomposition of 2-methyl-2-propanol-1,1,1-d3.  All  of the   reactions are of interest to computational modelers, and for each there   is some uncertainty over rate, mechanism or stereochemistry.   With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic   Dynamics Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) are   supporting the research efforts of Drs. David K.Lewis and Bansi L. Kalra   of the Department of Chemistry at Connecticut College.  The project   examines the rates and detailed mechanisms of prototype isomerization and   fragmentation reactions of small hydrocarbons.  The work, at the   interface of theory and experiment,  will allow the continuation of a   well established undergraduate research program.",
