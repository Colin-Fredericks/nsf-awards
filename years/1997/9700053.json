 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to design and analyze discrete  algorithms solving hard combinatorial graph problems.  Because  many of these problems are NP-hard, an exact solution is often  not feasible; in such cases approximation algorithms are a viable  alternative. In addition to attacking approximation problems that  seem to require new strategies, a main goal is to investigate the  applicability of design principles developed successfully for  traditional discrete optimization problems to comparable tasks  occurring in other areas, in particular in Computational  Molecular Biology and Operations Research.  As problems of very  similar combinatorial flavor are found in different areas, it can  be expected that many solution methods are extendible as well.  For example, previous research has resulted in the comparison  method to analyze the approximation of the Maximum Independent  Set problem for bounded degree graphs.  A bipartite graph is used  to compare an optimal solution with a solution found by an  approximation algorithm.  It can be expected that this method  will have many more applications. The research plan includes new  approaches to algorithm design applicable to various problems in  algorithmic graph theory including Steiner trees and the graph  isomorphism problem.  Another goal is to study the limits of  approximability by polynomial time algorithms.  While several  spectacular results have been obtained in this area, for many  approximation problem the gap between  the quality of  the  approximate solutions obtained in polynomial time and the proven  hardness results remains large.",
