 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702744  Dickenson  This action is to support an integrated research and  educational-enhancement project submitted under the NSF  Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program. The  primary objectives include investigating the use of soil  improvement for insuring acceptable seismic performance of  waterfront retaining structures, and creating an  interdisciplinary, design-oriented course sequence for  undergraduates in civil, construction and environmental  engineering that will emphasize university-industry  collaboration.  The research component addresses the use of soil improvement  as a means of limiting to acceptable levels the earthquake  induced deformations of waterfront retaining structures.  Recent experience has shown that waterfront retaining  structures are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes, even  under only moderate levels of ground shaking, a primary  cause being the liquefaction of the saturated loose sandy  soils that typically prevail at port facilities. The  economic impact of these losses to the affected ports and to  commerce dependent on port operations has been severe.  Although soil improvement technology has been used to  mitigate liquefaction hazards at numerous ports around the  world, engineering standards for specifying the extent of  remedial soil treatment required to insure the  serviceability of the waterfront components after a design  level earthquake have not been developed.  The methods to be employed include centrifuge modeling of  anchored sheetpile bulkheads and rockfill dikes, and  supplementary numerical analyses. Anchored bulkheads and  rockfill dikes have been selected for investigation due to  their extensive use at port facilities in the United States.  Technology transfer is a key component of the research. The  results of this study will provide port engineers with  improved methods for evaluating the seismic performance of  common waterfront retaining structures, as well as design  guidelines for mitigating liquefaction hazards to these   structures.  The principal objective of the educational component is to  develop the curriculum for an integrated sequence of courses  that provide a \"capstone\" design experience for senior-level  undergraduates. The capstone sequence is intended to provide  students with a project that requires: (1) the formation of  a multi-disciplinary design team, (2) synthesis of acquired  knowledge in the planning and design of a significant civil  engineering project, and (3) additional experience with oral  and written presentation skills. Course sequences will  reflect the partnerships that exist in contemporary  engineering practice. The synthesis and application of prior  course work will be fostered by the student's participation  in a \"real-world\" design experience. In addition to the  coordinated engineering design, the projects will emphasize  ethics in practice, economics, environmental impacts, and  the influence of socio-political factors on design. This  integrated program will include: interdisciplinary team  building and the role of collaboration in practice, and the  influence of \"non-engineering\" factors on the design and  construction of civil engineering works. The significance of  the capstone program is that this instructional technique  has been identified as a method of enhancing student's  preparation for careers in the dynamic field of civil and  environmental engineering.",
