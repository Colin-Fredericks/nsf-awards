 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604849  Artalejo      The major response of animals, including humans, to fear or  stressful situations is termed the \"fight-or-flight\"  response. Such situations trigger the sudden release of  hormones called catecholamines (e.g. adrenaline) into the  blood stream; these catecholamines then go on to activate a  characteristic set of events including accelerated heart-  rate, hair-elevation etc. One major source of adrenaline is  the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla (AC cells). This  project concerns the mechanism whereby AC cells are able to  secrete adrenaline into the blood stream so quickly in  stressful situations. The investigators will use cells from  bovine adrenal medulla as a model system, but believe  similar processes are operative in other mammals, including  humans. Secretion is initiated by movement of Ca ions from  the outside to the inside of the cell, these Ca ions cause  vesicles inside the cell to fuse with the surface membrane  and release their contents. The investigators have  hypothesized that there is a specific type of Ca channel  that allows passage of Ca into the cell and is tightly  coupled to the machinery that regulates the fusion reaction.  Such tight coupling would explain why the cells can secrete  \"instantaneously\" when stimulated.    The prime objectives of this proposal is to validate this  hypothesis and to determine how cells recover from the  secretory event and get ready for the arrival of the next  stimulus. In the first objective the investigators will  employ a new method for detecting adrenaline secretion from  the cells that has a very fast time-resolution enabling us  to measure secretory events on a millisecond time scale.  This will allow them to determine how Ca entering the cell  can trigger the rapid release of adrenaline. In the second  objective, they will employ a different method that allows  them to measure the surface area of the cell. Use of this  method enables them to detect the recovery process that  ensue immediately after se cretion of adrenaline has  occurred.  In combination, these experiments will give a  much more detailed appreciation of the mechanism of this  important physiological event.",
