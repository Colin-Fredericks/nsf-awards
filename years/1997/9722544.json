Collins at the Kanagawa Industrial Technology Research  Institute, Ebina, Japan.  Dr. Collins will work with Dr.  Hikoji Wakoh, Chief Scientist, on a research project  entitled \"Building Regional Innovation Systems: A  Comparative Study of Kanagawa and Osaka, Japan.\"    The proposed research will study the role of regional  science and technology transfer policies in promoting local  economic development in two Japanese prefectures, Kanagawa  and Osaka.  Recently in Japan, a major goal of science and  technology policy has been to stimulate regional economies  by promoting technological innovation that uses resources  found in abundance locally.  Such policies are based on a  growing body of research showing that a richly endowed  science and technology infrastructure, coupled with  appropriate mechanisms for diffusing and transferring new  knowledge, contributes to an entrepreneurial business  environment.  Notable examples are California's Silicon  Valley and North Carolina's Research Triangle, which many  local governments in Japan wish to emulate.  This study will  examine two such regions in Japan, comparing activities and  policies of prefectural governments and research institutes  aimed at leveraging regional and national resources to  promote sustainable development.  The results will shed  light on the geography of technological innovation, as well  as provide insight into differences in regional policies  across Japan.  Finally, the project will contribute to the  Kanagawa Prefectural government's goal of understanding  technological innovation in the region and situating it in  the broader context of both regional and local science and  technology policy across the nation.  ***",
