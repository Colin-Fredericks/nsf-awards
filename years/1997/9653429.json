Major expansions in this critical industry are occurring in Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, Virginia and Maine.  Community colleges and secondary schools in these states are ramping up programs to prepare the needed workforce.       This project continues a successful national conference on advanced technological education in semiconductor manufacturing that has served as a forum for educators and industry people to share best practices, learn about industry needs, and enhance faculty capability through presentations and workshops.  The project funds annual conferences in 1997 and 1998.",
