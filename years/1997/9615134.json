 "awd_abstract_narration": "HARE  9615314    Host plant resistance is an effective means to protect crops against pests and pathogens. The value of host plant resistance in applied systems presents a paradox for natural systems:  if host plant resistance is so valuable, then why aren't all individuals of wild plant species resistant?  The paradox suggests that there is some cost to resistance that favors non-resistant plants when pests are absent.  The costs and benefits of plant resistance will be examined in jimson weed, Datura wrightii, where the presence or absence of glandular hairs is determined by a single gene.  Glandular plants are less suitable as hosts for the tobacco hornworm, a common insect pest of tobacco and tomato.  Specific objectives are: 1) to quantify the costs and benefits of producing glandular hairs when plants are grown under drought and non-drought conditions and attacked by different pest species; 2) to quantify the damage caused by different pest species attacking several plant populations along an environmental moisture gradient; 3) to predict the frequencies of glandular and non-glandular plants in different populations based on herbivore densities and cost-benefit data; and 4) to determine the mechanisms responsible for variation in susceptibility of glandular and non-glandular plants to different pest species.  Results will increase our understanding of how the interplay between the costs and benefits of plant resistance maintains genetic variation in plant defense against diverse pests.",
