The films will  be  characterized  using  dc  transport and  magnetic  susceptibility  measurements,  and  will then be studied using THz  spectroscopy.  The  results  will  be  used  to help illuminate  the  mechanisms  involved  in  CMR  in  the  manganese  perovskites  and   address  questions  about  the application of the materials  as  microwave  circuit  elements,  bolometric detectors, and  magnetic  sensors.  This  research  project is interdisciplinary in nature  and  will  involve collaboration between a leading academic laboratory and a  government laboratory.  %%%  This  experimental GOALI research project, supported in  part  by  the   Office  of  Multidisciplinary  Affairs  (OMA)  of  the  MPS  Directorate  makes use of sophisticated optical  measurements  to  clarify   the  interaction  of  magnetic  fields  with  \"Colossal  Magnetoresistance  Materials\" (CMR) of the  manganese  perovskite  family.  These CMR materials have extremely large sensitivity  in  their  electrical resistance to ambient magnetic field,  and  are  therefore  of  great interest for their potential application  in  magnetic  field  sensing elements as are used  in  magnetic  disk  drives,  as  well as for their scientific interest. Results  from  this research may include unusual new effects or structures which  may  find  application in technology. This  research  project  is  interdisciplinary  in  nature  and  will  involve   collaboration  between   a   leading  academic  laboratory  and   a   government  laboratory.  ***",
