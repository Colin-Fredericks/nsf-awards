 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617404  Hart  This project will test the hypothesis that dusky-footed  woodrats use the  fresh leaves of particular plants to control nest-borne  ectoparasites.  If  this proves to be true,  it would be the first known case of  a mammal using  the biocidal substances of a plant as a means of combating  nest infestation  by blood-sucking ectoparasites such as fleas.  In the study  population,  woodrats place sprigs of freshly gathered bay leaves near  the rim of their  sleeping nests, and pilot observations suggest that bay  leaves are effective  in preventing the hatching of flea eggs.  They may be  effective against flea  larvae and adult fleas and against mites and ticks as well.  Perhaps stickhouses in  areas with bay trees harbor woodrats with fewer fleas and  ticks than those  in areas devoid of bay or other plants with biocidal  properties.  These questions  will be addressed with a series of observational and  experimental studies,  including remote monitoring of nest activities with  \"videostick\" cameras, tests  of the biocidal properties of plant materials against  ectoparasitic insects,  experimental manipulation of parasiteload, and measurement  of the impact of  nest material collection on survival and fitness. Improved  understanding of the  interactions between woodrats and their ectoparasites is of  considerable  theoretical interest theoretical interest because of  implications for the use of  medicinal plants by animals other than humans, and has  public health  implications as well. This study is also of interest because  the relationship  between behavior and the exploitation of plants as nest  protectants may   represent another step in the co-evolution of woodrats and  their ectoparasites.  Additionally, the ticks of woodrats are an important  reservoir of Lyme  disease and their fleas are potential vectors of plague.  Since woodrats occur  in or near many public parks as well as in rural areas, and  their large houses  attract human attention, they constitute a risk.",
