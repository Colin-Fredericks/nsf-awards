This equipment will enhance   research in a number of areas including the following: (1) binding and   fluorescence quenching experiments to probe partially folded states of   proteins, (2) the role of protein surface loops in the reaction catalyzed   by the interfacial enzyme cholesterol oxidase, and  (3) the mechanism of   the enzymes enoyl-CoA hydratase and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.     The fluorescence spectrometer counts photons of light in the UV and   visible regions  and when a sample of material is illuminated by UV   light,  filtered to absorb the reflected UV light, then only visible   fluorescence is detected. The spectrometer is used in fluorescence   quenching experiments which occur at fast rates, and will allow   relaxation processes to be used at various temperatures.        ***",
