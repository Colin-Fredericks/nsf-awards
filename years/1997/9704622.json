Olagunju   Proposal DMS-9704622       INSTABILITIES AND BIFURCATIONS IN NON-NEWTONIAN SHEAR FLOWS           ABSTRACT    In this project we shall undertake the analysis of instabilities and  bifurcations in flows of non-Newtonian (or viscoelastic)  fluids.  Particular emphasis will be paid to three dimensional shear flows.  Among the issues that will be investigated are:  (a) the mechanism(s)  that cause instabilities in viscoelastic flows (b) what rheological and  hydrodynamical factors are responsible for the instabilities and (c)  the nature of bifurcations that occur once instability has set in. Of  great interest will be to asses the role of rheological factors such  as  first and second normal stress differences,  and shear thinning in  the onset and development of instabilities. The importance of  hydrodynamical and geometrical factors like inertia, surface tension  and aspect ratios will also be investigated.  To this end we shall  consider shear flows in different geometries and will employ a number  of different constitutive models such as  the Oldroyd--B, Phan--Thien  Tanner, Johnson Segalman and the Giesekus models. The results of our  analysis will be compared with available experimental results. In  addition to providing qualitative as well as quantitative results on  instabilities and bifurcations our results will also provide valuable  information on how well different constitutive models describe not only  simple shear flows but complex flows as well.    Non--Newtonian (or viscoelastic) fluids which are the subject of this  project include materials used in a wide ranging number of industrial  and scientific applications.  Examples are polymers (used in the  plastic industry), paints, industrial inks, suspensions, emulsions and  biological fluids.  The nature and behavior of these fluids can be  radically different from ordinary fluids such as water (Newtonian  fluids) with which we are much more familiar. During industrial  processing and scientific experiments thes e fluids are subjected to  shearing motions. For example in order to determine the properties of  new materials they are placed in instruments called rheometers and  sheared. Data obtained from the subsequent motion are then used in  determining the relevant material properties. It is known from  applications and experiments that when viscoelastic fluids undergo  shearing the nature of the flow may change drastically in ways that may  lead to unpredictable results. These drastic changes are termed  instabilities. Because these instabilities can have undesirable as well  as unexpected consequences during industrial processing with great  economic implications,  it is important for us to understand the  factors that cause and sustain them.  Such an understanding will  provide a means  of predicting when such instabilities will occur and  what the effect will be on the flow when they occur. This will enable  us to set parameters during experiments and industrial processing so  that instabilities can be prevented. In this project we will try to  provide answers to these and other related issues by studying and  analyzing mathematical equations that describe the flow of viscoelastic  fluids.  This work will be an important contribution to the Federal  Government's strategic initiatives in the areas of materials and  manufacturing.",
