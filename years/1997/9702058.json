 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702058  Chang  The goal os this research project is to develop an intelligent 3-  Dimension seismic base isolation system aimed at protecting  critical  high-tech manufacturing buildings and their contents.  The  building contents, which usually are far more valuable than the  building itself, consisting of delicate equipment, computers,  chip or disk products, etc.  The ratio of the content loads to  the structural dead loads is typically high for such high-tech  industrial plants.  These content loads change in magnitude and  location frequently and usually will cause horizontal and  vertical eccentricities which in turn will cause ampliation of  torsion, tilting, and rocking responses.  The intelligent  protective systems proposed are designed to generate liquid  artificial mass as needed to maintain the fundamental natural  frequencies of the isolated building as a constant, and also  produce a sound alarm if any isolator is over loaded.  The smart  system can also adjust its own properties to fine tune the  isolation system automatically.  If the smart system does not  have to be active during a strong earthquake in order to function  effectively both for vertical thrust fault prone regions or  lateral strike-slip fault prone regions.    An integral, companion educational program O.K. consisting of  innovative system design, demonstrations and workshops will  capture the interest of young adults, to give undergraduates the  opportunity to indulge their academic curiosities, and to prepare  graduate students for a productive career in intelligent building  design will also be implemented.  ***",
