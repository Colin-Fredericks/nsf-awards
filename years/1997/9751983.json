 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Integrated Natural Resources Technology Program demonstrates an interdisciplinary approach to educating technically advanced field technicians for ecosystem-based management.  The program differs from traditional natural resources and resource-related programs that focus on individual disciplines such as forestry, fisheries or wildlife.  Instead, the project embodies a systems perspective to information gathering, data analysis, and ecosystem management.  The program, a two-year, high-tech technician curriculum with a three-year option for students transferring to a four-year institution is: 1 ) developing, implementing, evaluating, and disseminating an outcome-driven curriculum; 2) developing and implementing a Summer Institute to assist community college faculty in adopting an integrated perspective; and 3) developing and implementing integrated field experiences.  It has strong support from local public and private natural resources employers and from education--the program articulates with three university and two high school natural resources programs.  The program has identified skills to be acquired by students in the program, conducted an employability survey to ensure these skills meet employer needs and that jobs are available, developed curriculum framework, and acquired agreements to collaborate with employers in developing cooperative work experiences.",
