 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT 9722819  White      This U.S.-Hungary research project between J. Michael White of the University of Texas, Austin, and Frigyes Solymosi of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Solid State and Radiochemistry, Szeged, will examine heterogeneous catalytic oxidation reactions of hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon molecules on single crystal transition metal surfaces.  Specifically, Hungarian participants will study reactivity of surface complexes that are key intermediates in catalytic reactions.  To accomplish this they will employ ultra-high vacuum chambers.  The U.S. team will focus on the dynamics of photon-driven oxidation reactions involving adsorbed reaction precursors by using a suite of surface sensitive spectroscopic methods.  Results are expected to contribute to our basic understanding of a broad range of oxidation reactions that occur between hydrocarbons and fluorocarbons at heterogeneous interfaces that have considerable societal impact on a global scale.    This project in analytical and surface chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.  ??",
