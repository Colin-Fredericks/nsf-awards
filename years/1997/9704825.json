 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704825  McDuff       One of the main tools that has recently revolutionized the study  of symplectic geometry is the use of analytic methods (non-linear  versions of the Cauchy-Riemann equations).  In the past year, a  serious technical problem in this theory has been overcome, so that it  now applies to all manifolds.  In collaboration with Lalonde and  Polterovich, McDuff is applying this improved theory to study  properties of the group of diffeomorphisms of a manifold that preserve  its symplectic structure.  This group has a subgroup of finite  codimension that is generated by Hamiltonian functions, but it is not  known in general whether this group is always closed in the full  group.  If it were, one might be able to formulate a topological  reason for a symplectomorphism to be generated by a function (rather  than a one-form).  Another question that McDuff is working on (in  collaboration with Abreu) is the extent to which the topological  structure of the group of symplectomorphisms changes as the underlying  symplectic structure changes.  A particularly simple version of this  problem appears when the underlying manifold is the product of two  two-dimensional spheres and one changes the relative size of the  spheres.  They have shown that there is an even-dimensional cohomology  class whose dimension jumps up by four each time the size of the  larger sphere increases by another unit.  They are working on  understanding the mechanism that produces this behavior.       A symplectic structure is a very basic kind of geometric  structure that underlies almost all the equations of classical and  quantum physics.  In the last fifteen years, new tools have been  developed that allow mathematicians for the first time to gain some  understanding of the global meaning of this kind of structure.  The  most significant developments of the past few years concern, on the  one hand, the elucidation of the structure of four-dimensional  symplectic spaces and, on the other, new understanding of the wa ys  that one can move around in a symplectic space.  Together with  Lalonde, McDuff completed the classification of a specially simple  kind of symplectic 4-manifold called a ruled surface and is in the  process of studying the structure of more complicated examples.  She  is also investigating the question of how much energy it takes to  achieve a particular movement of space, and to find ways of estimating  this energy on curved manifolds.  ***",
