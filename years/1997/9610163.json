 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be carried out to create methods to lay out, analyze,   outsource, assemble, and debug complex mechanical assemblies. To accomplish   this, ways must be found to capture their fundamental structure,  including the designer's strategy for locating the parts accurately with   respect to each other. A concept called the `datum flow chain` will be   defined and elaborated to capture this logic.  Graph theory will be used to   define the properties of datum flow chains.  They will be explored   computationally and tested on real assembly examples from the aircraft and   auto industries to see how well they can capture the information designers   need in order to solve typical assembly process design problems as well as   to see how well they scale to large problems.  The properties of different   kinds of assembly features will be defined and modeled mathematically,   including those that do not constrain a joint completely.  A design process   will be created that permits layout designers to explore the consequences   for assembly and tolerances resulting from choices among different datum   flow chains, feasible assembly sequences, choices of assembly mating   features, and tolerances on the location and shape of these features.  If successful, this research will result in increased understanding of how   to model mechanical assemblies and make it easier to analyze them very early   in the product design cycle.  This capability could be beneficial to   companies that want to improve the speed of their product development   process.  Improved models of assemblies could also be incorporated into   engineering education, providing deeper understanding of the fundamentals of   engineering systems and better preparing students to be productive in   industry.",
