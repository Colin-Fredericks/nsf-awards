These hyperthermophiles are the most  closely related to the universal ancestor for all life (from  small subunit rRNA and gene duplication data) which supports  the theory that life arose in highly reduced, high  temperature environments such as those encountered at  hydrothermal vent systems. Recently scientists  proposed a  mechanism for the synthesis of the first molecules for life  in which pyrite can be synthesized abiotically with hydrogen  as a product, laying the framework for the evolution of the  first metabolic cycles. The central hypothesis of this study  maintains that the abiotic synthesis of pyrite provides the  essential properties for sequestering the energy sources for  chemoautotrophic metabolism of the deepest lineages of life.  Drs. Luther and Reysenbach believe that under an extreme  chemical and physical environment microorganisms can utilize  the resources provided on the pyrite surfaces for sustained  metabolism. They also believe that these organisms will  closely represent early life forms that may have occupied  similar extreme habitats. Furthermore, since molecular  phylogenetic evidence exists that the deepest of these  thermophilic lineages inhabit iron and sulfidic-rich  environments at deep-sea hydrothermal vents, they are well-  positioned to test these assertions.    The objective of  this research are: 1. To  establish whether pyrite and the associated adsorbed trace  metals and simple inorganic molecules will mediate the  microbial community structure in high temperature aquatic  environments. 2. To determine whether pyrite synthesis can  be predicted,  through the simultaneous measurement of FeS  and hydrogen sulfide. This project clearly addresses most of  the primary mandates of the LExEn research program. In this  interdisciplinary study these collaborators will integrate  molecular genetic approaches with in situ geochemistry to  study the diversity, ecology, and evolutionary history of  the microorganisms thriving in extreme habitats where  intense redox and temperature gradients exist.",
