This project is based on the engineering design experiences for seventh and eighth grades. It provides support for teachers in their understanding of the design experience and of learning goals for students.  The materials include short papers, how-to instructions, assessment items, and videos demonstrating classroom experiences, technical instructions and assembly of materials. In addition a sixth grade challenge that can be used in stand alone classrooms or in team situations provides a bridge from World in Motion I to the engineering design experience.  The evaluation provides data demonstrating the effectiveness of the materials.",
