 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-9702908  Abstract - J. Blondin    Computers have made an important impact on both astrophysics  research and education over the last several years. Numerical  simulations on modern supercomputers have made great strides in  our ability to do research in virtually every subfield of  astrophysics, from computing chaotic planetary orbits to the  models of the formation of large-scale structure in the Universe.  At the same time, computers have become an ever-growing presence  in our nation's classrooms. Now, with the increasing popularity  of the World Wide Web, those computers are opening up the  classroom to the world.  This is a project to exploit this  natural link between computational astrophysics and computer-  based education.    The educational aspect of this project will draw on a variety of  different avenues, including the development of a new, computer-  based astronomy lab at NCSU for non-science undergraduates, the  creation of web sites intended to convey the excitement of  current astrophysics research to the general public by drawing on  the visually striking results of numerical simulations, the  teaching on numerical methods in upper-level physics courses, and  the involvement of undergraduates in computational astrophysics  research.    The research aspect of this project will focus on the  hydrodynamics of mass and angular momentum transfer in X-ray  binary stars. However, this work will have far reaching impact,  for the phenomenon of mass transfer is an important process in a  wide range of binary star systems. By studying X-ray pulsars,  where one has a quantitative measure of both the mass and angular  momentum accretion rate, one can learn about the physics of Roche  lobe overflow, tidal stream impact, accretion disk formation,  disk winds, and much more. Furthermore, the current wealth of  observational data from satellites such as ASCA, BATSE, and XTE  will greatly accelerate the progress in this fi eld over the next  few years, and the numerical models generated in the proposed  research will provide an important key to interpreting this new  data.",
