 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent addition of computer simulations into the laboratories of several of the biology courses has greatly enhanced the learning experience of students.  By combining the practical experience of traditional wet laboratories with the unique opportunities for student input and discovery that is available through computer simulations, students in these laboratories are exposed to and actively participate in all phases of the scientific process ranging from the inception of experimental design to the dissemination of experimental results.  In this project, the number and types of laboratories for which this pedagogic model is offered are expanded to include laboratories involving modern molecular techniques.  Integration of computer simulations with wet laboratory exercises provides a better learning environment than either type of exercise provides alone.  Because of past equipment limitations, the university has been unable to offer wet laboratories to complement the computer simulation of molecular techniques used in Genetics and Cell and Molecular Biology.  A new laboratory course entitled Molecular Techniques in Biology has been developed to serve as a general companion course for lecture-only courses.  By these additions to the curriculum, students are better prepared to conduct independent research, enter the competitive job market, or enter graduate school.  Success of these laboratories can be evaluated using the departmental learning outcomes assessment process.  Parameters used for this assessment include the number of students participating in local, regional, and national scientific meetings; the number of publications written by students; and the number of students accepted into competitive graduate and professional programs.  An additional parameter includes job placement in the discipline within 24 months of graduation.  Plans for dissemination of this project's results include sponsoring an on-site training program for sister institutions.  *",
