 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's main research interests lie at the (less and  less clearly defined) border between mathematics and  theoretical physics.  Physics provides an ever-evolving  source of inspiration and intuition for the formulation of  mathematical problems.  The two subjects currently pursued  are both inspired by surface physics, namely the description  of the behavior of two-dimensional objects, such as  membranes, or interfaces between different media, with  possible applications to biology (membrane in a solvent,  protein folding).  Remarkably, new mathematical tools needed  to develop our understanding of surface physics have emerged  in the very different context of string theory, which aims  at a unified description of the matter and space  interactions in the universe.  Surfaces emerge in this  framework as the trajectories of loop-like particles  (strings).  The research is principally concerned with  (1)  The physical and mathematical aspects of discrete two-  dimensional quantum gravity, a simple model of string  theory, in which discretized surfaces resembling fishing  nets are generated by a powerful tool: the random matrix  models and (2) The various combinatorial and algebraic  problems linked to the concept of folding in surface and  polymer physics.  In particular, the PI will investigate  possible crumpling or folding transitions of surfaces when  physical parameters such as temperature or bending rigidity  are varied.",
