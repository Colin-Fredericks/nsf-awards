One of the critical research issues  of ECD is design for disassembly (DFD).  Product disassembly  considerations have major impact on serviceability and  various end-of-product life cycle issues such as recycling,  reuse, and remanufacturing.  This research project attempts  to conduct deeper investigations into the disassembly  process by (1) Formalizing the disassembly process using  graph theory and abstract algebra techniques and, (2)  Developing an advanced design tool to evaluate product  \"greenness\" at the concept design and final design stages.  The context chosen is mechanical/electromechanical  artifacts.  The design information is fuzzy (of approximate  nature) in the early design stages.    However, crucial design decisions are made at the early  design stages.  As the design activity proceeds to the final  stage,  the design variables start assuming crisp values.  However, there are fewer avenues to improve product  greenness at the final design stages since there is less  flexibility to incorporate the redesign suggestions.  Maximum benefits will be reaped if a phased evaluation is  performed at the concept and final design stages.    A formal methodology for representing and processing  imprecise design information of a conceptual artifact is  proposed in this study.  The green evaluator will have  different evaluation perspectives for the concept and final  design artifacts -- moving from generality to specificity.  Fuzzy neural networks (FNN) in conjunction with expert  reasoning system will be used to build this green evaluation  design tool to determine the initial feasibility and green  indices of a candidate design.  The approach adopted in this  study is to infer various life-cycle disassembly,  serviceability, and recycling characteristics; provide   qualitative evaluation by identifying portions of a design  artifact that are environmentally burdensome; and compute  appropriate green indices.  Component-level and productlevel  green indices will be computed in terms of factors such as  relative disassembly cost and time, relative service cost  and time, and relative product salvage value.  Research  issues relating to formalization of disassembly process and  development of a computational design tool will involve  interaction with the industrial supporters (Ford, Boeing,  Finale International Tool, and Home, Inc.) of this project.  The concepts and computational tools discussed in this study  will lead to an increased understanding of the disassembly  process and the development of advanced computer-based  design tools to produce environment-friendly products.  This  will help the U.S. companies to meet the targeted ecological  goals and gain advantage in the global marketplace.  The  Manufacturing Research and Training Center (MRTC), MO, has  kindly agreed to cost share $24,976 over a period of two  years.  ***",
