 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Engineering has a modern undergraduate materials laboratory equipped with an image analysis system.  This system has been used to improve the capability of students to view and analyze microscopic structure.  However, it has been limited to traditional optical microscopes and two-dimensional (2-D) views on video monitors.  This project seeks to remove this limitation through the acquisition of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) and Virtual i.O VGA glasses.  The AFM allows students to see views on the molecular arrangement level.  However, these views are still presented on a VGA monitor as a 2-D view of a three-dimensional (3-D) view.  The Virtual i.O VGA glasses correct this deficiency.  Through the use of special software, the normal static view from the AFM is turned into a virtual 3-D view.  Thus, the virtual image of the instructor is able to walk onto the object being viewed and point out the significant details.  Students, wearing the Virtual i.O VGA glasses, are able to roam about the virtual 3-D view of the object being studied.  Another objective is to improve the ability of students to understand 3-D visualizations and particularly 3-D object rotation.  Pre- and post-tests evaluate whether increased understanding has taken place.  *",
