 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information Retrieval (IR) research involves computer programs to organize, classify, retrieve, evaluate, and display databases and search results. The IR field has a long history of rigorous evaluation in narrowly defined test environments. However, the current trend is toward more realistic test environments with larger databases, more sophisticated search engines, and evaluation of the human-system contribution to the search process. The focus of this workshop is to begin development of a toolkit of programs, environments, and tasks to be made widely available to researchers. The goal of the toolkit is to provide a more uniform basis for comparison of research by different groups and under different circumstances. Workshop presentations are devoted to identifying the available tools, their limitations, and the needs of current and future research. Reports from smaller working groups are to be integrated into a plan that will guide toolkit development in the near future. Furter information about the workshop and the workshop reports is available at <http://www.pitt.edu/~korfhage/ir-tools.html>.",
