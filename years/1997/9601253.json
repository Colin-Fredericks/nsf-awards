 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to continue developing an  empirically based, dynamic general equilibrium framework for  analyzing monetary policy.  This effort will have two basic  components: to better understand the monetary policy making  process itself, and to develop improved models of the links  between monetary policy and the performance of the overall  economy.  The first component seeks to endogenize monetary policy  by thinking of it as being determined by a purposeful policy  maker who does not have the ability to commit to future actions.  This project will investigate the possibility that the take-off  of inflation in the 1970s reflects in part the kind of  instability that can arise when monetary policy is conducted in  the absence of commitment.  An important objective of this  proposal is to analyze alternative feasible institutional  arrangements that could give rise to a more stable monetary  policy.      The second component of this project focuses on developing  improved models of the economy.  For an analysis of alternative  monetary policy regimes to be persuasive, it must be built upon a  sound model.  One strand of the proposed research builds on the  author's previous work developing a framework for integrating  monetary and business cycle phenomena.  Specifically, the project  will explore various factors that can help account quantitatively  for the observation that the price effects of monetary policy  disturbances appear to be small, while the output effects are  relatively larger.    In a third strand of research the investigator will continue his  work reconciling the salient characteristics of asset returns  with macroeconomic models.  This is important because virtually  any view about the way money affects the economy assigns a  central role to asset markets.  The investigator will also  explore the possibility that expectational shocks play an  important role in the business cycle.  Understanding what are the  ultimate impulses to the business cycle is likely  to be important  in any assessment of alternative monetary policies.  Finally, the  investigator will use financial market data to obtain improved  estimates of the exogenous component of monetary policy.  Such  measures play an important role in efforts to identify the  channels by which money affects the economy.",
