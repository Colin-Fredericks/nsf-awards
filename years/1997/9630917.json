 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9630917  Luke Achenie    New Solvents are developed in response to one or more of the following:  (i) a desire for  better performance or reduced cost, (ii) the presence of a new process (iii) change in federal and state environmental regulations and (iv) safety and health considerations.    Developing new solvents with improved properties is, in general, a very time consuming and expensive process involving a combination of heuristics and costly experimental studies.  In these trial and error approaches, different solvents are synthesized, their physical and/or chemical properties are measured or inferred and compared with the desire properties for that application.    This proposal deals with initiating a systems research approach into finding a systematic framework for designing cleaning solvents for the printing industry.  This frame work simultaneously takes into consideration process performance and economics as well as health, safety and environmental targets.  An \"optimal\" blanket wash (cleaning solvent for the printing press) designed through a systematic procedure can result in significant energy savings as well as minimal environmental impact.  ***",
