 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is supporting   Professor D. Kouri of the University of Houston.  In this next grant   period he we will continue to pursue computational implementation and   testing of the Time-Independent Wavepacket Divide-and-Conquer (TIWDC)   approach.  The immediate objectives are: a) Testing the DC-procedure   whereby the initial arrangement is also uncoupled from the strong   interaction region.  b) Testing the DC strategy for uncoupling the   vibrational-rotational, pure rotational, and elastic final state   interaction regions so that the maximum benefit of the approach can be   realized. c) Applying the DC procedure to H+O2 -> OH+O in order to try   and carry out the first ever completely ab initio calculation of   state-to-state reaction cross sections for the system as a function of   energy.  He also will carry out the first full 3D tests of the TIWDC   method for photodissociation of HOD, with emphasis on a comparison with   experiment when the HOD is vibrationally hot.  Secondly, he will continue   development of the distributed approximating functionals (DAFs),   including the exploration of a new class of DAFs that are related to   various interpolation schemes.  These investigations will also study the   fitting of multidimensional potential energy surfaces using finite   amounts of ab initio input data, with particular emphasis on   electronically non-adiabatic systems.  Third, he will continue studies of   a new method being developed for diagonalizing extremely large matrices   with very dense eigenspectra.  Finally, he will begin work on developing   and testing new approximation methods for solving the quantum equations   for reactions involving more than 4 atoms in order to simulate more   complex chemical systems.   The research supported here focuses on developing robust, efficient, and   highly stable methods for solving the partial differential equations   which are used to describe fundamental chemical reaction processes.    Because of the enormous complexity of the equations, solutions are   feasible only by using the most powerful, high-speed, large-memory   computers.  However, the development of a detailed understanding of the   elementary chemical reaction process can open up the possibilities of   controlling chemical reactions in order to maximize desired products.    These studies are also used in simulating numerically fundamental   processes that occur in the earth's atmosphere, in order to understand   and better deal with pollution.  Such studies also find application in   modeling the detailed chemistry of combustion in order to develop   pollution-free propulsion systems.  In addition, some of the techniques   being developed can also be used to solve other, enormously important   partial differential equations.  Thus, the techniques being developed   show great promise for making it possible to solve equations ranging from   long term weather forecasting, to other equations used to model   combustion.",
