 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701013  Gordon    This award supports a conference on the arithmetic and geometry of algebraic cycles.  As a subfield of algebraic geometry, the subject of algebraic cycles has thrived through its energetic interaction with algebraic K-theory, Hodge theory, arithmetic algebraic geometry, number theory, and topology.  The immense recent progress in algebraic cycles, based on so many interactions with so many other areas of mathematics, has made the subject less accessible to graduate students and non-specialists.  The goal of this conference is to have leading experts who study algebraic cycles from all these different directions speak on their various points of view, aiming their talks to graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s as well as to researchers who work in other aspects of the arithmetic or geometry of algebraic cycles.    Algebraic geometry has a long and important history in mathematics, particularly because it interacts with so many other fields of mathematics, such as topology, analysis, algebra, and number theory.  It has flourished during the last half of the twentieth century, especially in this country.  At its simplest and most fundamental level, algebraic geometry studies sets defined by polynomial equations. Such sets arise in many problems in computer science and robotics, and there is increasing interaction between algebraic geometry and these fields.",
