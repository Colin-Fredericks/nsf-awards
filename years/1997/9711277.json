 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9711277  Peter King and Jan Miller, University of Utah    Travel support will be provided to a group of twelve U.S. academic researchers to participate at the U.S.-South Africa (S.A.) workshop on particulate and multiphase processes on June 30-July 1, 1997, and to visit academic and industrial institutions for promoting collaborative activities in the field of minerals and chemical engineering.  The main purpose of the workshop to establish trends in fundamental research, present new research results obtained in both countries, and identify opportunities and topics for future collaborations.  The multiphase particulate systems to be considered include particle comminution, size separation, flotation, fluidization, three-phase flows, pneumatic and slurry transportation of solids.    The S.A. workshop will be co-chaired by Dr. Roy Marcus, President of the Engineering Association in South Africa.  He will be the link with other S.A. research institutions and industry.    The field of particulate and multiphase processes is essential in mineral, chemical, and environmental processes.  Research in this field has major relevance in both countries, and considerable benefits from research have been obtained.  A synergistic effect with benefits to both sides is expected by organizing the workshop and short working visits by small groups to S.A. universities and industry.    This workshop is being supported by the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems and the Division of International Programs.",
