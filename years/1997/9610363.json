 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with the development of methods  and procedures for predicting response of vibroimpact  systems to random excitation. Typical fields of applications  include Engineering (response of moored bodies to ocean  waves) and Power Engineering, particularly Nuclear (flow-  induced vibrations of fuel bundles within channelling tubes;  and of heat exchanger tubes impacting against support  plates). Other potential applications include Railway  Machinery (vehicle dynamics with impact-type wheel/rail  interactions) and Rotating Machinery (gearboxes with  reversals of motion). A quasiconservative stochastic  averaging method is used together with a Fourier series  expansion in a `rapid` time, within a response cycle. In  addition, a new approximation procedure is developed and  evaluated which is based on the dominating contribution of  the impacts into overall spectral density of response  acceleration for lightly damped systems. The model of a  periodic excitation with random phase modulation is used to  predict subharmonic response of moored offshore platforms to  ocean waves, and to predict transitions between planar and  whirling flow-induced vibrations of tubes in heat  exchangers. Fundamental theory of nonlinear vibration and  control would benefit through new analytical methods and  procedures developed during the course of this research and  some new specific solutions obtained for (strongly  nonlinear) systems. Also, this research will assist in  response prediction and control, as well as predicting  and/or testing reliability and developing design guidelines  for systems in offshore and power engineering.",
