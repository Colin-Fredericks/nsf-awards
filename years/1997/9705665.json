 "awd_abstract_narration": "An NSF-Industrial Postdoctoral Fellow, Anna C. Gilbert, carries  out research jointly in the Department of Mathematics at Yale  University and AT&T Labs-Research.  The Faculty Mentor at Yale is  Ronald Coifman, Professor of Mathematics, and the supervisor at  AT&T is Dr. Walter Willinger.  We envisage two general areas of  research, both of which are of direct interest to AT&T: (1)  wavelet techniques for analysis and performance management of  network traffic, (2) wavelet techniques for homogenization of  differential equations.  The common element of these two areas is  the use of wavelets to decompose a problem into many scales and  to analyze which scales are crucial to solving the problem.    The research which will be conducted with Dr. Walter Willinger at  AT&T will include using wavelets to investigate the physical  model of Willinger, et al, at a basic level.  We want to model  and to tune queues, switches, and other component network  components in wavelet terms and then to derive the properties, in  wavelet terms, of the corresponding self-similar behavior.  There  are so many data sets available and in such detail that we want  to extract more detailed and more basic information than just the  Hurst parameter.  We want to build a structural model of the data  and the networks which produce that data.    The research which will be conducted with Prof. Ronald Coifman at  Yale University will include extending the methods developed in  Anna C. Gilbert's thesis.  We will construct multiresolution  methods for the reduction and homogenization of partial  differential equations.  We envision using these techniques in  many different applications.  In particular, we would like to use  these homogenization techniques to reconstruct a rough surface  off which electromagnetic waves are scattered.  We would also  compare the MRA homogenization methods for n-dimensional elliptic  PDEs with the classical theory.    Anna Gilbert completed her thesis under the supervision of I.  Daubechies at Princ eton University in June, 1997.  In it she  compares the wavelet techniques for homogenization with classical  analytical techniques, develops a wavelet method for homogenizing  nonlinear ordinary differential equations, and applies these  methods to a reaction-diffusion model.    This GOALI project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
