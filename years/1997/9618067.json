The isotopic temperature record from this  core demonstrated that, during the last glacial period,  temperatures at Huascaran were colder than today, supporting  various other lines of evidence that the tropics were indeed colder  during the last glacial period.  These findings are consistent with  ice core records from Greenland and Antarctica which extend into  the last glacial period.  The high degree of covariation between  all these records during the Glacier termination argues that there  are strong teleconnections between these sites which are probably  responding to the same (or similar) forcing functions.  This award  supports measurements of the elements and isotopic composition of  the trapped gases in the Huascaran ice core.  These records will  provide definitive evidence for the existence of glacial-age ice at  Huascaran.  The gas records will refine the timescale for the  Huascaran core to within 500 years of that ascribed to the GISP II  ice core from central Greenland.  The gas records will also allow  the transfer of the Huascaran climate records into a \"common  temporal framework.\"  In addition, leads and lags between all these  climate records and many other records covering the last  deglaciation can be investigated.  The ultimate goal in this  research is to gain insight into the mechanisms which caused the  Earth to move out of the last glacial period by establishing the  sequence of events which led to the deglaciation.  Placing the  tropical climate events from Huascaran in this sequence will help  decipher the nature of the forcing mechanisms responsible for the  last termination.",
