It  will bring together researchers with expertise  in  a  broad range of topics considered to be at the forefront of global  issues  in solid state chemistry and materials. The support  will  be provided for the educational aspects of the conference, namely  to  provide money for a \"scholarship\" program to support 10  U.S.  contributions from students, postdocs, and new faculty,  and  for  registration   and  partial  travel  support   for   other   U.S.  participants  of renown in the area of solid state chemistry  and  materials.  The cost of  U.S. participation in this international  meeting is being cost shared by the Gordon Research Conference.  %%%  This  is  one  of  four major meetings on solid  state  chemistry  occurring  in 1996-1997 that will receive NSF support  and  which  together  will help to serve as an information base for  the  NSF  Workshop  on Solid State Chemistry to be held late in  1997.  The  purpose  of  this  meeting  is  to bring  together  international  researchers with expertise over a broad range of topical areas in  solid state chemistry and materials to survey those considered to  be of high priority by the international community.  ***",
