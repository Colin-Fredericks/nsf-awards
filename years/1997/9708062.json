 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708062  Jelinski    This Focused Research Group (FRG) award, supported by  MPS/DMR, MPS/OMA, and BIO/MCB, seeks to understand the  structure-function relationships in a model biomolecular  material - spider silk.  The project draws on the  synergistic skills of the four Principal Investigators (PIs)  Lynn Jelinski (Cornell; NMR and biomaterials), David Kaplan  (Tufts; biotechnology and proteins), David Grubb (Cornell; x-  ray diffraction and mechanical properties of fibers) and Ron  Eby (Akron; x-ray diffraction and polymer science).  The  goal is to understand and mimic the design and crystal-  growth processes found in a naturally occurring system in  order to obtain an improved structural material.  To this  end, the project team will share samples, including various  silks collected in the wild, fibers produced from  genetically engineered silk-like proteins, and fibers  produced from proteins containing a reversible redox switch  to control solubility.  The primary characterization  techniques will include mechanical measurements, synchrotron  x-ray diffraction, and solid state NMR spectroscopy.  The  FRG will provide a focus for interdisciplinary education and  will serve to integrate education and research.  The  objectives are  1  to correlate the structure and materials  properties of different natural silks with their protein  content and sequence;  2  to correlate the structure and  materials properties of regenerated fibers and fibers drawn  from silk-like proteins made by recombinant DNA technology;   3  to design into silks a reversible redox switch to  control solution properties, and then to test films and  fibers made of this material.  %%%  This research will lead to a better understanding of the  relationships between structure and function in protein  polymers and lead to protein polymers with improved  mechanical properties.  The research will also serve as a  springboard from which undergraduate and graduate students  will be exposed to a wide range of interdisciplinary  s cience.  ***",
