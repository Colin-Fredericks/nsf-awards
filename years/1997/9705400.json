 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705400  Coffman    In-Touch Science provides informal learning experiences to help  children ages 8 to 11 understand the science in their everyday  lives.  Each science theme is introduced through a hands-on  activity in one subject area and is reinforced through a second  experience based in a different field of science.  By linking  concepts common to the paired fields, the program teaches children  to make connections between what they've learned in one context and  what they observe in another arena.  The program targets children  enrolled in special needs programs, 4-H clubs, school-age child  care facilities, and home schooling.  The program engages, supports  and sustains community science facilitators, the majority of whom  are not experienced educators.  They will be trained to work with  the children, using the Learning Cycle, a guided discovery  strategy.  Cornell developed the curricula for three paired  disciplines: 1) Engineering and Plant Science, 2) Animal Science  and Fiber Science, and 3) Chemistry and Environmental Science.   Instructional materials for the project consist of three curricula,  a facilitator-training guide, and supply kits.",
