 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703483  Fife    Solid and liquid materials can exist in different ``states'', whether  the concept of state is that of the usual liquid/solid phase, or some  other condition like a variant of a crystal, etc.  The processes which  cause and accompany changes of state, while usually known in broad  terms, often also have mysterious aspects.  The understanding of these  processes is a basic thrust of present day materials science.  In the  face of little known basic physics, mathematical models are continually  being proposed in the hopes of shedding insight.  The present proposal  focusses attention on certain classes of continuum models for the  spatio-temporal variation of phase transformations.  In typical cases,  this variation consists of motion of an interface between two phases  or between more general types of states. Different models do not  always predict the same thing, an example being the detailed nature of  the motion of the interface in anisotropic media.  One aim in the  proposed work will be to better elucidate the differing assumptions of  important classes of models, and to tie these different assumptions  more clearly with their predictions. Special attention, in comparing  these models, will be paid to nonlocal ones. Finally, a mysterious  specific type of phase transformation for solid binary alloys known as  discontinuous precipitation or cellular precipitation will be further  modeled and analyzed.     The development of new high performance materials is vital to economic  and other national interests.  Among the many properties of materials  which are relevant to their performance is  the possibility of  progressive phase change and the development of  interfaces between  alternate solid phases or crystalline variants. There is need for a  great deal more basic understanding of the processes by which such  interfaces are formed and move.  This research will contribute to this  understanding by the development, comparison, and analysis of  mathematical models of these phen omena based on physical laws.",
