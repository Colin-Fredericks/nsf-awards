The collaborators  are Dr. P. Somasundaran, Department of Chemical Engineering,  Columbia University and Dr. Pradip of the Tata Research,  Development & Design Centre, Pune, India.  This research will  focus on usage of combinations of low polymer concentrations for  flocculation of oxide minerals.  The motivation stems from novel  results obtained from a current project on iron oxide-alumina  where at low concentrations of polyacrylic acid, it was found  that alumina can be effectively flocculated.  The researchers  will study the fundamental mechanisms of polymer-polymer,  particle-particle and polymer-particle interactions in order  reach the goal of this research which is to develop a unified  theory of polymeric flocculation.  The knowledge gained from this  study will help develop strategies for an industrially important  and technologically challenging problem--the selective separation  of fine particulates in general and oxide suspensions in  particular.    Scope:  This project supports pioneering research at two well  regarded laboratories and between scientists with complementary  expertise and excellent research track records.  Students in   both countries will be involved in the research.  The project  enhances international collaboration in an area of high  scientific interest and mutual benefit.  The project meets INT  objectives.  ***",
