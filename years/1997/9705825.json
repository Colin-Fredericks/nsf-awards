 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Jerison      The first goal of the research proposed is to describe level sets of  eigenfunctions and Green's function on regions in three or more  dimensions and on positively curved surfaces.  Another goal is to  prove a unique continuation property which is the appropriate  substitute for uniqueness in the Cauchy problem for solutions to  elliptic boundary value problems.  The proposal is to use an optimal  hypothesis on the smoothness of the boundary, namely, Lipschitz  regularity.  The optimal hypothesis makes this a fundamental issue in  harmonic analysis.  A third goal is to solve two extremal problems for  eigenvalues, one related to regularity in the Neumann problem, the  other aimed at proving uniqueness in an inverse problem of finding a  domain given the density of the first variation of the eigenvalue as a  function of normal variation.  Another main goal concerns three  problems motivated by fluid mechanics.  The first problem is to show  that infinitesimal control on vorticity and compressibility implies  some global control.  The second problem relates the first to measures  of consistency of economic data.  The third is a free boundary problem  related to constructing equilibrium fluid flows with vortex lines.  The final goal is to study certain oscillatory integrals with singular  phases, with an application to pattern recognition in camera images.    The main project is to understand how the shape of a region affects  the distribution of heat in the region or how the shape of an  electrical conductor affects the distribution of electrical charge on  it.  These problems are closely related mathematically, even though  they describe very different physical systems.  The case of  temperature describes a refrigerator or building with insulated walls,  but the case of electrical charge describes electrical components like  wires and cables.  The main issue addressed in the part of the project  motivated by fluid mechanics is how stretching and twisting at small  scales  leads to changes in the shape, speed, and density of a fluid  (or air) at large scales.  This is a fundamental question in the  mechanics of solids, plastics, and elastic materials, as well as  fluids.  A similar mathematical model is encountered in economic  equilibrium theories.  The ultimate goal of the project in the  economics context is to give criteria for when a set of economic data  about purchases can be combined into a meaningful price index, despite  errors and inconsistency.  In other words, how small must  inconsistencies be in order that one can safely ignore them?  The  camera image project will use Fourier analysis to design a computer  program to recognize the angle a building makes with the camera's line  of sight based on a single photograph of the building.  The  determination from a single image would improve on existing techniques  using two images and make computer vision less subject to error.",
