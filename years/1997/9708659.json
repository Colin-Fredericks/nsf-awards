 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708659  Stepp  The  strategic plan (April 1996) for the National Earthquake  Loss Reduction Program (NEP) opens with the statement,  \"Although  earthquakes are inevitable natural hazards,  they  need  not be inevitable disasters.  Through prudent  actions  our  nation can reduce losses of life, casualties,  property  losses,  and  social  and economic disruptions  from  future  earthquakes.\"  This  is   a renewal of the national commitment to  managing  losses  in earthquakes that motivated implementation of  the  National  Earthquake Hazards Reduction  Program  (NEHRP)  in  1977.  An integral part of the NEP goals is the availability  of an adequate data base of strong motion information.    Given  the  broad  need for strong motion  data  to  develop  earthquake  loss reduction measures, recent studies  of  the  key  needs for earthquake engineering and earthquake  hazard  mitigation have emphasized the need to establish  an  entity  to  overview and provide broad national perspective of needs  for  strong motion information and to provide leadership for  coordinated  development of plans to advance  strong  motion  programs  to  meet established national goals and  strategic  targets  for reducing earthquake losses.  The U.S. Committee  for  Advancement  of  Strong  Motion  Programs  (CASMP)  was  established in 1996 in response to this need.    The  objective  of  CASMP  is to  provide  continuing  broad  national  overview  of strong motion program  needs  and  to  encourage advancements in the collection, dissemination  and  utilization  of strong motion data as a tool  for  improving  public  safety  in  earthquakes.   The  Committee  plans  to  accomplish  its  objectives through a  series  of  workshops  focusing  on  the identification of national  strong  motion  data  needs;  assessment  of the degree  to  which  existing  strong  motion programs meet the national needs  for  strong  motion  data;  and  facilitation of  the  development  of  a  national  strategic  plan for strong  motion  programs.   The  Committee  will  promote actions to  enhance  strong  motion  programs  implementing the national strong motion plan,  and  will  facilitate  development of  coordinated  international  strong motion programs to augment U.S. programs.    This  action  is  to  support the  first  of  the  workshops  planned.  The goal for this workshop is to develop an action  plan for strong-motion programs, referred to as Vision 2005,  to  mitigate  earthquake losses in  urbanized  areas.   This  workshop will be held in Monterey, CA, 2-4 April 1997.",
