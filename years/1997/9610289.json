 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Anshuman Razdan    Scientific visualization provides scientists with tools to model  and visually observe three dimensional data.  This technique has  advanced scientific understanding in numerous scientific fields  such as biology, chemistry and engineering.  The traditional  method of visualization is to model the data into one of the many  surface modeling schemes and display the data on a computer  screen.  This approach has obvious limitations for people that  are visually impaired.  This project will test a novel way to  provide analogous information to these individuals whether they  are students, scientists or researchers.  Data are modeled in the  normal manner, but instead of displaying the model on a computer  screen, a three-dimensional wax-based model will be created.  The  data, after being geometrically modeled, will be converted into a  physical model using a Layered Manufacturing (Rapid Prototyping)  machine.  The tactile model will maintain the appropriate ratios  so as not to distort the proportions of the data.  A Scanning  Probe Microscope (SPM) has been chosen as the test-bed to provide  3D data.  A SPM is used to probe objects on a nano scale and its  output is inherently three dimensional.  The only way to  currently observe experiments and data performed on SPM is a  visual display on a screen.  With the proposed technique, a  visually impaired student will be able to feel the surface  representation of the 3D data on the physical model as seen on a  SPM.  The use of 3D physical models for tactile feedback will be  developed in three Arizona State University classes: a junior  level course in Chemical Engineering, a sophomore level course in  Physical Science for in-service and preservice teachers, and a  junior level interdisciplinary science course.  Activities will  be created to demonstrate the viability, importance and success  of this project.  Workshops will be organized to bring educators,  scientists, special education teachers and students to both  evaluate  and provide input to this project.  The project has  broad implications for science education for all students because  they will be able to touch, feel and observe tangible three-  dimensional data models.",
