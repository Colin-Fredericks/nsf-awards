The approach employed here differs from  many others, in that it enlarges from the outset the collection of  deformations that a body can undergo to include non-classical  \"structured deformations.\"  The present, \"front-end\" approach provides  flexibility in modelling and gives simple and direct predictions of  important phenomena such as yielding, hysteresis, and dissipation for a  variety of microstructures.  The key mathematical idea employed is that  the limit of a sequence of derivatives of functions may differ from the  derivative of the limit of the sequence of func- tions.  The difference  between these two quantities gives a concrete measure of the amount of  deformation due to \"disarrangements\" at small length scales.  Existing  theories of crystalline solids, liquid crystals, polycrystalline metals,  and granular materials introduce measures of such deformations via  \"internal variables\" or \"directors\", e.g.,  plastic deformation,  molecular orientation, or void fraction.  Although these variables have  natural physical interpretations, in standard approaches they must be  accepted as primitive objects within a theory; for structured  deformations, counterparts of these variables can be calculated directly  as limits of averages of geometrical changes at the microlevel.  The  proposed research will provide precise definitions and useful formulas  for kinematical quantitities such as \"velocity and stretching due to  slip\" and \"velocity and stretching without slip\", will achieve new  refinements of general balance laws and dissipation inequalities, and  will obtain parallel refinements of specific constitutive relations that  distinguish one material body from another.        A principal challenge faced by applied mathematicians who model complex  phenomena such as the bending of a metal bar, t he appearance of  contrasting optical fields on a liquid crystal display, and the flow of  sand through a hopper is that of incorporating into the mathematical  equations the influence of the microscopic structure of each substance.   Considerable success has been achieved in individual cases of  technological importance, but there is lacking a clear and useful  language for systematically including microstructure.  As a result,  shifting, say, from studies of deformations in a bar to studies of sand  flowing through a hopper requires starting nearly from the beginning of  the modelling process.  The proposed research is part of an ongoing  program to provide a new, relatively simple mathematical language that  will permit a more efficient and economical procedure for modelling  these and other phenomena.  The initial successes of this program help  to provide simple and useful answeres to questions such as why a paper  clip springs back to a complex, curved shape when removed from a stack  of papers and does not spring back to the simple, straight shape that it  may have assumed early in its manufacture.  The proposed research will  continue the quest for a more unified and efficient approach toward   understanding and predicting complex phenomena based on knowledge of  microstructure.",
