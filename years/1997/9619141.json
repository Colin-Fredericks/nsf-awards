Each  year of the project 40 new teachers, selected from 10 of the 50  participating schools, will be selected and will take an intensive  three-week summer program, followed by 16 after school sessions and  two Saturday sessions during the schol year.  In-class and in-  school assistance will be provided in subsequent years to aid in  the classroom implementation of the materials.  At the end of the  project, in most of the target schools, all teachers who teach  science in a given school at the grades selected will have been  involved in the program.  A parallel program for parents, not  funded by NSF, will support what is being done in the classroom.   Parents will become knowledgeable of the science activities done by  their children and be involved in a science literacy program.    Matching funds constitute 182% of the NSF award.",
