 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702616  The problem of developing concurrent programs from formal  specifications is addressed. Concurrent programs consist of  a set of interacting components each running on a single  computer.  A formal specification states precisely the  correct behavior required of the program. The project  investigates automatic program synthesis: given a formal  specification, the synthesis method automatically produces a  correct program. Synthesis obviates the need to manually  compose a program and manually construct a proof of its  correctness. A serious drawback of previous synthesis  methods is that they are too inefficient to generate any but  the smallest programs. The objective is to produce synthesis  methods sufficiently efficient to synthesize large  concurrent programs. The approach taken uses \"pairwise  analysis.\"  Previous approaches considered all program  components simultaneously, requiring the analysis of a very  large number of combined behaviors. This research looks only  at pairs of components at any one time, greatly reducing the  analytical burden. Almost all large, practical programs are  concurrent; the interaction among their many independent  components is very difficult to design properly. The  significance and impact of this research is that it will  eventually provide conceptual tools to help programmers  create such programs and analyze whether their behavior  conforms to the program specification.  ***",
