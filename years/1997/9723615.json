 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723615  Patterson  Galectins are a family of eukaryotic lectins consisting of eight family members: galectin-1 through galectin-8.  The galectins are defined by two distinguishing characteristics: high affinity for (-galactoside-containing glycoconjugates, and conserved amino acid residues in the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of the polypeptides.  At least two galectins (1 and 3) exhibit nuclear as well as cytoplasmic localization.  Recent evidence indicates that the nuclear galectins colocalize with both snRNP and non-snRNP (SC35) splicing cofactors in HeLa nuclei. Thus, nuclear galectins are functionally redundant in splicing activity and exhibit the same distribution in nuclei as other splicing factors.  We also have shown that galectin-depletion inhibits the formation of active spliceosomal complexes which suggests galectins are required at an early step in the splicing pathway.  This research will determine whether galectin splicing function is due to direct association with splicing complexes or an indirect mechanism. Splicing complexes will be directly analyzed by two methods to determine whether either galectin is stably associated with these macromolecular structures.  Additional experiments are designed to determine whether the CRD of the galectins is required for splicing activity. Mutations in the conserved amino acid residues of the CRD of galectin-1 abolish lactose-binding.  These mutant polypeptides will be evaluated for their ability to restore splicing activity to galectin-depleted extracts.  Lastly, one further approach to elucidate a mechanism of action for galectins in splicing is to identify their ligand/partner and determine whether the ligand(s) is a known or new splicing factor.  Four candidate molecules are possible as ligands: an unidentified (-galactoside-containing glycoconjugate; a protein structurally mimicking galactose/lactose that binds to the CRD; a protein that interacts with some region other than the CRD; a pre-mRNA splicing substrate or an RNA-conta ining splicing factor.  Interestingly, glycoconjugates capable of binding to galectins have not been identified in nuclei. We will use the yeast two-hybrid system to identify and characterize the ligand(s) for nuclear galectins.  Ligands isolated by this sensitive genetic approach will be evaluated by biochemical techniques for ligand-galectin interactions and used in depletion/reconstitution protocols to determine if they are required for pre-mRNA processing.  %%%  Galectins are a family of eukaryotic lectin proteins consisting of eight family members:  galectin-1 through galectin-8.
