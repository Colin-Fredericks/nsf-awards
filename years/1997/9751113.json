 "awd_abstract_narration": "The college offers a strong program in experimental psychology and related courses.  Over the past decade, psychology students have made more presentations, and earned more awards, in the Missouri Academy of Science undergraduate paper competitions than students from any other college in the state, regardless of discipline.  In recent years, the focus of the program has started to shift to more computer-assisted instruction.  All psychology majors now receive training in the use of electronic mail, word processors, spreadsheets, web-browsers (e.g., Netscape), and basic statistical analysis software.  In addition, students have been placing their independent projects on the college's World Wide Web server.  In the past, although the college had limited computer resources available for both in-class and independent use, those resources were heavily taxed and shared with all other departments on campus.  Moreover, the computer laboratories did not have the required software or technical support for conducting statistical analysis or for data collection.    This project develops a comprehensive computerized laboratory that allows students to integrate better the computer skills they learn into their current academic work, their future professional work, and their future scientific endeavors.  This laboratory allows an increase in both the amount and quality of research that is produced by our undergraduate students.  The skills acquired in this laboratory should give students the technical knowledge required for critical thinking in modern society.  A further goal is to increase the communication among undergraduate researchers through the use of modern technology.    The project creates a 17-station teaching/research laboratory where students can learn and practice all steps of the scientific research process.  This objective is accomplished through four components:  Basic Research Skills, Statistical Analysis, Data Collection, and Simulation and Demonstration.  These four components should enhance  the psychology students' already exceptional record of independent research and promote enthusiasm for careers in science.  *",
