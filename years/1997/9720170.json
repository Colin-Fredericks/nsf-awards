University of Georgia    Acquisition of a Symmetric Multiprocessor Scientific Computer System    The University of Georgia is upgrading its parallel scientific computing facility to a 24-node Silicon Graphics Origin 2000 High Performance Computer System to advance a multidisciplinary activity in intelligent multiscale scientific simulations.  This platform has the flexibility to run several jobs at once in mixed configurations and will allow a user to run programs requiring distributed memory processing.    Research areas to be supported range from parallel computing, artificial intelligence, optimization and interoperability issues, scalable parallel algorithm design for nuclear physics, fluid flow modeling, materials simulation, molecular modeling, quantum chemistry, polymer modeling, and geological modeling.    The proposed computing facility will allow the University to continue and expand its educational programs in computational sciences.  In addition to graduate students participating in the research projects described in the proposal, existing undergraduate and graduate courses in computational physics, biology, simulation methods, and business process modeling will utilize the proposed facility.",
