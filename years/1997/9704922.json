This will be the first conference of its kind, as other conferences on colloidal systems have been focused on the fundamental issues with scant attention being paid to the applications of these structured  fluids and interfaces.  Funds are requested to offset partially the registration fees and travel costs of speakers and selected academic and graduate student attendees at the Conference, titled \"Structured Fluids and Interfaces:  Technical Applications and Opportunities for Organized Molecular Assemblies\", which is to be held in Lucca, Italy, during the week of 12-17 January, 1997.   ***",
