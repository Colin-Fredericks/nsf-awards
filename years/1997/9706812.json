Funding from the Foundation would  be used for travel and conference fee support for up to ten  graduate students.    The meeting is expected to  help the U.S. meet new  challenges in the development of artificial internal organs,  viz.         The need to establish a strong engineering design basis       for devices expected to perform for increasingly longer       periods of time.         The  need to sustain bioengineering innovation  in  the       U.S.  academic community and to transfer that knowledge       to  American  industry  for R & D  related  to  medical       devices.              The  need  to  consider  simultaneously  technological,       economic  and  ethical issues in  the  distribution  of       health care resources.              The   need   to  attract  women  and  under-represented       minorities  to  a field which already employs  a  large       number of bioengineering graduates.    It is expected that new innovative and proactive  interactions will develop among the groups participating in  the meeting.  The young scientists to be supported by NSF  funds will have an excellent opportunity themselves to  engage in such interactions; a special session is planned  wherein the students can meet with their peers.    Abstracts of presentations at the meeting are to published  in an Abstract Volume that will constitute a regular issue  of  Artificial Organs, the official journal of the  International Society for Artificial Organs.",
