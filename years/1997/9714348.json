 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  EEC-9714348  Pikal      The key to bringing a successful therapeutic entity to market is to develop a stable product that can be manufactured and distributed in a dosage form useful to the patient.  The development of the manufacturing process for a therapeutic agent must proceed quickly and efficiently in order for the pharmaceutical company to be economically successful.  However, there are significant technical challenges that must be overcome, such as physical and chemical stability problems and changes in dosage form performance introduced during the formulation or manufacturing process.  Many companies do not have the resources to sufficiently research or develop, independently, new formulation and manufacturing strategies to overcome these barriers.    The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Pharmaceutical Processing was established at Purdue University to partner with pharmaceutical companies to gain understanding, at the molecular level, of the effects of processing on critical qualities of pharmaceutical products and to improve process monitoring with the goal of minimizing validation requirements.  This proposal addresses the establishment of a research site at the University of Connecticut to complement and extend the technical base of the Pharmaceutical Processing Center.  University of Connecticut researchers will bring to the Center expertise in:    * stability behavior and characterization of proteins in both solution and solid state,  * the science and technology of freeze drying,  * materials science of amorphous pharmaceuticals,  * tablet coating science and technology,  * dissolution behavior, and  * the study of disperse systems with a focus on emulsions, interfacial characterization, and micro-encapsulation.",
