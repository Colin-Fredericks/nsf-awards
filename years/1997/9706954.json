 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elaydi    Abstract    Poincar -Perron's Theorem marks the beginning of the  asymptotic   theory of scalar nonautonomous difference equations.  However,   this theorem is of limited use due to two reasons.  The first is   the  requirement that all characteristic roots of the limiting   equation have  distinct moduli.  The second reason is that the   theorem does not provide  explicit asymptotic representations of   solutions of difference equations.   Levinson's Theorem or rather   its discrete analogue addressed the second  deficiency by providing   the desirable asymptotic representation of solutions  of difference   equations.  However, Levinson's Theorem puts a severe restriction   on the coefficients of the difference equation in question since   it requires that they  are summable.   The latter condition makes   the applicability of the the theorem  rather limited, particulaply   in orthogonal polynomials, combinatorics, special  functions, and   continued fractions. The proposed research is directed toward   addressing the deficiencies in the above two important theorems.    It will attempt  to complete and unify asymptotic theory using a   unified approach via the theory  of dichotomy.    Difference equations are one of the basic mathematical tools of   computation. There is hardly a computational task which does not   rely on recursive techniques, at one time or another.  The widespread   use of difference equations can be ascribed to their intrinsic   constructive quality, and the great ease with which  they are   amenable to mechanization.  On the other hand, like most recursive   processes, difference equations are susceptible to error growth.    If conditions  are unfavorable, the resulting propagation of error   may or will be disastrous.  Hence the need to investigate the   asymptotic and qualitative behavior of solutions  of difference   equations.  This is of paramount importance since difference   equations occur prominently in many branches of applied mathematics,   Economics,  population dynamics, Chaos Theory, mathematical physics,   etc.  Asymptotics is even more important in Computer Science where   it is used to rate  algorithms and how fast and accurate they are.",
