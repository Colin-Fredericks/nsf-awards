 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves the general physics courses for life science students with a new sequence of introductory college physics laboratories that unites intrinsically motivating medical and life science applications with the power of scientific computing tools.  This project addresses the two introductory college physics courses at the university by (1) intrinsically motivating applications and (2) using the computer for data acquisition and analyses.     Most introductory college physics students are enrolled in a physics course in order to fulfill the requirements for careers in the medical and life sciences.  Therefore, an entire group of students shares common interests that are virtually ignored in the present traditional physics laboratory sequence.  This project develops a complete set of lessons that focuses on fundamental physics concepts, but also attempts to motivate the study of these concepts based on medical and life science applications.     Computer technology is becoming an important part of every day life, but no where is this more true than in the field of medical sciences.  Essentially all scientific data are collected using automated data acquisition systems and analyzed using computers.  If students use computing tools for the study of medical and life science applications of physics concepts, they have a unique opportunity to develop their awareness of and sophistication with the appropriate application of scientific computing tools.  In addition, students develop skills at using large electronic databases to find needed information.",
