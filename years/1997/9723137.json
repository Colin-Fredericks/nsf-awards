Feeding in most organisms includes an  appetitive phase and a comsumatory phase. The appetitive  phase includes detection of food and arousal, followed by  directed locomotion. This aspect of the behavior is  dependent upon the integration of signals from multiple  sensory systems that provide information about the external  environment. The consumatory phase consists of ingestion of  the meal. This aspect of the behavior is generated by the  orderly activity of interconnected neurons the activity of  which yields the coordinated activity of muscles. This  project identifies the individual neurons responsible for  these behaviors and way they are connected to generate the  behaviors associated with different phases of feeding.  Experiments determine whether the same neurons are involved  in both aspects of feeding or whether there are separate  neurons for each phase. The project furthers the  understanding of the way that the nervous system uses and  adapts neurons to different functional roles and switches  from one class of activity to another as complex behavior  unfolds.",
