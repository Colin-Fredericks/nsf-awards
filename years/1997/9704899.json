 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704899  Lamm    The main goal of this project is to develop local regularization methods for   the solution of ill-posed inverse problems such as those arising in   applications of inverse heat conduction and image reconstruction.  The   ideas of local regularization developed by the P.I. naturally lead to a   \"predictor-corrector\" type of solution method.  The idea is that a regularized   solution is first obtained on a small part of the domain of the solution, after   which subsequent correction is applied in order to avoid oversmoothing.    This method has been seen to be as effective as standard Tikhonov   regularization for Volterra problems, with improved computational   performance.  In addition, the scheme naturally suggests a \"variable   regularization\" approach in which a functional regularization parameter is   used to apply more smoothing in some parts of the domain and less in   others.  In this project the P.I. plans to continue to develop the existing   theory for Volterra problems, and to extend this theory to non-Volterra   problems of the type arising in image reconstruction and image deblurring.    The design of a theoretically-sound adaptive process of selecting the   functional parameter is an essential and difficult part of this project.     Inverse problems naturally arise in numerous scientific applications,   including biomedical imaging (Magnetic Resonance Imaging and CAT   scans), the nondestructive thermal testing and analysis of materials, satellite   sensing of remote images, and geophysical applications such as seismic and   reservoir engineering.  These problems are of considerable challenge to   scientists because they often lead to very large computational problems   which are extremely sensitive to errors in data.  The aim of this project is to   develop new methods for the stable and efficient solution of such inverse   problems.  The successful attainment of this goal would have an important   impact on applications such as biotechnology, remote imaging, and    materials science.",
