 "awd_abstract_narration": "- - ~    9702313  Dadmun    In this CAREER award the effect of varying the amount of hydrogen  bonding present in a polymer blend containing a liquid  crystalline polymer and an amorphous polymer on its phase  behavior and engineering properties will be explored.  The  amorphous polymer will be a copolymer where one monomer (vinyl  phenol) can participate in hydrogen bonding while the other  monomer can not (styrene).  The amount of hydrogen bonding  present between the two polymers will be systematically varied by  altering the composition of the amorphous copolymer.   The effect  of this variation on the phase `ehavior and, consequently the  engineering properties (i.e. storage and loss modulus, tensile  strength, viscosity) of the blend will be determined. It is  expected that the change in the amount of hydrogen bonding  present will produce systems which exhibit wide range  miscibility, primarily immiscibility, and systems where the  miscible/immiscible window is accessible.  This last system will  be utilized to examine the influence of the polymer chain  anisotropy of the liquid crystalline polymer on the phase  decomposition kinetics. The results will provide a fundamental  understanding of the physical chemistry of blends containing a  liquid crystalline polymer which can be utilized in the  development of novel materials with tunable properties.    The preparation of undergraduate and graduate students for  careers demands different emphases from an instructor/advisor.  Faculty primarily interact with undergraduate students via the  classroom while the maturation of graduate students involve  learning in both the classroom and the laboratory.  Therefore, a  description of a teaching philosophy which is followed is  presented.  A summary of the proposed teaching philosophy is to  utilize effective teacher-student interaction to insure that  students learn and understand the desired curriculum; to make  chemistry accessible  through more everyday examples; to inspire students to think  a nalytically by detailing complex  relationships in lecture and in workshops; and to prepare  students for a vocation by introducing  them to the methods by which chemical concepts are utilized in  industry via industrial visitors and  trips to local chemical plants, by attacking and solving problems  as groups, and by introducing  them to common engineering principles.  %%%  The proposed research program will examine how manipulation of  the microscopic  structure of high performance, liquid crystalline polymers can be  utilized to create new materials  with target properties.  It is hoped that the results will  provide fundamental information which can  be used to guide product development such that the desirable  characteristics of liquid crystalline  polymers can be efficiently exploited commercially.  ***",
