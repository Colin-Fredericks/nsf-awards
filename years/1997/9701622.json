 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Woerpel's research focuses on the development of new   methodologies for the construction of carbocyclic and heterocyclic   compounds through the (3+2) annulation reactions of functionalized   allylsilanes.  Use of allylsilanes with strategically-placed   electron-donating substituents permits rapid 1,2-silyl migration in the   initially formed beta-silyl carbocations, leading to more stable   carbocations which then undergo annulation with a variety of reactive   functionalities.  In addition to providing synthetic access to a variety   of cyclic structures, these studies also permit the assessment of the   role of electronic factors in these annulation reactions.  Portions of   the research program are particularly designed to encourage participation   by undergraduate research students.  Professor Woerpel will also examine   the effectiveness of new pedagogical tools for improving student   comprehension of organic chemistry, focusing on three central themes,   stereochemistry, conformational analysis and inductive effects in   determining acidity.  With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the   research and educational activities of Professor Keith A. Woerpel of the   Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine.    Professor Woerpel's research efforts are focused on the development of   new approaches for the synthesis of cyclic compounds.  These studies,   exploiting unique reactions of silicon-containing molecules, promise   access to a variety of carbocyclic (containing only carbon) and   heterocyclic compounds (containing elements such as nitrogen in addition   to carbon).  Such cyclic structures form the basis of numerous   pharmaceutical compounds and other important products.  Professor   Woerpel's educational activities include the involvement of   undergraduates, recruited both from his home campus and through outreach   programs, in his research program.   Professor Woerpel will also   incorporate new laboratory- and computer-based approaches and implement a   learning cycle approach to the teaching of undergraduate organic   chemistry.",
