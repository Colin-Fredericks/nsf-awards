 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617702  Reysenbach    In order to better understand the chemical processes occurring in  hydrothermal plumes and develop predictive models of hydrothermally-derived  chemical fluxes, it is necessary to characterize the effects that microbial  activity have on plume chemistry. The main objectives of this project are:  1. To characterize the diversity and define the structure of microbial  communities associated with chemical fluxes within the hydrothermal plume  environment, utilizing molecular phylogenetic techniques; 2. To map changes  in the diversity and structure of the microbial community as the plume ages;  3. To examine the abundance and activity of specific members of the plume  microbial community through the use of fluorescent rRNA probes. This  research will provide significant new information about these poorly defined  microbial effects which in turn will aid in the development of realistic  models of chemical fluxes in hydrothermal systems.  A fourth objective of  this project is to provide an opportunity for the new Ph.D. (E. McLaughlin)  to broaden her research experience as defined in the RIDGE program  announcement. A postdoctoral position in Dr. Reysenbach's laboratory will  allow E. McLaughlin to learn and utilize molecular phylogenetic techniques.  Thus, fostering \"cross-disciplinary fertilization\" by combining the  molecular phylogenetic expertise of the host laboratory with the geochemical  knowledge obtained during the candidate's thesis work.",
