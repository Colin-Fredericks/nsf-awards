 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Karen Magee-Sauer  The prime objective of the research to be carried out  is to  make measurements of the ammonia (NH3) abundance in several  comets and to measure the spatial profile and other  characteristics of the emission. Models of solar nebula  chemistry predict that the dominant nitrogen gas in the  solar nebula was Nitrogen (N2) while the dominant nitrogen  gas in the sub-nebulae of the giant planets was ammonia  (NH3) (Fegley and Prinn, 1989). The ratios N2/NH3 and  NH3/H20 enable on e to test solar nebula models and are  important diagnostics of the origins of cometary ices  (Lunine 1989, Fegley and Prinn 1989, Womack et al. 1992).  Ammonia (NH3) had long been believed to be a significant  reservoir for volatile nitrogen in comets, but until  recently its presence had not been directly observed.  The  advancement of infrared detector technology has made it  possible to directly detect NH3 in comets via its rotational  vibrational transitions in the 3.0 micron wavelength region.  The observations will consist of detecting the rotational-  vibrational transition in the 3 micron wavelength region of  the nu-1 vibrational band of NH3.  The g-factors  (fluorescence efficiency factors) of the Q, R-, and P-  branches within this band are not available.  In order to  relate the observed intensity of its spectral lines to a  production rate of ammonia, these g-factors need to be  known.  Therefore, as part of my analysis for the relative  abundance of NH3, I will calculate the relevant nu-1 g-  factors using known laboratory band intensities and non-LTE  rotational distributions appropriate for cometary  conditions.  The focus of this project is on observing the NH3 in comets,  and the results of this research will provide important  information on the NH3 abundance and nature of the emission.  The results will be used to help answer the basic question  of the origin of comets, study whether NH3 is a parent  molecule present as a natal ice in comets, and by examining  the spatial ch aracteristics associated with the emission,  and determine whether some ammonia is produced from an  extended source.  Undergraduate students at Rowan College of New Jersey will  assist in developing data reduction techniques and in  analyzing the data.",
