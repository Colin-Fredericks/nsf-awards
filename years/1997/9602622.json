 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ARI award will provide funding for the replacement of research and research training space at Roosevelt University.  Founded in 1945, Roosevelt University is a metropolitan four year institution of higher learning serving a diverse student population in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs.  Consisting of two campuses:  the downtown campus, and the Robin campus in Schaumburg, the latter is devoid of any dedicated science facilities. Two outdated laboratories downtown will be decommissioned and relocated to the Robin campus to meet the desperate need for research space.  In exchange, two laboratories will be established to support ongoing research programs in ecology, genetics, molecular biology and chemistry. Laboratory renovations will consist of the following:  1) new walls, ceilings and floors; 2) installation of new fixed laboratory equipment, including fume hoods and casework; 3) installation of a  new HVAC system; 4) improved electrical services; and 5) new plumbing and fire protection systems.  Upon completion, research space will comply with ADA guidelines.  The renovation project will enable the science faculty to conduct basic research at both campuses, offering quality research training to high school students, undergraduates and graduate students, and teachers regularly.  The modernization of this facility will increase the quality of the research programs, stimulating the participation of more minority students in research, and allow for the initiation of new programs in the sciences.",
