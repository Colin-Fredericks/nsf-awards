This project maintains and improves the accessibility and reliability of VSERC, provides for and improves the ease of transfer of VSERC to other Centers, and adds new educational capabilities to the software program.    The enhancement of VSERC will be achieved by the addition of an Educational Wing that will allow Internet access to the following material: 1) Interactive Components, 2) Multi-Media Server Access Facilities, and 3) Software Engineering Courseware.    The proposed enhancement of VSERC will allow educators and students to access all SERC related educational and research material through a single hierarchical interface.  The research material is already available via VSERC and is continually updated.  Starting in Fall 1997, the educational material will begin entering into the database currently under construction in SERC and the Department of Computer Science at Purdue.  This database will contain the digitized versions of live lectures delivered in the classroom, course material, interactive software engineering tools, and \"concept applets\" written in Java.  The proposed addition of the Educational Wing to VSERC will allow faculty and students to update and access this database through a uniform interface that is independent of the specific courses, concepts, and research areas supported.",
