 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708643  The goal of this research is to devise and perform component  integration experiments at the software architectural level that  determine (1) what component interoperability problems exist, (2)  what are solutions to those problems, and (3) which strategies  for integration can perform those solutions. The value of this  research is that it can provide developers with early knowledge  of potential interoperability problems among software components.  With this knowledge, developers can treat integration as a design  decision, instead of only an implementation task. With the  increased use of COTS applications, developers can choose between  applications with similar functionality but fewer  interoperability problems with in-house components, speeding  productivity. Using research on software architecture, design  patterns, and reports on integrating actual applications, the  proposed research will define a catalog of architectural  characteristics of software that contribute to interoperability  problems. Integration strategies will be associated with their  respective solutions to the conflicts that result from  interleaving component characteristics. A knowledge based  system will serve as an experimental testbed to determine the  best integration strategy based on predefined conflict  resolutions among characteristics. The research results, i.e.,  characteristics, conflicts, solutions, and strategies, will be  provided to the developer to enhance design decisions and to  formulate implementations.  ***",
