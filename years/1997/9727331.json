 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific planning activities will be undertaken to further  develop the revised scientific agenda of the International Human  Dimensions (of Global Environmental Change) Program (IHDP).  These  activities will focus on planning for studies of the Institutional  Dimensions of Global Change (IDGC); of Industrial Transformation  (IT) to more sustainable production and consumption patterns; and  of Global Environmental Change and Human Security (GECHS).  An  implementation plan for research on Land Use and Land Cover Change  Program (LUCC: studies supported jointly by the IHDP and the  International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP)) will be  developed.  Scientific capacity-building and networking, especially  with scientists in developing countries will be enhanced;  interaction between IHDP scientists and policy makers will be  developed; and scientific planning meetings and workshops will be  organized on emerging human dimensions issues such as the  interaction between global change and urbanization, health and  water.  These activities will be coordinated by the revamped IHDP  Scientific Committee with strong support from the IHDP Secretariat  recently established at the University of Bonn under a major grant  from the German Ministry for Education, Science, Research and Tech-  nology (BMBF).  Oversight for these activities will be provided by  the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), with  cooperation from the International Social Science Council (ISSC).",
