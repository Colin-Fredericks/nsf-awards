 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707359  Richard S. Varga      The goal of this proposal is to attack basic problems in polynomial and   rational approximation, with varying weights, in the complex plane, by means  of potential theoretic techniques. Recently, the proposers have begun fruitful  initial investigations in this area, resulting in a number of new research   manuscripts, which we consider to be of break-through character. We clearly  feel that these initial investigations are so promising as to warrant the   submission of this research proposal to the National Science Foundation.   But, an important and novel feature of this proposal is that connections,  with the efficientsolution of large nonsingular systems of linear equations  by iterative methods, are directly associated with this theoretical work in   the complex plane by potential theoretic methods. Thus, the proposed research  bridges research in complex function theory and numerical analysis, and will  have a strong numerical component.      Problems arising in large-scale circuit design, oil recovery via petroleum  reservoir machanics, and the design of nuclear reactors for generating   electrical power, all have the following item in common: the modeling of   these physical phenomena leads to massive nonsingular systems of linear   equations, whose unknowns can exceed one million. To efficently solve these  systems, iterative methods are commonly used. One aim of this proposal is to  use tools, from the fields of potential theory anddd complex function theory,  to theoretically attack a specific question on how best to iteratively   such large systems of equations.",
