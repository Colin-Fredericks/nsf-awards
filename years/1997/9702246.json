 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER Award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry Program supports the research and education plans of Karin   Ruhlandt-Senge of Syracuse University.  The goal of the proposed research   is to develop reliable synthetic routes to organoalkaline-earth   derivatives. Initial studies will be directed toward facile routes to   prepare diorgano alkaline-earth species and organo alkaline-earth   halides.  Possible applications in synthetic inorganic, organic, polymer   and materials chemistry will be explored.        The advantages of heavier organoalkaline-earth derivatives over   organomagnesium derivatives will be investigated.   Graduate students and   students in undergraduate laboratories will be involved in the work and   will learn to prepare air-sensitive compounds and handle them by Schlenk   and dry-box techniques.  Ruhlandt-Senge has developed a combined   laboratory experience involving mentorship between seniors and first year   chemistry students in which they prepare and investigate carefully chosen   inorganic compounds.  Ruhlandt-Senge is also involved in the Minority   High School Student Apprenticeship Program and participates in the   training of high school and prospective high school teachers.",
