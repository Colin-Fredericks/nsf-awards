The research  is in the area of the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) and the  Fractional Quantum Hall Effect.  The PI in recent research  has contributed to dicovery of a duality symmetry.  The  proposed research aims to explore the duality symmetry  between the QHE liquid phase and the newly discovered  insulating phase.  Another topic to be studied is the  universal relation between the longitudinal and transverse  conductivity in QHE liquid to insulator transition.  Another  class of transitions is proposed in extremely low mobility  samples.  %%%  This research project experimentally studies the behavior of  conduction electrons in state-of-the-art semiconductor  devices.  It is found that conduction electrons n extremely  pure semiconductor samples, when confined to move in a  nearly two dimensional planar region, at low temperatures  and high transverse magnetic field, behave in unique ways.  These previously observed effects are known as the Quantum  Hall Effect and the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect.  They  are basic effects resulting  from the laws of quantum  mechanics applied to a dense gas of electrons interacting  with each other by Coulomb repulsion.  New behaviors are  expected, described as new phases of the electron gas, and  this research is devoted to finding and describing these new  behaviors.  The understanding gained can be expected to  contribute to improvements in microelectronic device  technology.  ***",
