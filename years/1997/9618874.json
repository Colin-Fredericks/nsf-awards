 "awd_abstract_narration": "Automated  systems  that  can  interact  with  human   users   in  modalities  such  as speech and handwriting will greatly  enhance  productivity  and  system  usability. These  systems  will  allow  simple access to information and services on the internet.  These  capabilities  are  essential to other  tasks,  such  as  enabling  access  by  handicapped users or querying an on-line  maintenance  manual  while performing intricate repairs.  A statistical  model  of language is a crucial component in such systems, which convert  between  speech  or  handwriting and  text,  and  in  statistical  machine   translation  systems.   Most  current  algorithms   for  language   modeling  exhibit  an  acute  myopia,   basing   their  predictions of the next word on only a few immediately  preceding  words.  When humans are faced with a comparable task they  easily  outperform  these models using the richer linguistic  information  available  to  them from more complete context.   Researchers  at  CLSP  propose to investigate and develop novel language  modeling  techniques  that  exploit  richer  contextual  information.  They  propose  to  examine models that use a variety of  techniques  to  capture  syntactic  dependencies  through  dynamic,  hierarchical  models  of  topic, and to combine the resulting models  with  the  best  current  ones  using the maximum entropy  principle.   This  research  will  focus  on improving the recognition  accuracy  of  spontaneous  human speech, but beyond that will  provide  insight  into  new  information sources and techniques applicable  to  all  applications of language modeling.",
