 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615705  Ravichandran    This is a fundamental study to understand the anomalous  behavior of naturally initiated small fatigue cracks  relative to large cracks.  It is suspected that the  anomalous behavior is associated with the three-dimensional  characteristics of small cracks, including  large, isolated  perturbations in crack front, as well as a lack of crack  wake closure.  An experimental approach examines the effects  of important microstructural variables, including grain size  and shape, deformation behavior ,and orientation in nickel-  base and aluminum-base alloys.  A novel technique is  employed involving a laser interferometric displacement  measurement system and a photomicroscopic system.  The laser  interferometric system allows the measurement of the crack  opening displacements of a small crack and the  photomicroscopic system records changes in the surface crack  length.  The unique aspect of the laser interferometric  system is the simultaneous accurate measurement of crack  compliance and crack closure levels of very small cracks.  This facilitates the calculation of growth rates of crack  tips at both the surface and  depth regions, incorporating  the continuous changes in aspect ratio.  An accurate  comparison of small crack behavior with that of large cracks  is therefore possible, leading to a better understanding of  small crack phenomena.  It is believed that this approach  provides new insights into the anomalous characteristics of  small cracks.  %%%  This novel experimental technique is useful in studies of  mechanical behavior of advanced materials, including  intermetallic alloys, ceramics and composites, where high  precision non-contact displacement measurement techniques  are needed for accurate property measurements.  ***",
