 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two semesters of advanced inorganic chemistry have been taught without a laboratory component to augment the theoretical ideas learned in the classroom.  Since inorganic chemistry is a discipline founded on experimentation, the previous practice of teaching it without a laboratory gives students a very flawed view of how inorganic chemistry progresses.  The goal of this project is to find a modern ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer that will be used with other instruments to incorporate an inorganic chemistry laboratory into the curriculum.  The new laboratory serves two upper-level inorganic chemistry courses, which cover all essential areas of inorganic chemistry.  Consequently, during the fall, students focus on the use of the new spectrophotometer in exploring basic principles and ideas of molecular spectroscopy as they relate to inorganic compounds.  In the spring semester, the instrument is used in studying the chemistry of coordination compounds, analysis of mixtures, light- and heat-induced color changes in the solid state and in solution, and kinetic analyses.      This project benefits African-American students because the university is a historically black institution.  The inorganic chemistry laboratory greatly enhances the undergraduate chemistry curriculum because it reinforces the teaching capabilities and provides an avenue for minority students to get hands-on experience in the use of a modern instrument.  New experiments developed here can be published in the Journal of Chemical Education.   *",
