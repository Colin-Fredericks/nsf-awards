 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to equip the National Magnetic Resonance  Facility at Madison (NMRFAM)  1  with a Customized Desk-top Experiment  Management System (CDEMS) that will provide users with adaptable  desk-top access to the software and hardware resources of the facility.  This project is a joint effort between members of NMRFAM (in the  Biochemistry Department) and the ZOO team (in the Computer Sciences  Department, University of Wisconsin-Madison); the latter group has  developed the tools to be used in constructing the CDEMS. NMRFAM is a  shared instrumentation laboratory dedicated to NMR investigations of  structure- function relationships in biomolecules. Hardware at NMRFAM  includes five high-resolution NMR spectrometers (with proton resonance  frequencies between 400 and 750 MHz), a Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI)  Power Onyx computer system, and a number of SGI workstations, the  associated software encompasses a wide variety of commercial and  academic software packages used for processing and analyzing NMR data  and for retrieving and examining other information available on the  systems studied. The proposed desk-top access capabilities will enable  NMRFAM to project these assets beyond its walls and to make them freely  available to collaborators and other consumers of its technology. The  CDEMS will facilitate collaborations of scientists over the Internet  and will enable users to interact with NMRFAM staff members in planning  and scheduling experiments and in processing and analyzing data. Users,  regardless of their physical location, will be able to execute, from  their own desk-tops, not only simulations and data analyses, but actual  data collection runs. In addition, the CDEMS will be designed to  maximize able the efficiency of available computational resources.       .",
