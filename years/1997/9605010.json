 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for support of a cooperative project by Dr. R.I.A. Malek of the Materials Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University and two Egyptian researchers: Dr. Hanaa Y. Ghorab of the Chemistry Department at Helwan University, and Dr. Assem K. Abdelalim of the Faculty of Engineering at Zagazig University.  The main objective of this research is to expand upon the existing knowledge contributing to the fundamental understanding of the reaction process, microstructural evolution and microstructure-property relationships of the alkali-activated aluminosilicate binders (geopolymers).  Another objective is to explore the detailed structural characteristics of the ancient mortars, where Egypt provides a unique archeological site, and to provide sound scientific knowledge using angle spinning NMR.  Scope:  This research project will be useful in promoting the scientific knowledge on geopolymeric binders, and in providing new knowledge on old geopolymers.  It involves US and Egyptian scientists with complementary expertise in material sciences, chemistry and engineering, as well as  complementary field and laboratory facilities at the three participating universities.  The project will also involve a US graduate student who will have access to an international experience that should help in his/her career.  This proposal meets INT objective of increasing U.S.-foreign collaboration in areas that benefit both sides, and in enhancing junior scientists' international experience.  This award includes partial funding by the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems.",
