 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615659  Muller  This project concerns the distribution, taxonomic significance and evolutionary origin of the main types of eukaryotic energy metabolism. Biochemical studies on a few parasitic protists have clearly shown that in addition to the broadly distributed aerobic type with its mitochondrial/cytosolic compartmentation, there are two additional types without mitochondria: Type 1 without metabolic compartmentation (Giardia and Entamoeba) and Type 2 with cytosolic/hydrogenosomal compartmentation (Trichomonas and other trichomonads, anaerobic ciliates and fungi of the rumen). The presence of these metabolic types in independent lineages suggests that they became established repeatedly during evolution. Amitochondriate organisms differ from mitochondriate ones by oxidizing pyruvate with pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and not with the nonhomologous pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Type 1 organisms have a number of other glycolytic enzymes, which differ from those found in organisms of Type 2 and also in mitochondriate protists. Type 2 organisms differ from the mitochondriate group by lacking mitochondria but containing hydrogenesomes with a pathway leading to H2. The main metabolic patterns thus can be recognized by the presence or absence a few selected enzymes. Information on these enzymes and on the hydrogenosome is entirely restricted to the few strictly parasitic or symbiotic species mentioned. Morphological and ecological data reveal the existence also of a great variety of free-living amitochondriate eukaryotes, all living in anoxic or hypoxic habitats. In this project PCR methods combined with nucleotide sequencing will be applied to such species selected from several taxa to establish the nature of those key enzymes that can define their metabolic type.  The sequences obtained will also serve permit the phylogenetic reconstruction of the history of these enzymes.  In combination, this information will contribute to our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic energy metabolism  and the much debated origin of the hydrogenosome.  %%%  Similarly to animals, plants and fungi, most unicellular organisms, protists, are aerobic, thus their metabolism depends on oxygen and is linked to an organelle, the mitochondrion.  A number of protists that live in oxygen-free or oxygen-poor environments lack mitochondria and have a relatively inefficient, oxygen-independent metabolism. The mechanisms of this metabolism have been studied only in a few parasites. This research, made possible by recent advances in molecular biology, will establish the metabolic types of oxygen-independent free-living protists and will compare these with the parasitic species. The results will contribute to our understanding of the significance and evolutionary history of this type of metabolism, a topic that until recently was beyond the possibilities of experimental study.  ***",
