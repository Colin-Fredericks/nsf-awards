 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the research of a cultural anthropologist from the University of California-San Diego.  The goal of the research is to develop methods for the identification and measurement of American, Mexican, and Japanese cultural orientations, defined as cultural models which have strong psychological significance for individuals.  Three different methods for the assessment of cultural orientations will be studied: ratings of statements, ratings of single terms or phrases, and intensive interviewing of s small sample of respondents.  Native born Americans, Mexicans and Japanese respondents living in southern California will be sampled.  If successful, this basic, methodological project will provide anthropologists and other social scientists with a conceptual framework and set of empirical methods by which persons can be assessed to determine which aspects of their cultural have become internalized into psychologically significant ways of understanding and reacting to the world.    This research is important because it will advance our understanding of fundamental issues of how people orient themselves to their reality, and how they feel about the information they deal with.",
