 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing the capabilities for rapid, accurate multi-element analysis through acquisition of an inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) and related sample preparation equipment. The ICP-AES is being used to greatly improve laboratory instruction and research opportunities for students in the Earth Science, Chemistry, and Biology programs. In Earth Science, ICP-AES is a critical part of reforming mineralogy and petrology, de-emphasizing traditional hand-sample description and classification, and focusing on investigations that teach students how to study minerals and rocks in order to characterize them and interpret their origins. In Geochemistry and Applied Hydrogeology, students are investigating interactions between solid earth materials and water in hands-on experiments. Earth Science students are developing a better understanding of minerals, rocks, and water as chemical systems and improving their quantitative problem-solving skills. In the Chemistry program, students are being introduced to ICP-AES in Quantitative Analysis. ICP-AES is expanding opportunities for water and soil investigations in Environmental Chemistry. In Instrumental Analysis, students are learning to optimize the ICP-AES operating conditions and gaining valuable hands-on experience with an analytical technique that is routinely used in research and industry. In the Biology program, ICP-AES is making it possible to include quantitative analysis in macro-and micro-nutrient investigations in Plant Physiology. In each program, use of ICP-AES is improving the students' understanding of important concepts by allowing them to use science in appropriate coursework. Of equal importance, students are becoming more excited about doing research.  *",
