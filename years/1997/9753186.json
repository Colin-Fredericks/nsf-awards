 "awd_abstract_narration": "9753186  Larson    Kilauea volcano, on the island of Hawaii, presents a major seismic as well as volcanic hazard.  Hawaiian volcanoes have also generated mega-landslides and tsunamis in the geologic past, and Kilauea's south flank is considered the most likely site of such a catastrophe in the future.  Frequent deformation monitoring is needed to understand south flank instability and to provide short term hazard assessments.  Stanford University, in collaboration with the USGS Hawaii Volcano Observatory (HVO), has installed a continuously operating GPS network on Kilauea for this purpose.  This network currently measures deformation from 2-10 days after the data are collected.  The P.I. will extend this network into a real-time deformation and hazards warning system, such that cm level precisions can be determined within 30 minutes of data collection.  She will visit the Hawaii Volcano Observatory in the summer of 1998 to work on technical issues with the onsite HVO science team.  As a visiting professor in the Department of Geophysics at Stanford University, she will develop and implement the software system and work on modeling of both seismic and volcanic deformation.",
