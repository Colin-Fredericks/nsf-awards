 "awd_abstract_narration": "To understand the spatial relationships among structures within  biological specimens, three-dimensional  imaging is required. Soft x-ray tomography offers the possibility to  image several micrometer thick  specimens at 30-100 nanometer voxel resolution, unique contrast  mechanisms, and the ability to examine  hydrated specimens.    Nanotomography with soft x-ray optics will be developed by adding  tomography capabilities to a soft x-ray scanning transmission  microscope with a liquid nitrogen temperature stage. Fresnel zone  plates will be used to focus a soft x-ray undulator beam to a 30-50  nanometer resolution probe (the smallest focused spot of  electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength), and the specimen will be  scanned through this probe at a range of tilt angles. The depth of  field is such that each image will represent a projection through the  specimen, at least in problems selected for initial studies. After  initial studies of freeze-dried specimens, hydrated specimens which  have been vitrified will be imaged at liquid nitrogen temperatures.    These novel nanotomography capabilities will be employed in ongoing and  new interdisciplinary studies with our biology collaborators at our  x-ray microscope user facility. These collaborations have included the  study of chromatin folding in metaphase chromosomes, imaging of the  malarial parasite P. falciparum, quantitative mapping of protein and  DNA concentrations to understand chromosome packing in sperm,  calcification in cartilage and bone (with implications for arthritis  and osteoporosis), and the localization of RNA transcription sites in  the nucleus.",
