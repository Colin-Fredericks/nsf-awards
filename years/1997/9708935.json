 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Vernon D.   Parker studies the reactions and energetics of organic radical ions in   solution.  Professor Parker, of the Department of Chemistry at Utah State   University, addresses the influence of coupling between charge and   radical centers on the reactivity of one or both of these centers.  For   example, dimerization rates of arene radical cations are greatly enhanced   by methoxy and N,N-dimethylamino substituents which separate the charge   and radical centers.  Kinetic support for the hypothesis of a correlation   between reactivity and extent of coupling is sought through study of   radical ions with varying degrees of spin-charge coupling.  Professor Vernon D. Parker, of the Department of Chemistry at Utah State   University, is supported by the Organic Dynamics Program for his studies   of the factors influencing the reactivity of a class of compounds known   as radical ions.  These compounds, which contain an atom bearing a   positive or negative charge (an ion) as well as an atom bearing one less   electron than ordinarily found (a radical), often display reactivity   distinct from that of a molecule containing only one of these structural   elements (radical or ion).  Professor Parker is exploring the hypothesis   that atomic or molecular groups intervening between the radical and ion   centers influence the reactivity of these centers, with those groups   providing the greatest `coupling` leading to the most dramatic alteration   of reactivity.  Radicals and ions appear as important intermediates in a   wide variety of chemical and biochemical systems and are additionally   significant in areas such as radiation chemistry and toxicology.    Professor Parker's studies are leading to the development of a more   fundamental understanding of those factors influencing the chemical   properties of these important species.",
