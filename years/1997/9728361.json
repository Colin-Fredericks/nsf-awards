 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to build upon the work done in 1996 by a team of WPI students who focused on the impact of NSF-funded projects in science for elementary teacher preparation.    In 1997, another team of students would focus on related issues, but in the engineering fields.  A major goal of the 1997 work would be to make engineering students more aware of teaching as a career.    Specifically the student team will engage in a variety of activities as follows:    1) research the projects that NSF has funded that relate K-12 teacher education and engineering,    2) determine what has been the impact of these projects on K-12 teachers,    3) examine, on the basis of the above activities, the feasibility of implementing at other institutions, what has emerged as the best practices,    4) investigate what is the role of technology and its effective uses in teacher preparation, as recommended by the 1996 student team,     The bulk of the research for this project would be conducted at NSF headquarters, with visits to a sample of the NSF-funded project sites.  The student team would conduct interviews with Principal Investigators and other personnel associated with the projects.  They would also conduct interviews with students who are being exposed to the NSF-funded activities at the same sites.  The interviews would be structured particularly to address points, two, three, and four above.    In preparation for those visits, the team would prepare a full literature review of previous studies done on teacher education in the engineering fields and related areas.  In addition, the would survey the literature relating to the use of technology in classrooms.    The primary benefit to NSF in having this information would be an increased understanding of what constitutes \"best practices\" in the field and to understand how best to use this information in promoting and implementing collaborative links that exist between engineering programs and teacher education.",
