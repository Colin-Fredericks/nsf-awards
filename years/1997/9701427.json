These studies will  explore  how electrons interact with their environment  and  will  provide  new  information on the effects of  electron  phase  and  correlations.  The  noise studies will be  carried  in  diffusive  microbridges  and quantum point contacts, in the frequency  range  of  0.1  to  20GHz.  Phase coherent transport,  sub-Poisson  shot  noise, and noise of superconductor-normal metal contacts may also  be  studied. Quantum limits on the spectral distribution  of  the  noise with frequency will also be investigated.  %%%  This research project involves experimentally studies the origins  and  limits on noise in nanometer-scale electron devices used  to  detect  radiation, emphasizing the 0.1 to 20GHz frequency  range.  Applications  of such detectors include radio astronomy and radar  receivers.  The  novelty  of the research  is  in  its  focus  on  nanometer  scale  devices  where quantum  behavior  of  electrons  becomes  important. In these circumstances the  understanding  of  noise   effects   is   incomplete,   both   experimentally    and  theoretically. Results from this research may include unusual new  effects  or  detector devices which may find new  application  in  technology. This research project is interdisciplinary in  nature  and involves both graduate and undergraduate students who will be  excellently trained to enter positions in industry, government or  education.  ***",
