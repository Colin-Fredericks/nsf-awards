The project targets rural, impoverished school districts in the Lower Mississippi River Delta region of the three states.    The DRSI project will: (1) improve the K-14 learning environment in the targeted counties/parishes to address student needs and promote student achievement in science, mathematics, and technology (SMT); (2) increase the capacity of local communities to build and maintain quality science, mathematics, and technology educational opportunities; (3) establish mechanisms that promote the development and implementation of appropriate policies at local and state levels that will sustain SMT education reform; and (4) create a regional infrastructure that will utilize intra- and interstate alliances to develop sustainable regional improvements in science, mathematics and technology education.    The DRSI has 3 primary focus areas:      Local and regional capacity building and leadership development-The initiative will offer to the district and school personnel leadership institutes and professional development opportunities that are designed to promote standards-based instruction, and adoption of systemic reform principles. Some of these will be given directly by the initiative team or through sub-contracts, and some will be developed by the districts and supported by sub-awards from the initiative.    Resource convergence and brokerage-The initiative leadership and field personnel will provide assistance to regional school personnel in realigning and redistributing funding allocations in a manner responsive to systemic reform  . . . .  prmclples.    Technical assistance and on-site follow-up-The initiative, through field personnel, will systematically provide technical a ssistance to district and school personnel in a manner that will improve educational efforts to adopt standards-based practices.        DRSI will facilitate educational systemic reform by working directly with district and school personnel--some district-specific opportunities and some offered on a regional basis. Much of the district-specific work will be the responsibility of six Field Coordinators (FCs), who will be assigned to certain participating districts.  -",
