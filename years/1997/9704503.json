 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project plans to investigate how to best use multiple  workstations to support modern, highly interactive  applications.  The initial focus is on the real-time  rendering of 3D computer generated scenes.  These  applications present two key new problems in the use of  multi-computers: they stress resources in the machines  (e.g., memory bandwidth and outboard video processing  capability) other than just processor speed and network  bandwidth, and \"good performance\" means meeting the short  time deadline by which the next frame must be produced  rather than minimizing the duration of a fairly long  execution.  The focus of this project is on resource  allocation: how to divide system-wide resources among the  components of the problem that must be done so that  performance objectives can be met.  The current effort is  aimed at solving this problem in an environment where  both the work to be performed and the total resources that  are available are relatively constant from frame to frame.  A longer term goal of the work is to investigate the use of  replication to help assure that deadlines will continue to  be met in more dynamic environments.",
