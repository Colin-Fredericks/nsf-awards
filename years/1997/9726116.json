 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research proposes to  develop innovative data acquisition protocols for  information associated plant biodiversity voucher  collections.  The conceptual innovation of the proposed work  is the separation of the process of specimen data  acquisition from the processes of keystroke data entry.  Acquisition of data will be accomplished by imaging plant  specimens, in situ, within the collection galleries. The  images will then be communicated over the Internet to a  remote data entry contractor where the scientific data  within the image will be converted to structured data  records and then returned via the Internet to the  collection.    This data acquisition protocol development project is  significant for two reasons: 1) There are an estimated 60+  million plant specimens in research collections in the U.S.  alone.  Each specimen includes historical distribution data  on the world's flora and data from only an estimated 2% of  the specimens in U.S. collections have been captured in  automated systems.  This information stored in museum  cabinets is the result of 300 years of biodiversity  inventories on the planet and represents a monumental human  and financial investment in the US biological  infrastructure. 2) The project is critically examining the  scientific and management components of data entry  protocols, with the primary objective of minimizing cost.  The largest impediment to bringing the data archived on the  labels of 60 million plant specimens into currency is the  scale of the challenge.  This project will examine several  work protocol variations to attempt to find efficient and  economically scalable techniques that could be implemented  generically across the collections community for the rapid  development of computerized indexes of the holdings of  biodiversity research institutions.  The results of this  work will likely contribute significantly to the National  Biological Infrastructure (NBII) by producing tools,  protocols and standards  for rapid data entry from biological  collections.",
