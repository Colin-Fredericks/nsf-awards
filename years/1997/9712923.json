During this time researchers have delved into and employed tools from many branches of mathematics, from algebraic geometry to martingales.  The result is well founded mathematical system and control theory.  The rich vocabulary of concepts developed by systems and control researchers integrating dynamics, stability, optimization, uncertainty and information - has the potential to pay rich dividends if it is further nourished carefully and properly harnessed.    Thus we are at an exciting time which is opportune for a \"Workshop on Future Directions in Systems and Control.\"  Systems and control researchers with to key qualifications - accomplishment as well as vision - have been invited.  They have been instructed to present their work, which is well motivated technologically, based on a system theoretic foundation, and has and extrapolation which is inspiring.  The collection of these strands of excellence will inspire the collective by example, and serve as a catalyst for future directions.",
