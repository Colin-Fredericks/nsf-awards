 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past several years, there have been successful bridge  workshops and conferences through which were developed  excellent communication and cooperation not only among the  `U. S. bridge community` but also within the `international  community`.   This opportunity for international  communication and for development of cooperative efforts  between researchers of both continents is extremely  valuable.  This international meeting on bridge engineering,  involving researchers for the U. S., Canada and Europe, will  be held in Switzerland during the summer of 1997.  The  leading European organization for this meeting is the EMPA  (the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and  Research.)  The U.S. participants are selected by a Steering  Committee based on submitted abstracts and would focus on  practicing engineers and engineering faculty early in their  careers.  Preceding the workshop, the U. S. team will  participate in a two-day technical bridge tour prepared in  consultation with the workshop organizers.",
