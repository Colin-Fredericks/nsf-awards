 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Edgar/Trachtenberg - 9614174      This project involves efforts directed toward the joint development, implementation, validation and transfer of advanced model-based control systems for next generations rapid thermal processing (RTP) and plasma etching tools for single wafer processing.  It is a joint program between the University of Texas, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, Austin), a manufacturer, and two tool developers and equipment suppliers:  Matrix Integrated Systems (Austin, TX)  and AG Associates (San Jose, CA).  Microelectronics manufacturing requires advanced systems technology in order to achieve satisfactory yields, maximize throughput and reduce costs for 0.25 micrometer semiconductors.  Improved mathematical models, sensors, and control systems can provide the capability to automatically adjust processing conditions in response to changes in the process environment and market requirements.    To demonstrate the key concepts, the PI's will focus on the latest technology using single-wafer reactors.  For various commercial equipment systems, in rapid thermal processing, fundamental (theoretical) mathematical models will be developed that relate the operating and equipment design variables to performance.  These models will be verified using production data from commercial equipment located at various industrial sites.  Next they will research the application of new sensors and control strategies that permit design of advanced model-based controllers for each reactor.  The resulting control systems will be tested with real-time computer control of the reactors use of in-situ direct and indirect measurements will be investigated to improve controller performance.  For plasma etching systems, they will focus on the monitoring of end-point signals to determine when the end point is reached or if a fault has occurred with the equipment or wafer.",
