 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704630  Sposito    This project entails the application of dynamical systems theory to the problem of groundwater flow and transport in an isotropic aquifer of arbitrary spatial heterogeneity.  The overall objective of the project is to provide new physical concepts that permit greater advantage to be taken of recent breakthroughs in experimental methodology and computer simulation of field-scale groundwater movement.  The specific objectives of the project are:    To calculate and interpret the vorticity field for steady groundwater flow in a stratified aquifer, based on field measurements of the hydraulic conductivity, and to develop and \"extended phase\" representation of this flow.  To establish general conditions under which tracer-plume spatial concentration moments modeled as averages over an ensemble of advective flow trajectories can be equated to plume concentration moments determined from a single field experiment.  To investigate, using the methods of dynamical systems theory, conditions under which chaotic motions of a tracer following advective flowpaths can be induced, leading to more efficient tracer spreading in a heterogeneous aquifer.    These three objectives, if met successfully, will result in the following technical advances: (1) a confirmation of the hypothesis that the flow topology of an arbitrary, steady groundwater flow can always be transformed mathematically to that of steady flow in a perfectly-stratified aquifer; (2) precise criteria as to when stochastic transport models can be applied accurately to solute transport data from a single field experiment; and (3) a strategy for using chaotic advection to improve contaminant solute spreading in groundwater.  One postdoctoral researcher, Dr. Scott Weeks (Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics), will be supported by project funds.",
