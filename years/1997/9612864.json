 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some signal design/analysis problems relevant to wireless  communication are under investigation.  Problems in the first class  relate to a code-division multiple-access (CDMA) communication scheme  in which the receiver makes optimum multi-user decisions.  The effect  the selection of a particular sequence family has on the performance  of the system is under study.  One measure of performance is the  capacity, i.e., the number of active users that the system can  support.      Signature sequences influence this number through their periodic and  aperiodic correlation properties.  These correlation values tend to  diminish performance by reducing the minimum Euclidean distance  between distinct multi-user signal sets.  Preliminary investigations  turned up an interesting example involving Gold sequences of small  length in which correlations reduced the Euclidean distance between a  multi-user signal and its nearest neighbour to zero.       The obvious upper bound on capacity obtained by replacing each  aperiodic correlation by the maximum over the entire sequence family  provides much too conservative an estimate.  Thus improved upper  bounds are currently being sought.      This requires a better understanding of the distribution of aperiodic  correlation values obtained by picking a randomly-delayed random  subset of the entire family of signature sequences. This distribution  is under study both for a family of signature sequences in general as  well as for specific families known to be efficient with respect to  periodic correlation measures.      The understanding gained, will be used in the design of improved  signal sets. For example, preliminary investigations suggest that when  communicating data using phase-shift keying, improved performance will  result if each user's phase transitions never exceed 90 degrees   since this has the effect of distributing the aperiodic correlations  across the real and imaginary axes as opposed to simply the real axis.     The second class of problems  under investigation deals with the  IS-54/IS-136 North American digital cellular standard.   Here the goal  is to come up with an efficient forward error-correction (FEC) scheme  well matched to the IS-54/136 channel.   The motivtion came from  previous work in which a nonlinear binary FEC code identified by the  author (the Nordstrom Robinson code) turned out under soft-decision  decoding, to improve uniformly upon the performance of the  convolutional code used in the current IS-54 standard.  This was to  the surprise of many in both industry and academia as the binary code  is of short block length (16) and has a small minimum distance (6),  whereas the IS-54 employs a rate 1/2 convolutional code of contraint  length (6).         The reason for this improved performance is under  investigation and attempts are under way to identify the code best  matched to this channel.  Some other problems of a miscellaneous  nature, all relevant to improved wireless communcation are also being  studied.",
