 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research  (IAI) was created by the Agreement Establishing the Inter  American Institute for Global Change Research, done at  Montevideo on May 13, 1992 (`the IAI Agreement`). The IAI  was created to coordinate and promote scientific research  related to global change in the Americas.  The Institute has  an evolving `Scientific Agenda` identifying particular areas  for research.  The US has played a leading role in the  creation of the IAI and has been an active participant in  the IAI since its creation.       The Principal Investigator proposes to carry out a plan  of research according to a Science Agenda that has been  defined by the scientific community of the Americas in a  series of meetings held over the last five years, and agreed  upon by the member States.  The Scientific Agenda is  complementary to the research priorities of the US Global  Change Research Program, and the results from this research  will be available to the US scientific community.      The IAI will make awards under the third round of the  Initial Science Program (ISP) to teams of research  institutions based in IAI member States. The IAI will  evaluate submitted proposals in terms of technical merit  using a peer-review system. Additionally, several workshop  activities to coordinate on-going and planned efforts with  other USG agencies (NASA, NOAA) and other international  global change research efforts will be supported, as well as  a summer scholarship program for two to three students per  summer.      The IAI receives additional support for the ISP from  the other Parties to the Agreement Establishing the IAI:  Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Chile, Cuba, Mexico,  Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.  This  additional support takes the form of in-kind contributions  pledged directly to the IAI (20 full scholarships from the  Government of Brazil; 7 full scholarships from the  Government of Mexico; 2 full scholarships from the  Government of Canada), or in the form of pledges made at the  time of proposal submission in the form of investigator  salaries, ship-time, computer time, logistical support, etc.        The Inter-American Institute for Global Change  Research (IAI) was created by the Agreement Establishing the  Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research, done at  Montevideo on May 13, 1992 (`the IAI Agreement`).
