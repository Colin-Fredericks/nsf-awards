Techniques are based on past work of the PI  and collaborators on the foundations of algebraic conformal field theory,  including the theory of Zhu's associative algebras, quantum Galois theory,  existence and modular-invariance of twisted sectors, and a cohomological  theory of discrete torsion and Dijkgraaf-Witten cocycles.      In recent years, mathematicians and physicists alike have been developing  conformal field theory, which incorporates infinite-dimensional symmetry,  in order to understand certain critical phenomena and also (via string  theory) the first rigorous approach to quantum gravity. This effort is a  highly intensive mathematical endeavour, and the PI will investigate a  number of new phenomena in abstract algebra which are part of this program.  So-called vertex operator algebras constitute a rigorous mathematical  axiomatization of some of the main ideas of conformal field theory, and the  PI will continue his research into the symmetries inherent in these very  complicated objects in order to solidify the foundations of the subject and  to uncover new phenomena.",
