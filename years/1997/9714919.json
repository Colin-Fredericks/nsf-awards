Its work encompasses all of the life sciences,  from molecular genetics to biodiversity.  Since 1984 BB has  received contracts and grants for the conduct of discrete  studies and has received only a small amount of core support  to assist in the management of BB, in the oversight of its  committees, in the organization of special workshops, and in  the development of new ideas for studies.         This award provides modest support for core funding for  BB.  These funds will help invigorate the activities of the  Board at a time when rapid advances in biology are occupying  an increasingly important role, both in science and in  public policy.  BB will facilitate such core activities as a  yearly workshop for sponsors, board members, and other  experts to identify and discuss emerging issues in selected  areas and other activities of benefit to biological science.",
