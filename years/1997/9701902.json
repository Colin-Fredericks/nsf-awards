After a series of summer programs hosted by the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s (NOAA) National Severe Storm s  Laboratory (NSSL), scientists at various meteorological institutions Norman, OK   (collectively known as the Weather Center) met to discuss the summer program and  ways to improve it.  The result was a proposal to the NSF to establish a REU site at  the Weather Center.  The REU program proposed for 1991 addressed the concerns  identified by the hosts of the NOAA program with a plan to increase the number of  students, the number of mentors, and the variety of institutions participating, as well  as the level of financial support to be offered and an increased effort to recruit  students from underrepresented groups.  In addition to NSF, the NSSL continued its  support at about the same level as in 1990.  For ten weeks, from June 10 through  August 16, 1991, fourteen undergraduates from eight different states and nine  different undergraduate institutions participated in the program of lectures,  demonstrations, laboratory experiments, field trips, and individual research projects.   Their positive evaluations of their experience led to REU sites in the Summers of  1992 and 1993.         Under the current award, this series will continue with approximately ten  undergraduate students participating in the late Spring/early Summer of 1998.  At  the Oklahoma Weather Center, students will participate in atmospheric research and  data analysis under the supervision of mentors from throughout the Oklahoma  Weather Center. The students' research experiences will be supplemented by tours of  Weather Center facilities and lectures to produce a well-rounded summer learning  experience.  This will give the students an opportunity to become more aware of  scientific ethics an d issues relating to gender and racial discrimination, and to judge  for themselves whether a scientific research career might be right for them.  The  students will prepare and present papers reporting the results of their research.         The students will be provided housing, transportation to and from the REU,  and a modest stipend to make the program accessible to economically disadvantaged  students who must work during summers to support their continuing education.  The  Principal Investigator will make recruiting trips to encourage underrepresented  minorities and women to apply to the program.  For example, the Principal  Investigator will travel to and work closely with the Department of Physics at Clark  Atlanta University (CAU), a historically African-American university, in recruiting  motivated students.          The Principal Investigator also intends to perform  a follow-up evaluation of   students who have participated in these programs in the past in order to obtain some   measure of effectiveness.  ***",
