 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wise and Janecek  OPP 9710358  This award supports the activities of a committee of marine  geologists, designated SHALDRIL (shallow drilling), to  investigate the technical feasibility of installing a shallow  drilling system on vessels of the US Antarctic Program (USAP).  The committee held an organizational meeting in December, 1996,  at which it discussed several existing systems that might be  suitable for use on USAP vessels.  Some of the systems are still  in development, but two seemed particularly promising for use in  Antarctic waters.  These are 1) The Dolphin in situ sampling and  testing system by Fugro McClelland Marine Geosciences, Inc.,  Houston, Texas, and 2) the Terrabor system developed by A/S  Terrabor-Namsos in collaboration with the Institute of Solid  Earth Geophysics-Bergen, both located in Norway.    The SHALDRIL committee plans to hold a workshop in late August,  1997, to further evaluate these drilling systems with a goal of  field testing one or more of them on USAP ships in the near  future.  Prior to the August workshop, however, an technical  evaluation of the suitability and feasibility of installing these  systems on the USAP ships Nathaniel B. Palmer and L. M. Gould  must be carried out by a professional engineer. With that  information in hand, the committee can then consider recommending  future field tests and eventually field studies.    This award provides funds to support the SHALDRIL committee's  activities during 1997, namely to 1) commission the engineering  study of the candidate drilling systems, and 2) to cover the  costs of its meeting in late August.  This meeting is expected to  be held in or near Tallahassee, Florida, over a three day period.",
