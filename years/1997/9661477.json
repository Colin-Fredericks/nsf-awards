 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9661477  Pirzada      This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project will investigate the synthesis and processing of nano-engineered materials for switching power supplies operating above 5 MHz. Conventional materials have excessive eddy current losses at frequencies above 1 to 5 MHz levels, making them unsuitable for higher frequency applications. Monodisperse, nano-engineered materials offer breakthrough potential in enabling very high frequency (1 GHz) operation while maintaining unavoidable eddy losses to an acceptable level. During Phase I, this research will show that commercially useful, nano-engineered materials for switching power supply applications can produced. Phase II effort will seek to optimize the process and produce prototype ferrite components. Phase III will commercialize the technology.   If successful, this research would help launch miniaturized switching power supplies. Proposed research would provide the material related breakthrough eagerly sought by high frequency power supplies market.  Potential specific customers include the electrical, electronic, and communication industries.  The technology will also be timely for the anticipated market trend towards miniaturization of multilayer chip inductors for SMD applications.  ***",
