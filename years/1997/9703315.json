 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the basic problems that people face as social beings is to make sense of each other's behavior. This research project investigates how people solve this problem. The approach is to understand people's `folk theory of behavior,` which refers to the conceptual framework within which people describe, explain, and influence human behavior. By studying this `folk theory,` it is expected that regularities inherent in communication, interaction, and social relationships will be better understood. The theoretical model relies on two propositions:(1) that people distinguish between intentional and unintentional behavior, and (2) that people explain unintentional behavior by mere causes (e.g., inside the person, in the situation), whereas intentional behavior is explained with reasons (e.g., beliefs, desires). Initial evidence for these propositions has led to an integrative model of folk explanations. This model generates numerous implications that are tested in the present research program, grouped under four questions:(1) How do people judge intentionality? (2) Which behaviors do people attend to? (3) How do people evaluate behavior? and (4) How do people explain behavior? To answer these questions the research employs multiple methods, including questionnaires, interactive audio-visual computer presentations, detailed coding of existing texts (e.g., novels, diaries), and observations of dyadic interaction. The aim of this research program is to identify key components of people's folk theory of behavior and to examine their substantial implications for social perception and social interaction. The aim of the associated educational activities is to increase awareness, among students and the public, of social perception and interaction phenomena and of the principles that govern them.",
