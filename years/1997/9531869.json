 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531869    Schmitt    In conjunction with companion projects by Drs. S. Riser of the University of   Washington and K. Leaman of the University of Miami, approximately 145   profiling P-ALACE (Profiling Autonomous Lagrangian And Circulation Explorer)   floats (at least half of them with salinity) will be used to study specific   water-mass transformation processes in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic   as part of the Atlantic Circulation and Climate Experiment (ACCE).  The basin-  wide grid will be used to provide relatively uniform sampling to track upper   layer salinity and heat content changes throughout the basin.   Higher   resolution arrays will be deployed in important local regions where water   masses such as the high-salinity Subtropical Underwater (Leaman), relatively   uniform 18-degree water (Riser) are formed or transformed, or where important   air-sea exchanges are highly variable such as under the ITCZ (Inter-Tropical   Convergence Zone) (R. Schmitt).  The higher-resolution will allow tracking of   seasonal and interannual changes in the volume and structure of the upper   ocean features, and relate these to modeled/observed estimates of surface heat   and fresh water fluxes.    Analysis of these data will provide time series of three-dimensional maps of   the velocity, temperature, and salinity fields within the upper 1500 m of the   tropical and subtropical gyres over the duration of the ACCE field experiment.    Additionally, statistical analyses will provide spatial distributions of mean   circulation and quantities like eddy kinetic and potential energies, and eddy   mixing, in addition to the flux estimates. These gyre-wide estimates will   provide strong constraints for the future climate models that must be   developed to adequately include the physics of the tropical and subtropical   Atlantic, particularly the fresh water budget.",
