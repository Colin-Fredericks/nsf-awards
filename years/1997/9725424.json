 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues work done under IRI-9322400, which approaches instances of   the general nonlinear programming problem through the use of hybrid systems based on   genetic algorithms.  The systems, in which genetic operators may vary with the type of   problem, is designed to handle both continuous and discrete objective functions and both   linear and nonlinear constraints on continuous, integer, and Boolean variables.  Some   interesting clues to the difficulty in obtaining global solutions to these problems have been   found in the previous work and are now being investigated. The results of this research   will provide a better understanding of the principles of genetic algorithms and their   applicability to constrained problems of the sort found in intelligent systems and other   computational applications.",
