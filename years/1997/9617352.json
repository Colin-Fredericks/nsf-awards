The equipment will be used for several research projects, including:    A project to investigate linear and nonlinear magneto-optical properties of magnetic multilayers and nanocomposites, in collaboration with the Civil, Mechanical, and Environmental Engineering Department in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at The George Washington University.    A project to utilize the magneto-optical Kerr effect to analyze the magnetizing processes of such multilayers and composite materials by measuring the major and minor hysteresis loops of the surface magnetic layer of such materials that cannot be measured with our vector vibrating sample magnetometer.  This magneto-optical equipment will be used to investigate the properties of modern Preisach-based models of the magnetization process.  When used in a scanning mode, this equipment will permit direct comparisons of the magnetization pattern on the submillmeter scale with that computed using our micromagnetic models.    A project to utilize this equipment as a part of an advanced undergraduate laboratory electrical engineering course, and for a senior research project.  ***",
