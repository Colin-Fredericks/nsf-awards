The education  component of this award will focus on the integration of  computational methods into courses and departmental  infrastructure.    The research component is comprised of two parts.  The first  is a study of ground states and barriers in extended systems  such as fluid interfaces and magnetic domain walls.  New  methods for finding low-energy configurations of interfaces  and multiple interacting lines will be applied.  The second  component involves charge transport in arrays of mesoscopic  islands: in particular, charge transport in low temperature  arrays of sub-micron sized conducting dots coupled by tunnel  junctions.    The educational component involves developing courses which  communicates to both undergraduate and graduate students the  rich interaction between condensed matter physics and  computational physics.  Modern physical examples from  research will be introduced into the classroom to teach  students how to effectively use computational tools to study  scientific problems.  %%%   This is a CAREER award to a new faculty member who is  conducting research on computational methods to investigate  transport properties in condensed matter systems with  strongly interacting degrees of freedom.
