The PI who  is  a  junior  faculty member at Tennessee will measure the temperature dependence of  the surface state conductance and attempt to correlate these classical  transport  measurements with state densities and band  dispersions  as  measured  with  angle-resolved  photoemission,  electron  energy  loss  spectroscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy. In addition, we will  explore  the  possible formation of local magnetic moments  using  the  a.c. susceptibility technique in ultrahigh vacuum. It is expected that  this multi-technique approach will  ultimately  bridge  the  gap between surface  science  and  mesoscopic  physics, thereby generating a profound impact on both condensed matter  physics and semiconductor technology.  %%%  The  primary  goal  of this new research program  is  to  explore  the  fundamentals  of  electron  localization at crystalline  semiconductor  surfaces   or   in  ultrathin  epitaxial  films.  The   trend   toward  miniaturization of industrial components is leading to materials  that  are  so  small as to be nearly two-dimensional. The smaller a  sample,  the  more important its surface properties, simply because the surface  represents  a  higher  percentage of the sample.  In  order  to  learn  something  about surfaces, scientists have \"bombarded\"  surfaces  with  quantum  particles  such as electrons or photons. Unfortunately,  such  experiments are  extremely  difficult to relate to practical matters such as electrical  conductance. In this research project, we are exploring  new  ways  to  measure  the  electrical  and  magnetic  properties  of  semiconductor  surfaces  and thin films directly. A novel method is being implemented  to  electrically insulate the surface from the bulk  so  that  we  can  measure  the  electrical  resistance  o f  the  surface.  We  are  also  constructing a very sensitive nstrument capable of detecting extremely  weak  magnetic signals from a  surface. It is expected that these  new  measurements  will provide unprecedented insights that  will  help  to  bridge  the  gap between the physicist's world of atoms and  molecules  and the engineer's world of device fabrication.  ***",
