 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award continues NSF support for the core activities of the Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT), a standing committee of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC).  The Committee was established in 1972 at the recommendation of the President's Commission on Federal Statistics.  It fills a critical gap as a integrative force for a highly decentralized federal statistical system, in which research interests often have lower priority than other concerns.  The Committee works to improve, over the long term, the statistical methods and information on which public policy decisions are based.  It strengthens, directly and indirectly, the development of data for social, behavioral, and economic science research, makes such data more accessible for research, and furthers the development of methods for measurement, collection, and analysis for research and other purposes.  On its own initiative, or at the request of NSF or another agency, the Committee identifies problem areas in which statistical questions are important to public policy and carries out studies within these areas by itself or by convening panels of other experts.  Most of the Committee's studies fall under three major themes:  improving and furthering the development of data on social and economic conditions, including health, social welfare, and the environment; improving statistical methods and their applications; and integrating and coordinating national statistics.  The Committee provides leadership over interdisciplinary areas by bringing methodologically oriented statisticians and quantitatively oriented social scientists together with federal agency staff to work on problems important to public policy.",
