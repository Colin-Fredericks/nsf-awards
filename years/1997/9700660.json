 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will address a number of different topics in  the design and implementation of algorithms.  The common  theme of the research is application of advanced algorithmic  techniques techniques to practical problems.  Four specific  problem areas are under investigation:  (1) N-body  Simulation:  This is a collaborative project with the UW  Department of Astronomy studying N-body simulation.  The  basic objective is to improve the algorithms and data  structures used for massive simulations. The scale of  simulations raise quite a few interesting computational  geometry problems.  (2) Constraint Satisfaction: One method  of developing graphical user interfaces is to use a system  of constraints to specify the behavior of the interface.  Algorithms will be developed to solve the types of  constraint systems which arise in this domain.  There will  be particular emphasis on constraint hierarchies, and on the  efficiency of solutions. (3) The Traveling Tourist Problem:  The problem is to visit a set of cities in minimum time  where travel is restricted to a periodic timetable. In other  words, it is the traveling salesman Problem restricted to  public transportation.  Heuristic and exact algorithms for  this problem will be developed and implemented. (4) Model  Checking Software Specification: A technique from hardware  verification will be applied to a major problem in software  engineering.  In the last several years, symbolic model  checking has become a very important tool for hardware  verification.  This project is to investigate whether model  checking can also be applied successfully to evaluate  software specifications.  The specification of TCAS, a  collision avoidance system used in commercial aircraft will  be a major case study for the project.",
