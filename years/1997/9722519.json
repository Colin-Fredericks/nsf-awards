 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year grant will support the research of three  faculty members, two post-doctoral fellows, and three  graduate students to perform a variety of experiments in  medium-energy nuclear physics.  Much of the activity of the  group is focused around measurements of the neutron  polarization.  These experiments include studies of the  complete set of spin observables in the reaction of  polarized protons with a variety of targets at the neutron  polarization facility at the Indiana University Cyclotron  Facility.  These experiments use specialized detectors  developed by Kent State to measure normal and sideways  polarizations of the neutron simultaneously.  Measurements  with 2H 3He, and 4He targets would study the nucleon-nucleon  interaction part that is mediated by a single pion or rho  meson.  Other experiments would study the isovector response  of the nuclear continuum and the isovector giant dipole  resonance.  The determination of the electric form factor of  the neutron would be obtained from neutron polarization  measurements using polarized electron beams at the MIT-Bates  Laboratory and the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator  Facility (TJNAF).  Other experiments include a search for  three-body forces and a search for pion-field effects.  This  grant would also support experiments with the Crystal Ball  at the Brookhaven National Laboratory AGS and the CLAS  detector at Hall B at TJNAF in order to study neutral baryon  resonances and nucleon resonances, respectively.",
