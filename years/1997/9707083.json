The LAURENTIAN is an 80'  general research vessel constructed in 1974 and owned by the  University of Michigan.  The ship is scheduled for 60  operating days in 1997, of which 35 days are in support of  NSF-sponsored programs.  The ship operates primarily in the  Great Lakes.       The R/V  LAURENTIAN is a capable vessel for the work  proposed.  The program considers the ship important part of  the fleet due to its location.  The Laurentian is the only  UNOLS vessel that operates in the Great Lakes, and the  University of Michigan should be encouraged to improve usage  of the vessel.       This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National  Science Foundation to support oceanographic research  projects.  Most oceanographic research projects require  highly specialized equipment and extensive support from the  ship's crew.  Oceanographic projects require permanently  installed specialized equipment on specially designed  vessels.  This equipment also requires highly trained crew  members for maintenance and operation.  The ships do not  operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing  vessels.  Therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety  of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic research.  These vessels are operated by universities and research  institutions around the country.  ***",
