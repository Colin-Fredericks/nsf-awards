The traditional serpentine flow patterns have drawbacks such as lengthy channels and non uniform reactant distribution among the cells in the stack. The reactant flow path is of utmost importance in determining continued trouble-free fuel cell operation. The research objectives include designing flow patterns and manifolding for air and hydrogen, demonstration of performance in single cells and multi-cell stack, and establishing variables such as depth and width of a channel for optimum performance. Single fuel cells of active area 50 cm2 will be assembled using graphite bipolar plates with the designed flow-fields. The membrane-electrode assemblies will be self-humidified types developed by BCS Technology. The fuel cells will be operated with cathodic reactants air and oxygen, and anodic reactant hydrogen. One four-cell stack will be evaluated to verify its performance and the flow related hypothesis at the stack-level. The anticipated results from this project are better reactant distribution among individual cells, uniform performance of all cells in a stack, and improved management of the product water.   Improved stack operation and cost reduction are needed for commercial viability of the PEM fuel cell.  As the conventional energy sources get depleted, the PEM fuel cell, with its quiet, clean, and renewable energy, will make a strong impact as an alternate stand-by power source for numerous applications.  The PEM fuel cell may also be used as a propulsion unit in next generation vehicles. ***",
