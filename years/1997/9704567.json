 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chadam  9704567       Reactive flows in porous media may undergo shape  instabilities in the reaction (equivalently,  porosity/permeability change) front.  Because flow changes are  coupled to these instabilities, it now appears to be the case  that this reaction-infiltration mechanism plays an important role  in many strategically significant problems (see below).  The  investigator models such phenomena as coupled nonlinear  partial-ordinary differential equations and as moving free  boundary problems and investigates the importance of the role  played by dispersive effects, geomechanical effects, boundary and  inertial effects, layered and random media, concentration  dependent diffusivity and permeability and surface reactions.  Basic existence, uniqueness and regularity of the coupled system  of equations are studied as well as the sharp interface limit.  The loss of stability of high-symmetry solutions is studied using  bifurcation theory and numerical simulation.       These mathematical models of goechemical processes and the  results listed above have direct application to many problems in  the petroleum, mining and waste management industries.  For  example, in enhanced oil recovery, the loss of stability of the  spherical reaction front at the injection well often leads to  fingering of the reactants directly to the removal site  completely bypassing the oil.  Moreover the dissolution and  reprecipitation of the porous media by the reactants can  sometimes lead to complete plugging at the injection well  requiring expensive redrilling.  Similar processes can explain  observed reductions in the effectiveness of bioremediation of  environmental wastes or predict the observed, but previously  unexpected, rapid encroachment of nuclear and chemical wastes on  sensitive environments.  By calculating the shape of redox fronts,  these methods can also be used (avoiding expensive drilling) to  locate lens-shaped (roll-front) uranium deposits.  Funding for the  project is provided by the progra m of Applied Mathematics and the  Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS and by the  Hydrologic Sciences program in EAR.",
