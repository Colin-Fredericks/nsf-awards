 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract, Bass, 9700634       The project will address three areas of geometric group  theory.  The first concerns group actions on trees, particularly tree  lattices, i.e. discrete groups of automorphisms of locally finite trees  with finite volume quotients.  This theory is a discrete analogue of  the theory of Fuchsian groups acting on the upper half plane.  The  second area is the representation theory of finitely generated groups,  and particularly the structure of rigid groups, i.e. those with only  finitely many irreducible representations in each dimension.  When also  linear, these are conjecturally of arithmetic type.  The third area  concerns algebraic group actions on affine space, and, in particular,  flat families of representations of reductive groups, and the extent to  which these are globally equivariant vector bundles.      The project is an investigation of certain groups of  symmetries of various kinds of geometric structures.  In the first  instance these are infinite trees, ( i.e. connected graphs without  closed circuits), and our symmetry groups are discrete, and act with  say finitely many orbits.  In the second setting, we study finitely  generated groups via their matrix representations, particularly for  groups that have \"very few\" of these.  In the last case we study Lie  groups acting algebraically, but possibly non linearly, on Euclidean  spaces, and try to determine when certain such actions are  \"approximately linear.\"",
