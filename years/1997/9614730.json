This study will determine the rates of erosion of active, rapidly eroding mountains by studying the sediments that are shed from these mountains.   In particular, apatite and zircon crystals will be collected from recent and relatively recent sediments.  Because of their uranium content, the crystals preserve the ages of their cooling which occurred during uplift of the mountains and exhumation of the rocks.  The study area is the Southern Alps of New Zealand, where recent uplift is relatively well known, and sediments are readily sampled.  Results are expected to help understand the role of erosion rates during orogensis in general.",
