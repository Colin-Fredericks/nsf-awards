 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705284  Dixon    This is a new project on the physics of rare earth doped  silicate glasses for the formation of permanent and  transient refractive index gratings in rare-earth activated  silicate glasses.  These studies will help develop a  pjysical basis for tailoring the photorefractive properties  of these media for frequency-selective switches, holographic  memories, distributed feedback lasers, and other  applications in optical signal processing.  Glasses are  synthesized in-house and characterized for properties of  grating strength and kinetics.  These measurements are  supported by theoretical studies and by experimental studies  of the phonon physics and transport properties of the  glasses.  The PI's expect to demonstrate a prototype  frequency-selective optical switch using transient gratings.  Such a device is important in order to increase the capacity  of optical communications networks.  %%%  This is a new project on the physics of rare earth doped  silicate glasses for the formation of permanent and  transient refractive index gratings in rare-earth activated  silicate glasses.  The capacity of  fiber optical telephone  networks can be greatly increased, without installing new  cable, if messages carried by different light waves are  transmitted simultaneously along the same fiber.  To do  this, it is essential to be able to switch and separate  these different light waves so that the messages arrives at  the correct receiver.  Light wavelength-selective filters  and switches are an interesting means of accomplishing this.  The present research project is directed toward  understanding the physical processes and chemical  compositions that make rare earth containing silicate  glasses a class of materials in which to fabricate these  switches and filters.  The results of this research are  expected to provide a \"road map\" for tailoring the glass  chemistry and processing to produce efficient devices of  this kind.  One of the expected outcome of this work will be  a prototype  wavelength.  ***",
