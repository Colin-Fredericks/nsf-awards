 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research in several different areas of  gravitational wave astronomy, and also in areas of  gravitation physics and relativistic astrophysics will be  studied.  The principal topics are: (A) theoretical  simulations of the accuracy with which a network of  gravitational wave detectors will be able to measure the  distances to and masses of coalescing binary neutron stars,  the most promising expected type of source; (B)  investigations of how this accuracy will be improved by the  construction, now being considered, of additional detector  systems in Japan and/or Australia; (C) determining the  required level of accuracy for theoretical template  waveforms that will be used to analyze the experimental  data; (D) developing new calculational tools that will be  useful in future calculations of low frequency waves from  supermassive black holes; (E) exploring quantitatively the  prospects for measuring gravitational waves from distant  black hole --- black hole mergers, both by ground based  detectors and possible future space-based detectors; (F) an  exploration of the effects of `anti-gravity` that occur when  quantum fields are coupled to classical gravity, motivated  by the expectation that this phenomenon will yield insight  into the nature of quantum gravity; (G) theoretical  explorations of the structure of a black hole's interior  which probe deeply into the theoretical structure of general  relativity and bring out its poorly-understood nonlinear  features.  In addition a comprehensive introductory course will be  developed and taught at Cornell to graduate students and  interested faculty, covering the various aspects of  gravitational wave astronomy: the physical properties of the  waves as predicted by general relativity, the experimental  technology to detect them, the catalogue of anticipated  sources, and the information we hope to extract from the  waves about the nature of gravity, about cosmology, and  about the various sources.  The lecture notes will be made  available on the world wide web so as to be accessible to a  wide audience beyond Cornell.  These web pages will be  periodically updated to bring them up to date with the  latest theoretical and experimental research in the field,  thus tying the educational facility closely to current  research.  In summary, it is hoped that the course will  contribute to curriculum development, foster  interdisciplinary interactions, and disseminate specialized  knowledge to a wide audience.",
