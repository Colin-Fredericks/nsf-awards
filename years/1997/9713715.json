 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the surface modification of two classes of materials using a specially designed device in which fibers, wires, and powders can be surface modified.  The materials will be exposed to a plasma in which an organic monomer is injected. The objective of this research project is to design, build, and thoroughly test two bench-top size reactors in which bundles of fibers and batches of powdery materials can be coated with plasma-polymerized films.  This technology will constitute a new process for surface modification of these materials which is nonpolluting, as opposed to existing technologies which usually employ solvents.   One attractive aspect of a plasma polymerization process for surface modification of materials is that a wide range of polymers with different properties can be obtained from one monomer.  Thus, the film can be tailored to the application in terms of adhesion, chemical and thermal stability, mechanical and other properties.  Additional important aspects of the process are the low energy requirements and the absence of solvents, making the process environmentally attractive.",
