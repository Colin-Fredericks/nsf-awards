 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spring  9701082    The lubber grasshopper can take noxious chemicals (including  herbicides) from its diet and store them in its body. The  composition and quantities of these sequestered chemicals  depends on the internal, physiological capabilities of an  individual grasshopper. These qequestrative abilities, and  the compositions of secretions, vary greatly among  individuals. This physiological variation can be  characterized by isolating segments of the grasshopper gut.  Further, when attacked by predators, the grasshoppers  secrete the noxious chemicals as a deterrent. The PI can  perform experiments using collected secretion and live ants  to test the defensive efficacy of specific secretion  samples. This provides us with a system to examine the role  of internal, physiological variations on an animal's  interactions with other organisms. One of the chemicals that  lubber grasshoppers sequester from their diet is the common  herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-D). This herbicide is  commercially available in radioactive form, making it  relatively easy to detect and measure in the defensive  secretion. The PIs can measure the amount of 2,4-D in the  secretion of individual grasshoppers, and then test the  relative level of ant deterrence for each secretion sample.  Thus, we can not only measure the internal, physiological  variation in the uptake of 2,4-D but also characterize the  role of that variation in ecological interactions.",
