 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motion is a nearly universal feature of life that can inform the investigator about the biophysics, biology, and behavioral parameters of the subject.  In this project, motion analysis is being used as a way to demonstrate basic biological and physical principles and to introduce students to the analysis of complex systems using a multidisciplinary approach.    Students are developing protocols, troubleshooting them, and identifying the significant variables using five simple motion analysis stations that can analyze individual moving objects or points.  They then proceed to an automated CellTrak Motion Analysis station that can perform an efficient analysis of large numbers of moving objects or points in a matter of minutes. The processed data is then downloaded to the simple motion analysis stations for graphical and statistical analyses.        The project's educational objectives include      Establishing links between the Biology and Physics Departments that use analysis of motion as a way to introduce students to an interdisciplinary approach to scientific investigations.  Student interest is being developed in the boundary between biology and physics in a manner consistent with the interests of both departments.    The departments ability to offer investigative laboratory exercises that demonstrate basic principles in biology, physics, and computer data acquisition, as well as the analysis of data using statistics is being improved.      Faculty research interests are being more closely linked with actual classroom exercises so that students see clearly the relevance of what is done in the classroom laboratory.    This project's initial benefits are affecting two courses and student research (both independent study and sophomore research)  These experiences are also serving as catalysts for generating similar themes in other courses..",
