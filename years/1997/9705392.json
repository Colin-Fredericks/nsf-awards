 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9705392  Yao    This project is motivated by two recent developments at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center concerning the scheduling and resource management in computer operating systems: (1) implementation of the so-called \"time-function scheduling\" in both OS/400 (the operating system for IBM's AS/400 product line) and AIX (the UNLX-based operating system for IBM's RS/6000 product line); and (2) a prototype scheduler for distributed-memory, multiprocessor environments (e.g., IBM's SP2 and clusters of workstations), which integrates several scheduling paradigms such as gang scheduling and load-sharing scheduling.  In both cases, through extensive theoretical studies, in addition to empirical studies, it has been found that the schedulers provide effective and flexible control of resources that achieves a diverse set of scheduling objectives and improves the performance of a variety of applications in large and complex scientific and engineering applications.    What we propose here is to explore and establish the control-theoretic foundation of these schedulers, and in return further enhance the dynamic scheduling and resource management protocols in high-performance operating systems.  Specifically, we propose to study the mathematical structure of the schedulers in the context of discrete-event systems.  Some of the PI's recent works in this area have established the connection between the optimality of simple control rules of a wide class of discrete-event systems and discrete mathematical structures such as matroid and antimatroid.  Here, we want to explore related structures such as polymatroid and extended polymatroid, which are associated with conservation laws and generalized conservation laws of many stochastic systems, so as to bring out the effectiveness, or in some cases, optimality, of the schedulers.  We also propose to implement the theoretical results for empirical studies, by way of adding new features to the prototype testbeds at Watson.",
