The approach that will be taken includes both  experimental and theoretical work.  The experimental system that  will be studied is aluminum oxide-coated silicon carbide  suspensions.  There are several practical benefits of selecting  this system for study.  The yielding properties of aluminum oxide-  coated silicon carbide gel network will be measured by dynamic  and static rheological tests.  The same yielding properties will  be calculated based on a recently developed network yielding  theory.  The zeta potential needed for the calculation of  interparticle interaction will be measured, and will be compared  to the predictions of numerical simulation of ceramic coating on  particle surface.  The consolidation behavior of the aluminum  oxide-coated particle suspensions will be investigated with  sedimentation, centrifugation, and pressure filtration.  The  structural information about the coated particulate network will  be characterized by light scattering.  It is expected that by  making the connection between theory and experiment, a systematic  picture of structure-property relationship can be established for  the coated ceramic suspensions.  %%%  Ceramic powders coated with another ceramic material have been  used in many applications in colloidal ceramic processing.  The  ceramic coating can protect the core particles from dissolution.  The coating may modify the interaction between the core  particles, thereby improve the rheological properties of  suspensions.  Although the applications of ceramic-coated  particles are many, the understanding of the suspension  properties of coated particles is very limited. Intuitively, one  might think that the property of the coated powder would be  similar to that of the coating material.  However, as shown by  the results from rec ent studies, the consolidation and  rheological properties of coated-powder suspensions can be quite  complex.  There is a need to perform a systematic study on the  colloidal properties of coated powders so that their full  potential benefits can be harvested.  The research will have a  significant impact on the applications of silicon carbide and  alumina ceramics.  ***",
