 "awd_abstract_narration": "Society's embrace of information and our reliance on the distributed networked environments that carry that information is changing the definition of a \"liberally educated person.\"  The skills required of all college graduates (not just computer science majors) will soon include the electronic delivery of information and services.  This project constructs a laboratory where non-science students manage World Wide Web servers.  The project has two major objectives.  The first objective is to ensure that each student has a firm grasp of the computational tools required for manipulating, organizing and displaying quantitative data.  The second objective is to give each student the opportunity to manage the delivery of that information to interested clients.  In this introductory course in computing for non-majors, students employ common forms of applications software as tools and then disseminate their results via a personally-managed web server.  The quantitative tool-based component includes a significant emphasis on mathematical content to address the needs of other departments that depend on this service course.  The server-focused component addresses the client-server skills that will be required of graduates entering the workforce in the next century.  an interactive web page facilitates dissemination of the method to instructors at other institutions and permits the construction of tailor-made lab handouts.  Instructors have the flexibility to choose from examples that use a particular application tool independent of their choice of instructions for a particular delivery mechanism.  *",
