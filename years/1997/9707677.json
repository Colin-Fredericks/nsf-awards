 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences   Directorate, Professor Kenneth B. Wiberg, of the Department of Chemistry   at Yale University, studies the factors that control the properties,   reactions, and reactivity of organic molecules.  Through a combination of   experimental and theoretical approaches, Professor Wiberg addresses the   degree of structural distortion possible in small-ring compounds and the   changes in energy and other properties that result from such distortion.    Carbon-bridged spiropentanes are expected to have a remarkably high   degree of ring distortion, with theory suggesting the presence of a   nearly linear bond angle at the central carbon.  Theoretical and   structural studies of related spiropentyl cations address the factors   controlling the two different types of rearrangements observed for these   systems.  Questions related to the structure and stability of small-ring   cycloalkynes and the attack by methylene and by permanganate on   carbon-carbon double bonds are also targeted for synthetic and   theoretical analysis.  Professor Wiberg also explores the magnitude and   the origin of the equatorial conformational preference in monosubstituted   cyclohexanes, focusing on careful analysis of the conformational   preference of the methyl group and on the role of entropy terms in   determining conformational preferences.  Theories regarding the structure and reactivity of organic molecules   continue to be tested experimentally, through the preparation of   molecules designed to probe the limits of chemical bonding, and   theoretically, through the calculational analysis of bonding issues in   such molecules.  Professor Kenneth B. Wiberg, of the Department of   Chemistry at Yale University, with the support of the Organic Dynamics   Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the   Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, explores molecules known   or expected to display extreme structural distortions.  These studies   target a number of classes of molecules, particularly those in which bond   angles at carbon atoms forming part of a small ring are forced to deviate   markedly from their preferred values in the absence of the geometry   enforced by these small rings.  Through these studies, Professor Wiberg   gains fundamental knowledge regarding the factors that control the   properties, reactions, and reactivity of organic molecules.",
