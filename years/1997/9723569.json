 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723569  Goldsby      This project is studying the development of the primary antibody repertoire in cattle.  In cattle the ileal Peyer's patch (IPP), a gut associated lymphoid tissue, is a major site of B cell diversification.  A process of targeted, developmentally regulated somatic point mutation is responsible for the generation of diversity in the IPP.  However, this is not the sole site or mechanisms for diversification in cattle, since the spleen has been shown to be a site of light chain diversification  during fetal development.  Also,  this investigator has data suggesting that heavy chain V gene rearrangement (but not light chain) occurs in the bone marrow. Thus the following  hypothesis is proposed for the development of B cells in cattle : 1)In the fetal bone marrow rearrangement of heavy but not light chain occurs; 2)Cells with rearranged heavy  chain genes migrate to the spleen where light chains rearrange; 3)Peyer's patch follicles are seeded with B cells from a pool that has undergone diversification in the fetal spleen.  Experiments will be done to test this hypothesis. These results will provide information on how antibody diversification develops in cattle, and will indicate species differences in the generation of diversity.  This grant is from a RUI college, and undergraduate students will be involved in this research.  %%%    Although all higher vertebrates have similar immune systems consisting of antibodies produced by B cells and T cells which modulate the immune response, the mechanism by which organisms generate antibodies  with different specificities is not the same in all species.  The experiments in this project will provide information on the development of diverse antibodies in cattle.   ***",
