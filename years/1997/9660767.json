 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9660767  Catalano      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I program will prove the feasibility of polycrystalline, thin film heterojunction infrared photovoltaic devices based on the II3V2 class of semiconducting compounds. Though these materials have not been extensively investigated, they possess numerous properties which make them well suited for many electro-optic applications, potentially rivaling III-V materials in importance. The devices developed in this study are intended to be used in broad band thermophotovoltaic (TPV) converters for a variety of commercial applications. This work will develop the deposition processes, characterize the materials, and prepare, test and characterize the appropriate II3V2 devices. Organometallic chemical vapor deposition (OMCVD) will be used to deposit the material. Because these compounds possess essentially the same crystal structure, and prior investigations have shown little minority carrier loss due to grain boundary recombination, we feel that polycrystalline devices have a high probability of success. Moreover, the high light flux densities encountered in the TPV application, should help overcome recombination losses via this mechanism. Several different device geometries will be examined.   The proposed technology is essential to producing low cost thermophotovoltaic (TPV) converters.  Such devices will lower the cost of TPV systems to the extent they will be competitive with other forms of power generation.  The potential size of the market for these products is extremely large.  ***",
