A set of experiments involving quartz  crystal  microbalance   (QCM)   studies   of   friction   in    controlled  environmental conditions and well-defined contact geometries will  be  performed.  Some  of these seek  to explore  the  fundamental  mechanisms  of  energy  transfer at a  sliding  interface,  while  others  will investigate model lubrication systems which  are  of  relevance  to actual engineering applications. One system  to  be  studied  consists of selected rare gas and alkane layers  sliding  on  clean  (111) metal surfaces. Model lubrication systems  under  study  include atomically-uniform C60 surfaces in contact with  a  liquid;  and  hexanes and synthetic lubricants  in  contact  with  atomically   uniform  metal  surfaces.  In  the  latter   systems  properties  of  interest include the viscosity  and  slippage  of  molecularly thin lubricant layers forming immediately adjacent to  the  surface,  topics which are related to the performance  of  a  lubricant in the transition region between elastohydrodynamic and  boundary lubrication.  %%%  This  experimental research project is devoted to  improving  the  scientific  understanding of friction forces and related  heating  effects.  An  understanding of these effects on the basic  atomic  scale  is sought, making use of advanced experimental techniques,  including the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) which can  detect  single  atomic  monolayers. The work  focuses  on  mechanisms  of  energy  transfer  during sliding friction; and  the  viscous  and  elastic properties of liquid lubricants close to a solid surface.  Improvements  in  understanding here can be of great  importance,  because  the range of technology involving mechanical motions  is  broad   and   has  great  economic  importan ce.   The   work   is  interdisciplinary in its nature and the graduate students in this  program  will receive an excellent education preparing  them  for  employment in industry, government or education.  ***",
