Until now, the possibility of monitoring the dynamics which occur as a surface evolves between different equilibrium states has been very restricted, because ultrafast x-ray sources with sufficient flux and time resolution have not been available. X-ray wavelengths below 3.5 nm source to resolve the first steps in processes such as melting, adsorption and desorption. The soft-x-rays are generated as a low-divergence x-ray beam, with pulse durations under lO fs, perfectly synchronized to an exciting laser, and are tunable throughout the soft-x-ray region. They can also be generated with more than sufficient flux for time-resolved x-ray photoemission experiments. The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). %%% This is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education. The proposed project provides education and training in a diversity of areas such as electronic and semiconductor materials, laser and optical technology, fast electronics, extreme ultraviolet and x-ray science, and vacuum technology, providing strong preparation for working in fields such as the semiconductor and optics industries, soft x-ray lithography, and microscopy. ***",
