 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706915  Wehr   The proposal discusses three circles of problems arising in mathematical physics of   random systems.  While the problems concern very different physical situations, at the   mathematical level they all deal with situations where presence of disorder can significantly   change properties of the system. Part one studies ground states of random lattice models   in statistical mechanics---a question related to understanding thermodynamics of   disordered systems.  In part two the focus is on effects of randomness on propagation of   nonlinear waves described by partial differential equations---of the conservation law and   Hamilton-Jacobi type.  The content of part three is statistics of density and of pairwise   velocities of galaxies in the universe. From the point of view of mathematics, each part of   the proposal involves studying nonlinear functions of many independent random variables   or of the realizations of a simple underlying process (often a Gaussian one). This relates   the project thematically to the theory of large deviations and concentration of measure   phenomena.  The tools include functional limit theorems, ergodic theory, large deviation   estimates and martingale methods in the first two parts and generalized Gaussian   processes in the third part. The interplay of physical and mathematical ideas is essential in   the whole proposal.   Many interesting questions in mathematical physics are concerned with   complicated inhomogeneous systems.  For example, a realistic description of a solid often   has to take into account presence of defects and impurities, which make its physical   properties different from those of a homogeneous crystal.  These special properties of   disordered systems are of crucial importance in modern materials science and technology    --- semiconductors and glasses are examples of disordered materials. Another example is   the distribution of galaxies in the Universe --- their positions do not follow any simple   regular pattern and us ing such a pattern in modeling their configuration would not account   for observed phenomena. While detailed configuration (arrangement of atoms, galaxies or   other constituents) of an inhomogeneous system varies from one region in space to   another, there is often an underlying simple statistical regularity, which leads to modeling   and studying such systems using concepts and methods of probability theory.  Each of the   three parts of the proposal addresses a different physical problem of the above type. Part   one involves the study of models of disordered solids, focusing on their ground states ---  the energetically preferred configurations.  Part two is concerned with propagation of   waves in disordered media --- several applications of mathematics to hydrology are of this   type. The content of part three is fluctuations of various quantities related to the   distribution of matter in the Universe and statistical questions arising in interpreting   observational results. The general physical motivation behind the proposal is to understand   possible effects resulting of the presence of randomness in different physical systems.",
