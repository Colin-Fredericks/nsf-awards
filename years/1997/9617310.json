Michigan State University    CISE Research Instrumentation for an SMP Cluster Testbed     This award provides funds for the purchase of a cluster of symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs), interconnected by a high-speed switch, to be used in parallel and distributed data processing   research.  The SMP cluster will be connected to existing research facilities, creating a rich research infrastructure.  The primary purpose of the testbed is to support experimental studies in four   projects: large-scale parallel data clustering as applied to image processing; communication algorithms and libraries for distributed parallel computing; programming support tools for specification and design, visualization, and resource allocation; and design of parallel algorithms for feature extraction and matching in large-scale, distributed, fingerprint databases.  The results of this experimental research will provide a better understanding of the issues and problems that must be addressed in developing distributed parallel software for SMP clusters. Moreover, these projects will produce tangible results in the form of applications software, libraries, and tools for use by other researchers and developers.  The Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering, and Michigan State University are strongly committed to the success of this project, as evidenced by significant matching funds, leveraging of existing equipment, and commitments for maintenance and support of the testbed.",
