 "awd_abstract_narration": "Klibanov  9704923       A fundamental challenge in inverse problems is the  determination of the composition of an unknown medium given the  boundary measurements of radiation by an outside source into the  medium.  The investigator and his collaborator make a theoretical  and numerical study of this problem from situations modeled by  the parabolic/diffusion equation using a novel approach -- the  Elliptic Systems Method (ESM).  The ESM involves the derivation  and solution of a system of coupled elliptic partial differential  equations with boundary conditions developed from a normalized  form of the temporal data.  The diffusion and absorption  coefficients of the medium are then reconstructed from the above  normalized solution, yielding the composition.  This project  involves a number of explorations, extensions, improvements and  testing of this new method applied to a variety of situations.  It  provides a fast and accurate new approach to the important  problem of reconstructing images from scattered data.       In a recently published report by the National Research  Council (Mathematics and Physics of Emerging Biomedical Imaging),  a call is made for the development of new effective medical  imaging algorithms.  An example is the early imaging of small  cancerous breast tumors using optical (near infrared laser)  methods.  Cancerous tumors are more light-absorbing than the bulk  of breast tissue, leading to an increased interest in developing  early detection methods by \"optical\" mammography.  The difficulty  is that unlike x-rays, which travel in essentially straight  lines, light is highly scattered, making reconstruction  difficult.  The investigators develop their new approach to this  problem, which uses the methods of numerical solutions of partial  differential equations to achieve rapid and accurate  reconstructions.  This approach, among other applications, has a  very good potential to lead to an optical alternative to x-ray  mammography exams or to a decrease in the number  of biopsies  resulting from false positives.",
