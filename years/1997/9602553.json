 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structure and function of scientific research and  education at academic institutions in the United States is  in a period of great change.  Many academic institutions are  considering plans to down-size in terms of staff and  funding, such that a reevaluation of their overall mission  is necessary (Selvin 1995).  One common theme is to focus  the efforts (and talents) of multiple investigators,  departments, and institutions in an integrated manner  towards problem-solving.  This development may be both a  necessity of limited budgets, and a reality of the types of  scientific problems that exist today.  This is particularly  true of studies on large ecosystems like the world's Oceans  and Great Lakes.  Environmental changes in these systems can  often be related to human activities (climate change,  eutrophication of exotic species), that often manifest  themselves over large spatial and temporal scales with  global implications.  In this way, centers of  multidisciplinary academic excellence may be valuable now  more than ever.    The State University of New York, College at Buffalo  supports one of the few academic field facilities on the  Laurentian Great Lakes.  The field station is operated out  of the Great Lakes Center (GLC), which is affiliated with  the School of Natural and Social Sciences. This project will  help refine the mission statement of GLC establish  collaborative connections with other institutions  in the Great Lakes region, and to plan and further develop  the physical facilities at our field station.    Objectives for the project are three-fold:    1.  To obtain feedback and suggestions regarding the mission  statement for the GLC's multidisciplinary Great Lakes  Environmental Studies Program.    2.  To facilitate communication and potential collaborations  between the GLC and other institutions in the Great Lakes  region, including scientists (particularly from field  stations), regulatory agencies, and local government.    3.  To produce a written 5- year Strate gic Development Plan  to help guide the further development of physical facilities  that support the GLC's program.",
