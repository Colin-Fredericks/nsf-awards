 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with the development of a methodology  for the simulation, analysis and design of high-order, complex  nonlinear dynamical systems that have an underlying multiple time-  scale structure. The methodology provides for time-scale  identification, efficient numerical simulation, and reduced-order  model development. The specific objectives of the project are to  extend the (CSP) Computational Singular Perturbation to a wide  class of multiple time-scale optimal control problems, establish  rigorous theoretical foundations for the method, develop and test  algorithms, and apply the algorithms to design problems in  robotics and aeronautics. The fundamental issues being addressed  are: how to identify multiple time-scale structure in a nonlinear  system and how to exploit multiple time-scale structure for  simplified simulation, analysis and design. the research  establishes a significant new capability for nonlinear system  design. the order reduction, better conditions, and physical  understanding - previously obtainable only for low-order systems  by analysts applying the analytical singular perturbation method  - will be obtainable for high-order, complex, nonlinear systems  that have multiple time-scale behavior - systems such as  machines, structures, ground vehicles, aircrafts, spacecrafts,  robots, and other mechanical systems.",
