 "awd_abstract_narration": "9709159  Riechert  It is well known that behavior is influenced not only by the  design  of an animal's nervous system, but also by chemicals produced by  its  endocrine system (i.e., hormones). These two influences interact  in  determining individual behavior and both systems are genetically  determined. This study tests the validity of the Conflicting  Tendency  Model, proposed to explain the potential interaction between  factors  that operate antagonistically in determining the behavior of  individuals on  a continuum from 'fearful' to 'aggressive.' The PI has identified  a possible  genetic basis for territorial behavior in a well-studied animal  model system (the desert funnel-web spider Agelenopsis aperta),  in which the action of each of two antagonistic factors -  one controlling tendency to flee or 'fear', and the other  determining  tendency to attack or 'aggression' - can be separated through  selected  breeding experiments. By comparison of the behavior of spiders  from  populations that differ in tendency to escalate fights, respond to  predators  and attack prey, and selectively bred genetic lineages, the PI  will examine  genetically-based aggressive tendency. In addition to testing the  hypothesis that  hormones may act in opposition to one another in determining  motivational states,  the work is important for the insight it provides into the genetic  bases of  such complex behavioral traits as fighting behavior, boldness  towards  predators, and attack responses towards prey.",
