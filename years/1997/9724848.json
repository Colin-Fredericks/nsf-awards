 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. David Ferguson received his Ph.D. in Mathematics and Science  Education from the University of California-Berkeley in 1980.   Currently he is a Professor in the Department of Technology and  Society at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.           Dr. Ferguson has been a major force behind the emergence of Stony  Brook s most successful programs for minority students. In addition  to recruiting other faculty colleagues to increase the minority  participation in their programs, Dr. Ferguson has accomplished the  following:         Took the initiative and coordinated The Alliance for Minority       Participation (AMP) Program for the SUNY system.  His efforts       have impacted the entire state.               Raised several million dollars in addition to the above to       support mentoring programs from high school to graduate       school.         Provides leadership throughout the state in offering advanced       opportunities for minority students.               Impressive mentoring of undergraduate students.  These efforts       give students research experience, sustained academic support       and strategies leading to successful matriculation and degree       completion in science and engineering fields.         Impressive support letters noting his commitment, enthusiasm       and untiring efforts to recruit and retain underrepresented       groups in science, engineering and mathematics.",
