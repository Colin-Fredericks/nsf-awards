These studies focus on MAP 4, a   microtubule-associated protein that is  expressed during early development and in specific   adult tissues in mice.  The working hypothesis  is that the functions of this ubiquitous   protein are context-specific; MAP 4 structure and functions in cycling cells may differ   from those in differentiated tissues.  The basic approach will be to  dissect how variations   which naturally arise either by alternative splicing or by post-translational  modification   affect MAP 4 behavior within cells.   Chimeras will be generated in which MAP 4   constructs are modified at sites corresponding to characterized post-translational   modifications or which reflect primary sequence variations observed in specific tissues.    Living cells transfected  with MAP 4 constructs tagged with green fluorescent   protein or its spectral variants will be analyzed to deduce how such changes in MAP   structure affect microtubule dynamics in interphase and mitotic cells.  Other aspects of   cytoplasmic organization, including the distribution of cytoskeletal elements or major   membranous organelles, will also be analyzed to assess whether specific domains of   MAP 4 may interact with non-microtubular structures.  These studies should  provide   fundamental information on whether this ubiquitous protein has multiple roles depending    on its place of expression.       Microtubules comprise one of the three major cytoskeletal systems in eukaryotic cells, and   one of two such systems known to be involved in intracellular motility phenomena by   serving as specific \"tracks\" along which ATP-powered molecular motors (dyneins and   kinesins) move.  In addition to the motor proteins, other specific proteins (\"Microtubule-  Associated Proteins, or MAPs) are  known bind to microtubules, although their functions   are far from established.  Dr. Olmsted will carry out functional studies of one of these   MAPs, termed MAP-4.  The structure of the MAP-4 protein is known to vary among   different tissues, as a result of alternative splicing (different ways in which the cell \"reads\"   the gene) and/or posttranslational modifications; however, the functional significance of   these variations is unknown.  These functional studies will employ state-of-the-art   approaches such as site-directed mutagenesis and \"green fluorescent protein\" (a marker   that allows one to literally see, in a microscope, exactly where the MAP-4 protein is   located within the cell).  Evidence increasingly suggests that these various cytoskeletal   systems are not independent, but rather are dependent upon one another in terms of their   function within cells.  The results of these studies are expected to help us understand   MAP-4 function and its possible role in coordinating microtubule function with various   cellular structures, including other cytoskeletal systems.  ***",
