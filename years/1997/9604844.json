 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:  Halpern  IBN:  9604844    Correct development of the brain and spinal cord of the vertebrate central nervous system requires cellular interactions between cells of different types, and a cascade of signals.  One well-studied interaction occurs between the notochord, which is located in the mesodermal, or middle, layer of the early embryo, and the overlying cells of the outside, ectodermal layer, which are destined to become the nervous system.  Notochord produces a signaling protein called Sonic hedgehog that induces the formation of specialized floor plate cells in the neurectoderm.  Floor plate cells in turn have patterning functions mediated by Sonic hedgehog:  they induce motor neurons to differentiate and guide axons within the nervous system.  Recent studies in mutant zebrafish by the PI and her collaborators indicated that zebrafish mutants without notochords nevertheless develop a floor plate.  This suggested that floor plate may be specified earlier than previously thought, before notochord formation.  Two genes related to hedgehog are expressed before there are any obvious morphological differences between cells.  Surprisingly, however, the two genes are expressed in discrete cell layers, one that will give rise to notochord and an overlying layer that is hypothesized to give rise to floor plate.  The investigators will use cell lineage studies to test this hypothesis.  They will also use the technique of transplanting single cells between layers to determine how distinct hedgehog-expressing cell layers form, and whether cells in these layers are committed to forming either notochord or floor plate.  Further insight will be obtained through the analysis of mutations that perturb formation of the discrete hedgehog-expressing cell layers, and as a consequence, alter the channeling of cells into notochord or floor plate pathways of differentiation.  Results from this research will increase our understanding of how cells become properly specified in the early embryo, which has importa nt consequences for the later organization of the nervous system.",
