 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title of Proposal: Modeling and optimization of diffractive  optical structures             Project Summary    The PI proposes training on the professional development of two  Mathematical Sciences Industry-Based Graduate Research  Assistants.  The first objective of the training activities is to  prepare the graduate students with skills and experiences that  will make them strong competitors in an industrial environment.  Another objective is to produce the graduate students who have  qualifications that will make them important contributors to  science and technology developments in a academic/industrial  environment.    The proposed research focuses on computational methods and  numerical analysis for modeling and design of optical  micro-structures  in linear and nonlinear optical media. The  research will extend the PI's long term collaboration with  Honeywell, Inc., and develop a new collaboration with Cray  Research, Inc. It will provide opportunities for the graduate  assistants to engage in academic/industrial joint research  programs and make important contributions to an exciting area of  applied and industrial mathematics.    The main topics of the proposed research are as follows:     -- Computational modeling of optical coatings. Multiscale               finite element methods.     -- Inverse and optimal design problems in diffractive optics.     -- Surface enhanced nonlinear optical effects.  Optimization            and design problems in nonlinear optics.  These problems are motivated by industrial applications.    This project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS)",
