 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700844 Lau This project addresses basic materials research issues in the combination of materials associated with metal contacts to gallium nitride.  The proposed research emphasizes fundamental mechanisms and processes along with some of the practical aspects of nitride contact technology.  The approach involves a systematic study of barrier heights of various Schottky diodes, and solid state reactions to produce intermediate materials such as platinum silicide which lead to thermally stable Schottky barriers, and low resistance contacts between metals and nitrides.  The project emphasizes strong interlinking between materials growth, characterization, physical property measurements, and related device research efforts.  %%% The project addresses forefront research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance, compact and efficient light sources in the blue-green spectral region.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry, in general.  Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
