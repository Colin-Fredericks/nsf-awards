For  such  systems there is generally a characteristic energy scale in  the  infrared which separates a strongly correlated low-energy region  from  a high-energy region in which interaction effects are much  less  significant.   The  proposed  research  seeks  to  use   spectroscopic  measurements to probe the dynamics in this crucial infrared range  and  thereby  to  develop an understanding of correlated systems.  Specific  systems  to  be  studied include Kondo insulators, mixed-valent systems, metal-  insulator  transitions driven by magnetic order,  and  superconductor-  insulator  transition systems. These experiments  will  elucidate  the  nature  of   the  charge  dynamics  in  these  systems,  and  explore  crucial  relationships between charge dynamics,  magnetism, disorder and localization. Results will provide both a test  of and a stimulus for  theoretical  work  in this area at the forefront of  condensed  matter  physics.  %%%  This  is  a  new  project to study systems in  which  the  effects  of  electron interactions extend the physics  beyond  the  domain  of  simple non-interacting  theories  of  solids.  Although our basic understanding of metals and semiconductors is built  on theories of non-interacting electrons, future electronic  technologies   will   increasingly   include   materials   in    which  interactions  between electrons play a role.  It is thus important  to  fully   understand  the  electronic  properties  of  these  correlated  electron  systems,  in which phenomena occur that  cannot  be  readily  predicted from a knowledge of the system components (the electrons and  nuclei),  but rather, arise in a non-obvious way from the interactions  between  them.  (Examples  include magnetism  and  superconductivity.)  This proposal is directed toward the study o f electron dynamics in the  infrared spectral region, which encompasses the energy range  relevant  to  the  formation  of most correlated electron  states  and  is  thus  particularly  important.  Systems to  be  studied  include  rare-earth  compounds that can be viewed  as correlated semiconductors, and  oxide  systems  where an interplay between magnetism and electrical conductivity leads  to striking effects (e.g., giant magnetoresistance).  The experimental  results  can be expected to stimulate and test theoretical efforts  in  this area at the  forefront of condensed matter physics.  ***",
