 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  CTS-9613742  Juan dePablo, U. of Wisconsin - Madison    Large-scale atomistic computer simulations of clay swelling by aqueous electrolyte solutions will be performed, and compared to experiments.  The \"expanded ensemble\" molecular dynamics approach, developed by the P.I. for polymer gels, will be extended to clay studies.  A connection is made between the molecular microstructure and macroscopic behavior of the respective materials.  While the dynamic simulation research is performed at the University of Wisconsin (Madison), the complementary experimental clay research is carried out at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).  This award will provide support for travel between the two partners.    This project was submitted in response to the NSF-CONACyT Collaborative Research Opportunities Announcement (NSF 96-145).  A parallel proposal was submitted by UNAM to CONACyT, and an award was recommended by CONACyT.    The research has primary relevance to soil mechanics and the stability of oil recovery wells.",
