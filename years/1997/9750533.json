 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jersey City State College (JCSC) and its Biology Department are diverse, dynamic entities that are evolving into larger, more sophisticated institutions of higher education. New Jersey is home  to major pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, biomaterials and chemical corporations  which employ thousands of graduates of area  colleges and universities in technical and professional positions.  Several institution-wide initiatives  are currently in place or in the planning stages which are intended to provide JCSC students, many of whom are women, underrepresented minorities and teachers-in-training, with a learning environment which will allow them to be competitive in graduate education and  the regional job market.          A full-year course sequence in cell and molecular biology (Cell & Molecular Biology I&II) has been designed to cultivate the knowledge base and technical expertise necessary for success in technology-based positions.  Cell & Molecular Biology I , a course in molecular cell biology studies the form and function of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.  The organization, physiology and reproduction of cells are examined, and accompanying laboratory experiences introduce classical and contemporary methods of cell study. Cell & Molecular Biology II, a course in molecular genetics, examines physical and biological  properties of nucleic acids, including DNA replication, gene expression, recombination, mutation, and DNA repair.  The laboratory component introduces students to basic techniques of recombinant DNA technology.",
