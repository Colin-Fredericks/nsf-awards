 "awd_abstract_narration": "9526881  Davis    The purpose of the proposed research is  to determine the nature and cause of spatial variability of 36Cl in water which has entered the subsurface between 50 and 10,000 years ago.  Information concerning geographic variations is necessary for interpretation of hydrologic studies of ground-water recharge in arid regions, of accumulation rates of glacial ice, of ground-water \"age\", of the origin of chloride in saline lakes, of the origin of deep subsurface brines in crystalline rocks, and of other studies related directly and indirectly to the field of hydrology.  In addition to providing critical baseline information for other projects, the proposed research will include sampling of water older than 10,000 years in a few carefully selected aquifers to study changes in past rates of natural atmospheric production of 36Cl.  Primary data for the proposed research will be obtained from analyses of ground water from various parts of the United States and from adjacent areas in Canada and Mexico.  Samples will be analyzed for major ions using chromatography and for 36/Cl/Cl using accelerator mass spectrometry.  In addition, analyses for tritium and 14C will be made to help determine isolation time of ground waters.  In arid western North America, where suitable water samples may not be available, supplemental information may be obtained from 36Cl extracted from below the depth of penetration of the weapons fallout in the soil profile.  Additionally, one or more samples will be obtained from glacial ice from mountains in western North America.",
