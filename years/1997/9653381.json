 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is broadening the horizon of mathematics educators in the region and in the nation through the production of twelve workshops, four during each of the summers from 1997 through 1999, for college faculty. The workshops are focusing on technology and applications in undergraduate mathematics. Each summer features a one-day overview workshop, a three-day workshop on calculators in undergraduate mathematics emphasizing applications in entry level mathematics, a three-day workshop on computer algebra in undergraduate mathematics with participation by professional engineers showing working applications of mathematics, and an Internet workshop which enables participants to learn about all forms of electronic communication and facilitates establishment of their own presence on the Internet. Each of the three-day workshops accommodates 25 participants. Of particular note is the involvement of secondary school teachers in the workshops, and recruitment strategies and workshop activities that target faculty involved in pre-service teacher preparation courses and programs. Additionally the project is hosting two three-day conferences during the summers of 1998 and 1999 on the applications of computer algebra systems to education and research in the mathematical sciences. The research portion of the conferences is supported by Oklahoma State University. These conferences feature a strong interaction among mathematics educators and researchers.",
