 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program supports Professor Philip P. Garner, of the   Department of Chemistry of Case Western Reserve University, in his   studies of the development of a new class of recyclable chiral   auxiliaries for asymmetric synthesis with chiral heteroalkyl radicals.    Prototype hydroxyalkyl radical equivalents contain a chiral acetal group   derived from either carbohydrates or terpenes.  General methods,   including radical translocation, for the formation of chiral   acetaloxyalkyl radicals are under development for the preparation of   these materials.  Systematic variation of the auxiliary structure,   coupled with ab initio transition state structure modeling, addresses the   nature of the interactions responsible for asymmetric induction and   facilitates their optimization.  Both inter- and intramolecular variants   of atom/group transfer reactions as well as additions to carbon-carbon   double bonds are explored, as is methodology to permit the efficient   removal and reuse of the chiral auxiliaries.  Bidirectional and iterative   versions of asymmetric `radical aldol` reactions promise stereocontrolled   access to 1,3-polyols.  In contrast to the often well-defined chemistry of compounds containing   even numbers of electrons, compounds containing an unpaired electron   (radicals) are often so reactive that their reaction chemistry is   difficult to harness.  Lack of reaction control is a particular problem   in the attempted synthesis via radicals of compounds displaying the   property of chirality, wherein a molecule differs from another in the   same way a right hand differs from a left.  With the support of the   Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Philip P. Garner, of the Department   of Chemistry of Case Western Reserve University, is developing chemical   approaches which allow the exploitation of the intrinsic reactivity of   radicals while maintaining a high level of control over the chirality of   the resulting products.  These approaches offer new routes for the   synthesis of biologically active compounds, which are often chiral.",
