 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702715  Bradley  The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award focuses on  research and enhanced educational opportunities in extreme  rainfall estimation for flood hazard assessment.  Estimation of  the upper limits of storm rainfall for design of high hazard  structures is based on the probable maximum precipitation (PMP).   Many of the concepts in PMP estimation were developed in the  1930's and 40's.  In recent years there have been substantive  advances in the observation, understanding, and modeling of  convective weather systems.  Research will be carried out to  improve PMP estimation using modern meteorological methods.  The  principal objectives of the research plan are to: (1) develop  unique climatological information on extreme rainstorms in the  central United States, to improve our understanding of the  hydrometeorological controls on extreme rainfall, (2) examine  fundamental concepts of the PMP approach, including moisture  maximization, using mesoscale numerical modeling, (3) develop and  evaluate a probable maximum precipitation procedure for major  river drainages in the central United States based on  descriptions of the large-scale circulation anomalies associated  with extended periods of excessive rainfall.  The objectives of  the educational plan are to: (1) integrate the use of remote  sensing information from modern weather observing equipment into  graduate and undergraduate courses, (2) develop Internet-based  instructional material to support education in remote sensing  technologies and hydrometeorological data analysis.  ***",
