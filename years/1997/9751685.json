 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past 5 years, a tremendous growth of the wireless communications technology has been fueled by a widespread use of cellular phone and GPS (global positioning system).  Wireless communications is a highly interdisciplinary area that requires a coverage of subjects from communications, electromagnetics, and digital and analog electronics.  It has become apparent that the traditional electromagnetics and communication courses are not adequate to teach the wireless technology within one-quarter period, and a new course has been developed.    The purpose of the proposed Wireless Lab is to introduce measurement techniques, simulations, and hardware design in the new wireless communications course.  This is implemented by creating new laboratory projects and improving those offered in the experimental course EE400.  In the new wireless communications course, a teaching method is employed that emphasizes the combination of theory, simulations, and hands-on experiments.  *",
