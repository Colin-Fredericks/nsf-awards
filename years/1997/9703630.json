 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hastings  9703630    Semi-discrete models of excitable media consist of coupled systems of  ordinary differential equations, with each unit describing the electrical  kinetics in a single \"cell\".  They are intermediate between continuous  (pde) models and purely discrete models, or cellular automata.  The investigator  studies whether principles developed for cellular automata models apply to  the more realistic semi-discrete case.  He considers specific models  developed from experimental data to give quantitative descriptions of  neural behavior.  A model of special interest is that of Morris and Lecar,  describing voltage oscillations in barnacle muscle fiber.  This model has  different features from the well-known FitzHugh-Nagumo system, features  that are found in a number of experimental settings and that, moreover,  appear amenable to mathematical analysis.  The investigator  explores the role of  various parameters in the system in the propagation of spatial patterns.  Among the factors to be considered are excitation threshold, coupling  strength, relative rates of fast and slow processes, spatial geometry of  the medium, and the relative time spent in the excited and refractory  states.    The goal of this project is to develop an understanding of pattern  formation in semi-discrete excitable media.  The main intended application  is to neurobiology, though excitable media are found in many biological  and chemical systems.  Isolated cells are called ``excitable'' if they  exhibit a threshold phenomenon in response to a brief external stimulus,  but cannot support continued oscillations on their own.  A semi-discrete  model describes collections of excitable neurons coupled by a linear or  nonlinear diffusion mechanism.  Examples include nerve, cardiac, and  muscle tissue, supporting phenomena such as wave propagation down a  myelinated axon, waves of electrical stimulation that sweep through heart  muscles, and spreading cortical depression, a brain wave phenomenon.",
