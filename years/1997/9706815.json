 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706815  Wuttig    This is a renewal grant for quantitative studies of the  evolution of the martensitic phase in constrained thin films  with an emphasis on the martensitic transformation at  constant strain.  Much is known already about this  transformation as it occurs at constant stress and, of  course, normally the differences in mechanical behavior of  materials under conditions of constant stress and strain are  not very large.  This is not the case for the martensitic  transformation, where a special kind of pseudo-elasticity  can occur.  The studies build on results and experiences  gained during the previous three-year NSF grant.  Specifically, the evolution of the two phase state, alpha  prime and gamma, is investigated by examining the  simultaneous evolution of the microstructure, stress and  modulus of single crystalline shape memory alloy (SMA) films  on a substrate which serves to constrain this state.  Microstructural evolution is modeled and the results are  compared to the experimentally observed mesoscopic two-phase  structure and related macroscopic stresses and pseudo-  elastic moduli.  It is expected that complete closure will  be achieved leading to an understanding of the evolution of  the martensitic phase transformation in constrained films on  the mesoscale.  The studies focus initially on NiTi films.  In later stages of the research other systems, such as  ternary FeNi-based alloys, Ni-free SMAs, FePt, FePd and Cu-  based SMA alloys will be investigated.  %%%  This phenomenon is of scientific interest and important in  composite thin film actuators based on shape memory  concepts.  ***",
