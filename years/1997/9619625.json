 "awd_abstract_narration": "In  many  environments  the problem arises of  generating  motion  strategies  for real and virtual robotic systems with visibility-  based  sensing capabilities. This last term refers to the ability  of  a  sensor (e.g., a video camera or a range sensor) to  detect  objects  along  one  or several line-of-sight rays  through  free  space.  Both  a  new  conceptual framework and  a  collection  of  specific  new  algorithms are needed to perform  motion  planning  under  visibility  constraints,  in  addition  to  the  classical  collision  avoidance constraints dealt with by previous planners.  The  output  of  these algorithms will be motion strategies  that  integrate   motion   commands   with   visibility-based   sensing  operations.  While  robotics has extensively studied  the  motion  planling problem for robots operating in fully known environments  with  little or no sensing ability, and active vision has studied  the  problem of local camera motion/control in order  to  acquire  needed  data, the integration of visibility sensing  with  motion  planning  has  remained relatively unexplored. Yet a  variety  of  important  tasks for a robot can be expressed in the language  of  visibility.  `Plan  a  tour so as to see all  of  the  region  of  interest,' `move to the desired location while keeping sight of a  target,'   `keep  a  moving  target  into  sight  despite   view-  obstructing mobile objects' are just some examples of such tasks.  As visibility-based sensing allows robots to operate in partially  unknown  environments,  these techniques allow  on-line  planning  applicable  to  dynamic  environments.  Both  manufacturing   and  medicine can benefit from application of such methods, especially  in  those  operations (e.g., part delivery, assembly, monitoring)  that occur in heavily occluded and dynamic work environments.",
