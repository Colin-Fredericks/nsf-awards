 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603002  Komanduri    This award supports a two year collaborative research  project between Professor Ranga Komanduri of the Oklahoma  State University and Professor Takahiro Shirakashi of the  Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan.  The focus of this  research is to delineate the micromechanisms of finishing  advanced materials such as ceramics and glasses.  The use of  ceramics for many advanced applications is hindered by the  high cost of finishing them. Both analytical and  experimental studies will be carried out.  On the analytical  side, molecular dynamics simulation and analysis of the  ultraprecision machining will be carried out.  On the  experimental side a variety of finishing operations will be  investigated including magnetic field assisted finishing  processes for internal and external finishing.    The proposal brings together the effort of two laboratories  that have complimentary expertise, research capabilities and  equipment.  The research should provide new knowledge of  magnetic field assisted polishing, ultra precision machining  of metals, `gentle' grinding of advance ceramics and  glasses, and in situ micromaching inside a scanning electron  microscope.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology,  this project will broaden our base of knowledge and promote  international understanding and cooperation.  ***",
