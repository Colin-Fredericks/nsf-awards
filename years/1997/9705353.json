 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705353  Zieve    This  experimental  planning grant involves research  related  to  the  motion  of  vortices in Type II superconductors. The PI  will  exploit  recent  advances in nanofabrication technology to study the motion  of  vortices  in  periodic  pinning potentials  (arrays  of  holes)  whose  characteristic dimensions (hole spacing and hole diameters) can extend  to  ranges previously inaccessible. One of the objectives is to  reach  conditions  where quantum tunneling of vortices is appreciable.  Thus,  the  plan  is  to  perform  quantitative study  of  both  quantum  and  classical tunneling rates of vortices, and their dependence on details  of the vortex pinning potential.  %%%  This  grant  supports planning for a study of  the motion of  magnetic  flux  (vortex lines) in a thin film of superconductor. This  topic  is  important  in  connection  with  the  current  carrying  capacity   of  superconductors  of  Type II, which allow a zero resistance  state  to  persist (allowing loss free transmission of electrical energy) even in  the   presence   of   a  magnetic  field.  High  temperature   cuprate  superconductors  are  of  this class, and the research  being  planned  under  this  grant may contribute to the development  of  an  improved  technology  for  the  electrical  power  transmission,  and  also  for  improved electrical motors and generators.  ***",
