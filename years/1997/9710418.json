 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710418  Adesida  Over the last decade, significant advances have been made in the epitaxial growth of SiGe/ Si heterostructure material system using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and ultra-high vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHV-CVD). The significant improvements in SiGe/Si material properties have brought to fore a silicon-compatible technology that has the potential to compete favorably with III-V compound semiconductor devices in application-specific designs which require low power consumption and high speed which are needed for cellular telephones and other portable and wireless electronics.  The bandgap engineering made possible on silicon by this material system has provided the impetus to study devices such as heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) and modulation-doped field effect transistors (MODFETs) that have heretofore been in the domain of InP and GaAs.  Indeed SiGe/Si HBTs have demonstrated excellent high frequency performance with unity current gain cut-off frequencies exceeding 100 GHz.  Although, theoretical predictions have shown that SiGe/Si MODFETs and related devices (e.g. MOSFETs) should have comparable or better performance than those obtained for HBTs, experimental work in this area is essentially inchoate.  SiGe-based FETs need intensive development in order to evaluate their practical usefulness for advanced microwave and digital circuits.    The PI's proposed research is therefore motivated by the continued improvement in the growth of SiGe/Si materials and the need to develop manufacturable processes to turn these materials into high performance conventional p-type and n-type MODFETs.  These devices will also make possible the realization of complementary MODFETs.  In the proposed research, The University of Illinois (UIUC) and IBM will collaborate to significantly advance the growth and fabrication technologies for SiGe/Si MODFETs needed for low power, high speed microwave and digital circuit applications.  The goals of the proposed research are 1) to provide n ew insights into the growth of SiGe/Si with very low density of dislocations; 2) to develop new methodologies for the formation of Schottky and ohmic contacts on SiGe/Si heterostructures; 3) to develop low damage dry etching methodologies for the selective etching of SiGe on Si and vice versa; 4) to study the physics and performance of short gate-length ( < 100 nm) p-type, n-type, and complementary MODFETs; and 5) to demonstrate simple microwave and digital circuits using SiGe/Si MODFETs.  ***",
