 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rhee  9605163    This award supports a three-year collaborative research  project between Dr. G-Yull Rhee of the New York State  Department of Health and Dr. Jin-Hwan Lee of Sangmyung  University in Seoul, Korea on \"Production of Dissolved  Organic Carbon and Taste-and-Odor Compounds Through  Extracellular Excretion and Cell Death in Cyanobacteria.\"  The goals of the project are: 1) to determine the effect of  light intensity on the production of dissolved organic  carbon and major odor producing compounds, and the relative  importance of excretion and cell death in their production,  2) to elucidate the seasonal dynamics of the compounds in a  reservoir, and 3) to identify problem species which produce  off-flavor compounds.    The production and consumption of dissolved organic carbon  in the aquatic ecosystem has important implications for  primary productivity, heterotrophic microbial production and  nutrient cycling.  From a public health standpoint, high  concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and taste and  odor producing compounds can impair potability and  recreational use of water.  This study will help elucidate  the release of these compounds from cyanobacteria, a  prevalent group of phytoplankton often associated with  eutrophication.   The expertise and facilities of the U.S.  and Korean research groups will be combined in an effort to  significantly advance the work.  ***",
