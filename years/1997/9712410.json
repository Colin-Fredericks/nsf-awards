 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many non-linear problems in dynamics fall under the general  theory of perturbations. Important examples include the attitude  and orbital stability of satellites, the identification of  molecules by spectroscopy, and the stability of beams in  accelerators. These multidimensional systems are not integrable,  but perturbation methods can be applied to transform them to  approximations with fewer degrees of freedom.  Most of the time,  such approximations are performed by elementary procedures with  no mathematical sophistication, with the result that the  calculations become enormous. The goal of this project is to  build a toolbox for solving dynamical systems, specifically  targeted to perturbation methods for Hamiltonian systems.  The  toolbox will be flexible enough to treat efficiently different  classes of systems will allow researchers to explore new  problems, experiment with new transformations, and verify  published results.    As a demonstration of usefulness, flexibility and efficiency,  an analytical theory  will be developed for lunar satellites at  low altitude. Planners for lunar survey missions, such as the  Clementine mission in 1994, seek orbits appropriate for  reconnaissance.  They need to predict the long-term behavior of a  satellite in order to select an orbit with low eccentricity (for  constant sensor altitude) and fixed pericenter (to economize fuel  in maneuvers). At present, orbit selection is largely a matter of  guesswork. Using crude approximations, planners choose possible  orbits which are then checked by numerical integration. Without a  global view of the long-term dynamics, mission planners can only  hope they sampled wisely. Generating ``maps'' of long-term phase  space from an analytical model will remove the guesswork. Such  maps have already proved useful in mission planning for earth  satellites.",
