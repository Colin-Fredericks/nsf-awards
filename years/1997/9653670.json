 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sinclair Community College (Dayton, Ohio) is creating a Parallel College to pilot test institution-wide reform efforts in science, mathematics, and engineering  technology education.  This effort builds upon eight existing institutional change drivers at Sinclair: Distance Learning, Sinclair Assessment Initiative, Corporate and Community Services Division, Sinclair Quality Initiative, Miami Valley Tech Prep Consortium, Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Center, National Center of Excellence for Advanced Manufacturing Education, and Center for Interactive Learning.  This effort also tests methods of correcting common problems at community colleges across the country: (1) misalignment of curriculum format with modern delivery systems; (2) misalignment of curriculum outcomes with modem workplace requirements; and (3) misalignment of college operating systems with modern operating systems.  Using curriculum modules created by the National Center of Excellence for Advanced  Manufacturing Education (an NSF ATE national center at Sinclair), the project is creating a Parallel College to pilot test key changes in the day-to-day operating systems (faculty workload and rewards, resource allocation, etc.).  The pilot provides a true indication of changes required in the day-to-day operating systems to achieve goals of higher quality and greater responsiveness.  It also leads the institution to a stronger position for meeting customer (students and employers) needs.",
