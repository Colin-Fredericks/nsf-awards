 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Proposal: CMS 97-02561  PI:  Linda K. Nozick, Cornell University    \"Career:  Integration of Education and Research in  Transportation Engineering\"      This research focuses on the development of more robust  methods to optimize the routing and scheduling of hazardous  materials shipments.  Analyses with which these decisions  are currently made fail to fully consider the multi-  objective nature, the stochastic elements, and the inherent  time dependency aspects of this problem.  The research will  develop advancements in multi-objective network analysis and  methods to identify the appropriate scope of analysis given  the decision situation.    Careers in transportation are increasingly systems-oriented,  extend beyond the bounds of traditional civil engineering,  focus on opportunities for the inclusion of non-traditional  resources to cope with increasing financial and  environmental pressures, and involve multiple stakeholders  often with conflicting objectives.  Therefore,  transportation professionals are increasingly being asked to  conduct analyses which are multi-objective, involve the  evaluation of the inclusion of \"non-traditional;\" resources  and high levels of uncertainly.    For these reasons, the teaching activities to be  accomplished here involve the redesign of three courses at  the undergraduate level.  At the M.S. level, the activities  focus on the creation of two semester, real-world team  design projects which incorporate many of these same  elements and ask the students to propose creative solutions  which can be realistically implemented based on  sophisticated analyses.  The characteristics of hazardous  materials transportation decision situations include all the  elements necessary to provide an excellent set of homeworks  and projects for both the undergraduate level courses and  the master's level projects.      ***",
