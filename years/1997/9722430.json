 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abrell  9722430    This award supports a 24 month Japan Society for the  Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr.  Leif Abrell at the Department of Marine Sciences, University  of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.  Dr. Abrell will work with  Dr. Tatsuo Higa, Professor of Marine Chemistry, on a  research project entitled, \"An Investigation of Interesting  Minor Bioactive Constituents from Nonconspicuous Okinawan  Marine Organisms.\"    Biomedicine has recently been the major driving force for  the chemical inveqtigation of marine sponges and  invertebrates.  Pharmacologists, physiologists, and  biochemists have shown that many of these natural products  posses properties that modify fundamental life processes in  ways that have important biomedical applications.  These  molecules are the leads that the pharmaceutical and chemical  industries have begun to focus on as templates for  development of the drugs for the future.  The first  compounds reported from these organisms were usually the  major constituents and were isolated in yields large enough  to provide sufficient sample size for nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR).  The evolution of tools available to  natural products chemists including molecule separation  technologies and high field NMR instruments for solving the  structures of miniature samples now warrants a deeper and  more meticulous look at sample extracts for bioactive  constituents.  The proposed research will: 1) collect bioactive extracts  from various marine invertebrate species (sponges,  tunicates, and coelenterates); 2) subject the extracts to  bioassay guided solvent partitioning and chromatographic  fractionation to purify active components, and; 3)  characterize the structures and stereochemistry of bioactive  compounds.  Emphasis in the proposed research will be placed  on compounds which posses potency in bioactivity screens  such as cancer cell lines, viruses including HIV-1, and  cancer cell enzymes such as topoisomerase I and II and DNA  polymerase.  * **",
