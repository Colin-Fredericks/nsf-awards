 "awd_abstract_narration": "A variety of problems in both medical diagnostics and nondestructive testing of  materials requires the reconstruction of a portion or cross section of an object  without directly viewing its interior.  Tomographic imaging techniques allow  noninvasive/nondestructive studies which minimize patient trauma and cost in the  medical domain, and reduce manufacturing and maintenance expenses for many  industries by transforming external measurements into images of the interior of  the patient or object.  The established methods for computing tomographic images  in common examples such as x-ray CT scanning are inadequate for difficult cases  involving a shortage of data or great uncertainty in their precise values due to  inherent error in measurements.  For these problems, algorithms are needed which  explicitly take into account the characteristics of the measurement errors as  well as common behavior of the tissue or materials under study.    Much improvement has resulted from statistical methods such as Bayesian  tomographic estimation, but conventional estimation techniques, based on  homogeneous random field models and fixed optimization strategies, seem to be  approaching their limits of improvement.  This project is developing three  principal innovations to improve the capabilities of tomographic systems, with  particular focus on three-dimensional applications: (1) nonhomogeneous image  cross section models which allow spatially varying image characteristics to be  accurately estimated using a simple multiscale estimation procedure; (2) fast  nonlinear optimization algorithms for minimizing the nonquadratic functions that  result from MAP estimation with nonGaussian prior models; (3) a novel approach  to tomographic reconstruction based on nonlinear, non-iterative estimation from  back projection data.  This research is applicable to the full range of emission  and transmission tomographic problems, with particular experimental focus on 3D  medical emission tomography.",
