The US organizer is Dr. Sedat  Biringen, Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences at  the University of Colorado at Boulder.  The Turkish co-  organizer is Dr. Haluk Ors, Department of Mechanical  Engineering at Bogazici University, in Istanbul.  The  workshop is to consist of invited and contributed papers  covering: mathematical modeling of turbulent flows;  turbulent closures and modeling; solution algorithms; error  analysis; high performance computing and parallel processing  relevant to turbulence simulation; industrial applications;  and environmental and geophysical applications.  The  workshop will also include discussions of areas where joint  research projects can be initiated between US and Turkish  scientists.    Scope: This award allows six American scientists from highly  regarded academic institutions (one is from the National  Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder) to travel to  Istanbul, Turkey to meet with  Turkish scientists, to  discuss scientific and technical developments in this area  of fundamental research which has many wide applications in  industry and in the environment.  They plan to focus  attention on the scientific questions that can be dealt with  through US-Turkish scientific cooperation.  There is  potential for considerable benefits from collaboration  between the US and Turkey with its strong base of  researchers and graduate students in the areas of applied  mathematics and engineering.  Areas of applications in the  US are many.  In Turkey there are several questions related  to the environmental impact of the South Anatolia Irrigation  Project (GAP) which includes building very large dams on two  major rivers, with resulting changes in water flows.  This  is an area of  importance to the Turks but also of scientific  benefit to the US scientific community.  The proposal meets  INT criteria for supporting activities intended to enhance  scientific collaboration between US and foreign scientists  in areas of mutual interest, and by supporting two junior US  scientist (including one woman) to gain international  experience that could be helpful to their career.  ***",
