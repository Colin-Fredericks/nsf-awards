 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This award is to support participation by six scientists from the United States in a workshop with scientists from Myanmar, to be held in Yangon in August 1997.  The US team leader is Dr. Arnold Gordon from the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, and the Leader of the Myanmar team is Dr. Swe Thwin, Department of Marine Science, University of Mawlamyine in Yangon.  The purpose of the workshop is to formulate a research program whose goal is to develop a regional circulation model for the Andaman Sea, forced by wind, river plume, tidal mixing, sea-air heat and fresh water fluxes.  The model of choice is the Princeton Ocean Model.  The model will have application to studies of spreading of pollutants, primary productivity research and meteorological phenomena in the Myanmar region.  A broader application is to better assess the role of the Andaman Sea in the larger scale climate system, primarily the Asian Monsoon.  The specific interest in the Andaman Sea stems from the effects of suspected internal wave and tidal derived elevated vertical mixing processes, which may alter the regional vertical stratification and circulation pattern.   It is anticipated that the result of the workshop will be a plan for a joint research project.   Scope: This award is to fund travel of five of six U.S. scientists who will meet with approximately fifteen scientists from Myanmar in a workshop where discussions will deal with a topic of great importance to oceanographers and atmospheric scientists in the US, and in Asia.  The meeting is expected to result in a proposal to be submitted to the Foundation, to support joint research that will include American scientists and scientists from Myanmar.  This activity is particularly worthwhile because it opens avenues for American scientists to work in Myanmar and with scientists from that country.  The project meets the objectives of the Division of International Programs in promoting collaboration with foreign scientists in areas of mutual interest.",
