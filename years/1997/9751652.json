 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, a gas chromatograph interfaced to a mass spectrometer (GC/MS) is included in all 4 years of the chemistry curriculum.  The instrument is used in upper-level classes, making full use of the power of the GC/MS combination.  In addition, the GC/MS is used in middle- and lower-level classes.  For example, analysis of the mass spectrum of chloroform in introductory chemistry illustrates the various isotopes of chloroform and allows calculation of their relative intensities.  The instrument can be incorporated even into the largest laboratory sections by connecting the GC/MS to a network (which already includes a Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance instrument).  The computer laboratory contains six terminals (allowing three students maximum per station) and is adjacent to the instrument room; licenses for six additional versions of instrument software are included in this project.  With advanced instrumentation provided early in the curriculum, chemistry majors have their experiences reinforced.  Additionally, geoscience and biology students who take lower-level chemistry are exposed to advanced instrumentation.  *",
