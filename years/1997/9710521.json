 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the 27th annual Frontiers in Education Conference to be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in November 1997.  The FIE Conference is co-sponsored by the IEEE Education Society, and the Education and Research Methods Division of the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE).      A primary goal of the FIE conference is to promote the widespread dissemination of innovation in teaching and learning in undergraduate engineering education.  Presentations in technical sessions represent work at the \"frontier\" of education, and the format of the conference is designed to promote dialog between presenters and attendees.    Funding from NSF has played a major role in increasing the quality of the conference in the last several years.  Continued funding will support the \"NSF Project Showcase\" to feature successful NSF sponsored projects, including the successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program.     *",
