From the perspective of human   physiology it is critical to understand transport phenomena in complex   biological systems. This project addresses areas where improved knowledge   of transport properties for  multi-phase systems will have a large impact on   technology. A significant part of this project focuses on the behavior of   composites with imperfectly bonded components. Imperfect bonding   between constituents is often the rule. Imperfect bonds are frequently the   result of damage to the structure incurred during use. The first project treats   the design of fiber reinforced materials in the presence of imperfect bonding   between the fiber and the matrix material. The goal is to provide rigorous   design rules for the optimal performance of imperfectly bonded fiber   reinforced structures. We consider next the transmission of oscillating   electric signals through structural materials possessing imperfectly bonded   constituents. We look for new mathematical methods that will deliver   structural information from the transmitted signal. These methods will rely   on the physics of the imperfect bond  separating the constituents. The third   project treats  the transport of ions in a biological system. The goal is to   understand the effect of cell geometry on the ionic transport within living   tissue. Last, the small geometries necessary for the layout of very large   scale integrated circuits incur high concentrations of the electric field along   conducting paths. These concentrations often result in the failure of an   electronic devise such as a microprocessor. The conducting paths are often   made from aluminum alloys of three or more materials. We seek the best   geometries among multi- phase conductors so as to minimize electric field   concentrations.    The analysis and o ptimal design of multi-phase materials is central to the   development of advanced materials for use in electronics, transportation   systems, and aerospace structures. From the perspective of human   physiology it is critical to understand transport phenomena in complex   biological structures. This project addresses areas where improved   knowledge of transport properties for multi-phase structures will have   impact on technology and medicine. Fiber reinforced structures appear in   many applications ranging from golf clubs to the rotors on windmills. Over   time the adhesion between the fibers and the surrounding material is   compromised by use. We investigate the optimal design of such structures   taking into account the imperfect adhesion between fiber and surrounding   material. Our goal is to design more durable products that last longer than   conventional fiber reinforced products. Next, we investigate how to reduce   the failure of microelectronic devices due to high concentrations of electric   current. The small geometries used in the layout of integrated circuits   require very narrow strips of metal to conduct electric currents. These strips   often fail because of the  high volume of current that they carry. The   conducting strips are often made from a mixture of Aluminum, Copper , and   Silicon. We seek the best deployment of the  Copper and Silicon in the   metal strip to prevent failure. Last, we attempt an improved characterization    of inter cellular ionic transport. From the stand point of human physiology,   an  understanding of such transport for human brain cells may offer early   detection of the extent of damage caused by stroke.",
