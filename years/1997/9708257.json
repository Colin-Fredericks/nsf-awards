LeHigh University    ATM-9708258  Seltzer, Geoffrey  Syracuse University    Title: Quaternary Paleoclimate Record from SOuth America: Lake  Titicaca    A long and continuous paleoclimate record from tropical South  America is needed to answer several persistent and important  questions.  This award supports the recovery of such a record by  coring the deep basin of Lake Titicaca on the northern Altiplano of  Peru and Bolivia.  Through the preliminary analysis of a series of  short, mini-piston cores, it is demonstrated that the sediments of  the lake are suitable for climatic reconstruction.  Also, high-  solution seismic reflection profiling has shown that there are many  excellent localities for siting much longer piston cores and for  obtaining even older sediments via offset coring.  Previous studies  revealed large-amplitude fluctuations of lake level in the Holocene  and Pleistocene, implying that effective moisture (and probably  temperature) has likewise varied drastically.  Siting of a series  of long cores will be aided by medium-resolution, deeper  penetration seismic reflection profiling with uniboom and water gun  sound sources.  The cores will be subsequently analyzed for  chronology (AMS radiocarbon), sedimentology (X-ray diffraction and  optical petrography), physical properties (porosity, density,  magnetic susceptibiity), geochemistry (stable isotopic analysis and  minor-element chemistry of ostracodes; stable isotopic analysis of  organic carbon and cellulose; determination of organic and  inorganic phosphorous, and biogenic silica; strontium isotopic  analysis of ostracodes) and paleobiota (ostracode and diatom  species compositions),  This record will allow us to examine in  detail the timing and mechanisms of tropical forcing of high-  latitude climate (and vice versa), as well as the linkage between  the climate of the  Altiplano and the Amazon basin",
