 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724501  Parise    This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation  (MRI) Program, provides $295,518 as one-half support of the  costs of acquiring equipment for development of a modular,  CCD detector-based x-ray diffraction facility that will be  used in conjunction with both synchrotron x-ray sources at  the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven  National Lab (BNL), the Advanced Photon Source (APS),  Argonne National Lab (ANL) and laboratory x-ray sources.  Specifically, the equipment will include two CCD detector  systems allowing real time x-ray diffraction studies of very  small single crystals and powdered samples, a significant  advantage over more conventional image plate-based XRD  systems. One of the CCD detector systems will be used in  conjunction with a refurbished Rigaku 18 kW rotating anode  that will incorporate focusing mirrors to provide an extra  beam and a high brightness focused beam for further in-house  development of the T-cup high pressure device originally  designed by researchers at the Mineral Physics Institute at  SUNY-SB (a node of the CHiPR STC). This modular system will  also be transferable to brighter x-ray sources at NSLS and  APS for studies of the smallest crystals (0.5 - 20 microns).  A second system will alleviate demand for beam time at NSLS  by the many postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate  students affiliated with the CHiPR STC who require XRD  analyses on crystals ranging in sizes from 20-100 microns  for which current laboratory x-ray sources and XRD detector  systems are not adequate.  Additional funds will be used to  purchase a workstation and mass storage for analysis of the  high resolution diffraction data and ancillary equipment  needed to manufacture this integrated modular system.  Specific examples of the cutting edge and funded research  that will be enhanced or enabled by this equipment include,  development of the next-generation, portable, large volume  high pressure cell, determination of the strength and   rheological properties of ceramics, textural analysis during  ultrasonic experiments for determination of seismic  velocities through high pressure phases, structural analyses  of organic-inorganic open framework compounds, powder  diffraction studies of doped-fullerenes, solid-state organic  geochemistry, characterization of low temperature compounds  formed during early diagenesis in marine sediments and bio-  medical studies of photochemically formed natural compounds.  ***",
