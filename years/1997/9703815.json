 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703815  Mountford   The subject of interacting particle systems is of particular interest when a given   process has multiple stationary distributions.  In this case it is of interest to know which   initial configurations converge to which stationary distributions.  For the contact process   the complete convergence theorem provides the perfect answer to the above question.   This solution may be carried over to a large class of supercritical, attractive, reversible   nearest particle systems.  Such a complete convergence theorem cannot hold for the   critical reversible nearest particle systems as finite systems die out almost surely.    Mountford is interested in examining the above question in this case. The convergence   question for the voter model is well understood and a good description of the stationary   distributions is given, but it remains difficult to address large deviation and percolation   issues. Mountford wishes to investigate these and similar questions. Mountford will also   continue his work on the structure of level sets for the Brownian sheet, in collaboration   with Professor Robert Dalang.   Professor Mountford is continuing his work on interacting particle systems.    Interacting particle systems are processes where a large (often infinite) population have   associated variables that evolve in random fashion; a particular individual's variable will   typically evolve according to its value and those of its close neighbors.  For instance the   population may be trees in an orchard, the variable values may be sick or healthy and an   individuals value may change from sick to healthy or vice-versa depending on the health   and sickness values of the immediately surrounding trees.  These processes provide a rich   family of models for the spread of disease, the propagation of knowledge, the   establishment of consensus. The subject of interacting particle systems for infinite   populations becomes particularly interesting when the system admits distinct equilibria.   The n one important issue is to say which (if any) equilibrium a system will converge to,   when starting from a given initial configuration. Another important area of research is to   describe the distinct equilibria.  If the population is large but finite, then although usually   there is only one equilibrium, multiple equilibria in the corresponding infinite population   translate into the existence of initial configurations for the finite system that take a very   long time to reach equilibrium.",
