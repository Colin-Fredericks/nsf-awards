 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723466  Lisman    The long-term goal of this project is to understand the  network and cellular basis of short-term memory, the type of  memory used in remembering brief lists of items such as a  phone number. Psychophysical tests on humans have shown that  there is a limit of about 7 items that can be stored in  short-term memory. The proposed research will extend  previous theoretical work showing how a single brain network  can keep 7 memories active at the same time using a  multiplexing scheme. This scheme is closely tied to  physiological observations on brain oscillations;  multiplexing is achieved by a clocking mechanism, which is  apparent in brain recordings as nested oscillations in which  about 7 gamma (20-80Hz) oscillations occur within a single  theta (4-10Hz) cycle. Memories become serially active in  sequential gamma cycles. The psychophysical analysis of  human memory provides a rich quantitative data set.  The  goal of the proposed work is to a develop a more detailed  physiological model that correctly predicts this data. The  first specific aim is to provide a specific model of how  memories are scanned during a recognition memory test.  Computer simulation methods will be used to model brain  networks in a physiologically plausible way. The second aim  is to understand a surprising constancy observed by  Cavanagh: the time required to scan a memory and the number  of memories that can be held both vary with the complexity  of the memory; however the product of the two appears to be  a universal constant. The third aim is to understand whether  there are fundamental network constraints that limit how  fast gamma oscillations can be; if they were faster, more  memories could be held, but there may be reasons why gamma  cannot be faster. Preliminary  results related to the first  two aims indicate that theta oscillation frequency may  decrease as  the number of stored  memories increases. Furthermore, gamma frequency may  decrease as the complexity  of stored items increases.  These  are important findings because they provide a way of  relating easily manipulatable aspects of short term memory  to brain signals and because they are very testable. As the  fourth goal of this proposal, collaborative efforts will be  initiated to test these predictions.",
