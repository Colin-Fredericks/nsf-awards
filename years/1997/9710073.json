Gender differences, in particular, will be assessed.  Gender differences in types of small businesses and in enterprise survival rates will also be examined as will the impact of entrepreneurial activity on gender roles and relations.  A range of field methods will be used.  Questionnaire surveys of individual male and female entrepreneurs in 19 western Hungarian border villages and 11 border villages in southeast Hungary will be undertaken.  This information will be supplemented by life histories of women entrepreneurs in each study area, focus groups with sections of the rural population, and workshops in the villages for feedback of results and discussion.  The research addresses the important issue of mechanisms for development in transitional economies as well as the role of women in development.",
