 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is improving the education of computer science and engineering students in the field of data communications by providing a model for a hands-on computer network laboratory.  The rapid rate of growth in the area of digital communications and networks will cause a shortage of knowledgeable personnel who are capable of administering computer networks and services.  This demand will be felt first in technical industry, and then in the general corporate world.  It will be the responsibility of colleges and universities to prepare their computer science graduates for the coming advances in networking technology and the practical issues surrounding the current communication technologies.    To solidify the theory traditionally taught in data communications courses, the project is developing a laboratory to put theory into practice.  In the same way that a chemistry student will better understand their discipline from practice in the laboratory, a hands-on laboratory is essential for a computer science student's understanding of network topics, including remote procedure calls, spanning tree adaptive routing, dynamic versus static routing, routing information protocol, hardware interface configuration, cabling issues, bandwidth and timing limitations, network file systems, protocol analysis, port-based network services, and peripheral configuration (such as networked printers and routers).  The hands-on laboratory is directed at upper-division computer science and engineering students.",
