 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Northwest Indian College, in collaboration with three other post secondary institutes within the Pacific Northwest region, is carrying out the development, testing, and transfer of an advanced technical education program in Native American Environmental Technology.  This two year AAS degree program meets a critical need among area Tribes to increase the number of Native Americans working within tribal natural resource and environmental management programs.  Northwest Indian College has brought together for this project those post secondary institutes within the region that have a track record and commitment of working effectively to meet the postsecondary education needs of Native American students and tribal communities.  These institutions include the Evergreen State College, and Huxley College and Fairhaven College, both at Western Washington University.  In addition, Mesa State College and Navajo Community College are providing assistance through their ATE grant which also prevents duplication.  The project model consists of curricula development, pilot testing student internships, and articulation agreements with four year institutes.  Program methods have been developed specifically to support Native American learning styles, and the need for development of transferable technical skills that can lead to meaningful career employment, in the area of environmental science and management.  These methods include: hands-on learning; emphasis on speaking and writing skills; group projects; multi-disciplinary courses; and an internship program.  The College is hosting a symposium in year three to formally present the project findings and work products.  This symposium is open to tribal colleges and other post secondary institutes and tribal organizations.",
