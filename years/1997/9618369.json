 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Nancy Benco will conduct archaeological excavation at the Moroccan site of al-Basra and also undertake a survey of the surrounding regions. Historical records indicate that al-Basra was established around 800 AD, possibly on the site of a Late Roman-Berber settlement. Built as part of the Islamic empire established by the Idrisid dynasty, it reached city size,  was destroyed ca 979 AD, was rebuilt in the late tenth century to serve as a commercial center and it maintained that role until about the twelfth century. Brief descriptions by Arab geographers indicate that the city produced large quantities of flax (and possibly linen cloth) which was transported across the Mediterranean.  Based on many seasons of fieldwork by Benco and others, extensive information on the spatial organization of al-Basra is available. In this current two-year research project Dr. Benco will focus on the production, distribution and consumption of crafted goods. Abundant historical and ethnographic information will be integrated with archaeological data. She will focus on open-area horizontal excavations in three functionally distinct parts of the city: an artisans' zone with known ceramic and metallurgical production facilities; a residential zone with early Islamic houses and interior courtyards; and an administrative area with elite residential structures and a possible mine. Topographic mapping and magnetometer survey work will be completed in the first season. A regional survey, which builds on a preliminary reconnaissance conducted in 1994 will entail a systematic investigation for sites. Test excavations will be conducted in a small number of these.  Archaeologists realize that control of craft production in early states served political as well as economic functions and worked to enhance elite power. However such great emphasis has been placed on this, it is often forgotten that much manufacturing took place in domestic contexts and cannot be understood from such a limited perspective. Dr. Benco will examine production and distribution to determine its broadest societal role. The site of al-Basra and its hinterland is well suited to this goal. The city served as an important administrative-commercial-manufacturing center where ceramic goods, metal objects and flax were produced. The archaeologically accessible 30 hectare site contains well-preserved architecture and abundant artifacts in two to three meters of well stratified deposits. This research is also important because North African Islamic sites are rarely examined from an anthropological perspective. Through her extensive interaction with Moroccan students and archaeologists Dr. Benco will help to introduce a powerful set of techniques and approaches.",
