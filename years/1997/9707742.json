 "awd_abstract_narration": "The demand for real-time image and video communications places unprecedented  demands on power and data-rate-limited communication links.  Present day  communication systems are primarily designed for data communications at a fixed  rate and are poorly matched to video data, which is more tolerant of errors and  is characterized by fluctuating rates.  The quality of wireless channels can also  vary greatly, and the video coding and transmission should be adapted to these  changing conditions.  Existing hardware implementations are equally inflexible,  being designed independently for pre-specified conditions and a fixed power  consumption.  The match between current video compressors, wireless modems, and  their hardware is thus often very poor.  This research addresses the joint design  of video communication components to maximize the overall system design of video  communication components to maximize the overall system performance.  While  achieving unprecedented performance in low-power image and video transmission  over wireless channels, this research also develops a powerful and general new  methodology for directly coupling chip design with signal processing algorithms  and overall system optimization.    The research obtains dramatic improvements in end-to-end video transport over  wireless communication links through adaptive, joint optimization of source  coding, channel coding, and VLSI computation.  Instead of selecting fixed  operating points for the source coder, channel coder, and the VLSI hardware,  dynamically adjustable coders and hardware supporting a variety of operating  points is being developed.  Specific research tasks to achieve this overall  system goal include: (1) the development of rate-distortion-optimized coders  based on multi-resolution data structures and tolerance to bit errors; (2) multi-  resolution channel coding methods supporting variable rate-vs.-quality data  transmission for multiple channels; (3) real-time reconfigurable hardware via  Dynamic Algorit hm Transformations (DAT) to achieve low-power operation at various  operating points, and, (4) joint optimization of the above three components  subject to overall system power constraints.",
