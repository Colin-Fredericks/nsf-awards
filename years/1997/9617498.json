 "awd_abstract_narration": "The measurement of G, the Newtonian constant of Gravitation,  is a long standing problem which continues to provide a  challenge to our scientific creativity.  Today's nearly 1%  discrepancy between the recent PTB (Physikalisch-Technische  Bundesanstalt) measurement and the `accepted` value of G is  of considerable interest to experimental physics and the  world of standards.  The fact that the PTB measurement  appears to be competently and thoughtfully done makes the  discrepancy even more intriguing.  A new free-fall approach (using g to measure G) will be  used.  In this experiment, an FG5 absolute gravimeter is to  be employed in connection with a movable 1200 lb. Tungsten  mass that surrounds the dropping chamber.  Little g is  measured when the surrounding mass is located above the  FG5's dropping region and then when it is located below the  dropping region.  The 80 micro-gal difference in these two  measurements together with the geometry of the surrounding  mass can be used to determine G.  A preliminary (proof-of-  concept) experiment using a 200 lb. Mass has already been  carried out.  This follow-on experiment is expected to  result in an accuracy for G of better than 5 parts in  10,000.",
