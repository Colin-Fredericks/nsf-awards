 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704535  McConnell       The project has three parts.  First, let G = SL(n,R), let Gamma  be an arithmetic subgroup of G, and let X be the symmetric space for G.  The spaces X/Gamma are one setting where automorphic forms can be  defined; they provide a topological approach to parts of the Langlands  conjectures.  For each Hecke operator T on the cohomology of X/Gamma,  MacPherson and McConnell have defined a cell complex W(T) which allows  one to find the operator by cellular techniques, i.e., using only a  finite amount of combinatorial data.  They will investigate W(T) and  extend the definition to more G.  In the second part, Ash and  McConnell are computing the cohomology of X/Gamma in degree five for  certain Gamma for SL(4).  The goal is to determine the cuspidal  classes and the Hecke action on them.  The third part concerns  Sheafhom, a suite of computer programs McConnell has developed.  Sheafhom provides models of chain complexes, spectral sequences,  sheaves, and other objects.  The largest application to date is its  algorithm for finding the intersection homology (IH) of toric  varieties in any perversity.  One goal is to compute the intersection  product on IH of toric varieties, with applications to convex  polytopes.  Sheafhom has also been used in the Ash-McConnell work.       A computer algebra system is a program for calculation with  algebra, as opposed to numbers.  Any program can find 2 + 2, but a  computer algebra system combines whole formulas: the input  (2x + 7) + (4x - 3) becomes 6x + 4 automatically.  This capacity is  more abstract, hence more flexible.  Excellent general-purpose systems,  like Maple or Mathematica, are available, but of course they don't have  everything that every mathematician needs.  In recent years, several  disciplines have been given their own special-purpose systems--  Cayley/Magma for algebraists, Pari for number theorists, and a dozen  others.  McConnell has written Sheafhom, a computer algebra system for  algebraic topology.  The program,  some 10,000 lines long, is written  in Lisp, one of the liveliest (and most efficient) programming  languages.  The goal is to apply Sheafhom to study convex polytopes.  Convex polyhedra are solid bodies with flat faces, like cubes, pyramids,  or hundred-faced diamonds.  A convex polytope is the same kind of body  in the fourth or higher dimension.  Since 1980, algebraic geometry has  become a major tool for studying polytopes.  This is surprising,  because algebraic geometry includes some of the most abstract  mathematics known, while polytopes, like crystals, are very concrete  objects.  Sheafhom will make possible some difficult computations in  algebraic topology and geometry; these will advance our understanding  of convex polytopes.  McConnell's project actually has two other  parts that are more loosely related to Sheafhom.  These are connected  with the Langlands conjectures, a very deep set of ideas that relates  number theory to other, more geometric parts of mathematics.  ***",
