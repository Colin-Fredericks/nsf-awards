University of California - Berkeley    CISE Postdoctoral Research Associates in Experimental CS: Design and Simulation of Algorithms and Mechanisms for Precision Assembly    (This award supports CES associate Karl Bohringer.)  Progress in miniaturization of mass-produced commercial products requires improvements and innovation in precision assembly.  Products such as magnetic storage systems, palmtop and wearable computers, or telecommunications devices often require submicron-level assembly operations.  Increasingly, the components for such assemblies are batch-fabricated in MEMS (micro electro mechanical system) technology, often yielding thousands of components in one parallel fabrication run.    In contrast to the highly automated fabrication of MEMS components, current assembly techniques are rather limited.  Conventional, sequential pick-and-place assembly is extremely inefficient or impractical for such applications, because of the small size of the components and the high accuracy required.  Instead, novel techniques are proposed for parallel self-assembly.    Active surfaces (i.e., surfaces that can generate two-dimensional force vector fields) permit the precise positioning, orienting, and sorting of small parts with little or no sensor feedback.  Vibration and fluidic   agitation can generate a motive force for parallel assembly.  Mechanical compliance, using micro-chamfers and latches, can be exploited to reduce the degrees of freedom of the components.    Detailed models are developed to describe precision parallel assembly using three techniques: mechanical vibration, fluidic agitation, and active surfaces.  The motive force response for each of these techniques is analyzed, and simulations with a modeling system are performed.  Physical experiments are performed   to confirm that our models accurately reflect measured behavior.",
