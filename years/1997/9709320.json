 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of Papanicolaou and an interdisciplinary group of scientists is  to establish a  Summer School on Mathematical Problems in Geophysics and Seismology at Stanford, and to support a year-round research program on various mathematical problems from geophysics.  Specific areas of interest are the following:  waves in random media, radiative transport theory and its applications in seismology, seismic and other methods for imaging, high contrast tomography, transport properties of disordered media, fluid-solid interaction, convection-diffusion, etc. The Group Infrastructure Grant will provide support for the Summer School and for the year-round research of graduate students and postdoctoral visitors who will work on projects that emerge from it.      Mathematical geophysics is very rich in basic mathematical problems  that are challenging but not well-known to mathematicians.  Most these are of great interest in geophysics research, which  will certainly benefit from the infusion of new mathematical ideas and techniques.  A one-month Summer School will be established that will help promote high level mathematics research, attract promising young scientists and mathematicians into the area by providing training at an introductory level, and produce results that are interesting and important in geophysics and seismology. Stanford and the San Francisco Bay area provide an excellent environment for this project because of the unusual concentration of senior researchers that will be actively involved with it.    Funding for this activity will be provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the NSF Geosciences  Directorate, Hydrological Sciences and Geophysics Programs.",
