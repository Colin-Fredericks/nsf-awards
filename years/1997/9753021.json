 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Swann will carry out experiments desdesigned to determine how sex steroids influence the activity of neural cells that regulate behavior.  Gonadal steroids have profound effects on the organization and expression of almost all forms of behavior.  Although it is clear from several different approaches that steroids affect behavior through actions on specific neuronal cell groups, the exact way in which steroids change neuronal function is not known.  The results from several experiments in Dr. Swann's lab indicate that gonadal steroids may regulate behavior by regulating neuronal activity and communication among three central areas in the hypothalamus (a brain structure).  These results were discovered by indirectly monitoring neuronal activity using a novel technique.  Dr. Swann plans to confirm and expand these findings by directly monitoring neuronal activity in the same experimental design.  Direct recording of neuronal activity is a laborious technique that requires substantial technical skill and equipment.  Therefore, Dr. Swann had planned to visit laboratories with special expertise in this technique.  These plans were delayed by the birth of her daughter.  The POWRE award will provide the funds necessary to complete these experiments, allow Dr. Swann to catch up on time lost to maternity, and prepare her for a new phase of research using cutting-edge neuronal monitoring techniques.",
