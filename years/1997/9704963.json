It has recently been demonstrated that many of the classical  obstacles for the development of industrially viable controllable  devices based on fluids can be overcome with the use of  appropriate magnetorheological (MR) suspensions. Indeed, the  successful synthesis of MR fluids with low power demand, high  achievable yield stresses, short response times and low  sensitivity to impurities has allowed the Lord Corporation, Cary,  North Carolina, to become the first ---and, so far, the only---  company to develop a variety of commercial dampers and brakes  that operate on MR materials (see, for instance,  http://www.mrfluid.com).    Attempts at optimizing the macroscopic characteristics of such  products are still out of reach, however, due to the expense  involved in a thorough experimental investigation of their  properties and the lack of accurate and efficient predictive  mathematical models and computational tools.  It is the goal of this project to advance the present  capabilities in these latter areas. For this, the PI's will  appeal to newly developed techniques in the mathematical theory  of  nonlinear homogenization to investigate the overall  (nonlinear) magnetic and (small deformation) rheological response  of MR fluids. The investigation will include numerical and  analytical calculations of effective permeabilities and storage  modul i for realistic microgeometries, as well as a study of their  dependence on important design variables such as particle size  (volume fraction and size distribution) and shape. The proposed  analysis will also involve the derivation of tight bounds on the  effective properties, applicable to rather general  microstructures,by means of a method recently introduced by the  PI in the context of shape--memory polycrystalline alloys. In  every case, the research group intends to take advantage of  Lord's local facilities to periodically validate the models  through appropriate physical experimentation.    This project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
