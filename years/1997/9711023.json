 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project FOCAL Point is a multi-strand project encompassing  models that have been shown to be effective in encouraging  girls and young women in non-traditional fields.  Twenty  high school computing teachers from Wisconsin and  surrounding areas will gather at the University of Wisconsin  - Stevens Point for a two-week summer workshop in which they  will receive training in gender issues, electronic  communication, and information systems concepts.  They will  develop female-friendly lessons to  be piloted with high  schools students in a following two-week summer computer  camp targeted for young women.  University women serve as  mentors to the high school students during the summer  session, as well as teaching assistants.  Gender related  technology projects, funded through sub-contracts to teacher  participants, extend the impact of the project beyond the  immediate participants.  All project participants are  electronically connected to a \"virtual community of  learners.\"",
