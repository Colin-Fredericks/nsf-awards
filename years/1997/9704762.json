 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704762  TARTAR  As part of a much larger project, the Principal Investigator plans to  develop variants of the tool of H-measures that he has introduced a few  years ago under NSF grants. One question concerns variants able to  observe large domains of frequency, as is supposed to occur in  turbulence. Another question concerns parabolic effects, which require a  variant using different scalings in different directions. Another  question concerns the taking into account of oscillating initial data in  studying the propagation of oscillations and concentration effects for  general hyperbolic systems with variable coefficients, a particular  emphasis being put on questions of Elasticity in connection with seismic  problems. Another question concerns the effects of limited regularity of  coefficients or interaction with the boundaries, reflection, refraction,  grazing rays. The Principal Investigator also plans to study which  constitutive relations in Elasticity are admissible under the necessity  of having the finite propagation speed property for mixtures.       The Principal Investigator has developed under NSF grants a new approach  to general questions of Continuum Mechanics and Physics, which  corresponds to explaining how waves can appear to behave like particles.  The repercussions of having now such a new rigourous mathematical  framework will be enormous in many different areas, but at the moment  the developments are still of a very technical nature, and apart from  problems related to Elasticity which are connected to seismic problems,  the work of the Principal Investigator during the coming year will be  mostly theoretical, opening new directions for future research and  applications.",
