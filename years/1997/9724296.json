 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF) Program and the Major  Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the Department of Chemistry at Hope College to acquire a 300 MHz   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment will   enhance research in a number of areas that include the preparation and   characterization of reduced mono-Cp zirconium compounds for use in C-C   bond forming reactions, the use of chiral tin(II) complexes for   asymmetric syntheses, the synthesis of derivatives of poly(m-xylylene) to   investigate the thermal processing of coal, the preparation of novel   polymeric material, and the use of enzymes for the synthesis of   asymmetric lactones.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.",
