 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support for a three year project to measure the  vertical strain rate as a function of depth at two sites on Siple  Dome Antarctica.  Ice flow near a divide such as Siple Dome is  unique in that it is predominantly vertical.  As a consequence,  the component of ice deformation in the vertical direction, the  \"vertical strain rate\"  is dominant.  Its measurement is  therefore important for the calibration of dynamic models of ice  flow.  Two different, relatively new, high resolution systems for  its measurement in hot water drilled holes will be employed.  The  ice flow model resulting from the measurements and flow law  determination will be used to interpret the shapes of radar  internal layering in terms of the dynamic history and  accumulation patterns of Siple Dome over the past 10,000 years.  The resulting improved model will also be applied to the  interpretation of annual layers thicknesses (to produce annual  accumulation rates) and borehole temperatures from the ice core  to be drilled at Siple Dome during the 1997/98 field season.  The  results should permit an improved analysis of the ice core,  relative to what was possible at recent coring sites in central  Greenland.  This is a collaborative project between the  University of Alaska, the University of California, San Diego and  the University of Washington.",
