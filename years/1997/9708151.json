 "awd_abstract_narration": "Davis  9614857  Fuiman  9708151  Williams  9618384  To forage efficiently beneath the extensive, unbroken fast  ice along the Antarctic coast, Weddell seals (Leptonychotes  weddellii)have adapted to an environment that is very  challenging for an air-breathing predator.  These  adaptations enable Weddell seals to hunt for prey at depth  while holding their breath for 20 minutes or longer.  This  is analogous to a lion or other large terrestrial predator  holding its breath while it locates, pursues and captures  prey.  In addition, Weddell seals must return to the same  hole at the end of a dive or know the location of other  breathing holes.  Failure to locate a breathing hole will  result in a seal's death by drowning.    This study will investigate the behavioral and energetic  adaptations that enable Weddell seals to forage in the  Antarctic fast-ice environment.  To achieve this goal,the  underwater behavior, locomotor performance (swimming  velocity, stroke frequency and amplitude, and three  dimensional movements)and energy metabolism of Weddell seals  will be measured during foraging dives. Hypotheses on  general foraging strategies, searching behavior, searching  mechanics, modes of swimming, metabolic costs of foraging  and foraging efficiency for different environmental  conditions and prey type will be tested. Until now, it has  not been possible to investigate the foraging behavior of  marine mammals in detail.    To accomplish this study, a small video system and data  logger will be attached to the seals' backs and oxygen  consumption will be measured during voluntary dives from an  isolated ice hole in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica.  Placing an  instrumented seal in an isolated ice hole is a standard  protocol for studying the diving behavior of Weddell seals.  The video system and data logger will record video images of  the seal's head and the immediate environment in front of  the animal.  In addition, the instrument will record time,  depth, swim speed, compass bearing, water tem perature,  stomach temperature and ambient sound.  Computer analysis of  data on depth, swim speed and bearing will enable  investigators to reconstruct the three-dimensional,  underwater path of seals'dives.  This new technology is  fully operational and has been used on other marine mammals.    Observing the foraging behavior and prey of marine mammals  has been and continues to be a major obstacle to the  advancement of studies on their foraging ecology.  The  Weddell seal may be the single best species in which to  study the foraging behavior and energetics of deep diving  pinnipeds because:  1) data is available on their diving  ability, 2) the isolated-ice-hole protocol in McMurdo Sound  enables recorders to be attached and recovered reliably, and  3) they make daily foraging dives when placed in the  isolated ice hole.  The proposed study will investigate both  behavioral and energetic aspects of foraging to obtain a  better understanding of the special challenges of obtaining  food resources at depth while being constrained by limited  access to atmospheric oxygen.  In addition, this study will  greatly advance our understanding of the foraging ecology of  Weddell seals as large predators in the Antarctic fast-ice  environment.",
