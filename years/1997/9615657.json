 "awd_abstract_narration": "Libavius was one of the most prolific writers of the early modern era yet only scant attention  has been given to his writings by historians of science.  In over twenty large volumes he  defended his own understanding of the dignity and disciplinary nature of chemistry and  contended with the philosophical claims, laboratory procedures, and interpretations of nature  proffered by Paracelsian empirics, court physicians, literate artisans, and members of academic  faculties.  The study will follow the course of Libavius's polemics and will investigate the  wide range of social, political, moral and religious issues that were often included in debates  about chemical-medical reform, the proper use of chemical language, and the preparation of  chemical medicines.  By analyzing the broader social and intellectual content of the chemical-medical debates  surrounding Libavius and by exploring the dynamics of cultural exchange within and between  local chemical communities, the project will suggest new ways of understanding the history of  chemistry.  On a broader level, the discussion of chemists and cultures will propose new  techniques for assessing the influence of chemistry itself among the many currents intersecting  within the Scientific Revolution.                                                      \u00a2 \u00a5\u00a9/\u00a5  \u2563>\u2502%\u2510\u2524\u00c1 \u00a2\u2502\u2563\u00c1>\u00a5\u2563\u00a2\u00a5\u00a2 />\u2524 \u2551\u00a9\u2563%?\u00a2?\u2551\u00a9\u00c1\u255d\u00a2  \u2551?%\u2563\u2502` _/,\u00c1\u255d\u00a2  />\u2524 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u00c0\u00c1>\u00c1\u255d/% \u2551\u2510\u2593%\u2563\u2502",
