 "awd_abstract_narration": "Herman  9612077       The investigator studies how to determine functions defined  over three-dimensional space from physically measured (and hence  only approximate) values of their line integrals, using ideas  from discrete tomography.  In discrete tomography there is a  domain --- which may itself be discrete (such as a set of ordered  pairs of integers) or continuous (such as Euclidean space) ---  and an unknown function whose range is known to be a given  discrete set (usually of real numbers).  The problems of discrete  tomography have to do with determining the function (perhaps only  partially or approximately) from weighted sums over subsets of  its domain in the discrete case and from weighted integrals over  subspaces of its domain in the continuous case.  The essential  aspect of discrete tomography is that knowing the discrete range  of the function may allow determining its value at points where  without this knowledge it could not be determined.  Discrete  tomography is full of mathematically fascinating questions (e.g.,  what shapes are uniquely determined by their x-rays?) and it has  many interesting applications (e.g., electron microscopy and  nondestructive testing).       The investigator studies how to determine three-dimensional  objects from physically measured (and hence only approximate)  values of what are essentially averages along one-dimensional  slices of the objects.  Mathematically, this is the problem of  determining functions defined over ordinary three-dimensional  space from approximate values of their line integrals.  Such  physical measurements may be taken of biological macromolecules  using an electron microscope or of industrial objects using high  energy x-rays.  What is shared by these two (and many other)  applications is that the object to be determined may be known to  have only finitely many possible values.  The distinguishing  feature of discrete tomography is that by making use of such  knowledge we may succeed in determining the structure of th e  object from data that is not in itself sufficient for determining  the structure without the prior information.  While the emphasis  of the project is on the development of an appropriate  mathematical theory (including computational procedures for the  solution of specific instances of the general problems under  investigation), these will be developed so that they can be  applied in the field of recovering the structure of biological  macromolecules from sets of electron microscopic images by making  use of the truly discrete nature of the objects to be  reconstructed.  What this boils done to is the following: certain  methods of data collection do not allow us to determine the  structure of a totally unknown object (e.g., the electron  microscopes destroys a macromolecule before sufficient data can  be collected).  Discrete tomography allows us to overcome such a  technical difficulty in those cases when the object is known to  have only finitely many values.  The project has applications to  imaging problems in medicine, biology, and chemistry.",
