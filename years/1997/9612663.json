 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612663  Rosen  This proposal is for the further investigation of a  relationship between the toxicity of various anionic  surfactants and certain of their physicochemical interfacial  properties discovered by the principal investigator and his  co-workers in a cooperative research project with the  Environmental Science Department of the Procter and Gamble  Company.  The proposed project is for an extension of that  investigation to other types of surfactants (cationic,  nonionic, and zwitterionic) and to mixture of surfactants,  with the aim of determining whether that relationship holds  also for these systems.  The physicochemical properties will  be calculated from surface tension measurements conducted in  the principal investigator's laboratory; the toxicity  measurements will be conducted by the Procter and Gamble  Company.  The surface tension measurements will be made on  solutions of the surfactants in water of the same pH and  electrolyte composition as that used for the toxicity  measurements.  In addition, other physicochemical  interfacial properties will be investigated for possible  correction with toxicity.  Since all of these  physicochemical properties have known relationships to the  chemical structure of the surfactant, the results of this  project should provide guidelines for the selection or  design of surfactants with minimum environmental impact for  commercial use.  ***",
