 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Le Boeuf  9603633    The aim of this project is to elucidate the  foraging strategy of white sharks (Carcharodon  carcharias) on their preferred prey, northern  elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris), and  reciprocally, to determine the evasive tactics  of elephant seals in the high risk zone of shark  attack.  White sharks will be tagged with  acoustic beacons when they surface to feed on  tethered decoys or seal carcasses in the waters  around Ano Nuevo Island in central California.  Ultrasonic tags and diving instruments will be  attached to elephant seals on the rookery before  they depart on biannual migrations and recovered  on their return.  We will tag sharks externally  with location transmitters and internally with  depth and temperature sensing transmitters,  placed in bait, to obtain records of three  dimensional movements, diving pattern, and  feeding behavior (inferred from a rise in  stomach temperature).  Movements of predators  and prey, as well as fluctuations in the diving  depth and stomach temperature of the sharks,  will be determined for up to 10 tagged animals  (sharks or seals) simultaneously to distances of  1.2 to 3.2 km drom the rookery by an array of  three radio-acoustic positioning buoys that  receive and relay the data to a land base  station on the mainland 250 m away.  We will  determine the presence or absence of tagged  sharks near the rookery, the length of time  individuals remain in the vicinity, evidence for  territorial defense, fluctuations in abundance  with time of the year, movements within area,  preferred stations where sharks concentrate to  capture seals, and the temporal pattern feeding  and behavior between kills.  Concomitantly, we  will determine the corridors of egress and  ingress near the rookery taken by migrating and  translocated seals and their diving behavior in  the high risk zone of shark attack.  This study  will provide fundamental information on white  shark life history and foraging tactics and will  elucidate the evasive s trategies of northern  elephant seals to its principal predator.  This  information is vital for understanding this apex  predator and its relationship to prey and humans  in nearshore waters in this area.  A better  understanding of the hunting strategy of white  sharks will elucidate the importance of predator  pressure on elephant seal life history, juvenile  survivorship and colony growth, and diving  behavior and pattern of rookery us.  This will  provide a deeper understanding of the predator-  prey relationship between white sharks and  elephants seals than exists for any other large  vertebrate in marine environment.",
