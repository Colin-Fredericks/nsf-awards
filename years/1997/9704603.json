 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dudley  9704603    For differentiating functionals or operators on empirical distribution functions, most statisticians had  adopted compact or Hadamard differentiability. R. Dudley and co-workers are showing that Frechet   differentiability, well known to be superior when it holds, can be obtained by use of p-variation norms  for one-dimensional sample spaces, with optimal bounds on remainders. The program is next being  pursued in multidimensional spaces. Also,  R. Dudley and a co-worker are showing that a posteriori probabilities can be well approximated by normal (Gaussian) probabilities even with respect to relative error when the probabilities are very small.      In the study of differentiable statistical functionals, one is looking at how estimators or other statistics  depend on the observed data distribution: is the dependence smooth, approximately linear, or not, and  how can smoothness or lack thereof be quantified. In Bayes asymptotics, one begins with an assumed prior  probability distribution over an assumed surface of possible parameter values, and from enough  observations, finds an a posteriori distribution which has approximately a Gaussian form. The project is  showing that a simple method works very well, giving very accurate Gaussian approximations to the a posteriori probabilities.  By way of these approximations, the project includes studies of methods for choosing between competing statistical models, or theories, based on multiple data sets, as in multiple  experimental studies on the same or closely related questions.",
