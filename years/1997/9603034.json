The co-organizers are Professor Robert  Blankenship of Arizona State University and Dr. Mamoru  Mimuro of the National Institute for Basic Biology in Japan.  The seminar will address most of the known types of  photosynthetic antennas, including integral membrane  antennas from bacterial plant and algal systems as well as  peripheral antennas such as chlorosomes and phycobilisomes.  Approaches will include spectroscopy, structure  determination, molecular biology, protein chemistry, model  systems and theory.  Particular attention will be paid to  new concepts on the regulation and protection of antenna  systems as well as to evolutionary aspects.    This area of research has seen exceptionally rapid progress  in recent years, with the determination of several  structures of antenna complexes and the maturing of  ultrafast spectroscopic and molecular biological techniques  for investigation and manipulation of photosynthetic  systems.  All the areas and approaches are well represented  among the participants from both countries.  The exchange of  ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will  enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will  set the stage for future collaborative projects.  The  seminar will involve active participation by junior  investigators and postdoctoral researchers, and the results  of the meeting will be widely disseminated via a World Wide  Web homepage.  ***",
