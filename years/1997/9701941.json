 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop balanced and integrated research and education goals related to the development of Abrasive Flow Machining (AFM).  The research studies are to: (1) develop a process model for AFM utilizing wear mechanisms and characteristics about the viscoelastic carrier, (2) expand the acoustic emission monitoring to multiple passages and new materials, and (3) investigate the potential application of AFM for post-process finishing of stereolithography prototypes.  On the education side, cooperative learning methodologies will be integrated into the curriculum for select manufacturing courses, and two new courses, Advanced Computer-Aided Process Planning and Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing, will be developed.  Research and education program results will be formulated into Internet-based software testbeds and primers accessible to faculty, students and industry engineers.  There exists a vital need for flexible finishing processes that are capable of handling intricate, precise geometries with a wide range of materials and in a variety of machining conditions.  AFM has proven effective in fulfilling this need in a limited range of applications.  A comprehensive research and education effort is essential to develop the necessary scientific knowledge and technology base of AFM to realize its full application potential.",
