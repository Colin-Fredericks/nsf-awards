 "awd_abstract_narration": "9629886  Chen        The interactions of atmospheric flows with mountains is  an important issue in atmospheric sciences.  Orography plays   a role in both local weather as well as influencing the larger  scale flow.  The isolation of the mountainous Island of Hawaii  provides a natural laboratory for studies of the impacts of  orography.  In 1990 a cooperative project among several  researchers, the Hawaiian Rainband Project (HaRP), was executed  to study the influence of the island on local weather and  fundamental mountain/atmospheric flow interactions.        The Principal Investigator will continue his analysis  of data from the HaRP with a focus on furthering  understanding of the impact of local environmental conditions  on the formation of rainbands.  A specific emphasis will be  the evolution of downslope flow on the windward side of the  island of Hawaii throughout the night for relatively dry and  relatively rainy cases.  In addition to downslope flow  evolution over land, the deepening of the downslope flow in  the Hilo Bay area, the extension of offshore flow over the  ocean before sunrise, and the effects of clouds and rains on  the downslope flow evolution will be studied.         Furthermore, the Principal Investigator will examine  the meteorological conditions that affect the daily amounts  of nocturnal rainfall west of Hilo and the early morning  rainfall along the coast.  ***",
