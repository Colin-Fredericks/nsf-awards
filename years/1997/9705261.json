A major objective is to develop a framework for a science resource kit for home use by parents and children in grades K-3, and related parent training.  The target audience is low income, minority, recently immigrated parents, with little to no involvement in their children's education.  Parents from the target audience will serve on the Planning Team.  The function of the kits is to provide exciting, intergenerational, exploratory experiences in math and science that are related to the school curriculum.  Each kit will be designed to be completely portable and will appear to be a large trunk with wheels.  Contents may include: a laptop-size computer; hand lenses and two small microscopes; diffraction gratings and flourescent sources; ramps and balls; mirrors, lenses and other optics.",
