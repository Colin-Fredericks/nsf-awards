 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project traces development of engineering education for women from the 19th century to the present, concentrating on how institutions and individuals related to the complex and changing relationship between gender and technical expertise.  The project takes a multidisciplinary approach to science, technology and society, combining history of engineering and professionalization with related issues in social history, history of education, women's studies, and current policy.  The first objective is to explore historical patterns in the relationship between women and the professionalization of engineering, looking at how different decades brought new questions about the role and importance of technical professionals in American life.  The second issue is to look at how the engineering profession itself addressed the issue of technical education for women.  The third question asks how different universities addressed the question of opening the engineering curriculum to women.  The final question takes the students' perspective, asking how women viewed the profession and the changing opportunities and obstacles it presented.  The project will blend oral history interviews with extensive work in engineering and university archives.",
