 "awd_abstract_narration": "9709029  Mills    The primary creep response of polycrystalline TiAl is  examined as a function of the lamellar spacing and grain  size under a GOALI grant at Ohio State with interaction of  Universal Energy Systems and Wright Laboratories.  Single  lamellar colony crystals are prepared and creep tested in  several orientations to determine the effects of lamellar  orientation on the primary creep behavior.  The effect of  carbon additions on the creep response of both  polycrystalline samples and single crystal lamellar colony  crystals is determined.  The form of primary creep transient  is modeled quantitatively and compared to the hardening  behavior under constant strain rate conditions.  Stress  change, strain transient experiments are conducted to  provide new insight into the mechanisms controlling  deformation during creep.  Activation energies for transient  flow are determined by employing rapid temperature change  experiments.  Transmission electron microscopy is used to  study the deformation microstructures in both the major  gamma phase and the alpha 2 phase, slip transmission across  lamellar interfaces, and deformation mechanisms within the  interfaces themselves.  Observations are conducted as a  function of creep strain in order to develop an  understanding of the hardening and recovery processes during  creep. The graduate student will have the opportunity to  interact extensively with the technical staff at both  Universal Energy Systems and Wright Laboratories.  This  project is jointly funded by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Materials  Research.  %%%  Titanium aluminide alloys of the gamma and alpha 2 phase  structure are considered for a variety of high temperature  applications where primary creep could be a critical factor  in their use.  This program is aimed at understanding the  effect of microstructural scale, lamellar orientation, and  composition on the primary creep transients in fully  lamellar TiAl.  ***",
