 "awd_abstract_narration": "Matrix Inequalities in Engineering and Sciences (DMS 9704534)    Chi-Kwong Li and Roy Mathias    The theory of matrix inequalities has applications in many fields including   electrical engineering, statistics, economics, psychology, graph theory,   differential equations, operations research and optimization, operator theory,   quantum physics, numerical analysis and control theory. However, many   researchers in these areas are not able to use the existing results and proof   techniques in matrix theory to develop their theory effectively because their   expertise is not in matrix theory and there is a lack of communication between   them and researchers on matrix theory. The principal investigators have   considerable experience in matrix inequalities and have developed from   scratch, adapted, or borrowed many techniques to study the subject. In this   project, they plan to develop and apply the theory of matrix inequalities to   different problems that arise from applications.  In particular, the emphasis   will be on proving matrix inequalities by conceptual rather than computational   techniques, and putting them in more general and accessible settings, so that   the results can be readily used by non-specialists.     It is worth mentioning that this project has strong connections with a number   of areas of Federal strategic interest.  For example, in high-performance   computing, one needs to be able to do computation efficiently and accurately.    In many situations, computations are very sensitive to round-off error   introduced by the machine itself. The design of fast convergent methods in   these cases is greatly facilitated by the theory of matrix inequalities.  As   mentioned in the first paragraph, matrix inequalities are important tools in   control theory, a regime that is crucial to the design of manufacturing   plants, aircraft, automobiles, etc.  Applications of matrix inequalities in   other subjects, including quantum physics and semi-definite programming are   proposed , and problems arising in economics, statistics and psychology will   also be considered.",
