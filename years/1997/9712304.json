Measured  parameters from prototype wire-grid polarizers will be used in the models to see if codes predict the benefits expected. Wire grid polarizers (WGP) offer performance and materials improvements for liquid crystal displays which can change the industry.  They are a reflective, inorganic, polarizer which will lead to brighter, lower-power liquid crystal displays.  The proposer has pioneered the technology to produce these polarizers and will produce them within the next 2 years.  The university partner had computer models of LC displays which can quantify the performance of displays incorporating WGP. The new WGP data for the model will come from 0.2 um and 0.16 um pitch polarizers prepared and measured by the proposer.  This data will be used, along with theory, to protect to the 0.1 um pitch (and smaller) WGP used in future LC displays.  These projections will then be folded in to existing computer models at the university  to quantify the performance improvements. The data generated in Phase I will be used to approach display manufacturing for development funding and to justify a Phase II program.           The large ($15 billion) market ensures that this LC display technology will be developed soon.  The proposer has an opportunity to develop a key technology for LC displays for the benefit of the United States.  ***",
