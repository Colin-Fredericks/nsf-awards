 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704490  Luo       Luo studies topology and geometry of surfaces and Heegaard  splittings of 3-manifolds.  One of the fundamental tools in surface  theory is the space of isotopy classes of essential simple loops on  surfaces introduced by Dehn and Thurston.  Dehn called the space the  arithmetic field of the surface.  The space was used by Thurston in  his work on the compactification of the Teichmueller space.  It has  been known by many mathematicians that the space of isotopy classes  has an intrinsic modular structure.  Luo has used the modular  structure to reconstruct the Teichmueller space and the space of  measured laminations.  This has enabled him to derive that the space  of measured laminations is semi-real algebraic. He is currently  working on the reconstruction of the mapping class group of the  surface.  He is also trying to apply the result on the space of  measured laminations to study the Heegaard diagrams of irreducible  non-Haken 3-manifolds.       Many problems in topology, geometry and mathematical physics  involve the consideration of all simple loops on a surface.  An  essential simple loop is a curve without self-crossing that cannot be  shrunk to a point on the surface.  The problem is to understand all  such loops put together.  The basic relation between loops is their  intersection number.  Luo is developing an algebraic calculation to  understand the intersection numbers on a space.  This may eventually  lead to a better understanding of 3-dimensional spaces through the use  of Heegaard surface theory.  ***",
