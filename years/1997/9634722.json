 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT     The NSF-CBMS regional conference on \"Dynamical Systems in Structured  Population Dynamics\" will be held at the Department of Mathematics,  North Carolina State University, June 3-8, 1997. Professor J. M. Cushing from  the University of Arizona will serve as the principal lecturer of the conference.              The conference will focus on a new and exciting area of research: structured  population models, their relationship to experimental data and their  implications for dynamical systems.  Structured models span the gap between  the level of the individual organism and the level of the total population.  This direction of research is still in its formative stage and is currently under  intense investigation by many mathematicians and mathematical biologists.     A major breakthrough occurred last year when Prof. Cushing and his  collaborators established nonintuitive complex dynamics in real population data.  By controlling laboratory parameters of the flour beetle, they demonstrated  complex dynamics including period doubling. Since then, these results and their  mathematical implications  have attracted the attention of many internationally  renowned researchers.     Prof. Cushing is an excellent lecturer and a major contributor to the  area.  With his presentation skills and broad view of the subject matter, he  is most appropriate person to give a well organized presentation of the major  ideas and recent results, and also set the future direction of research in this  field during the course of his lectures.",
