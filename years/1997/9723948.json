 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grossniklaus  9723948  The mechanisms controlling the development of the female gametophyte in plants are largely unknown. Approximately 60 mutants in which the gametophytic phase of the life cycle has been affected as judged by reduced fertility and non-mendelian segregation have been identified from over 5,000 lines of insertional mutants of the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Initial studies indicate that different stages of megagametogenesis are affected in these lines and it is proposed to dissect the genetic hierarchy controlling female gametogenesis by analyzing these mutants further at the genetic level including reversion and transmission analysis, the determination of map position and the characterization of regulatory interactions with other genes expressed in the female gametophyte. One mutant will be chosen for an in-depth molecular and genetic analysis. The structure and sequence of the gene will be determined as well as its expression at the RNA and protein level.    Plants have evolved a characteristic life strategy with alternating generations and the absence of a distinct germ line. The plant life cycle alternates between a diploid and a haploid generation, the sporophyte and the gametophyte. In the sexual organs of the flower, haploid products of meiosis are produced which mark the beginning of the gametophytic phase, which eventually results in the development of the gametophytes. The mechanisms controlling the development of the female gametophyte are largely unknown and this study will use a combination of genetic, molecular and cell biological techniques to dissect that pathway. A detailed knowledge of the genes and molecules controlling female gametogenesis will provide insights into fundamental morphogenetic mechanisms and cell differentiation pathways, and open up new possibilities for the manipulation of the reproductive system harboring great potential for plant breeding and crop improvement.",
