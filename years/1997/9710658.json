 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a postdoctoral fellowship that would allow a philosopher of science who is interested in visual representation to continue her education and conduct research at the University of California, San Diego, which is at the forefront of neuroimaging research and instrumentation.   Visual representation has, until recently, been relegated to the background of philosophical analysis of science.  While we know that scientists rely heavily on images provided them by sophisticated instruments, the exact nature of the knowledge provided by such techniques is not clear.  Of special importance for this project is the relationship between visual representation and propositional representation in the production and presentation of scientific knowledge.  The integration of visual and propositional representation in studies of the brain offers a new domain for examining the use of integrative strategies in science.",
