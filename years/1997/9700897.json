The scientific theme of the conference   is \"Statistics for Correlated Data\", which covers many of the currently  important theoretical and applied research topics, and which   corresponds to the areas of the department's strength and tradition.    The plan for the conference is to make it as accessible as possible to   the diverse statistics community, and to encourage and support   researchers in early stages of their career.    Correlated data arise in modeling temporal and spatial processes, in   analyzing repeated measures, in complex sampling and experimental   schemes, and in a wide range of applied problems.  In this broad   subject, researchers tend to form separate groups defined by sub-topics  or the areas of application.  This conference attempts to gather   statisticians with interest in any of the theoretical or applied   sub-areas of correlated data statistics, and to serve as a place for   communicating and exchanging knowledge.  Sub-areas covered by the main   theme include time series, spatial statistics, sampling, longitudinal   analysis, multivariate analysis, applications to engineering, life, and  agricultural sciences.  It is planned to have 10-15 invited speakers   from outside Iowa State.  The conference also plans to have a special   invited poster session for young researchers.  This program will be   announced and advertised widely to obtain a large pool of applicants.  At least ten young researchers will be selected as invited   participants, and will be feat ured in the poster session.  In addition,  the participation of graduate students and young faculty members will   be promoted through the network of the Midwest departments of   statistics.",
