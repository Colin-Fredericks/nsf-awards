 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this CAREER project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry   Program of the Chemistry Division, Arthur Utz of Tufts University will   use supersonic molecular-beam techniques, infrared laser excitation of   gas-phase reagents, and ultrahigh vacuum surface characterization to   elucidate the role of vibrational energy, both alone and in combination   with translational energy, in promoting the reactivity of gas-phase   molecules incident on a solid surface.  Experiments will probe the   dissociative chemisorption of methane on a Ni(111) surface.  The   educational goal of this project is to stress the importance of active   learning.  For chemistry majors this will be accomplished through student   participation in original research, providing a hands-on experience that   should lead to a deeper and more lasting understanding of important   concepts and skills.  Cooperative learning methods and open-ended   laboratories incorporated into the curriculum should produce a similar   result for all the students enrolled in chemistry courses.  Other   educational methods, such as public information forums targeted at the   non-scientist, will help convey the importance of chemistry outside of   the classroom.  Comparing the reactivity of methane excited with different amounts of   vibrational energy will identify the nuclear motions most effective at   promoting chemical reaction and will help explain the molecular basis for   the dissociation of methane following adsorption on an ordered metal   surface.  These results have practical importance in understanding   materials deposition, semiconductor device fabrication, and heterogeneous   catalysis processes used in the chemical industry, and will help   understand how to improve the yields of desired products and reduce the   levels of unwanted byproducts.  The educational component of this work   should increase the level of understanding of chemistry for both   specialists and the general public and demonstrate the effectiveness of   such approaches to scientists in other fields.",
