The method is to examine the energy transport  between  the  low lying equilibrium and non-equilibrium states and configurations of  solids with a variety of  linear  and  nonlinear  spectroscopic tools, including  persistent  IR  spectral  hole  burning, IR pump-probe transient hole  burning,  Raman  scattering and fourier transform IR spectroscopy.  Interest has  grown  in  the  possibility that intrinsic localized modes, made possible  by  the lattice anharmonicity,  may  exist in bulk crystals, at their surfaces or at their edges.  The  progress  in  localized vibrational mode studies  is  leading  to  the  exploration  of  intrinsic localized excitations  in  other  nonlinear  dynamical  systems.    Antiferromagnetic  crystals   provide   new   experimental  opportunities to search for intrinsic localized excitations.  %%%  Non-Technical Abstract  An  outstanding problem in condensed matter physics is identifying the  source   of  the  static  and  dynamic  behavior  of  near-equilibrium  vibrational states in crystals and glasses.  The proposed method is to  examine the energy transport between the low lying equilibrium and non-  equilibrium  configurations of solids with a variety of  spectroscopic  tools.   Recently, interest has grown in the likelihood of a new  type  of  localized  vibrational excitation made  possible  by  the  lattice  nonlinearity that may exist in bulk crystals, at their surfaces or  at  their edges.  Progress here is leading to the exploration of intrinsic  localized  excitations  in nonlinear magnetic systems.   The  proposed  measurements  should  impact on topics  as  diverse  as  the  role  of  structural defects in optical materials used for information  storage,  amplification  and  optical  transmission,  and  on  the  science  and  technology of fast-ion conductors  and that of magnetic structures.  ***",
