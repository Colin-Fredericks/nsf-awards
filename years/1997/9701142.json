 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701142       Weaver       A   project   is  to  be  undertaken  to  further   our    understanding  of  linear stochastic  wave  fields,  waves    which have suffered sufficient randomizing scatterings  or    reflections  as to lose most coherence.  Such  fields  are    present  in  applications of ultrasonics  in  many  modern    heterogeneous  materials.   The  proposed  work  primarily    concerns   the   diffuse  ultrasonics  of  polycrystalline    materials  with  a view towards ultimate  applications  in    robust ultrasonic characterization of microstructures  and    flaw  detection  in the midst of grain  noise.   The  main    focus   will  be  towards  the  validation  of  ultrasonic    radiative   transfer  formulations  of  multiple   diffuse    scattering in polycrystals.  Of particular interest is the    transition  from the simple single scattering limit  model    used  by  many,  through the complicated regime  in  which    typical rays have scattered a few times, to the once again    simple   diffusion  limit  in  which  typical  rays   have    scattered many times.       Broad industrial Interest in materials characterization    where  conventional attenuation and velocity  measurements    are  difficult or fail, and where therefore  the  proposed    project  will  have application, includes grain  size  and    texture  characterization  through  rough  surfaces  (with    associated inferences in regard to fracture toughness  and    formability),  detection  of low  levels  of  porosity  in    acoustically  (grain-)noisy materials with thick  sections    (i.e. porosity in powder metallurgical iron), detection of    microcracking   and  monitoring  of  microcracking   after    service,   detection   and   monitoring   of   embrittling    conditions,   detection   of   residual   stresses,    and    characterization of highly inhomogeneous materials such as    sintered materials or metallic foams.       While  the  primary  concern and  envisioned  Immediate    application i s in diffuse ultrasonics, fields of this kind    are  also  present  on sufficiently long  time  scales  In    seismology,  in reverberation rooms, In the vibrations  of    large  Irregular built structures, In the  electronics  of    mesoscale  devices  and for optics in turbid  media.   The    project  Is  also,  therefore, expected to  contribute  to    these other fields.       The  proposed project consists of theory, numerics, and    experiments.    The  equations  of  ultrasonic   radiative    transfer will be extended where necessary.  They  will  be    applied  to  the specific experimental configurations  and    samples   to  be  studied  in  the  lab.   The   resulting    numerically  generated predictions for diffuse  ultrasonic    intensity  will  be compared with laboratory  measurements    and  with  direct numerical simulations of two-dimensional    heterogeneous   elastic   media.    Extensive   ultrasonic    Immersion  testing of metal samples with  well  controlled    polycrystalline microstructures will be carried out  in  a    variety  of  configurations designed  to  be  optimal  for    illustrating and testing the main predictions of radiative    transfer.       Two  secondary but related thrusts will be carried  out    also.   One  on  ultrasound  in materials  with  extremely    strongly scattering microstructures will contribute  to  a    basic  understanding  of  fluctuations  and  transport  in    materials  with attenuations of the order of  wavenumbers.    The  other  on reverberant ultrasound at very  late  times    will study fields which are potentially very sensitive  to    global   properties   of  the  samples   in   which   they    reverberate.  The proposed methods are expected to  reveal    material   properties  that  are  not   otherwise   easily    obtained.       This is a collaborative project In which the theory and    numerics will be conducted primarily at the University  of    Illinois,  and the experiments will be conducted primarily    at the Uni versity of Missouri.",
