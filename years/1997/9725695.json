 "awd_abstract_narration": "In search of Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS/CDMA) receiver designs with favorable cost versus performance characteristics, we consider adaptive linear tap-weight filters. The architecture under consideration is the most conventional, but the chosen design optimization criterion is not. Based on stochastic approximation concepts, we propose the development of recursive algorithms that minimize directly the induced probability of error (average Bit-Error-Rate). The novelty of this approach   is the incorporation of the performance evaluation measure directly into the design process.    The nature of this project involves feasibility studies, development, and theoretical analysis of the induced linear filter Bit-Error-Rate surfaces.  We plan to focus initially on memoryless, time-invariant DS/CDMA channels and then we aim at the development and performance evaluation of pertinent receivers that operate successfully in multipath fading channels.     In terms of the impact of the proposed work, we recognize that this line of research goes well beyond DS/CDMA communications and may lead to studies for non-least squares (possibly MBER) optimization of linear and non-linear filters.",
