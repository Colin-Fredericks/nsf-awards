 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700034  Leal    The ultimate objective of this GOALI award (supported  jointly by the Division of Materials Research and the  Office of Multidisciplinary Activities) is the  development of a predictive basis to describe the  behavior of solutions of linear-chain, flexible  polymers in flows that are either extensional or  extension-dominated.  The primary emphasis is on  solutions that are sufficiently ent  angled that  reptation-based theories are expected to apply.  The proposed experimental studies utilize a novel  combination of flow cells, known as 2- and 4- roll  mills, that are designed to produce pure extensional,  or extension-dominated, two-dimensional flows, that  can also be either steady, or time-dependent; and  optical techniques that can probe the chain  configuration and the actual velocity gradient at any  point within the flow cell.  Chain configuration is  inferred from two-color birefringence measurements of  the degree of optical anisotropy in the fluid. A  unique implementation of dynamic light scattering  provides a pointwise measure of the velocity  gradient for either steady or transient flows.  Comparisons with theoretical models are made via  full-field fluid dynamics simulations for the dilute,  Boger-type fluids. For reptation-based models  of monodisperse and bi-disperse entangled solutions,  measured biorefringence data is compared with  model predictions using the measured velocity  gradient data as input.  %%%%  From a technological point of view, the ability to  predict the behavior of polymeric liquids in  extensional flows would allow an understanding of the  relationship between material characteristics and  processing.  From an educational standpoint, this GOALI project  offers enhancements to the normal Ph.D. program.  Graduate students will spend up to a year in  residence at the Exxon Corporate Research Laboratory,  where they will work directly with Scott Milner, as  well as visiting the Exxon Research Labs at Baytown  where work is being carried out on  both polymer  synthesis and polymer processing issues that are  directly related to the fundamental objectives of  this project.  ***",
