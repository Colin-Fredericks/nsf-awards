 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Michael T. Ashby, Department of Chemistry, University of Oklahoma, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division for a study of metal complexes containing ligands   that are geometrically constrained so that they cannot donate pi   electrons to the metal. Because their orientation precludes them from   utilizing their maximum number of electrons in bonding with the metal,   these ligands are termed `misdirected.` The project will address the   fundamental questions of how can a ligand be `misdirected,` but still be   firmly attached to a metal; the effects of `misdirected` ligands on the   ground-state and transient properties of transition metal complexes; and   the possibility that ligand `misdirection` and `redirection` can have   practical application. To address these questions a series of complexes   will be synthesized  utilizing ligands that can be forced to shuttle   between a conformation that allows pi interaction with the metal and one   that is `misdirected.` The dynamic conformational properties of these   complexes will be studied and the influence of ligand `misdirection` on   the chemical properties of the complexes will be assessed.   Many chemical reactions carried out in the laboratory, in industry, and   by biological systems involve the participation of metal ions. Much of   the unique reactivity of the metals is a reflection of variations, during   the course of reactions, in the number of electrons surrounding the   metal. This project will probe fundamental questions of how complexes can   be designed so that groups attached to metal ions can be forced to   provide variable numbers of electrons. Systems will be studied to   determine both how to obtain such compounds and how controlled   alterations in the metal electron counts can change chemical reactivity.   This will set the ground work both to understand existing processes and   to rationally design new ones.",
