 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop new applications of DNA in polymer  physics, in fields as diverse as adhesion, polymer brushes,  reptation, low dimensional systems, confined geometries, and  topological statistical mechanics.  It is expected that this  research will provide significant new progress towards the  resolution of open questions in these fields.  Specific  experiments that will be performed include the following.  The kinetics of adhesive fracture will be studied by  measuring the dynamic forces as two entangled polymers are  separated.  The static and dynamic behavior of a DNA brush  will be measured, thus testing the predictions of various  theories by providing a direct measurement of single  molecule configurations and dynamics.  The theory of  reptation will be critically examined by searching for  correlated motion of polymers in a melt.  Low dimensional  statistical mechanics will be studied by confining DNA in  microfabricated structures.  Finally, the effects of  topological knots on the statistical mechanical behavior of  DNA will be investigated by directed knot tying.  This research will be integrated with educational activities  on many levels.  Graduate students will be trained with an  interdisciplinary range of skills.  An upper level  undergraduate/first year graduate course on `The Biophysics  of DNA` will also be developed, that will serve to provide  an integrated curricula knitting together the various  theoretical and experimental applications of DNA to  biophysics, and vice versa.  This grant is made under the NSF `CAREER` Program.  Support  is provided jointly by the MPS Division of Physics, the MPS  office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the BIO Division  of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.",
