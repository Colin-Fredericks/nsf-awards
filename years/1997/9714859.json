 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714859  Lee  Most large metropolitan areas here in the United States, or  countries in other parts of the world, already have or are  planning to have underground infrastructure systems as an  alternate way of urban transportation.  It is important to  understand the characteristics of damages associated with the  underground construction and to find out the cause of both  geotechnical as well as structural deformations, and also, to  study the influence of local site effects in the vicinity of the  structure on the amplification of structural deformations  resulting from strong earthquake motions.    Experiences from previous earthquakes suggest that the recorded  motions in some areas had larger than expected amplitudes.  These  are usually areas with large depths of alluvial sediments  together with comparatively soft soil deposits near the surfaces.   Massive civil infrastructures (dams, freeway networks, bridges  and now the underground subways) respond to strong earthquake  ground motions that are highly dependent on the surface and  subsurface topographies at the local sites.  This project is to  study the effects of the interactions among the subways, the  multiple structural foundations and the local geology, to explore  how all these key elements will affect the resulting  amplifications of foundation motions.  The proposed method is  based on the wave propagation in elastic solid media.  The  challenge in solving the problem will be in the boundary  conditions where the nonorthogonal compressional and shear  potentials are coupled.  This will be overcome with expanded  series and integral representations of the wave potentials.    Results from these studies will be compared with the actual  deformations as recorded from previous earthquakes.  The  comparisons will serve as guidelines to the correct modelling of  the problem under consideration.  With proper understanding of  how surface (buildings and freeways) and subsurface (underground  subways) structures performed during str ong-motion earthquakes,  future structural design of new buildings and retrofit plans for  existing structures can be improved by including these local site  effects to provide the correct design strength and reinforcement.   Then it will help to minimize property damage and the loss of  life in future earthquakes to come.  ***",
