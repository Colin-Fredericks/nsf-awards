 "awd_abstract_narration": "This   research  is  concerned  with  the  problem  of  recovery,  representation,  and  recognition of  two  and  three-dimensional  shape from real images. Building on the results of previous  NSF-  funded research on deriving a representation for segmented  shape  that  is  robust to variations in the visual scene,  the  current  effort  focuses on deriving such representations   directly  from  real   images   of  appreciable  complexity,  involving   partial  occlusion, gaps, spurious edges, and noise. Two key complementary  approaches  are proposed. The first relies on a local formulation  of  deformation and shock formation by propagating local, labeled  waves  directly  from  edge elements and detecting,  classifying,  grouping,  and  labeling  the formed  singularities  (shocks)  to  recover  partial  shock segments from partial  contour  segments,  shock-based partitioning of shapes in grey-scale images prior  to  segmentation,  and  completion  of  missing  contours.  Secondary  (interpenetrating)  waves and a set of shock transformations  are  proposed to deal with alterations due to partial occlusion, gaps,  and  spurious edge elements. The second approach is complementary  to  the  first  and  captures  regional  continuity  by  randomly  initializing  object  hypotheses as fourth-order shocks  (seeds),  which  then grow based on the output of low-level processes.  The  research  is motivated by segmentation and registration  problems  in 3D and will focus on two key areas: 1) the formalization of  a  classification of 3D shocks, the development of a shock  grammar,  and  the  implementation of robust numerical  schemes  for  their  detection; and 2) the development of a geometric notion of  scale  in  3D by devising a surface evolution scheme of diffusion,  thus  generalizing  the  reaction-diffusion space to  3D.  The  overall  approach  reflects visual modeling by sets of coupled systems  of  PDEs,  a  paradigm which allows for simultaneous  interaction  of  boundary  and  regio n  processes as  well  as  bottom-up/top-down  communication.",
