 "awd_abstract_narration": "Benedict College, a Historically Black College in South Carolina, is the recipient of ARI funds to renovate biology and chemistry research and research training facilities. The Department of Biology and Physical Sciences has been instrumental in producing under-represented scientists, and in order to sustain this course, it is imperative that the physical infrastructure is improved. Alumni Hall, a structure constructed in the mid 1960's, is home to the department where the majority of the laboratories reside.  Dispersed space consisting of modified classrooms, shared between research and instructional activities will be consolidated, relocated, and upgraded as designated research laboratories. Funds will be used to reconfigure space, remove asbestos, upgrade utility infrastructure, and install fume hood, casework and benches in the building.  The renovations are required to support research programs that concentrate on molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and analytical and environmental chemistry.  Upon completion, this project will provide modern space for instrumentation and technology to support present and future research and training activities.  Beneficiaries include five faculty members and their students who will utilize five research laboratories, a research training facility, and research support laboratories consisting of a cold room, a tissue culture room, and storage space.  Consolidating scattered space in a centralized location will promote shared usage of equipment and facilities more effectively, and facilitate collaborative projects.  This project will increase the College's potential to attract, retain and develop a high caliber of faculty; recruit and retain high achieving students, and increase of number of minority students entering and succeeding in graduate school, and subsequently pursuing research as a career.",
