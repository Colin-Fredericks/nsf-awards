The Council of State Science Supervisors (CSSS) proposes to conduct a conference for state and jurisdictional level science and mathematics coordinators, who have as part of their responsibilities, the implementation of the PAEMST Program at the state level.  CSSS is uniquely qualified to conduct the conference, as they are the membership organization for the science supervisors in all fifty states.    PAEMST recognizes outstanding mathematics and science teachers K-12.  Recognition begins with the selection of state and jurisdictional finalists in the categories of elementary science, secondary science, elementary mathematics, and secondary mathematics.  Finalists' names are forwarded to NSF where a national selection committee, composed of outstanding mathematicians, scientists, and educators, recommends awardees in each category.  These names are then forwarded to the White House for final approval.  This is an extremely important effort, as there are several issues that need attention by the state and jurisdictional chairs for the PAEMST program, such as consistency and fairness in selecting state finalists, efforts to increase the participation of underserved minority teachers, appropriate recognition and later utilization of awardees at the state level, connecting awardees at the state and national levels with significant education reform efforts in mathematics and science.  This conference  provides the only forum for state and jurisdictional chairs to meet and  create plans to address these issues.",
