 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tools  for  Lexicon  Building\" project  is  preparing  a  lexical  database  for English called \"Framenet\" built on abundant  corpus  evidence and formulated on the principles of frame semantics.  It  will  be  freely  available to researchers  in  several  formats,  including  one  that can serve as an accessory to  WordNet.   The  primary  deliverable  is  a highly relational  \"starter\"  lexicon  containing  5,000 entries covering major semantic domains.   Each  database entry is associated with the semantic frame in which  it  participates,  and annotated with respect to how it  constellates  with  the  elements  of that frame, both morphosyntactically  and  semantically.   Entries will also list examples  taken  from  the  corpus  showing  the range of the word's use, including  relative  frequency  data.  Another significant development of the  project  is  a  set  of  high-performance computational tools  for  corpus  research,  annotation,  and analysis (some  of  which  are  being  developed in collaboration with colleagues in Europe) which  will  be  made  available  to  the research community.   The  resulting  facility,   which   incorporates  both  linguistic-semantic   and  lexicographic techniques, will be valuable to human users of both  printed  and  online  works  and also  to  researchers  exploring  natural  language processing, speech recognition, and the complex  problems of language understanding.",
