 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602179  Shen      This award supports development of cooperation between Zheng-  Kang Shen and David Jackson, UCLA, and Li Yanxing, State  Seismological Bureau, Tianjin, on investigation of tectonic  deformation in China using the Global Positioning System  (GPS). The researchers will analyze existing data from  Chinese GPS sites and initiate further studies in North  China, an area that has received less attention than more  active areas in the western areas of China. Active tectonic  deformation has been recognized within the eastern Eurasia  plate, mainly due to its collision with the Indian plate and  its interaction with the Pacific plate along its eastern  margin.  How much deformation has been taking place either  across the plate margins or along individual faults there is  largely unknown.  It is clear that the level of seismic  activity in the region as a whole is very high.    Thus the  proposed work is an important component of understanding the  dynamics of the region.    The project has good potential to establish a GPS baseline  in a tectonically active area through cooperation between  the UCLA group and the SSB group.  This could lead in the  future to establishment of permanent GPS sites in China,  which would benefit all researchers working in and around  China.",
