Munnecke, Founder and President, Environmental  BioTechnologies, Inc. in San Carlos, CA, and Dr. A.M. Azzam,  Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Research Institute (GEBRI)  in Mubarak City for Scientific Research in Alexandria, Egypt.  The  objective of this joint project is to investigate the applications  of advanced biotechnology discoveries in various industries,  including food, agricultural and environmental monitoring and  control industries, and the potential for US-Egypt industrial  production cooperation. The two sides intend to: define the market  needs and size for selected industrial bioproducts and  bioprocess; identify available American products and technology  for importing into Egypt; and finally initiate contacts between  American and Egyptian biotechnology companies for possible joint  activities. Scope:  This project will involve a US scientist with  extensive experience in developing applications  for discoveries and advanced research results in the area of  biotechnology, in various fields in the United States.  On the  Egyptian side, the cooperating scientist is an experienced  chemical engineering researcher who is now in charge of a major  government research laboratory (GEBRI) with a mission to make  possible the utilization of the rapid advances and discoveries in  the field of biotechnology. The work in this project will seek to  utilize the scientific advances made in Egypt and in the US in  biotechnology for economic development in Egypt and in other  Middle East countries.  The results can have a major impact on the  economic development and also on the environmental quality, and  general health services in these countries and on their technical  cooperation with the United States.  Most of the work will be done  in Egypt with support from the US scientist, with the rest to be  done in the United States.  This proposal meets INT objective of  supporting US- foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund  Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both  countries to carry out these cooperative activities.  ***",
