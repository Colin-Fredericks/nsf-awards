Using Internet tools and techniques, CK Software, Inc. will develop a Protocol Engine to provide nurses and physicians with access to health care rules and guidelines at the time of treatment, when these are most effective in improving quality and cost effectiveness of health care.  During Phase I, the Protocol Engine will be prototyped as a Web-Server application.  Tools and techniques of accessing current data on mainframe and mini computers will be investigated. Server/browser notification techniques will be developed so that users can be informed of the actions they need to take.  Processes for integrating standard Lab and Chart notes applications will be demonstrated to take full advantage of the network and Web-Server environment and to display the full power of this approach for future customers.     The fully functional Protocol Engine which CK Software, Inc. intends to develop in the second phase of the project will be a valuable tool for insurers, government agencies, health management organizations, clinics, and payors of all types that are pressing to limit costs and improve quality by standardization and managed care.  ***",
