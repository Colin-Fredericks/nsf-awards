 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pattern Matching is coming of age.  The last six years have  seen great progress in the area of Pattern Matching  Algorithms.  In particular, researchers have looked into  generalized versions of the problem.  The field has evolved  from being an important theoretical foundational area to  being well-poised on the verge of practical usability in  many diverse applications, from multi-media to computational  molecular biology. The project is seeking a pro-active role  in bringing these new results into the relevant applicant  domains, as well as feedback and direction about the  important missing parts in the theory of pattern matching.  This involves joining some large applied projects as an  algorithmic group.  The research problems described here are  motivated and inspired by the needs of these projects.  These problems require achieving new insights into the  nature of pattern matching, as well as results of the  following nature:  Efficient algorithms for association  generation in dynamic data bases.  Efficient generation of  generalized associations (e.g.\\ with negations).  Efficient  algorithms for approximate matching in hyper-text.  Efficient algorithms for approximate dictionary matching.  New multidimensional adaptive compression schemes that allow  efficient compressed searches and space and time efficient  local decompression.  Generalization of Pattern Matching.",
