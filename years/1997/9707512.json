 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707512  Edwards  The goal of the proposal research is to investigate  molecular transport across the major transport barriers of  the eye.  Despite the importance of sight, a fundamental  understanding of transport in the eye is still lacking.  A  mathematical model without fitted parameters will be  developed to predict solute transport rates across the  cornea and the sclera given the physiochemical properties of  the compounds.  The model will be vased on the real  ultrastructure of each barrier, and will relate the  geometrical parameters and chemical composition of each  tissue to its macroscopic measurable transport properties.    The importance of understanding molecular transport in the  eye is several fold.  The natural function of the eye, like  all organs of the body, is directly related to the transport  of water, solute, and ionic species.  For instance, glucose  is required by the corneal epithelium for energy production,  and it reaches the cells by diffusion from the aqueous  humor.  Another example is that of keratocyte migration to  the wound site following stomal injury, possibly under the  attraction of an electrical field.  Characterization of the  structure and function of the eye is often made by measuring  transport properties such as diffusivity, permeability and  electrical conductivity.  A quantitative understanding of  transport in the eye can aid in the interpretation of these  data.  The ability to predict transport rates also has  direct application to eye drug delivery.    The principal aims of the model are:  1) to predict the  water and solute permeability of the cornea and the sclera  as a function of hydration, collagen and proteoglycan  content, fibril distribution, and the size and partition  coefficient of the solute; 2) to determine the electrical  resistance properties of the two barriers; and 3) to  simulate transient transport of nutrients in the cornea.  ***",
