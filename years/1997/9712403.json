 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns two areas in geometric algorithms,  including the exploration of some promising connections  between them.  One area is the application of random walk  techniques in the design of algorithms for sampling from a  convex body, volume computation, and related geometric  problems like bringing a convex body to isotropic position.  The key technique is using a random walk to generate sample  points, and the analysis of mixing and other properties of  this walk.  Further improvements depend on a number of  unresolved technical questions, mostly in geometry but also  connected with Markov chains.  The other topic is geometric  representations of graphs, and the application of such  representations in the design of graph algorithms.  This has  surprising connections with graph properties and parameters  like chromatic number, cliques, connectivity, cuts, and  topological embeddablity. Representations with favorable  properties can be used to design exact or approximation  algorithms for many such problems.  There are geometric  representations connected with random walks on graphs, and  geometric properties of these representations reflect mixing  properties of the random walk.  Applications of these  representations in the analysis of random walk techniques  are being studied.",
