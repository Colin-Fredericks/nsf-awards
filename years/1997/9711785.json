Achieving  these  very  difficult  experiments will require substantial improvements  in techniques for isolating, manipulating, and securing SWNT  ropes onto fabricated supports.  A single continuous rope of  SWNTs  will  be  draped cross metallic line  features  on  a  silicon  wafer  fabricated  at the Stanford  Nanofabrication  Facility.  The sample will then be introduced into an atomic  force microscope which will be used for three purposes:  (1)  The  entire  sample will be scanned periodically,  first  to  find  an attractive span, and subsequently to look for signs  of  breakage and slippage;  (2) High-resolution scans of the  rope  lying on the support lines on either side of the  span  will  yield the geometry of the rope, giving a good estimate  for the number of SWNTs in the rope; (3) The AFM tip will be  engaged  at  one point in the middle of the span to  deflect  the  rope.   The  known AFM cantilever force constant  along  with  the  measured deflections will provide the information  required to obtain tensile strengths of the rope and of  the  individual tubes.    %%%    New   evidence  suggests  that  carbon  nanotubes  are   the  strongest  materials  known,  potentially  enabling   unique  applications  in  many areas critical to the  U.S.  economy.  This  research  will  involve  direct  measurements  of  the  strength  of  nanotube  ropes using micromanipulators.   The  results  will  provide  the  foundation  for  research   and  development  of  nanotube  based superstrong  materials  and  their applications",
