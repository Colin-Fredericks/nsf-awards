 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to purchase and equip a very-light aircraft (RANS S-12  Airaile) with remote sensing instruments (e.g. ground penetrating  radar, infrared digital multispectral camera, hyperspectral radiometer,  and high-speed true and false color video), net CO2, H2O vapor, energy  balance sensors (NOAA-ATDD Mobile Flux Platform), and meteorological  sensors.  This instrumentation will provide users with   integrated ecophysiological and biophysical data for arctic tundra and  semi-arid shrubland and woodland ecosystems, and builds on existing  research efforts by all users who have ongoing ecosystem research  programs sponsored by NSF (OPP) and others (e.g. DOE, NIGEC, EPRI, and  USGS). By combining instruments and research needs on a single  aircraft, a dedicated reliable system for integrated data collection  will be established. This aircraft fills a critical need of a group of  researchers from several universities and agencies working on the  effects of global change and on ecosystem and landscape processes in  the arctic and southwest US.    Projected ecological factors, such as impending climate change and  increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse  gases, have the potential to alter global ecosystem structure and  function. These regional and global phenomena highlight the importance  of large-scale, process-based research. For example, although much  process-based C balance research has recently been conducted, the  challenges of scaling these predominantly plot-level estimates of  ecosystem C exchange has been hampered by the inability to directly  assess the scaled, regional-level estimates. The technology for  directly assessing regional C balance and the biophysical controls on  ecosystem C balance has recently become available. Aircraft platforms  have been used extensively in recent initiatives to determine net CO2,  H20, and energy exchange of terrestrial ecosystems (FIFE, ABLE 3 A,  BOREAS, and NSF-LAII), and when linked with remote sensing  instrument ation, significant progress has been made in understanding  spatial feed backs between surface features and ecosystem C exchange.",
