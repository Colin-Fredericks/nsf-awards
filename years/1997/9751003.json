 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) is being used in course throughout the chemistry curriculum to stimulate interest in science, to explore different approached to experimental design, and to answer scientific questions of interest to students.  ICP-OES is a technique in which an argon stream is caused to absorb energy from a radio-frequency source.  This energy converts the argon into a high temperature plasma into which samples are introduced.  The sample atoms absorb energy from the plasma and move to excited states.  These atoms then return to their ground states by emission of radiation by emission of characteristic lines of radiation.  The theory behind this technique is presented early in the introductory chemistry course.  Students at all levels work in teams under the supervision of a faculty mentor to develop model projects for study.  These projects involve collection and preparation of environmental samples for determination of specific elements selected by the team.  In the introductory laboratory, students submit samples and receive data for interpretation and analysis.  In more advanced laboratories, students use the instrument to explore limits of detection of elements in the environment and  also become familiar with the EPA procedures for analysis.  One specific activity involves the collection of all documentation required for EPA certification of an ICP-OES method.  Advanced students run the samples collected by students in the introductory courses and then serve as consultants to the introductory students in the analysis of their data.  This project emphasizes a team based approach to the use of ICP-OES in solving problems requiring both qualitative and quantitative information.  *",
