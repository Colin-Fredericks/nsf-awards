 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many computer systems are multi-threaded.  Traditional  on-line problems abstract away the existence of multiple  threads, either by collapsing multiple threads into a single  thread or by reducing each thread to a single request. This  project studies a new class of problems:  on-line systems  with multi-threaded inputs.  To model multi-threaded inputs,  multiple client input model where each client (thread) is  represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) are  introduced.  Three practical problems investigated are the  multi-threaded paging problem, where processes compete for  both central processing unit (CPU) time and fast memory  locations; the multi-threaded disk scheduling problem where  processes and/or database transactions compete for access to  the disk; and the multi-threaded operating system problem,  the natural combination of these two problems.  These  problems generalize into the k-client problem, a dual  version of the well-studied k-server problem, and the  k-server l-client problem.  One important goal of this  research is to learn how to design a complex system such as  a fast memory manager, a CPU scheduler, and a disk  scheduler.  In particular, determine if the algorithms and  results obtained by considering each system component in  isolation can be easily combined to produce new algorithms  and results for the complete system. In education, there are  two complementary projects.  The first project deals with  the process of learning how to teach.  The PI applied for  and received a highly competitive MSU Lilly Endowment  Teaching Fellowship.  In this intensive year-long program,  the PI will work together with a group of five promising  young faculty to learn fundamental educational principles  taught by leading education scholars from around the  University and around the country.  The second project is to  build a more cohesive curriculum emphasizing the practical  importance of all topics, especially theory.  This is  achieved by leading a departmental effort to wr ite a  comprehensive computer science textbook written in hypertext  markup language (HTML).  This HTML textbook will utilize  hyperlinks to highlight the connections between and within  courses.  For example, links will connect a module on stacks  and queues from a data structures course with modules from  an operating systems course where these structures are used.  This HTML textbook project may also supplement departmental  efforts to offer distance learning courses to nontraditional  students.",
