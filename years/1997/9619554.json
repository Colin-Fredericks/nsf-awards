 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flexible  and approximate computation considers how  to  allocate  limited  computation  resources and trade  solution  quality  for  reduced   computational  cost  in  order  to   optimize   overall  performance of an autonomous system or agent.  The goal  of  this  research is to develop general, effective, and efficient  methods  for flexible and approximate computation.  The approach, based on  heuristic  state-space search, consists of a  set  of  reductions  that  help to restrict search effort to the most promising  areas  of  a problem space.  Specifically, a state-space reduction is  a  process  of  reducing a state space that is difficult  to  search  into  a  less  complex state space that is easier to explore  and  more  likely to contain high-quality solutions.  After reduction,  the optimal goal in the reduced state space is found and used  as  an   approximate  solution  to  the  original  problem.    Better  solutions  can  be  found incrementally, with  refined  reduction  processes.   One  important issue in flexible computation  is  to  find  performance profiles of a computation which measure  system  performance  in  terms of required computation  resources.   This  research  also considers how to construct closed-form performance  profiles  by  analyzing  the expected complexity  of  state-space  search  algorithms.  The results of this  research  will  provide  effective methods for real-time scheduling and on-line searching,  and provide intrinsic insight into the computational behavior  of  state-space search methods.",
