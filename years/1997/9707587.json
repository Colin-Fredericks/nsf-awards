 "awd_abstract_narration": "Attardi  9707587         Career Advancement Awards expand the opportunity for  women researchers to advance their career.  Dr. Attardi will  use these funds to increase her knowledge of brain anatomy  and to acquire state-of-the-art neuroanatomical  techniques  to allow her to examine the differential actions of  progesterone leading to the facilitation or inhibition of  the gonadotropin surge.   The progesterone receptor is  unusual among members of the steroid/thyroid family of  nuclear receptors since, it exists in two isoforms, PRa and  PRb,  in all species except the rabbit.  Moreover, it has  been suggested that responsiveness to progesterone within a  particular tissue could depend upon changes in the relative  ratios of the two isoforms especially given that the two  isoforms change developmentally and with endocrine  manipulations.  Since these studies used only tissue from  the peripheral system, it is not clear whether the two  isoforms are involved in the mechanism of progesterone  action in neural tissue as well.   Dr. Attardi will now  examine both the presence and the regulation of the two  progesterone isoforms in the brain and pituitary.  She will  determine the role that these two  isoforms play in the  modulating the ability of estrogen and progesterone to  regulate gonadotropin secretion.  Understanding the  integration of this complex neuroendocrine mechanism is very  important since it underlies the perpetuation of the  species.",
