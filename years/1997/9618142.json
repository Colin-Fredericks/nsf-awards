 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618142  Krasny    This proposal is to develop a set of in-depth, interdisciplinary,  grade 9-12 instructional modules that focus the application of the  four process standards (from the National Science Education  Standards) -- Science as Inquiry, History and Nature of Science,  Science and Technology, and Science in Personal and Social  Perspectives -- to the topic of environmental toxicology.  This  issue is important to students living in urban, suburban and rural  communities and all students using the materials will be  investigating problems relevant to their own lives.  The modules  include activities designed to engage students in three levels of  inquiry, 1) open ended laboratory exercises that focus on building  skills and understanding science concepts, 2) exploratory  investigations that give students the opportunity to investigate  variables related to their initial laboratory exercise, and 3)  controlled experimental research that uses the results of  explorations to define a controlled experiment with independent  variables.  Students learn to communicate their results among  communities of scientists and to the wider lay community.  The  topic of environmental toxicology is a focus of Cornell research  programs and the scientists from these programs will join with  teachers and educators to develop the materials.  The outcome  includes teacher materials designed to assist teachers in making  the transition to inquiry-based science and to other aspects of the  science reform movement.",
