 "awd_abstract_narration": "Galvin  9700796    This award provides funds for an investigation into list coloring problems and other problems in combinatorics. List coloring problems in graph theory involve coloring the elements (vertices or edges) of a graph in such a way that adjacent or incident elements receive different colors, and the color of each element must be chosen from a prescribed list of colors  associated with that element. For example, the list chromatic index (or  list edge-chromatic number) of a graph is the least number n  such that,  given an arbitrary assignment of a list of  n  colors to each edge, there  is a proper edge-coloring in which each edge is colored with a color from  its list. The list (vertex-) chromatic number  and list total chromatic  number are defined analogously.  The list coloring conjecture, due to  Vizing, asserts that the list chromatic index of any graph (or multigraph)  is equal to its (ordinary) chromatic index. The list coloring conjecture  (LCC for short) is a notoriously deep and difficult problem.  One of the  major recent advances in this area was the PI's proof of the LCC for  bipartite multigraphs, a result which included, as a special case, the  well-known Dinitz conjecture about partial Latin squares.  In this project,  the PI hopes to make further progress on the LCC, by extending and applying  his result on the bipartite case, and by other means. While the main focus  of this project is on list colorings, the PI plans to investigate various  other problems in combinatorics and graph theory, possibly including, but  not limited to, the areas of Ramsey theory for paths, hypergraph  games, cliques in factorizations of graphs and hypergraphs, and  Frankl's conjecture on union-closed families.      This research is in the area of combinatorics. Combinatorics is generally  applicable to various practical problems: routing, scheduling, and other  management science problems, communications, cryptology, etc.  The  mathematical formulation of a scheduling problem is a  graph coloring  problem.  List coloring theory, besides being directly applicable to  certain kinds of scheduling problems, is a useful tool in the study of  classical graph coloring problems. The educational significance of a lot  of work in combinatorics and graph theory, in particular the kind of work  planned for this project, is that the problems and results, and even the  methods used, are often accessible to bright undergraduate and high school  students, so that they can enjoy the excitement of direct contact with  current research.",
