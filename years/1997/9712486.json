Tanner       Affiliation:                       Vanderbilt University                     This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program        sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of        the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The principal        investigator is Dr. Robert Tanner from Vanderbilt University. The         research involves development of a technique for protein separations        using foam and bubble fractionation. While it is well known that        bubbling a gas through aqueous protein-containing solutions leads to        protein adsorption on the bubble interface and transport with the        bubble to the solution surface, exploitation of the phenomenon to        extract proteins from solution has been prevented due several inherent        problems. Most important amongst them is the possible denaturation of        the protein either as a result of protein unfolding at the gas-water        interface or as a result of shear-induced denaturation as a        consequence of bubble burst. The process is difficult to study and the        parameters that govern the extraction of proteins with maximal        retention of structure/function have not yet been elucidated. The        research seeks to conduct a systematic  study of the phenomenon and        determine the variables that affect protein extraction, selectivity        and retention of structure/function.               The research would contribute to the fundamental understanding of        proteins at liquid-gas interfaces.  From a technological perspective,        the studies could lead to defining operating conditions that result in        protein extraction with retention of structure/function. The method        proposed is very inexpensive and could have significant applications        in  the extraction and recovery of industrial enzymes.",
