 "awd_abstract_narration": "Philip Reid of the University of Washington has received a CAREER award   in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study reaction dynamics   of environmentally important compounds.  Reid will focus on condensed   phase reactions of halooxides and other halogenated species.  Resonance   Raman intensity analysis or time-resolved Resonance Raman spectroscopy   will be used to investigate the reactivity from initial excited-state   nuclear evolution to the appearance of ground state photoproducts.    The teaching program will involve the creation of new courses and   instructional tools to enhance the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.    Internet-based teaching methods and a new course in physical chemistry   for environmental scientists are being developed in response to a   recently created interdisciplinary program in environmental education.    Undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Washington   will participate in collaborative research at Pacific Northwest National   Laboratories.",
