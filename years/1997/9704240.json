 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research  aims  to  develop a conceptual  natural  language  processing  (NLP) system with adaptable components  that  can  be  easily  tailored  for  different domains  and  applications.  The  architecture  of  the system consists of fine-grained  layers  to  support  various depths of text processing.  The  shallow  layers  support  syntactic processing, which may be sufficient  for  some  information  retrieval  tasks, while the  deeper  layers  support  semantic   and   conceptual  processing  for  in-depth   language  understanding.  The system includes components for part-of-speech  tagging,   prepositional  phrase  attachment,  semantic   feature  identification,  and concept extraction. Each  component  can  be  tailored for new domains with minimal manual effort.  The layered  architecture   also   allows  students  to   develop   individual  components   and   plug  them  in  to  the  larger   system   for  experimentation. The education goals are to use the system as the  basis for a hands-on science workshop for young girls, for summer  lectures  to high school students, for class projects in  natural  language  processing and machine learning, and for  graduate  and  undergraduate research projects. The purpose of the  research  is  to  develop  techniques for building conceptual natural  language  understanding systems automatically or semi-automatically for new  domains.  Generating  conceptual sentence analyzers  quickly  and  efficiently   is   an  important  step  toward   many   practical  applications,  including conceptual information  retrieval,  text  categorization, and information extraction.",
