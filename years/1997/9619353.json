It involves collaborative  research between Arizona State University and ALCOA.  The  grant has two objectives.    One objective is to use density functional theory methods to  determine adhesive energies between aluminum alloys and  selected tool coating materials.  The electronic structure  of each system will be analyzed to determine the critical  factors that control adhesion.  This study will yield the  first reliable database on metal-coating adhesion energies,  including the effect of the most common alloying elements  (Cu, Mg, Si, Mn, Zn).  This database will serve as an  invaluable design tool for almost all aluminum manufacturing  processes that involve load transmission through  tooling/workpiece interface.    The second objective of the research is to simulate adhesive  metal transfer at the atomic scale.  This will involve some  small-scale quantum molecular dynamics simulations, and some  larger-scale empirical molecular dynamics simulations.  Simulations will focus on small scale plastic deformation  during bulk forming processes.    Finally, based on results of this work, selected coating  materials will be tested by the ALCOA adhesive wear research  group using an adhesion balance in ultrahigh vacuum.  Altogether, these studies will aid in the selection of  coating materials for aluminum forming processes such as  rolling, extrusion, forging and continuous casting.  %%%  This award is a GOALI (Grant Opportunities for Academic  Liaison with Industry) grant which is co-funded by the  Division of Materials Research and Directorate for  Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities.  It involves collaborative  research between Arizona State University and ALCOA.  The  grant has two objectives.  Firs t, calculations will be made  of the strength of adhesion between aluminum alloys and  various materials which are used for coatings in aluminum  processing.  These results will be helpful in designing  aluminum manufacturing processes.  Second, simulations of  adhesive metal transfer at the atomic level will be done.  The focus will be on plastic deformation during metal  forming.  The results of the calculations and simulations  will be tested in ALCOA laboratories.  ***",
