Cohen,  S.P Kerckhoff, and R.J. Milgram.  Cohen and Milgram both have research  projects that involve studying the algebraic topology of spaces (\"moduli  spaces\") that arise as the set of solutions to equations coming from  Geometry and Theoretical Physics.  These include the Yang-Mills equations  defining instantons on four dimensional manifolds, and the Cauchy-Riemann  equations, which define holomorphic structures on maps from surfaces to a  variety of important target manifolds.  In addition, Cohen plans to use  techniques from Algebraic Geometry and Topology to study a holomorphic  version of the K-theory of an algebraic variety.  These lead to invariants  of holomorphic bundles in a systematic way.  Milgram plans to continue to  study the emerging connections between the structure of finite groups and  homotopy theory.  He will also study the topology of certain special types  of function spaces with applications to both homotopy theory and other  areas of mathematics.  S.P. Kerckhoff studies low dimensional topology and  geometry.  In this project he plans to continue his work on hyperbolic  geometric structures in dimension 3.  This includes studying structures with  singularities along links and along graphs.  He will use both combinatorial  and analytic methods.       Recent interactions between mathematics and physics have  brought new ideas and problems into mathematics related in part to  the physicists' desire better to understand quantum field theory.   Among the mathematical results of this interaction have been  extensive new information about the geometry of 3- and 4-dimensional  spaces, including counterexamples to basic conjectures  and new structure results.  The major focus of this project is to  apply much more advanced results from deep, well-developed areas of  mathematics, such as algebraic topology and homotopy theory , to  these new ideas and problems, as well as to related questions.  ***",
