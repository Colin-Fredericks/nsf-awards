 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728366  Wang  The proposed research program uses renewable natural  polysaccharides as a platform, and uses thermophilic enzyme  libraries as a novel synthetic tool to develop  environmentally friendly chemistry for the synthesis of  novel po!ysaccharide-based materials.  The major thrusts are  the development and application of thermophilic enzyme  catalysis.  Extremozyme libraries from microorganisms in  extreme environments (e.g.  high temperature, high pressure  or high salt concentration) constitute a new type of  biocatalysts, which exhibit novel chemo-, regio- and stereo-  selectivities and can be used at extremes of temperature or  pH or in organic solvents in industrial processing.    The specific aims and expected results for this program are:    1. Obtain a complete data base on glycosidase-catalyzed  glycosylation with the thermophilic glycosidase library and  synthesize a host of monosaccharide modified polysaccharide.    2. Utilize the thermophilic cellulase library to synthesize  structurally well defined cellulose derivatives which can be  used to study the structure/property relation of  polysaccharides.    3. Develop thermophilic lipase/esterase-catalyzed  polymerization technology to graft polyesters onto  polysaccharides, and synthesize a host of novel  polysaccharide-polyester materials.    This program will serve to demonstrate and promote the use  of environmentally friendly biocatalysis to transform  renewable natural resources into novel materials.  ***",
