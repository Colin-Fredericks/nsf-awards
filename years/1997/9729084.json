 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies various schemes that provide affordable and  interactive Video-on-Demand (VOD) services for popular videos.   These videos include ``hot'' news coverage, popular sport events,   tapped lectures, or recently released movies. The first goal of   the study is to understand the tradeoff among various resources   such as server I/O bandwidth, client buffer size, and client   I/O bandwidth. All these tradeoff issues are important in   designing a video server since, in future multimedia   applications, service providers might subsidize the cost of the   set-top box at a user's side if it is cost effective. The second   goal of the study is to provide interactive services to users.   The interactive services, which include VCR like functions such   as pause, resume, rewind and forward, make any content available   under the touch of a fingertip. The study includes resource   allocation schemes for providing timely interactive services.   For a full description of the project, please refer to the   web page   <A HREF = \"http://cs.smith.edu/~gao/research/ivod.html\">Providing   interactive VOD services for popular videos</A>.  As a new researcher in the area of multimedia networks, the PI   will focus on the first goal and set a stage for the second   goal during the planning period. The PI plans to submit a full   proposal by the end of the planning period.",
