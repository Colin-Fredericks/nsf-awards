 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for one year of support to convene a workshop on  subglacial rock drilling in the Antarctic.  Only 2% of the  Antarctic territory is ice-free and accessible to direct  geological sampling and research.  Many areas of research have a  need to know what kinds of rocks and sediments occur beneath the  ice sheet.  Most of the processes that lead to fast ice streaming  flow are located at the base of the ice sheet and involve basal  conditions and basal materials.  In fact, active volcanism may be  a crucial element of the dynamics of the West Antarctic ice  sheet.  In addition, much of the paleontological record is stored  beneath the ice sheet and is inaccessible to direct sampling.  Hence the need seems to be great for drilling access boreholes  through the ice to get samples for studying the basal geology and  basal conditions.  A workshop on subglacial drilling will bring  out the interest and need from the scientific community and will  allow for an assessment of the presently available technologies.  Additional requirements from all parties need to be gathered so  that the technology that is developed will be of use for a wide  range of interests.  The outcome of this workshop will be an  implementation plan that will spell out in more detail how to  reach the specific scientific goals of the different groups  interested in subglacial rock drilling.",
