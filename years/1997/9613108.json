 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dramatic growth of interest in wireless communication systems has  motivated an attendant interest in signal processing  techniques for data  demodulation in multiple-access communication channels.  Multi-user  detection provides a useful theoretical basis for the study of optimum  signal processing in such channels.  One principle established through the  study of  multi-user detection is that multiple-access channels can be  reduced to ambient-noise-limited channels with appropriate signal  processing.      The primary framework within which multi-user detection has been developed  has been the Gaussian code-division multiple-access (CDMA) channel, in  which the ambient background noise is white and Gaussian.  Experimental  evidence suggests that the ambient noise in many channels of interest in  wireless applications (e.g., urban and indoor radio channels, and  underwater acoustic-modem channels) is significantly non-Gaussian.  In  particular, it is known that such noise environments can be better modeled  as being derived from more general linear processes, in which both Gaussian  and impulsive components can arise. It is further well-established in the  context of single-user communications that non-Gaussian noise can be quite  detrimental to the performance of systems optimized for Gaussian noise,  whereas it can be quite beneficial if appropriately modeled and ameliorated.     Thus, as work in multi-user detection moves closer to practice,  it is of  interest  to examine the multi-user detection problem in the context of  more realistic ambient noise models.  The proposed study will address this  issue in depth.  Specifically, three research problems arising in the area  of multiple-access communications in non-Gaussian channels will be  addressed - the analysis of extant multi-user detectors in non-Gaussian  ambient noise; the design of optimum and near-optimum multi-user detectors  for non Gaussian channels; and the design of waveform sets for  non-orthogonal signaling through non-G aussian channels.     The results of this study should be quite beneficial in practical  communication systems, particularly in areas such as urban mobile  telephony, indoor wireless communications, and tetherless underwater  acoustic communications (which is of emerging interest in oceanographic  instrumentation). For the foreseeable future, there will be considerable  commercial and scientific interest in techniques that allow wireless  networks to operate with better performance for more users/subscribers and  with lower transmitter power requirements.  This means that signal  processing techniques that can significantly improve the performance of  wireless systems in real channels, such as those proposed for study here,  will be of significant interest to the commercial and scientific sectors.",
