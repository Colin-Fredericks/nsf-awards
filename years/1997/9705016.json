 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705016  Coleman            The principal investigator will continue his work on the  development of the elastic rod model for DNA with the goals of (i)  attaining insight into the mode of action of topoisomerases, (ii) finding  efficient ways to calculate configurations of DNA segments and plasmids in  circumstances in which the forces arising from self-contact are not  negligible, and (iii) obtaining mathematical results in the theory of  vibrations of elastic rings that are needed to account for the effects of  thermal fluctuations on quantities, such as writhe, that depend on the  tertiary structure of DNA plasmids. In research in a different area,  analytical and numerical methods will be employed to study the  morphological changes and instabilities that result from curvature driven  mass diffusion within the bounding surfaces of solid bodies.  Among the  topics to be investigated are (i) the evolution and stability of  axisymmetric surfaces and of planar curves in the theory of curvature  driven diffusion and (ii) the evolution of pit-like defects in otherwise  flat films.            Much is yet to be learned about the modes of action of proteins  that are known to bind to and induce deformations in DNA. There are cases  in which one can discuss the action of DNA bending proteins by treating a  DNA molecule as an elastic rod.  Recent research has shown that one can use  exact solutions of the equations of equilibrium for elastic rods to  investigate the nature of the dependence of the configuration of a segment  of DNA on conditions imposed at its end points.  Several of the problems  that are investigated in this way are important for understanding  mechanisms of gene regulation. The work on curvature driven mass diffusion  within the bounding surfaces of solids is expected to have significant  applications in materials science.  As the effects of surface diffusion  increase in importance as dimensions become small,  the theory of such  diffusion can be applied to obtain insight and quan titative results in the  following research areas: the formation of thermal grooves, i.e., the  development of surface indentations at grain boundaries in heated metals;  the stability of field-emitter cathodes, of interconnecting elements in  microelectronic circuits,  and of moving parts in micro-electromechanical  devices; fiber spheroidization in metallic composites; and the pitting of  thin films at grain boundary vertices.",
