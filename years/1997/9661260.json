 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9661260  Daniels   This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project to be carried out by Quality Air Heating & Cooling of Midland, Inc. will demonstrate the feasibility of identifying microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) by high-speed gas chromatography (HSGC) for possible control of antimicrobial engineered processes.  Variations in sources, process conditions, building activities, and environmental factors produce concentration patterns that require rapid and continuous monitoring.  Existing monitors are limited to simple mixtures, and are restricted by high detection levels and slow analysis times.  HSGC can potentially speciate and resolve complex mixtures of MVOCs at low detection levels (< 0.1 ppb) and short analysis times (< 10 sec.  Microbes and MVOCs which adversely affect indoor air quality (IAQ) are of interest to industrial hygienists, research administrators, heating/ventilation/air-conditioning (HVAC) system designers, and environmental health officials.  MVOCs are associated with outdoor air, building materials, occupants, and HVAC systems.   The proposed HSGC monitor would provide rapid detection of MVOCs from microbes having potential health effects; more efficient operation of HVAC systems; improved design and construction of IAQ systems; and better control of engineered antimicrobial processes.  The technology has utility in detection, prevention, and control of MVOCs associated with hospital; remediation sites; pollution prevention activities; production processes; and natural environments.  ***",
