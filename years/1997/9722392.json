 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722392  Palmer  A career development program is described that integrates research and pedagogy of structure/function by NMR spectroscopy.  The research program will provide a molecular basis for understanding molecular recognition in RNA-protein complexes as well as transcription termination/antitermination in lambdoid coliphages.  The initial goal is the characterization of the interaction between HK022 Nun protein and Box B RNA sequences.  The educational objectives of this proposal are the development of resources for the teaching and self-study of high resolution NMR spectroscopy.  High-resolution NMR spectroscopy is an increasingly important component of chemical and biological research in academic and industrial settings, and courses in NMR spectroscopy are offered at an expanding number of universities.  The educational efforts are based on the textbook, entitled Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice, co-authored by the PI of this proposal.  Course materials will be used in the course \"NMR spectroscopy of biological macromolecules\", taught at Columbia University, and will be distributed via the Internet.    Understanding the mechanisms by which proteins specifically recognize and interact with other molecules is a critical research problem in chemistry, biophysics, and biotechnology.  The research component of this proposal will use NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the nature of the interactions between proteins and RNA molecules that are important for molecular recognition.  The educational component will develop computer-based materials for teaching NMR spectroscopy at the advanced undergraduate and graduate university levels.  The educational materials will complement the textbook, entitled Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice, co-authored by the PI.  ***",
