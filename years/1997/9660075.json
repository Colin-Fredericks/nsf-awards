 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9660075  Warren     This project investigates ion implantation for modifying the properties of commercial metal alloys to mitigate the growth of catalytic coke which forms on critical heat transfer surfaces during many important high temperature processes including ethylene cracking, heavy oil refining, partial oxidation and substoichiometric combustion. These coke deposits are generated as byproducts of thermal cracking reactions and diminish heat transfer rates, thermal efficiencies, and reactor product yields. Work will focus on ion implantation of selected periodic elements, such as alkali/alkaline earth, phosphorous and aluminum, into commercial alloys to suppress coke formation by: ( I ) promoting the gasification of carbon, (2) altering the catalytic activity of metals for the formation of carbon radicals, and (3) impeding the process of carburization. Ion implantation offers a more durable method for treating critical heat transfer surfaces competed to conventional coating techniques such as electroplating and plasma spraying because it is less prone to cracking and delamination under extreme thermal environments. In Phase I, the coking rates of ion beam implanted metal coupons will be compared against data for conventional alloys under industrial thermal cracking conditions to assess the effectiveness of this technique. Phase II work will focus on use of emerging ion implantation techniques to allow application to more complex geometries including the inside of commercial furnace tubes.     Ion implantation of selected elements to mitigate coke deposits on high temperature metallic surfaces can significantly improve the operating economy and life of heat transfer equipment subjected to thermal cracking conditions.  Commercial applications will include treatment of thermal cracking furnace tubes and burner components.  ***",
