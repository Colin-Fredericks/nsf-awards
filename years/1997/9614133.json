 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614133  Leggett  Within the last year the phenomena of Bose-Einstein  condensation (BEC) in dilute atomic gases has been realized  in three different laboratories and many more are moving  into this area.  The systems in question lie in a regime of  parameters (density, temperature, isolation _.) many orders  of magnitude different from those which characterize the  only previously known laboratory system believed to exhibit  BEC, namely superfluid 4He.  Consequently, it should be  possible to use these systems to subject to experimental  test a variety of ideas which are believed to apply to  superfluid Helium but have never been tested there and in  particular to explore the precise relation between BEC and  the complex of phenomena which go under the name of  \"superfluidity\".  Theoretical work will be carried out, both  in general and in the context of dilute atomic gases, to  examine the superfluid density and the condition for the  phenomena of zero rotation and of persistent currents, and  to make predictions about a number of interesting  experiments on the subject of \"quantum phase coherence\" and  \"phase memory\" which are apparently feasible in these  systems. This grant has been co-reviewed with the  Theoretical Physics program in the Division of Physics and  is being co-funded with them.  %%%  This grant supports the work of a senior, distinguished PI  whose many thoughtful contributions to the general area of  superfluidity and other condensed state phenomena (such as  macroscopic quantum tunneling)  are well known.  This  project, motivated by recent experiments, takes him back to  the questions associated with relationship between Bose-  Einstein condensation and superfluidity in dilute gases.  This grant has been co-reviewed with the Theoretical Physics  program in the Division of Physics and is being co-funded  with them.  ***",
