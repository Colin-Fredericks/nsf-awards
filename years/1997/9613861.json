 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Matthew S. Platz of the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State   University is supported by a grant from the Organic Dynamics Program to   continue his studies of the rearrangements of carbenes and excited states   of diazirines.  He will study alkyl, dialkyl, cycloalkyl, and acyl   carbenes generated by laser flash photolysis of nitrogenous and   non-nitrogenous precursors, examining the influence of carbene structure   and isotopic composition, temperature, and solvent polarity on the rate   of carbene rearrangement.  Calculational studies will address the   possible roles of quantum mechanical tunneling and dynamical effects in   these rearrangements.  Rearrangement and cleavage mechanisms of   diazirines will be probed by low-temperature high resolution fluorescence   spectroscopy.  New types of carbene precursors, more efficient than those   currently used, will be used to generate carbenes at low temperature,   allowing their study by UV-visible and infrared spectroscopy and   experimentally addressing the issue of ground state electronic structure   for simple dialkyl carbenes.  In contrast to typical stable organic compounds, which are based on   carbon atoms connected to four other atoms, carbenes, which contain   carbon bonded to only two other atoms, are high-energy compounds.    None-the-less, carbenes appear to be formed in a large number of chemical   reactions, and development of an understanding of their properties and   chemistry remains an important research goal.  Professor Platz will study   the influence of several critical variables on the reaction chemistry of   carbenes and will couple these studies with calculational work in order   to assess the influence of electronic structure and quantum mechanical   effects on these reactions.  He will prepare organic compounds which   serve as precursors to carbenes, allowing the formation of ordinarily   reactive carbenes under conditions which permit their experimental study,   and will analyze the chemistry of other carbene precursors, widely used   throughout the world research community, which appear to display more   complex chemistry than generally appreciated.",
