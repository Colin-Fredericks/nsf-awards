 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615719  BENGTSON  The pack ice region surrounding Antarctica contains at least  half of the world's population of seals, with population  levels comprising about eighty percent of the world' total  piniped biomass. These seals are among the dominant top  predators in Southern Ocean ecosystems and the fluctuation  in their populations, patterns of growth and life histories  provide a potential source of information about  environmental variability integrated over a wide range of  spatial and temporal scales. As top predators, seals are  like to be sensitive to changes in the dynamics of  ecosystems and , in particular, variations in the flux of  photosynthetically fixed carbon to higher levels of the food  web caused by either climatic or ecological changes. To  assess the functional significance of these seals in  Southern Ocean ecosystems, the Scientific Committee for  Antarctic Research, the scientific body which provides  advice to the Antarctic Treaty nations, developed a program  focused on Antarctic Pack Ice Seals. This workshop will  bring together an interdisciplinary group of scientists to  develop research priorities for the US contribution to this  international program. In particular, the development of an  interdisciplinary cruise plan, will move the US forward in  addressing important questions related to pack ice seals and  their environment.",
