 "awd_abstract_narration": "In collaboration with nine members of the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Engineering and Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics and Psychology, the Philosophy Department at Trinity College is currently developing laboratories attached to philosophy courses and modeled on those traditionally found in science departments. These laboratories develop specific problem-solving skills and techniques in mathematics and science associated with philosophy, including problems in physics, astronomy, biology and engineering as well as mathematics, including geometry, algebra, and calculus. Our goal is to develop literacy in mathematics and the sciences within a humanities setting and for humanities students, who will not otherwise achieve such literacy.    These laboratories provide an excellent means of achieving this goal. (1) Historically, philosophy, mathematics and science have always been intrinsically related, e.g., physics was often called \"natural philosophy\" and current work in theories of consciousness is closely related both to developments in neuroscience and in A.I. (2) A major part of philosophy's task as a discipline is to account for the successes and failures of mathematics and science. Laboratories, jointly designed by philosophers, scientists and mathematicians, develop specific problem-solving strategies central to mathematics and science, while philosophy classes examine the theoretical accounts and justifications of these strategies. Thus, laboratories and courses each retain their disciplinary integrity while we develop the intrinsic relation between them.",
