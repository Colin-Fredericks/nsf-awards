The cause of variable rift width and crustal thinning is fairly  well explained by variable initial heat flow and crustal  thickness.  Mechanical stretching of the lithosphere has been  linked to rift shoulder uplift but the cause of variable rift  flank uplift remains poorly understood.  The Transantarctic  Mountains (TAM) are an extreme example of rift flank uplift,  extending over 3500 km across Antarctica and reaching elevations  up to 4500 m and thus constitute a unique feature of EarthOs  crust.  The range was formed in the extensional environment  associated with the Mesozoic and Cenozoic breakup of  Gondwanaland.  Geological and geophysical work has shown that the  TAM developed along the long-lived lithospheric boundary between  East and West Antarctica reactivated by a complex history of  extensional and translational microplate motions.    The TAM are not uniform along strike.  Along the OWilkes FrontO,  the northern segment of the rift extends from North Victoria Land  to Byrd Glacier.  The Wilkes Front architecture consists of (1)  thin, extended crust forming the Victoria Land Basin in the Ross  Sea, (2) the TAM rift shoulder, and (3) a long-wavelength down-  ward forming the Wilkes Basin.  Contrasting structures are mapped  along the OPensacola/PoleO Front, the southern segment of the  rift extending from the Nimrod Glacier to the Pensacola  Mountains.  Along this southern section no rift basin has been  mapped to date and the down-ward along the East Antarctic, or  ObacksideO, edge of the mountains is less pronounced.  A flexural  model linking the extension in the Ross Sea to the formation of  both the mountains and the Wilkes Basin has been considered as a  me chanism for uplift of the entire mountain range.  The  variability in fundamental architecture along the TAM indicates  that neither a single event nor a sequence of identical events  produced the rift flank uplift.  The observation of variable  architecture suggests complex mechanisms and possibly a  fundamental limitation in maximum sustainable rift flank  elevation.    The motivation for studying the TAM is to try to understand the  geodynamics of this extreme elevation rift flank.  Are the  geodynamics of the area unique, or does the history of glaciation  and related erosion contribute to the extreme uplift?  With the  existing data sets it is difficult to confidently constrain the  geological architecture across representative sections of the  TAM.  Any effort to refine geodynamic mechanisms requires this  basic understanding of the TAM architecture.    The goal of this project is to (1) constrain the architecture of  the rift system as well as the distribution and structure of  sedimentary basins, glacial erosion and mafic igneous rocks  surrounding the rift flank by acquiring three long wavelength  geophysical transects with integrated gravity, magnetics, ice-  penetrating radar, and ice surface measurements, (2) quantify the  contribution of various geodynamic mechanisms to understand the  geological conditions which can lead to extreme rift flank  uplift, and (3) use the improved understanding of architecture  and geophysical data to test geodynamic models in order to  improve our understanding both of the TAM geodynamics and the  general problem of the geodynamics of rift flank uplift  worldwide.  This project will allow development of a generalized  framework for understanding the development of rift flank uplift  as well as address the question of the specific geodynamic  evolution of the TAM.",
