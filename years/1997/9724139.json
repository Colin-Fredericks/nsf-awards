Proposal Number:IBN9724139              Neurochemical Analysis of Motivated Behavior                                  The long-term goal of this project is to explore how  chemical systems in the brain control motivated behavior.  Among motivated behaviors, ingestive behaviors such as  feeding and drinking have formed the focus of such studies.  To develop general principles to explain the control of  motivated behaviors, the results from studies on a variety  of behaviors (e.g., reproductive behavior, aggression) are  needed.  To date, little is known about the neurochemistry  of the motivational components of female reproductive  behavior.  The PIs have pursued studies showing a link  between the mesolimbic dopamine system and the control of  the incentive (e.g., reward) properties of female  reproductive behavior, using female hamsters as our  experimental model.  The studies in this proposal are  designed to further pursue this link between neural dopamine  pathways and female reprodcutive behavior in three specific  ways.  First, the PIs intend to continue microdialysis  studies demonstrating proximal relationships between female  reproductive function and extracellular dopamine levels in  the nucleus accumbens.  The PIs have demonstrated that  experienced female hamsters show higher, and more sustained  extracellular dopamine levels during interactions with males  compared with inexperienced females.  As sensitization of  responsiveness is one property of dopamine neurons  repeatedly activated with drugs, the PIs will explicitly  test whether this augmentation of nucleus accumbens dopamine  levels in experienced female hamsters reflects a sensitized  response of these neurons to stimuli received during mating  encounters.  This would be the first such demonstration of  sensitization of dopamine neurons resulting from the  expression of a naturalistic behavior.  Our second goal is  to provide a broader neurolo gical perspective on the  relationship between dopamine and female mating behavior.  To date, the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum are the  only brain regions in which in vivo measurements of dopamine  during mating encounters have been taken.  The PIs intend to  extend this analysis to other behaviorally-relevant  dopaminergic terminal fields, such as the frontal cortex,  medial preoptic area, and amygdala.  In the context of these  experiments the PIs will determine the degree to which  dopamine in each of these areas is related to the expression  of female mating behavior or some other factor associated  with social encounters.  A key issue in the interpretation  of these behavioral findings centers around the degree to  which individual dopaminergic neurons project to multiple  targets.  That is, do similarities or differences in  dopaminergic activity in each terminal field derive from the  activity of the same or different dopamine neurons.  This is  an unresolved issue for any species, and the PIs propose to  determine quantitatively the degree to which individual  dopamine neurons innervate multiple terminal fields.  Together these studies will provide a framework for defining  how functional dopaminergic pathways regulate different  components of female reproductive behavior, providing a  basis for developing generalizations of the role of  dopantine in motivated behavior.",
