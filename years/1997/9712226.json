 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate algorithmic solutions to several  geometric problems arising in layered manufacturing, where a  physical prototype of a 3D object is built directly from its  computer model by orienting and slicing the model into parallel  layers and manufacturing the layers successively.  The problems  considered include finding orientations of the model that  optimize one or more design criteria (e.g., number of layers,  surface finish, amount of support structures needed), and  algorithms for model decomposition, packing, slicing, support  generation, and computation of offsets and tool-paths.  The scope  of the project includes the design and analysis of efficient and  practical algorithms, their implementation in software, and,  furthermore, the evaluation of this software via actual  fabrication of parts on a layered manufacturing machine. The  project will draw upon combinatorial, algorithmic, and data  structuring techniques from computational geometry.  The project  will also benefit considerably from the input and practical  expertise of engineers at a leading company specializing in  layered manufacturing, with whom a collaboration is already  underway. It is expected that the proposed work will result in  significant design and performance improvements in layered  manufacturing and will also open up interesting new directions  for research in computational geometry.",
