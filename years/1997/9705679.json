The ion source will be based on cesium liquid metal materials, with ion emission through interaction of the liquid metal skin over a blunt field emitter solid tip in the presence of an intense electric field.  A variety of cesium compounds that contain bromine, iodine and chlorine as well as oxygen will be studied.  The source is expected to overcome the major limitations of present SIMS ion sources, in that it will be both high brightness and high resolution (0.1 micron).  Current cesium-based sources only have a broad resolution of about one micron; gallium sources have high resolution but such low brightness that their use in a spectrometer system is limited.  A high brightness, high spatial resolution ion source and spectrometer would have many applications in the microelectronics industry for direct surface analysis of circuits with dimensions of less than 0.25 microns.",
