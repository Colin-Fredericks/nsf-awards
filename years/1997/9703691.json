The present project   continues the study of these relations and their applications. Sheth's model for   gravitational clustering of galaxies leads to problems related to the additive coalescent in   which each pair of sets in a partition of a finite set is merging at a rate which is the sum of   the sizes of the two sets. Asymptotics of this additive coalescent define a discrete measure   valued process which can be constructed by cutting Aldous's continuum random tree at   points of a suitable Poisson process. It is proposed to study this and other measure-valued   Markov processes which model coalescent phenomena, and to look for novel applications   of these processes.     Brownian motion provides the doundation of the modern theory of continuous time   random processes with continuous paths, and has applications in fields as diverse as   physics and mathematical finance. Random partitions find applications to combinatorics,   physics and genetics. Statistical models for physical processes of coalescence and   fragmentation are of interest in a number of fields. The evolution of a partition of particles   into clumps can be variously interpreted, for example, as a partition of atoms into   molecules, a partition of molecules into polymers, or a partition of stars into galaxies. In a   chemical setting, atoms coalesce to form molecules, and molecules coalesce to form   polymers. In a cosmological setting, stars coalesce to form galaxies. The proposed   research focuses on models for an irreversible process of coalescence of a partition of a   continuum with finite total mass into a finite or countable collection of sub-masses, with   conservation of mass.",
