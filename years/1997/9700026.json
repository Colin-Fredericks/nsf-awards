 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REG award provides funds for the purchase of research  equipment related to experiments in control of constrained non  smooth mechanical systems. The equipment comprises of a two axis  direct drive motion setup, digital oscilloscope, force sensor,  deburring tools, data acquisition cards, power supplies and  amplifiers, and computers for simulations and real time control.  The research addresses applications of the results from the  theory of non-smooth differential equations to the modeling and  control of constrained mechanical systems, which are  characterized by nonlinear differential-algebraic equations and  often such phenomena as Coulomb friction,saturation dead zones  and backlash. The equipment will facilitate experiments in  automation of surface finishing operations,utilizing the unique  methodology developed for such operations, and will identify new  research directions in the area of control applications of non  smooth mechanical systems. In addition, it will be used as a  testbed for automated deburring, grinding, and other edge  finishing operations, the behavior of which can be accurately  described by non-smooth mechanical system dynamics. The  knowledge base developed from the proposed experiments on the  test-bed will provide significant insight towards solving some  of the problems associated with complex real-world automated  surface finishing operations in the industry. Besides advancing  the fundamental knowledge in control theory and its  applications, experiments conducted on the proposed equipment  will also prepare students for industrial employment with added  training in mechatronics, i.e., integration of system dynamics,  control theory, process dynamics and real-time control  implementation.",
