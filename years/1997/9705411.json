This  new research program focuses on reduced-dimensional  heat  flow   and   thermal   equilibration  in  nanostructures.   The  investigators  have developed new techniques  for  the  surface  nanomachining of suspended semiconductor structures that enable  the  construction  of  miniature,  thermally-isolated  devices.  These   possess  integral  transducers  permitting  the   local  introduction  of  heat,  and  local  temperature  measurements.  Coupling these with high sensitivity dc SQUID-based methods for  electron  thermometry at millikelvin temperatures is ultimately  expected  to  yield sensitivity sufficient for  exploration  of  energy  exchange processes involving individual quanta. Single-  phonon phenomena, with analogs in classical and quantum optics,  should  become  observable.  Intriguing  possibilities  include  phonon  shot  noise, phonon bunching, anticorrelated  electron-  phonon relaxation, and the phonon-by-phonon energy decay  of  a  quasi-isolated   thermal  reservoir.   With   this   level   of  sensitivity,  calorimetry  experiments  elucidating   processes  involving individual atoms and molecules are also possible.  %%%    Calorimetry and Thermal Transport at the Quantum Limit.  This  new research program focuses on the question of how  heat  flows   in   extremely  small  objects,  i.e.   nanostructures.  Ultrasmall   systems  can  behave  as  if  they  are   reduced-  dimensional  (i.e.,  less than 3D).  At low  temperatures,  for  systems   that  are  small  enough,  heat  flow   and   thermal  equilibration  will  ultimately  occur  by  the   exchange   of  individual  energy quanta. This domain, where heat transfer  is  \"granular\" (delivered quanta-by-quanta rather than as a  steady  flow)  remains  completely unexplored. A complete understanding  of   these  issues  will  become  crucial  with  the  continued  miniaturi zation  of  devices leading to  nanotechnology.  These  studies  are now possible through new nanomachining  techniques  developed  by  the  investigators,  allowing  the  creation  of  suspended,  ultrasmall  semiconductor  structures  with  three-  dimensional  relief  --  with on-board  electronic  measurement  circuitry.  Among possible applications of this research, these  experiments  should  enable  direct  observation  of  the  heat  evolved during chemical reactions involving *individual*  atoms  and   molecules.  The  devices  developed  should  also   offer  unprecedented  sensitivity  for  measurement  of  optical   and  infrared radiation.  ***",
