 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goal of this project is to establish a research  Center for Distributed Computing:  Theory, Development and  Applications.  This is a collaborative effort between  Florida A&M University (FAMU) and Florida International  University (FIU), both members of the State University  System (SUS) of Florida.  The proposed center would  integrate education with research in the areas of Science,  Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology (SMET) to enable  FAMU and FIU to conduct increase minority participation in  SMET disciplines and promote minority participation in  quality research activities.    FAMU and FIU are in a unique position to establish this  center.  FAMU's student population is 90% African-American  and that of FIU is 60% Hispanic.  FAMU and FIU both have  graduate programs in the related fields and FIU offers a  doctoral program in Computer Science.    The specific objectives of this project are:    I.   increase the number of minority students majoring and    graduating in SMET;    II.  strengthen the research capabilities of FAMU and FIU at    departmental levels; and    III.      increase the number of minority students pursuing    advanced degrees in SMET.    This proposal outlines a plan to use research as a tool to  improve the enrollment of minority students at the graduate  and undergraduate levels in SMET.  These objectives will be  achieved by upgrading the research capabilities at FAMU and  FIU; recruiting regional high school SMET students,  retaining these students and involving them in research.  By  meeting the above objectives, this project will increase  minority scientists and practitioners in SMET.",
