 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617477  Rinaldi    In this grant, two- and three-dimensional nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) triple techniques (together with isotropic  labeling in some cases) are being used to study problems in  polymer structure, polymer formation and degradation  mechanisms, and polymer reactivity.  Methods which have been  used for years in structural biology are being adapted for  application in polymer science and new methods are being  developed which are uniquely suited for the study of  polymers.  These methods allow selective probing of the  structure and transformations which occur in one small part  of a large molecule without interference from the signals  from the rest of the molecule.  %%%  These techniques are being used to study the structure of  polymer block junctions, polymer chain ends and defects, and  the mechanisms of various polymer reactions.  A knowledge of  these structures provides valuable insight into polymer  formation and stability.  The materials being studied are  important for the manufacture of rubber products, plastics,  semiconductors, and biomedical engineering materials.  ***",
