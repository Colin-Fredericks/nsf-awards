 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biology graduates an average of 75 students per year, 11 of whom are typically preservice teachers and 24 of whom are seeking careers in environmental biology.  Additionally, several inservice teachers enroll in summer field courses and environmental biology workshops.  The number of students in the environmental biology program has increased dramatically over the past several years, and the department is now deficient with respect to the number and variety of environmental courses offered and the equipment supporting these courses.  This project modernizes the environmental and ecological curriculum with a major infusion of investigative field and laboratory research into the course activities.  The major objective of the project is to equip the field station (TLES) with modern ecological and environmental biology equipment for undergraduate student use.  The TLES is a teaching and research facility, established with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and located 3.2 km from the main campus.  The new equipment allows students to use a variety of modern ecological research techniques as they ask and answer important ecological questions.  Additionally, with an equipped field station so close to the main campus, the department can provide invaluable field experience for environmental biology students and preservice teachers as part of the regular curriculum.  Ultimately, the university produces better trained individuals for today's very competitive field of environmental biology and produces preservice teachers with better field training who may eventually transpire into more field activities in the high school biology curricula within the Inland Northwest.  Additionally, students gain more experience designing and conducting studies and analyzing and presenting their own data, which has similar beneficial impacts.  *",
