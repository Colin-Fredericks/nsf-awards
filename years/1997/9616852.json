 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Thomas P. Fehlner, Department of Chemistry, University of Notre Dame,   is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   of the Chemistry Division for the synthesis of new clusters containing   both main-group and transition-metal atoms. The project is a three   pronged investigation. The first part will explore the chemistry of   chromaborane and related clusters where electron delocalizion can occur   throughout the cluster network. The chemistry of these compounds will be   used to define the reactive sites on the clusters, which will then be   related to the clusters' electronic structure. Second, efficient   synthetic routes, which begin from known monocyclopentadienyl metal   complexes,  will be developed for dimetallaboranes containing a wide   ranging of metals. Thirdly, these dimetallaboranes will be used as   ligands to low valent metal fragments in order to form polymetallic   species where a transition metal cluster serves as a complex ligand.   The chemistry of the transition metals when combined with carbon   containing substituents is the basis of the vast field of organometallic   chemistry. Research in this area has led to many advances in pure and   applied chemistry. This project aims to open a related area in which   transition metals are combined with units containing boron. Preliminary   results indicate that these  `metallaboranes` will possess an extensive   chemistry that in some  ways resembles organometallic chemistry, but in   other ways is very different. In this investigation new combinations of   boranes and transition metals will be prepared and their chemistry   investigated. The new compounds will express the unique aspects of their   electronic structures in new kinds of reaction chemistry.",
