In the case of the semi-autonomous respiratory  organelle, the mitochondrion, this process is more  complicated because, in order for progeny cells to be  respiratory competent, both the organelle and its genome  must be accurately transmitted.  Although it is widely  accepted that during cell division the partitioning of  mitochondria is an active process dependent on the  cytoskeleton, one fundamental question  that remains  unanswered is what additional mechanisms are required for  the partitioning and distribution of mitochondrial DNA  (mtDNA) both within the organelle and to daughter cells.  The long term goal of the proposed work is to determine the  cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for mtDNA  inheritance.  These questions will be addressed using the  simple eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast).  From a wealth of genetic data obtained using this organism,  it is clear that mtDNA inheritance is a non-random process.  The ability to visualize both the organelle and mtDNA in  vivo, and the opportunity to combine both genetic and  biochemical approaches to understanding function, make S.  cerevisiae an excellent model system for examining the  cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in mitochondrial  inheritance.    It has recently been shown that when S.  cerevisiae haploid cells fuse, mitochondrial fusion also  occurs and a single, continuous dynamic mitochondrial  reticulum is created in the zygote.  While mitochondrial  matrix proteins are able to freely diffuse within this  reticulum, the diffusion of inner membrane-associated mtDNA  is severely restricted.  Although the movement of mtDNA  within the organelle is restricted, mtDNA does enter  emerging buds with the mitochondria.  Elucidating the  molecular mechanisms underlying mtDNA limited diffusion is  critical to understanding the exact mechanisms for mtDNA  inheri tance.  The specific aims of this proposal are  directed at further characterizing this mechanism and at  identifying and determining the mechanisms of action of the  proteins in S. cerevisiae that mediate mtDNA inheritance.  Specifically, mtDNA movement within cells will be  characterized by time lapsed imaging of a fluorescently  tagged mtDNA-binding protein.  The molecular components  responsible for the limited diffusion and segregation of  mtDNA will be identified using both genetic and biochemical  approaches.  Conditional mutants that are unable to stably  maintain the mitochondrial genome during mitosis will be  isolated.  The mtDNA-protein complexes will be purified and  characterized biochemically.  Associated proteins will be  identified using tandem mass spectrometry.  The role of  these proteins in mtDNA segregation will be determined using  genetic, biochemical, and microscopic approaches.        When cells divide, the various essential components (genes,  cytoplasm, organelles) of the cell must be apportioned among  the two daughter cells.  In the case of the mitochondrion,  the organelle possesses its own genome (in the form of  multiple copies of mitochondrial DNA), and this must also be  apportioned.  Prior work has shown that the mtDNA  distributes non-randomly, suggesting that mechanisms exist  to somehow tether the DNA so that the copies do not intermix  spatially within the organelle.  This project will shed  light on just how this occurs.  ***",
