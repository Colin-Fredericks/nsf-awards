 "awd_abstract_narration": "Asuru  9724040    Technical Abstract:  This minority research planning grant is aimed at laying the groundwork for a full proposal that would focus on the role of eIF-2B in the regulation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells.  Specifically, a mammalian expression system will be developed to study the role of phosphorylation of the largest subunit of eIF-2B in controlling protein synthesis.  The cDNA for this subunit will be cloned and transfected into COS-7 cells. The cDNA currently in hand is incomplete, and the full length cDNA will be constructed using restriction enzymes.  A 2-D gel electrophoresis system will be developed that will allow the characterization of the phosphorylation states of eIF-2B. Preliminary data will be  developed for a competitive grant proposal.     Non-Technical Abstract:  Protein synthesis in higher animals and plants is regulated by a group of proteins called initiation factors.  This project focuses on characterizing one initiation factor, eIF-2 alpha.  EIF-2 alpha mediates the inhibition of protein synthesis in response to environmental stresses such as viral infection, heavy metal exposure, nutrient deprivation and heat shock.  This research could lead to a better understanding of  regulation of protein synthesis during stress.",
