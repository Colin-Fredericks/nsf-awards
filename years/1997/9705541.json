The principal investigator is Dr. Meilin Liu of the Georgia Institute of Technology. The objective of the research is to develop ceramic membranes based on mixed ionic-electronic conductors for methane conversion. Lanthanum-ferrate materials are primarily considered as candidate systems. The research will involve studies of methane conversion kinetics, characterizations of product distributions, and characterizations of membrane microstructure and transport properties.    These studies have the potential to develop materials that will facilitate the electrocatalytic conversion of methane to cleaner fuels, to higher-valued hydrocarbons, or to other transportable liquid products to reduce transportation costs. In addition, the acquired knowledge will advance our ability to design new materials for related applications, such as electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells using natural gas as fuels, solid-state gas sensors for monitoring and control of  combustion processes, and the removal of noxious pollutants from combustion exhausts.  Successful development of new materials for these applications will therefore have significant impact on energy efficiency, environmental quality, and a new generation of vehicles powered by cleaner fuels or fuel cells.",
