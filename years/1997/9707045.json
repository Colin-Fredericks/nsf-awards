 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sawyer  9707045       The investigator develops statistical tests for detecting  gene conversion.  Gene conversion is any process in biology that  causes a segment of DNA to be copied to another DNA segment.  Gene  conversion is an important process in evolution, and also has  consequences for human health.  For example, it can cause the  transference of pathogenic traits between bacteria and parts of  viral genomes between viruses.  Statistical tests for detecting  gene conversion in aligned DNA or amino acid sequences are  studied and extended.  Particular emphasis is given to permutation  or permutation-like tests that can evaluate unusually long  segments on which two sequences are similar, or else on which a  single sequence is unusually divergent. (This includes tests of  Karlin-Altschul type, which are faster to perform but are not as  accurate as permutation tests.) Some specific aims of the  proposal are: (i) to extend these tests to allow occasional  mismatches and alignment gaps by finding high-scoring segments  for a similarity score rather than segment length, (ii) develop  ways to improve the power and effectiveness of these tests, (iii)  compare statistical procedures for detecting gene conversion in  regards to efficiency and power, and (iv) make the resulting  improved software available to the biological community on a Web  site.       Human HIV and influenza viruses belong to a family of  viruses (RNA retroviruses) that not only are highly changeable,  but can also exchange pieces of genetic material among  themselves.  Viruses that can exchange blocks of genetic material  are more dangerous since the more adaptive parts of the virus can  spread rapidly, and since vaccines that target only part of the  virus can become rapidly obsolete.  There are also several  families of plant viruses in this viral family that cause damage  to food crops of economic importance.  The project extends a  statistical test that can detect a history of such exchanges from  a sample of genetic sequ ences and assign measures of statistical  likelihood to the most likely events.  This will help to  understand the nature of the evolution of these particular  viruses.  The work extends earlier work of the investigator that  looked for possible exchange events in aligned DNA sequences  under the assumption that the exchanged material had not  undergone later mutation.  This assumption does not hold for these  highly mutable viruses.  In addition, recent work has shown that  the earlier test has biases in some of its procedures that can  hide evidence for some exchange (or gene conversion) events.  This  bias is removed.  Finally, computer software that implements the  improved procedures, including listing the most likely exchange  events and their statistical likelihood, is made more available  on the internet for the biological community. (Software that  implements the earlier procedures has been widely used.)",
