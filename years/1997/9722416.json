The project is build around research designed  to understand the behavior and neural basis of hygienic  behavior in honey bees. Hygienic behavior is a mechanism is  a defense against a parasitic mite and a mechanism of  disease resistance in which bees identify and remove  parasitized and diseased brood from the hive. This project  examines the behavior expressed by bees, identifies the  sensory cues they use to trigger the behavior, and  investigates the nervous system mechanisms that control its  expression. Undergraduate students participate in research  projects ranging from practical bee breeding to behavioral  and neurobiological experiments in the laboratory.  Understanding the factors that regulate hygienic behavior in  honey bees, vital pollinators in may parts of the world  including agricultural areas, is critical as beekeepers  search for bees with natural defenses against diseases and  mites with the goal of reducing antibiotic and pesticide  application.",
