The Center has been funded by the National Science Foundation since 1998.  The research has been highly productive with more than $2 million in annual support from its industrial and governmental partners.  Some of the research topics at the Center are fundamentals of sol-gel film formation, ceramics with controlled pore size, liquid routes to supported dense mixed metal oxide membranes, synthesis of dielectric ceramics with controlled microstructure, aerosol synthesis of ceramics, etc.  The objectives of the Center are to develop new technology for microengineered ceramics, to transfer technology to industry for commercial development, to educate students for the materials science industry, to assist the development of high-tech companies through the small business innovative research programs (SBIR), especially in the state of New Mexico.  The undergraduate students are involved in the research activities of the Center with faculty mentors in teams of graduate and undergraduate students.",
