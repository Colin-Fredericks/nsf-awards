The  classification of 2-dimensional manifolds provides a model of the kind  of classification sought for 3-manifolds.  A crucial step in the  classification problem was completed by J. H. Rubinstein in 1992, when  he described an algorithm to decide if a given 3-manifold was  homeomorphic to the 3-sphere, the \"simplest\" 3-manifold.  His  arguments used minimal surface theory in the context of a triangulated  3-manifold.  There is a deep connection between this type of minimal  surface theory and the notion of thin position for knots in the  3-sphere, an idea introduced by D. Gabai.  This interplay between  standard knot theory and minimal surface theory provides significant  new techniques to explore outstanding problems.  This project explores  two particular applications of these techniques.  The first is the  extension of the standard 1-parameter idea of thin position for a knot  to multi-parameter families.  These extensions are used to approach  some long-standing problems in knot theory.  Connections between  multi-parameter thin position and other well-known invariants, such as  the energy of a knot, another notion of efficient imbedding, are also  described.  The second application is to a new type of irreducibility  for Heegaard splittings that divides splittings into two groups, one  of which is atoroidal.  The techniques will be used to seek injective  immersed surfaces in one group and negatively curved metrics in the  other.       People originally thought the earth was flat.  This was a reasonable  hypothesis, arrived at by considering the local information available  at the time.  Similarly, by considering the local information  available to us, we might hypothesize that the spatial universe we  live in is 3-dimensional Euclidean space.  Evidence from physics makes  th is unlikely.  The question then is, what is the 3-dimensional shape  of the universe we live in?  Is it the 3-dimensional analog of the  sphere?  Perhaps -- but here we encounter a deep mathematical problem.  Unlike 2-dimensional spaces, which are well-understood, there is no  list of all 3-dimensional spaces.  So we don't even understand what  the possibilities are for the shape of the 3-dimensional universe.  Perhaps the most important problem in low-dimensional topology today  is to find such a list.  This project uses the interplay between new  minimization techniques from piecewise linear geometry and knot theory  to explore aspects of this problem.  ***",
