 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lars Wahlbin    Abstract    It is proposed to work on several problems in the numerical analysis of  finite element methods for partial differential and integral  equations.  A. Maximum-norm estimates for finite element methods in second order  hyperbolic problems: In contrast to the situation for elliptic and  parabolic problems, the theory in the case of hyperbolic problems is  very incomplete.  B. Superconvergence in finite element methods: The main problem is to  ascertain when (and when not) superconvergence holds up to boundaries.  C. Finite element methods in problems with anisotropic diffusion: In  the singularly perturbed case, very little is known.  D. Finite element methods in partial integro-differential equations:  The main problem lies with enormous memory and work requirements in  problems with an integral-type memory term.        It has been estimated that 2/3 of all computer runs involving  approximation of scientific or engineering models are useless: not  because they are necessarily wrong but because you do not know that  they are right and so cannot trust them. This is particularly annoying  when you are formulating a new model and want to find its predictions  to test against reality. You do not know whether a peculiar prediction  is inherent in the model or crept in via a faulty computer simulation  of it.  The present proposal is aimed at investigating how a selection of  widely used simulation methods behave on mathematical problems with  various quirks. It will thus give guidelines to people using numerical  methods and help them in judging whether a particular series of  computer runs is reliable or not in representing a scientific model.",
