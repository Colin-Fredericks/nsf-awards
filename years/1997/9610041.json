 "awd_abstract_narration": "9610041  Penner       The decorated Teichmueller theory of punctured surfaces gives a  new point of view on the classical Teichmueller theory, and there are,  moreover, connections between this work and the string theory of  high-energy physics.  There has also evolved from this a rich  geometric theory of the space of right cosets of the Moebius group in  the group of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle  (which is our model of a universal Teichmueller space) as well as a  sensible universal mapping class group, which turns out to be  isomorphic to the (Richard) Thompson group.  There are also different  and interesting applications of this universal theory to various  seemingly disparate topics in algebraic number theory (such as Markov  tuples, the Gauss product of quadratic forms, and Grothendieck's  version of absolute Galois theory, for instance).  Current research  aims to develop these ideas further and pursue a deeper study of these  connections.       There are important and venerable questions in mathematics  about the space T(S) of all possible geometric structures on a fixed  two-dimensional surface S.  Imagine taking a surface (like the surface  of a balloon, for instance) and pricking a hole in it; the hole, i.e.,  the missing point, is called a puncture, and there are special  techniques developed over the last decade or so for studying the space  T(S) of geometric structures on a punctured surface S.  Remarkably  enough, various quantities in the string theory of particle physics  are given by explicit geometric invariants of these spaces T(S) for  punctured surfaces S.  Moreover, these techniques lead to new insights  about various classical mathematical constructions in number theory,  and this project's research emphasis lies in these algebraic  applications.  ***",
