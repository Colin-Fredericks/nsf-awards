In the fall of 1994, 17 holes  were  drilled  in  the 200 meter diameter TAG active  hydrothermal  mound  on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge during Leg 158 of the Ocean  Drilling  Program to investigate the fluid flow, geochemical  fluxes,  and the subsurface nature of an active hydrothermal  mound.   This  mound is perhaps the closest mid-ocean  ridge  analog  to Cyprus ore bodies and has an estimated convective  heat  flux  from the black smokers of 225 MW, and  from  the  entire  mound area of 500-1000 MW.  Theoretical calculations  will  be carried out to examine the relationships among  the  different fluids exiting the mound, and to examine the  role  of  seawater  entrainment at TAG, including  the  amount  of  seawater entrained, and what imprint such entrainment leaves  in   the   deposits,  and  in  fluids  exiting  the   mound.  Calculations  of transport and reaction will also  be  done,  allowing establishment of links between fluid chemistry  and  observed  mineralogy and texture of drillcore samples.   The  emphasis will be on modeling processes occurring during  the  most recent phase of hydrothermal activity, i.e., related to  (i)  formation  of anhydrite (CaSO4) veins, (ii)  alteration  and mineralization associated with veining, (iii) deposition  of  chimneys  and sulfide crusts at the mound  surface,  and  (iv) formation of fluids currently exiting the mound.  These  studies  will  allow  quantification  of  mass  fluxes   and  examination  of  processes involved in  mineral  deposition,  zoning,  and  zone  refinement in one of the  largest  known  active hydrothermal mounds along the mid-ocean ridge sys tem.",
