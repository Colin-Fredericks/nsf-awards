 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robert W. Field of The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is supported   by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program  to further develop and   exploit molecular quantum defect theory (MQDT) in an ongoing effort to   investigate scaling (with n*, l and ml) in molecular electronic   spectroscopy.  Specifically, he will use Stark switching spectroscopy to   study core non-penetrating molecular Rydberg states or two-color   resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization to study the core-penetrating   Rydberg series of alkaline earth monohalides. Initially, he will focus on   relatively simple systems such as the alkaline earth monohalides, then   gravitate to more complex systems including larger polyatomic molecules.    His overall objective is to exploit, uncover, and test unconventional   models which might eventually describe the electronic structure and   dynamics of entire families of molecules:  all properties, all states,   all dynamical processes.    A few comments about the practical significance of these experiments are   warranted.  Why should we care about the electric multipole moments of   cations?  All +1 cations have the same monopole, so this dominant aspect   of the interaction of the cation with the outside world is independent of   the molecule.  Ion-specific long-range interactions, on the other hand,   derive from the higher multipoles (and their normal coordinate   displacement derivatives).  These multipoles and derivatives control the   mechanisms and rates of resonant long-range ion-molecule, ion-electron,   and possibly ion-surface energy and angular momentum exchange.  The   information obtainable from systematic studies of core-nonpenetrating   Rydberg states would yield valuable insights into a wide variety of   processes occurring in plasmas.",
