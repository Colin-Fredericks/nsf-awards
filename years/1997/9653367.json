 "awd_abstract_narration": "The modern workplace needs more mathematically and technologically literate graduates in introductory college mathematics and calculus than it is receiving. To address this need, a consortium of five New Mexico community colleges and the state's mathematics association of two-year colleges created the New Mexico Initiative for Math Reform. The project is designed to help improve student learning in introductory college mathematics and calculus through mathematics reform and technology.  Classroom intervention is being achieved by increasing and continuing the professional development of regional mathematics faculty member in the ways of mathematics reform and use of computer classrooms to implement reform.         The method of operation is the recursive application of sessions and workshops in which the participants, after acquiring and honing the techniques of mathematics reform, fan out across the region and host their own workshops. This iteration of workshops ensures an \"exponential delivery\" of the material. The region to be serviced is New Mexico and adjacent areas of its bordering states. The partners are the Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute, New Mexico Military Institute, New Mexico State University at Alamogordo, New Mexico State University at Dona Ana, University of New Mexico at Valencia, San Juan Community College, and one professional organization, New Mexico Mathematical Association of Two Year Colleges. The impact is on the students of introductory college mathematics and calculus. The project has the potential of reaching every such student in the New Mexican region. The project is being evaluated with the aid of an outside investigator both formatively and summatively. The results of the project are being disseminated by the participants themselves through their own workshops, by presentations to professional organizations such as the American Association of  Two Year Colleges, and by publications in scholarly journals.",
