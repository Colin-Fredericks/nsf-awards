 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to enhance the electromagnetics and communications (EMC) curriculum.  This goal is accomplished by incorporating electromagnetic compatibility concepts and measurement principles more fully into the undergraduate curriculum; providing students with real-world practical experience in using state-of-the-art equipment; and providing students with the opportunity to carry out both individual and group projects that include design, implementation, simulation, and EMC testing.    The project improves three existing courses (Introduction to Engineering Electromagnetics, Electromagnetic Waves, and Communication Systems) by incorporating EMC-related experiments.  It also develops a new advanced Electromagnetic Compatibility course.  In the laboratory portion of the course, students conduct the following experiments and measurements: signal spectra; time- and frequency-domain measurements; surface and common-mode currents; radiated and conducted emissions; and immunity testing.  An integral part of the course is a design project.  Students have the opportunity to design, simulate, test for EMC compliance, and redesign their devices, if necessary.    To offer hands-on experience to the 80 to 90 students per year who enroll in these courses, the project requests a G-TEM cell, a spectrum analyzer, a signal generator, a power amplifier, a line impedance stabilization network, and an EM modeling software package.  Results of this project can be disseminated through the publication of a laboratory manual, presentation at EMC symposiums, and technical papers in IEEE Transaction in Education and Transactions of American Society of Engineering Education.   *",
