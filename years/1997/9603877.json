This  project will examine three potential mechanisms for  achieving isoform-dependent variation.  The importance of  tertiary interactions between the C-terminus and residues 26-  36 will be examined in select site-specific PV variants --  employing differential scanning calorimetry, Ca2+-binding  measurements, titration calorimetry, and 15N NMR relaxation  measurements.  To assess the impact of overall electrostatic  free energy on metal ionbinding behavior, the consequences  of the S55D and G98D mutations on Ca2+- and Mg2+- binding  affinity will be examined in PV isoforms differing widely in  their isoelectric points.  Finally, the minimal sequence  requirements for the metal ion-facilitated association of  CPV3, an avian -PV, will be examined.  The energetics of  complexation will be investigated by analytical  ultracentrifugation and scanning calorimetry.  Low-  resolution structural information on the trimer will be  obtained by antibody reactivity and chemical crosslinking  studies.  Detailed structural data will be obtained via x-  ray crystallography and/or NMR.    Contemporary protein research seeks to identify the physical  principles that dictate protein structure and function.  The  parvalbumins offer an attractive system for examining these  issues.  The vertebrate-specific family of small Ca2+  binding proteins illustrates the application of the same  basic protein architecture to the solution of distinct  biological problems -PVs play a rather passive role in  maintaining cytosolic Ca2+ levels below the toxic threshold.  By contrast, in higher vertebrates, -PVs are utilized for  highly specialized signaling roles.  This functional  variation is accompanied by corresponding variation in  physical properties.  For example, -PVs display greater  structural rigidity than -PVs.  Thus, one objective of this  project is to investigate the molecular basis  for this  difference.  Additionally, whereas all -PVs  bind Ca2+ very  tightly, the -PVs display highly variable affinity for the  ion.  Therefore, a second objective of this project is to  assess the impact of the overall charge on metal ion-binding  properties.  Lastly, although parvalbumins are widely viewed  as non-associating monomeric proteins, the avian -PV CPV3  forms a trimeric complex in the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+.  Thus, a third goal of this project is to identify the  structural idiosyncrasies responsible for this self-  complementarity. This work will illuminate demonstrably  successful strategies for tailoring the physical stability  and ligand-binding properties of macromolecules through  subtle sequence alterations.  The knowledge gained from  these studies may assist in achieving the long-term goal of  manipulating existing biological activities and designing  new ones.",
