 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Planning Grant is supported by the Analytical and  Surface Chemistry Program.  Professor Zoski is spending a  sabbatical initiating a collaboration with Professor Dana R. Kester  of the Graduate School of Oceanography at the Narragansett Bay  Campus of the University of Rhode Island.  During this time she is  learning the special requirements of doing analytical chemistry in  a marine environment together with her students.  This project will  focus on fabricating microelectrodes and microsensors and  characterizing their function under real marine environmental  conditions.  These electrodes will be compared with commercially  available sensors for analytes such as oxygen that employ membranes  to protect against fouling.  The behavior of bare metal  microelectrodes in marine samples will be characterized using a  sequence of applied potential pulses designed to clean and activate  the metal surface and then analyze for specific analytes.  The  course of this applied work will be guided by fundamental  theoretical work, the PI's area of expertise, throughout this  project.     This work focusses on the development of microelectrodes and  microsensors that can be used in the complex matrices found in  marine aquatic samples.  Theoretical and experimental work will be  used together to characterize the analytical responses of these  electroanalytical probes so that robust, real-time systems can be  developed and used for marine chemical analysis.  Professor Zoski  and her students at the University of Rhode Island will begin a  collaboration with Professor Kester at the university's Graduate  School of Oceanography that will result in more reliable analytical  information about the chemistry of marine environments.",
