 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Research Council's Center for Science, Mathematics. and Engineering Education (The Center) proposes to undertake for the National Science Foundation a project that would examine the need, options, and issues in establishing a digital National Library for Undergraduate Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology (SME&T) Education (hereafter referred to as the \"National Library\").  The purpose of such a library would be to provide a comprehensive, dynamic, and readily accessible and searchable collection of high-quality educational material in undergraduate science, mathematics, and engineering education that is intended to facilitate and enhance the NSF's programs to improve and evaluate undergraduate teaching and learning.    To facilitate the work of the NSF, the NRC will assess the strategy, and potential effectiveness for the Foundation to develop a National Library.  The proposed NRC project will produce a consensus report of findings and recommendations concerning the need for a digital National Library for Undergraduate SME&T Education, and the options, timeline, and components that will be important for planning a National Library. First, background papers on key subjects by acknowledged experts will be commissioned to provide state-of-the-art surveys of current opportunities for establishing a National Library and the challenges that NSF must confront if the Foundation decides to fund the National Library.  Second, these papers will be presented and discussed at a two-day workshop to be attended by individuals with technical expertise in digital libraries, representatives from the federal agencies sponsoring national library projects, college/university faculty and students, and representatives from the corporate sector.  Third, workshop proceedings will be developed to summarize the outcome of the workshop and offer recommendations about the feasibility and logistics for developing a National Library for undergraduate SME&T education.  The proceedings will be delivere d to the Foundation in mid-September, 1997.",
