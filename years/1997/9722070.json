This conference should provide an increased awareness of protein deposition as a process that is not only biologically relevant but also exhibits significant molecular structure and specificity. The focus is on protein aggregation and other manifestations of protein-protein interactions, e.g., domain swapping. A main thrust of the conference is on folding and aggregation of polypeptide backbones using state of the art methodology. The conference will be attended by a maximum of 160 participants.  The topics are mainly fundamental in nature.    This meeting will bring together biologists familiar with the biology of  protein aggregation and assembly  processes in order to understand the molecular biology and biophysical basis of these phenomena. The format of the FASEB Summer Research Conferences is ideal for stimulating cross-fertilization in developing areas of research.",
