 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9619306  Chowdhury    Changes in the utility operating structure, increased competition in a deregulated environment, lower  margins of stability and constrained expansion plans are all trends that point to future   developments that should provide ample challenge for engineers throughout the industry, On the other  hand, advances in power electronics, computer science and microprocessor technology are  opening doors for power engineers to provide practical solutions to problems.  Expanded automation  of transmission and distribution systems will be an important key to making the best use of  utility resources in the future.  The development of semiconductor devices for high voltage, high   current applications, the so-called second silicon revolution, is already bringing about   fundamental changes in industrial equipment and utility networks, The intent of the proposed project  is to steer the power engineering curriculum to meet these new challenges.  The overall objectives are  to form a coalition of industry practitioners and academic personnel to examine long-term educational  needs in the power engineering discipline.  The plans will include (1) curriculum changes to   incorporate changing trends in the industry, (2) new educational tools, such as simulators and   innovative software for computation and visualization, (3) computer-aided laboratory exercises,  (4) computer-enhanced classroom lectures, (5) creating active learning environment by introducing  concepts of learning-by-doing, (6) involving the community colleges in distance courses, and (7)  involving high schools students in summer programs.  We firmly believe that there is a need to teach more breadth of topics and spread the topics in power engineering over a number of courses outside of the core power courses.  Learning can be enhanced if the application of a specific concept ties sub-disciplines of electrical engineering together.  We need the cooperation of industry representatives who can guide us to implement progra ms that are practical and useful.  The deliverables in this project will include software that are appropriate for student use in labs and classroom; the design of a simulator for studying the performance of FACTS devices; and the methodology of the course restructuring process.",
