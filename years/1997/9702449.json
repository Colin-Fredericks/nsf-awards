 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Plan:  The second roundtable on the state of the Internet in September  1996 stated that the evolution of the Internet will follow   three paths: multimedia, multicast, and mobility. This project   combines two of the three evolution paths: multicast and mobility.    Laptop and palmtop computers are now available at affordable   prices; studies indicate that laptop computers are currently   35% of computer sales. With the explosive interest in   laptop computers, there is now the desire for continuous Internet   access no matter where users are. In other words, users desire an   Internet version of the cellular telephone.     Multicasting capability (transmitting a message to a group   of hosts instead of a single host) are an important facility   on the Internet. Thousands of users currently obtain data from   the MBONE or multicast backbone through its numerous multicasting   applications (e.g., video-conferencing system). Furthermore, since   a multicasting facility is part of the next version of the   Internet Protocol (IPv6), even more users will begin using   multicasting applications on a regular basis.     This project concerns both mobility and multicasting. The Internet   Engineering Task Force lists multicasting as a desired service   in our future mobile environment. However, the current   Internet protocol for mobile hosts does not handle multicasting   and the current Internet multicasting protocol does not transmit  messages to mobile hosts. This project is to develop protocols   that will allow mobile hosts to transmit and receive multicast   messages in the Internet efficiently.     For more information, see  http://cs.ua.edu/faculty/camp/camp.html/mobi-arch.html    Education Plan:  The education aspect of this project revolves around the ``women in  computing'' issue. Over the past year, we have been exploring gender   issues in computer science, since the decreasing percentages of   women in our field is discouraging. During this project, we will   initiate programs a t the university and in the community to try   to reduce the decreasing female trend that we are seeing in   our field.
