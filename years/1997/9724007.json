 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724007  Johnston  This proposal concerns mechanisms of olfactory perception  and  communication, particularly with regard to competition  between individuals  by scent marking.  Most mammals communicate their individual  identity  and other information by scent marking, and many species  that scent mark  also scent over-mark (deposit their scent in the same  location that other  individuals have deposited scent).  It has recently been  discovered that, in  at least two species of rodents, individuals can determine  which of two  individuals' scents is on top in an over-mark, regardless of  whether the two  scents are completely or only partially overlapping.  Animals can thus  determine which animal has marked most recently.  The data  suggest:  (1) that the animals have a perceptual/cognitive strategy to  determine which scent was deposited most recently; and (2)  that they have  some previously unsuspected sensory mechanisms to accomplish  this.  In this research, behavioral experiments will be carried out  to investigate the  functions of these extraordinary abilities, particularly  with regard to the  related hypotheses that (a) individuals engage in scent  marking  competitions in order to maintain their scent as the most  recent scent in  an area and (b) that other individuals evaluate scent over-  marks as one  means of assessing the quality of potential mates.  Specifically, females  may prefer males that are persistent at over-marking because  this is a  measure of male vigor and quality.  These experiments will  involve both  typical laboratory tests using habituation-discrimination  methods and other  experiments using semi-natural laboratory enclosures to  approximate the  complexity of natural situations. In the specific context of  the sense of smell  and its role in animal behavior, this research will clarify  the significance of  a newly discovered ability to analyze spatial arrays of  individual scents and  determine which scent is on top (that is, to perceive  \"depth\" or recen cy in  arrays of individual odors).  This perceptual ability  probably occurs in  many species and is potentially important in a wide range of  situations.  Our research aims to determine why such abilities have  evolved, and to  investigate the specific hypothesis that they are important  in evaluation  of the health, vigor, and quality of other individuals and  thereby  influence mate choice and competitive interactions. This  project integrates  mechanistic and functional approaches to olfactory  communication.  In a more general context, this research demonstrates some  of the  higher-order mechanisms involved in social perception and  characterizes in  a unique way the kinds of sophisticated processes animals  may use to  evaluate one another.  Such higher-order knowledge of other  individuals are  widespread throughout the animal kingdom,  which in turn  suggests that this  kind of evaluation of others has been important in the  evolution of complex  social behavior necessary for complex social organization.  Understanding  this kind of higher-order social cognition is necessary if  we are to truly  understand both the evolution of social communication and  the neural  mechanisms underlying social recognition, social memory, and  social  behavior in animals and in humans.",
