 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704135  Thurston       This project is a multi-pronged investigation into low-dimensional  geometry and topology with the central long-range goal of supporting  and establishing the Geometrization Conjecture, namely, that every  3-dimensional manifold has a canonical decomposition into pieces with  locally homogeneous Riemannian metrics.  The first of these prongs is  an investigation, partially aided by computer, of geometric Dehn filling  spaces for 3-manifolds.  Geometric Dehn fillings interpolate between  manifolds with distinct topology.  A suitable variation of this idea  has the potential to connect all possible 3-manifolds and equip them  with geometric decompositions.  The second prong is an investigation  of the geometry of taut foliations and essential laminations and their  relationships to hyperbolic structures and other geometric structures.  This approach has the promise to give a common generalization of the  canonical decompositions of surface homeomorphisms developed by Thurston  in 1976, and the geometrization of Haken manifolds developed by Thurston  in the late 1970's and early 1980's.  Additional prongs of this project  involve contact structures, confoliations, and geometric group theory.  In addition, the project will explore connections of low-dimensional  geometry and topology to biology, particularly genetics.       Low-dimensional geometry and topology is a beautiful area of  mathematics that has undergone tremendous growth and transformation over  the last two decades.  Paralleling this internal development of the  subject, lagging slightly behind, has been the external development of  new connections and strengthened connections to other areas of mathematics  and of science.  Some of these connections are direct, like the  cosmological issue of the shape of our universe or the more down-to-earth  issue of the shapes of crystals.  Other connections are indirect, to  diverse topics such as databases, group theory, genetics, or computational  chemistry.  Any topic tha t can be formulated in a quantitative way can be  studied with geometric methods (alongside the more prevalent symbolic,  algebraic and analytic methods), so that in any particular case, the  powerful discoveries and tools of low-dimensional geometry and topology  have a reasonable chance to have a direct bearing.  The aim of this  project is further development of the tools of low-dimensional geometry  and topology to make them more portable, more powerful and more universal.  ***",
