We propose to investigate current hydrologic and thermal processes occurring  in the Siberian Arctic and compare their dynamics to watersheds we have studied in the Alaskan Arctic.  Our approach will be to synthesize hydrologic and meteorologic data collected by Japanese and Russian scientists in two nested watersheds near Tiksi, Russia and apply our spatially distributed coupled model to those watersheds.  Spatially distributed hydrologic models require spatially distributed calibration and verification data.   Collection of this data will be accomplished through utilization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery.  Field ground truth will be collected by us to develop and verify SAR imagery neural network training data sets.  This research will identify the applicability of utilizing SAR imagery for use in developmental and operational hydrologic models in the Russian Arctic.  It will allow us to test and improve the capability of our hydrologic and thermal model in simulating current physical processes and consequently improve the model's forecasting capability.  This research will also improve our understanding of the global hydrologic cycle by improving our understanding of the physical processes occurring in the Siberian Arctic, their variability and their interactions.  Finally, this research will enable a comparative analysis of hydrologic and thermal processes between latitudinally equivalent sites, and also a comparison of our ability to correctly simulate these processes.  This research will also enable an international meld of the GEXEX/GAME and ARCSS/LAII research programs and an international collaboration of Russian, Japanese and American investigators joining forces to share expertise and improve our understanding of processes of inter-continental dimension.",
