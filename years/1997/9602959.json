 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Jerry Moore will conduct two seasons of field survey and excavation in the Bahia San Quintin and Rosario Valley region of Baja California. Covering 630 sq. km. the project area extends from sea level to approximately 500 m. elevation and includes a variety of vegetational zones. Thus the research should provide information which is relevant to understanding the prehistory within other portions of this long peninsula. Given its proximity to the United States and the very extensive archaeological investigation conducted in coastal regions of US southern California, it is surprising that the prehistory of Baja is almost unknown. Therefore it provides an excellent context to examine and attempt to validate patterns observed to the North. There archaeologists have noted that complex - at a hunting and gathering level of subsistence - forms of social organization developed. These were characterized by specialized production of socially significant items such as shell beads and large scale trade networks. Many archaeologists believe that a reliance on stable and productive marine resources is primarily responsible for this phenomenon. However other archaeologists have noted that resources such as shellfish require significant amounts of time to process and prepare for consumption. They also point out that complex societies failed to develop in many other resource rich coastal areas and therefore other important factors must be involved. Baja California with its long coastline and its proximity to southern California makes an excellent venue to address this question.  Dr. Moore's project will address three basic issues: 1. What is the antiquity of coastal adaptations in the region? 2. What is the nature of prehistoric responses to climatic fluctuations over the last ca. 12,000 years? and 3. Given current ethnohistoric and ethnographic data, what were the basic patterns of settlement and subsistence employed in the area. The research will involve: a systematic survey based on a stratified sample of the project area; preparation of detailed site plans; and collection of selected radiocarbon samples to develop a corpus of absolute dates for the region. California State University Dominguez Hills is a multiethnic institution of undergraduate education and the project will serve to introduce students to archaeological field research and, hopefully, encourage them to pursue careers in science.",
