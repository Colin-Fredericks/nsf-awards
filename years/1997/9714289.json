 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714289 Li  This CAA project addresses selective area chemical vapor deposition of GaN and InGaN. The PI is a chemist planning to develop and expand her scientific expertise in the field of epitaxy of III-nitride semiconductor research, which will allow her to bring interdisciplinary approaches and insights to the field. She expects to move into active research fabricating low dimensional structures such as quantum wells, wires and dots and to study the quantum size effect on optical and electrical properties. Her long range goal is to develop new and better materials that have novel properties and potential applications, to advance the understanding of III-V semiconductor materials properties and to contribute to the realization of the full potential of III-nitride as well as other III-V semiconductors in device applications. In this project the correlation of optical properties with defect and impurity distributions will be explored, the selective growth of InGaN films will be carried out on single and dual stripe patterns., and the effect of selective growth on the doping behavior of Si2H6 and Cp2Mg in GaN will be studied as a function of mesa size and geometry. %%% The project addresses materials science and engineering research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuits.  Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving the performance of advanced devices by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials. ***",
