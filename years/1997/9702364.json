 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient Multilevel Methods for Electromagnetic Finite Element Analysis  Finite Element (FE) analysis is very widely used for computer simulation  of electromagnetic fields in various electric machines and devices.  Although  significant progress has been achieved over the last two  decades, considerable computational difficulties remain.  For complex engineering electromagnetic problems, three dimensional FE  meshes often have hundreds of thousands of elements or more and the  computational time may be prohibitively high.  As a result of the  proposed project, the speed of electromagnetic FE analysis will be  increased substantially.  This will be achieved by implementing and  employing  Multilvel Preconditioners.  The computational accuracy will  be significantly improved by using the Fully Adaptive Multigrid  algorithm.  Applications of the proposed methodology to magnetic recording problems  will be explored.  In particular, efficient FE simulation of  multiparticle systems typical for magnetic tapes should  become  possible.  The ultimate goal is to make FE modeling considerably more accurate,  fast and practical for engineering electromagnetic  problems.  This will  facilitate analysis of electric machines, magnetic tapes and recording  heads, and will have important implications for nondestructive testing,  optimization, computer aided design, rapid prototyping, and in other  areas.",
