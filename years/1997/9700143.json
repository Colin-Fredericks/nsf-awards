 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with developing a deeper  understanding of the behavior of systems with multiple tuned  vibration absorbers and to use this knowledge to offer  improved guidelines for the design of absorber systems. From  a fundamental dynamics viewpoint the work concerns the  dynamic response of structures to which are attached  multiple tuned subsystems for the purpose of vibration  attenuation although the focus of research is on  applications to rotating machinery, the techniques developed  are more widely applicable, for example, to translational  vibration absorber systems. In the area of multiple  absorbers, recent results for a special absorber system have  shown that the desired unison motion can become dynamically  unstable, resulting in a drastic reduction in operating  range. The thrust of the analytical portion of the proposed  work will focus on the dynamic performance of more general  multiple absorber systems, including: the dynamic  performance of multiple absorber:systems with general paths  (including: the mistuned circular paths most commonly found  in industrial applications), the effects of imperfections in  the absorber paths, and the effects of rotor flexibility.  this research will significantly expand the knowledge base  for tuned absorbers as applied to rotational systems and  will offer an improved understanding of the dynamics of a  general class of systems which have attached tuned  substructures. Such understanding can be distilled into  improved design guidelines that will include dynamics of a  general class of systems which have attached tuned  substructures. Such understanding can be distilled into  improved design guidelines that will include dynamic  bifurcation's and their effects on system performance.  Exchange of information with  industrial liaisons will be  carried out in order to focus the research in the proper  direction and to transfer the understanding gained by the  proposed research. Specifically, manufactures of automotive  engines (Ford Motor Company) and light aircraft/helicopter  engines (Textron Lycoming) will be kept appraised of the  results of this research and consulted for direction.",
