 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714368  Coffin  Large igneous provinces have been produced by massive accumulations  of basalt produced in the mantle and are represented by features  such as continental flood basalts and ocean plateaus. Although  significant in terms of global geochemical cycling, mantle  convection and cooling, and potentially global climate change,  little is known about the specific processes responsible for  production of such large volumes of mantle melt or their  emplacement at the earth's surface. The present award will support  participation of U.S. scientists in a Japanese led study of the  Ontong Java Plateau in the western Pacific which is one of the best  examples of an oceanic large igneous province. Seismic refraction  and reflection data will be acquired to examine the crustal  structure and history of formation of the Plateau. Dr. Coffin will  have primary responsibility for processing and interpreting seismic  reflection data to be acquired by the Japanese, and will also be  involved in all other aspects of data interpretation and modelling.  Data from the cruise will be used to guide selection of candidate  drill sites for planning by the Ocean Drilling Program.  ***",
