 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oakton Community College is reforming its mathematics offerings by:  (i) applying and assessing effective pedagogical approaches and technologies that meet the needs of a diverse student body; (ii) conforming to a new policy of the Illinois Board Higher Education to raise and align the mathematics standards for students in baccalaureate transfer programs; and (iii) meeting the expressed needs of business and industry to use a learning format that parallels the workplace and emphasizes technology and teamwork.    The goals of the project are to (a) increase students' ability to use software tools to solve realistic problems in a team environment; (b) employ cooperative learning techniques; and (c) increase student enrollment and retention in mathematics classes.  The design includes a variety of teaching and learning techniques including cooperative and experiential learning and visualization techniques within a technologically integrated laboratory/classroom that simulates the academic research or industrial workplace setting.  Undergraduate students team together to work on realistic problems using the Internet, interactive multimedia applications, and Derive to extend their problem-solving capabilities.  Cooperative learning activities are being supported by a laboratory/classroom equipped with notebook computers and TI-92 graphics calculators.    The project's significance exists in the faculty's efforts to develop the use of new pedagogies in mathematics.  These approaches are being shared through traditional and electronic media.  The project also provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to have a rigorous and exciting encounter with mathematics as well as achieve mastery in the use of mathematical applications and technology to solve real-world problems.  *",
