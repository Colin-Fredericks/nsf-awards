Research areas include high-energy physics, materials science simulations, cosmology, protein dynamics, and large non-linear dynamics systems simulation.    Northeastern University plans to include advanced computational techniques involving parallel platforms and languages into existing computational science courses.  One of the PIs of the proposal is also a co-coordinator of Academic Common Experience (ACE) at Northeastern University whereby non-science majors are introduced to science and technology. The high-performance facilities will also be available for use by such students.  Various departments represented in this proposal are active in outreach activities for local high school teachers and students.",
