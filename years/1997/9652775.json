 "awd_abstract_narration": "While design is gaining emphasis in engineering curricula, a disproportionate part of this emphasisis placed on designing new products and processes. In practice, in engineer is faced with an imperfect existing process (or product) far more often than with a requirement to build a new one.    We propose to address this discrepancy between curricula and engineering practice, by developing process-improvement modules to be incorporated in engineering courses ranging from freshman-level through intermediate courses to the capstone design courses. The process improvement modules will be based on industry-inspired case studies, and will be targeted to chemical  engineering for the initial scope of this project.    The instructional modules will cultivate problem-solving strategies that enhance a key ability of an engineer: The ability to examine an existing, operating process or industrial system and identify ways in which it can be improved in the broadest sense (including cost reduction, better quality,  improved reliability or flexibility, etc.), without a complete redesign of the process.    Incremental process improvement is eminently suitable for the freshman or sophomore levels because design-from-scratch is usually complicated by the lack of engineering science background.  Process improvement retains many of the advantages of a design activity but comes in more manageable problems. In incremental improvement, the students have from the outset an entire feasible design (which would be impossible for them to derive on their own without comprehensive engineering-science background).    The instruction mode for identifying and implementing process improvements will involve class discussion much like a meeting of an engineering team. The students will float ideas about process limitations and areas of improvement, and the team discusses the pros and cons of each idea. This enhances the students' ability to constructively participate in meetings and exchange ideas and critiques in that setting.  This will improve communication skills, as well as encourage critical thinking in the context of continuous review and proactive improvement.    The deliverables of the project will be 6 case studies in process improvement, which will be synthesized based on a review of industrial process improvements. The case studies will cover a cross-section of chemical engineering topics and suitable for courses at different levels. Some case  studies will include computer simulations, while others will be suitable for laboratory experimentation. For each case study, we will provide comprehensive information on the initial process and a series of potential improvements, with numerical results, rationale, hints that can be  offered to the students, and class discussion topics.    The introduction of modules in existing core courses (rather than the development of a new course) has the advantage that many more programs (at other institutions) are likely to adopt at least a portion of the modules. The course modules will be promoted in forums that include selected professional conferences, publications of the American Society for Engineering Education (such as Chemical Engineering Education and the Journal of Engineering Education), and the non-profit organization Computer Aids for Chemical Engineering Education.",
