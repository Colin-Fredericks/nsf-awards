 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous research led to the development of a piece of equipment, a transducer, to directly measure dynamic force applied by gibbons and chimpanzees during locomotion by brachiation.  The transducer made it possible to determine that gibbons use a unique mechanical strategy for conserving energy during high speed brachiation.  Coordinated exchange of two kinds of kinetic energy, translational and rotational, is involved in this locomotor strategy.  This newly discovered mechanical exchange strategy appears to be a critical component of true brachiation.  The present project extends the previous research to quantify the passive and active muscular factors that allow this critical energy exchange.  Using the same analytical techniques, the processes of acceleration and deceleration in brachiation will also be studied.  The white-handed gibbon will be compared to the chimpanzee to determine the differences in detailed functional capability and mechanical strategies employed by each species during brachiation.  The new understanding of the mechanical basis of brachiation that will result from this project will permit the determination of the functional limitations and critical design criteria that allow animals to utilize this mode of locomotion.  Comparison of the gibbon to the less specialized chimpanzee will add detailed information on the factors responsible for the production of the brachiation repertoire and its anatomical underpinnings.  This is important for the analysis of locomotion strategies in extant species, and also critical to the evaluation of the functional capabilities of fossil remains.",
