Hasselmo    PROJECT SUMMARY  Computer modeling techniques are required to understand how  neurochemicals with subtle and broadly distributed effects  alter brain function.  In the proposed research, computer  models of the olfactory system (the brain system for odor  perception) will be used to aid in understanding the action  of the neurochemicals acetylcholine and norepinephrine on  the function of cells can affect the processing of odor  memories.    OBJECTIVES  Research will focus on the following central questions:  1. How do the combined effects of noradrenaline and  acetylcholine in the  olfactory system affect the capacity  of memory? Computer simulations will be used to model two  components of the olfactory system: the olfactory bulb and  olfactory cortex.  Models will be used to analyze how  modulation of  inhibitory effects by acetylcholine and  norepinephrine in the olfactory bulb and cortex increases  the number of odor memories that can be stored by allowing  them to be coded by separate populations of cells. 2. How  does regulation of noradrenaline and acetylcholine in the  olfactory system affect behavior in an odor learning task?  Computer models will be used to analyze recent behavioral  experiments in this laboratory testing how  rats respond to odor pairs which share components (odor A  with odor B, odor A with  odor C) versus how they respond to  odor pairs that do not share components (odor A with  odor  B, odor C with odor D).  The model will generate predictions  about how the response to odor pairs with shared components  should differ depending on whether the response to odor  pairs is based on the familiarity of the odor pair, or on  whether  the odor pair has been paired with a reward. 3. Does  acetylcholine more strongly suppress spread of activity at  synapses that have been recently increased in strength?  Computer models show that storage of  odor memories in the  olfactory system appears to function more effectively when  acetylcholine suppresses the  spread of activity at recently  strengthened  synapses.  This prevents recently stored  memories from  interfering with storage of new memories. In  slices of olfactory cortex, we will test whether drugs that  activate acetylcholine receptors more strongly suppress  spread of activity at synapses which were  recently  strengthened by repetitive stimulation. 4. Computer models  will be used to analyze the effect of  acetylcholine and  norepinephrine on fast and slow oscillations of activity in  the olfactory system.  The  interaction of oscillations in the olfactory bulb and  olfactory cortex will be analyzed, with  an  emphasis on  feedback connections from the olfactory cortex back to the  olfactory bulb.",
