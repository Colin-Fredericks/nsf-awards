 "awd_abstract_narration": "The essence of this research is a systematic classification  of the variants of the multicast problems that present  themselves in various networking and distributed systems  applications, as well as algorithmic solutions to these  problems in the spirit of \"competitive analysis\". Even  though the research pursued in this project is theoretical  in nature, the algorithms developed may be of practical  value.  The issues addressed are also being very actively  studied by the networking community.  This algorithmic  effort may in fact bridge between the Theory and Networking  communities, since the researchers in the Networking  community are seeking solutions to dire problems created by  the growing scale of the Internet and its applications. From  the algorithmic point of view, which is the point of view  taken in this proposal, the Multicast Problem can be defined  as follows.  Various network users issue online requests for  a connection to certain multicast sources.  The network  either connects this request or rejects it (admission  control decision).  If a request is connected, a path with  sufficient residual bandwidth is established starting at the  requesting user and ending either at the source or at one of  the users previously connected to the same source (route  selection decision).  The goal of these admission control  and route selection decisions is to maximize the total  number of users connected subject to the network capacity  constraints.  Namely, the number of connections to different  sources passing through any edge should not exceed the  capacity of that edge. The innovation in this research is in  developing a unifying framework that simultaneously captures  admission control and route selection decisions in their  full generality. This framework can be generalized to  include issues such as pricing policies, network design &  synthesis, etc.",
