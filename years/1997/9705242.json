The  bombardment  with  electrons of variable energy produces various  charged  and  metastably  excited  states of the droplets.  The  proposed  work  builds  on a previous observation that infrared light can produce  photodetachment  of  electrons  and  also  of  metastable  helium  molecules   from   the  clusters.  A  time  of  flight   velocity  spectrometer  will  be  added  and used  to  measure  the  energy  distributions  of  the  detached  species.  Experiments  will  be  perfomed  to  measure (1)  the energy of the bombarding  electron  which  creates  the  initial excitation, (2) the  energy  of  the  photon which detaches the resulting relaxed particle, and (3) the  velocity  distribution of these particles after  detachment.  The  goals  are  to  learn  about the cluster density  of  states,  to  measure the ground state kinetic energy of an electron trapped in  a  bubble, and to study the evolution of excitonic states of  the  cluster.  %%%  This  experimental research project probes unusal  properties  of  nanometer  size  droplets  of  rare gases,  particularly  helium,  produced  in  a  beam  apparatus.  Of  particular  interest   are  interactions  of the nanometer scale droplets with  electrons  of  variable energy, which put the drop into states of altered energy  and/or  altered charge. The excited states thus produced  are  of  fundamental  interest, and will be probed by use of light,  which  has  been  found  to  lead  to detachment  of  metastable  helium  molecules from the excited clusters. The velocity distribution of  resulting photodetached molecules will be measured with a time of  flight  apparatus.  The  research will add important   information  about   nanometer   scale  clusters,  their   interactions   with  electrons,  and  the nature of their states as  their  energy  is  raised. This research project is interdisciplinary in nature  and  involves  graduate  students who will be excellently  trained  to  enter positions in industry, government or education.  ***",
