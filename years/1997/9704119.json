The funds requested  are to provide  travel support for students from the U.S. to attend this  school/workshop, which will assemble students and  researchers from the U.S. and from developing countries in  Latin America.  Co-organizers of the meeting are Dr.  Marleigh Sheaff of the University of Wisconsin and Dr.  Gerardo Herrera of the Centro de Investigacion y Estudios  Avanzados (CINVESTAV) or the Instituto Tecnico Nacional  (IPA) in Mexico City.    The School will consist of lecture courses in various state  of-the-art instrumentation techniques in current use in  experimental particle physics, augmented by laboratory  courses designed to demonstrate the material presented.  The  goal is to encourage increased participation by young  physicists from developing countries in elementary particle  physics experiments and to encourage future collaborations  in experimental elementary particle physics.  While the  instrumentation techniques to be presented are those  currently in use in particle physics, many have wide-ranging  applications to medical imaging or to the non-destructive  evaluation of materials.  ***",
