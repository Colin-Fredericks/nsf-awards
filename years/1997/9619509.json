The site will be focused in mitigation/reduction of natural and man-made hazards.  The NSF support for 10 undergraduate students each year will allow them to become involved in the research activities of the faculty of the Department during the summers of 1997 through 1999.  This experience is designed to provide students with an improved understanding of research and to encourage them to consider careers in research.  Support for this REU site will supplement the commitment of the Department to such research activities, and provide students with the opportunity to participate in ongoing cutting-edge research projects.  The research activities span the areas of expertise of the faculty in Civil Engineering and Geological Sciences and include projects in water resources, bioengineering and pollution control, and structural mechanics.  Components of the program include identification of exceptional students through nationwide recruitment with emphasis on women and minority participation; matching of student research interests with faculty; close interaction of graduate students and faculty with the undergraduates to provide students with a fuller appreciation of graduate study, university research, and careers in academia; an intense two month research experience; and a mini-conference for presentation of results.  The goal of the program is to excite some of the best engineering students in the nation about the challenges of a career in research.  ***",
