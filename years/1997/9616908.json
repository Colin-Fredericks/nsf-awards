 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, Poliakoff will identify and characterize   aspects of the photoelectron ejection process which retain their   molecular character far from threshold using soft X-ray molecular   spectroscopy.  Electronically excited photoions will be created using   tunable synchrotron radiation, and their dynamics will be investigated   via their dispersed fluorescence.  These studies are unique in that the   range of kinetic energies probed extends hundreds of eV into the   ionization continuum, where the molecular character of the electron   ejection still persists.  Vibrational and rotational energy deposition   into molecular photoions over a broad range of photoionization energies   will be determined.  Earlier experiments on simple molecules will be   extended to examine small polyatomic molecules.  The results of these   experiments will provide a useful database for experiments employing   photoionization and will furnish insights into fundamental scattering   phenomena, thereby aiding the continued development of molecular   scattering theory.    In the experiments performed in this project, the motions that electrons   make when molecules dissociate under the influence of  high-energy light   will be correlated with the motions of the nuclei.  The light used in   these studies will come in part from a synchrotron radiation source at   Louisiana State University.  The data acquired in these studies is   inaccessible by other  techniques and will be used to guide and shape   theoretical models for these processes.  Some of the processes studied in   this project are relevant to understanding the physical and chemical   reactions involved in the X-ray processing of materials.",
