 "awd_abstract_narration": "Raghavan   DMS 9704951  Cooperative Games  NSF Abstract      The proposal addresses algorithmic problems of cooperative and  noncooperative dynamic games.  Cooperative Games: How should the common costs be allocated fairly  among the benefeciaries of a joint enterprise is a basic problem  widespread in both private firms and in public enterprises. While  cost accountants and practitioners have stuck to a few cost  allocation practises , these procedures are being questioned by  researchers especially by game theorists who would like the  procedures to be fair, equitable and reflective of the decision  makers power and influence in steering the course of actions.  Cooperative game theory addresses precisely these issues.  Till recently game theorists have been proposing many solutions  without any efficient solution technique to solve for them.  Often many practical cost allocation problems and profit sharing  problems can be modeled as games whose essential coalitions grow  only polynomially with he size of the player set.  The project is aimed at developing efficient  algorithms  that will  solve for the nucleolus and the Shapley value for  many models.  Stochastic games: In the area of stochastic games  the aim is to  study non-zero sum games in limiting average payoffs for finite  and arbitrary state spaces and to look for correlated and Nash  equilibria.  Unlike zero-sum games, non-zero sum  structured  stochastic games may not possess even epsilon -stationary  Nash equilibria in limiting average payoff. Even more important  is to develop allgorithms to locate Nash equilibria, at least  for structured stochastic games.    Increasingly industries and organizations and even federal  funding agencies want to measure the contributions of joint  efforts. In environmental  problems accurately allocating costs or  fines for industrial pollutions will be possible with  cooperative game theoretic solutions. In civil law suits and in  divorce law suits, the ad hoc but intuitively appealing decisions   by judges based on the individual cases can be backed up by  quantifiable approaches using cooperative game theoretic solutions.  The strategic behavior of price wars by airlines,  the tax evasion and auditing by tax offices, auto manufacturing  competitions can  all be analyzed using stochastic game theoretic  methods and models. The solutions backed up  by efficient algorithms  for computation is essential for the applicability of Game Theory  to real life problems.",
