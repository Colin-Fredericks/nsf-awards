 "awd_abstract_narration": "Block         This grant is focused on the use of a new generation of  remote technology devices, called pop-up archival satellite tags  (PSAT).  This study combines physiology, oceanography and  engineering to develop technology that will permit studying the  migratory movements of open ocean fish.  The PSAT tags are  essentially computers that record navigational information, body  temperature, depth and ambient temperature data.  The tag  technology will be used in combination with established molecular  genetics techniques to establish the relationships between  distinct genetic haplotypes evident in certain populations oi  pelagic fish and their dispersal patterns in the open ocean.  Despite the economic and ecological unportance of highly  migratory pelagic fish such as bmfishes (e.g. marlins, swordfish,  sailfish) and tunas, little is know about their movement patterns  and population structure.  The PSAT tags will provide information  on how the movements of pelagic fish are influenced by  oceanographic factors such as temperature.  Although considerable  effort has been expended using fisheries statistics, tag and  release studies, and acoustic telemetry, the time scale and  resolution of these techniques are insufficient to characterize  migrations and address questions about life histories and gene  flow. This lack of information becomes more critical as fisheries  continue to pressure resources.  The NSF award will support the  development of prototype and first c,,eneration tags, and the  deployment of tags on captive and wild tunas.  Tracks of  approximately 20-30 Atlantic bluefm tuna will be obtained for  periods of one-two years.  The PSAT tags will immediately  illustrate the potential existence and relative importance of  migratory corridors and temporal and spatial movement patterns in  relation to oceanographic conditions.  Until now this has been  challenging data to obtain.  The information gained will improve  our understanding of the biology of these species and increas e  our knowledge of stock structure.  The successful implementation  of the pop up archival tag technology will provide marine  researchers with a novel tool for studying inaccessible marine  vertebrates.",
