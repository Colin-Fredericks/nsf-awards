 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Sanford's research focuses on the synthesis of substituted   (1.1.1) propellanes and their polymerization to produce materials   displaying novel thermal and optical properties.  Introduction of   long-chain alkyl substituents will enhance the solubility of the targeted   homopolymers and alternating copolymers.  Polymerization of propellane   monomers with planar pi-substituents will create materials with novel   molecular architectures, while copolymerization with electron deficient   olefins will provide materials with unusual electronic properties.    Large-ring propellanes will provide access to polyamides with rigid   propellane structures in the main chain of the polymer.  In addition to   providing undergraduate research opportunities in these projects,   Professor Sanford will integrate materials issues into the curricula for   science and engineering students and will develop a collaborative,   interdisciplinary course for nonscience majors in which critical thinking   and understanding of science will be fostered through lecture and   laboratory investigations relating to science and technology in the   everyday world.  With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the   research and educational activities of Dr. Elizabeth Sanford of the   Department of Chemistry of Hope College.  Professor Sanford's research   focuses on the synthesis of propeller-shaped molecules known as   propellanes.  These molecules are relatively unstable, and they readily   undergo reactions which relieve their strained polycyclic structures,   forming polymers comprised of long chains.  Professor Sanford introduces   various substructures into the propellane molecules, thereby permitting   the formation of polymers bearing these substructures, which are designed   to impart to the polymers better solubility, novel architectures, and   unusual electronic properties.  Professor Sanford is developing   educational programs for both science and nonscience majors.  A course   focusing on science and technology in the everyday world will be   developed for the nonscience majors, while curriculum changes and the   opportunity for undergraduate research in Professor Sanford's laboratory   will afford undergraduate science and engineering students a broad view   of current materials science issues.",
