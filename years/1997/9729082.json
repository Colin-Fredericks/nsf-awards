 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective is  to  develop  traffic  and  performance  models  for  the  Internet.  Internet applications exhibit growth  trends, short and long term traffic  variability  and  pose  dif-  ferent  quality  of  service demands on the network. This traffic  environment requires that networks migrate to dynamic routing and  resource  allocation  paradigms  for efficient sharing of network  resources.  Baseline traffic models and techniques  to   validate  and  adaptively  update these models must be in place in the net-  work to support dynamic network  functions.  This  work  proposes  measurement  driven time-series modeling approaches for capturing  traffic characteristics and other seasonal and exogenous  factors  that  influence  traffic  variability on the Internet. The models  will be developed to capture  both  the  short  time-scales  over  which  the arrival processes can be stationary as well the longer  time-scale non-stationary features. Real-time traffic monitoring,  measurement  and  modeling  algorithms that can adaptively update  and predict traffic descriptors will be designed  for implementa-  tion at network nodes.    The preliminary research plan is aimed  at  determining  feasible  traffic  measurement strategies for the longer term research work  proposed above. Traffic measurements will be taken at a small set  of  access  routers on the Internet.  A baseline traffic sampling  and characterization methodology will be outlined.  Packet voice,  variable  bit rate video and traditional Internet traffic will be  considered at the flow level. The effect of increasing granularity   in  traffic measurements and relative increase in information  content useful for resource allocation  will  be  examined.  This  preliminary  work  will  determine  the  relevant time scales for  traffic monitoring and measurements and  a  better  understanding  of  the types of modeling tools that must be in place at Internet  nodes to successfully implement adaptively controlled service a nd  routing  disciplines.  The  results of this research plan will be  integral for the PI's long term research interests  in  designing  an  adaptive  dual mode connection and flow level traffic charac-  terization scheme to be used  in  admission  control,  end-to-end  resource  reservation and adaptive routing decisions in broadband  packet networks.
