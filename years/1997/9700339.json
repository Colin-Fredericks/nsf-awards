 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700339  Raskin  This is an award to assist in the purchase of equipment for  conduct of research on microbial ecology of biological processes  used for treatment of wastewater, bioremediation of xenobiotic  compounds, and for the detection and viability of waterborne  pathogens.  The major use of the equipment will be for research  on performance of anaerobic bioreactors, development of an  oligonucleotide probe data base and to study causes and control  of foaming in suspended growth bioprocessing reactors.  In  addition the equipment will support research by the  investigator's colleagues Dr. Snoeyink in his research on  adsorption water treatment processes, Dr. Marinas in research on  chemisorption capacity of titanium dioxide for treatment of air,  and Drs. Werth and Sanford who are working on insitu  bioremediation of contaminated aquifers.    This award will provide the investigator and her colleagues with  equipment that can be used to address a unique approach to  studying anaerobic ecosystems and re-addressing the \"long-  standing problems\" of foaming and bulking experienced with  suspended growth bioreactors as well as the newer challenges in  nutrient removal from wastewater by use of biological processes.  The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to  NSF 93-155, Research Equipment Grant Program.  ***",
