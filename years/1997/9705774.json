 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705774    Sternberg          In this proposal, the principal investigator decribes a research  program in nonlinear partial differential equations and the calculus  of variations. The research topics come from three areas: the   Ginzburg-Landau model for superconductivity, the Cahn-Hilliard model   for phase transitions, and the structure  of stable solutions to  volume-constrained least area problems. A common goal throughout  the proposal is to study the existence, disappearance, and structure  of local minimizers to problems arising in continuum mechanics when  relevant parameters are altered. In the work centered on   superconductivity, the P.I. will focus on problems concerning the  complex relationship between the size of an applied magnetic field   and the behavior of vortices which appear within the superconducting   sample.  The projects related to phase transitions concern the   structure of transition layers bridging two (or more) phases within   the context of the Cahn-Hilliard theory of phase transitions. This   work is inextricably linked to the study of volume-constrained least   area problems. These geometry problems are quite subtle, and their  resolution should shed light on the structure of phase transitions in  the Cahn-Hilliard setting as well.         This proposal concerns research projects related to the study of  superconductors and to the study of phase transitions in fluids or   alloys. In the production of superconductors, a major concern is the   emergence of vortices which are little \"defects\" in the sample leading  to a loss of perfect conductivity. In this proposal, the P.I. will use  the so-called Ginzburg-Landau theory as a model for the superconductor  in order to investigate the emergence, disappearance, and placement of  these \"defects\" when the sample is subjected to a magnetic field.  In  the research devoted to phase transitions, the P.I. will study  mathematical models for binary alloys (Cahn-Hilliard theory) and for  two-fluid systems (van der Waals the ory). The goal is to understand  the possible shape of the boundaries between different phases of a   medium. Particular attention will be paid to the effect of the   boundary of the container holding the medium on the structure of these  so-called transition layers. These studies are related to questions  about the possible shape of bubbles confined to a container. Since  these bubbles tend to hug the wall of the enclosing container, one  wants to understand how the specific shape of the container will  affect the structure of the stable bubble.",
