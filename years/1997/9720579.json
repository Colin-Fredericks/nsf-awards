The relation is intended to support dynamic evolution in object-oriented applications, and is relevant at both the design and implementation level.  The relation provides a solution to a number of popular design patterns that have demonstrated how awkward it is to model natural concepts of evolution when using a traditional object-oriented model.    This research incorporates the adaptor relation into the object-oriented model, and investigates new notions of dynamic binding that accompany the relation.  Alternative implementation techniques are compared on numerous aspects including efficiency, safety and scalability.   An existing implementation employs a preprocessor approach for parsing tagged Java code.  Implementations based on metaobject protocols are also investigated.    This project facilitates the Principle Investigator in establishing a strong presence as an expert on object-oriented software evolution.  Project funding also facilitates the Principal Investigator in developing relationships with Santa Clara University students through research collaboration.  The technical goal of the research is to support dynamic evolution within the realm of efficient, type safe languages.  Establishment of a two-way technology transfer with industry serves to provide a relevant research result.",
