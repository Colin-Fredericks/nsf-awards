 "awd_abstract_narration": "A setting for quantum mechanics will be sought that  avoids the notorious problems that beset the foundations of  the subject.  Such a formulation would rely on no prior  concept of measurement or observer, would describe  individual systems and not just ensembles, would make sense  for small systems uncoupled to an environment, and would  satisfy an appropriate locality condition.  Two elementary  but insufficiently noticed recent theorems raise the  possibility that it may be possible to satisfy all these  requirements in an interpretation of quantum mechanics based  on the view that the physics of an isolated system is  nothing more or less than the study of all the correlations  that exist among its subsystems.  The goal is to arrive at  an elementary, unmysterious, unambiguous, paradox-free, and  pedagogically useful interpretive framework for the quantum  theory, as a natural language for describing an inherently  probabilistic world.  In an independent study the origins of  certain misconceptions about special relativity held by  physicists and/or sociologists will be traced to some lapses  in the traditional pedagogical approaches to the subject.  Alternative routes to the special theory will be developed  that avoid these pitfalls.",
