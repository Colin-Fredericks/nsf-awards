 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724190  Bierman    This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation  (MRI) Program, provides $106,166 as partial support of the  costs of acquiring equipment to be used in integrated  studies of surficial and environmental geology at the  University of Vermont. Specifically, the equipment to be  purchased will include a real-time kinematic global  positioning system receiver and hand-held GPS field unit, a  carbon/nitrogen analyzer and a whole core magnetic  susceptibility system. This equipment will benefit the  analytical needs of these young researchers and their  students for a variety of interesting and environmentally  significant studies including, landscape evolution research  that relies on AMS dating of exposed surfaces using  cosmogenic nuclides, studies of tectonic and post-glacial  isostatic tilting in New England fluvial terraces,  documenting historical lake level changes and coastal  wetland transgression in response to rising sea level,  investigating the carbon dynamics of coastal wetlands, and  assessing nitrogen transformations in forested ecosystems  and through aquatic food webs.  The GPS equipment will help  to carefully document the geographic location of samples for  subsequent exposure age dating and will provide accurate  delineation of changes in lake and wetland shorelines  through time.  The C/N analyzer is necessary for  characterization of lake and marsh sediments and will  complement the stable isotopic investigations of co-PI  Andrea Lini in studies of nutrient dynamics in coastal,  lacustrine and forest ecosystems.  Finally, the magnetic  susceptibility system will be invaluable for stratigraphic  control in the tectonic, isostatic and geomorphologic  studies of Bierman as it will aid in the correlation of  individual strata.  ***",
