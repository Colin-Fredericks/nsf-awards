 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research on heterocyclyne complexes by Drs. Claire A.   Tessier and Wiley J. Youngs of the Chemistry Department, University of   Akron.  New complexes will be prepared by incorporating heteroatoms such   as Si, Ge, B, Al, Ga, In, P, As and Pt into the cyclic structure of the   complexes, and by associating transition metals with available C-C   multiple bonds in the ring.  Special emphasis will be placed on preparing   rings containing two heteroatoms, on synthesis of dipocket heterocyclynes   that contain both a Lewis acid and a Lewis base, and on using larger   diynes to create larger pockets.  The non-linear optical, conducting, and   liquid crystal characteristics of some platinum chain complexes will be   determined.  Attempts will also be made to build complex tube-like   polymer structures that may have interesting electronic features.    Multinuclear NMR is an important analytical tool in this work.  Heterocyclynes are cyclic polyalkynes that, in addition to carbon,   contain a different element, or heteroatom.  The system investigated here   contains three alkynes linked together with three spacers--one of which   is the heteroatom--to form a planar 11-membered ring.  The cavity of this   ring, or pocket, varies in size as the heteroatom changes.   More   elaborate structures can be formed by linking heterocyclynes together, so   that they contain up to four pockets.  The compounds can be made in a   controlled way and built up to larger structures that have conducting and   liquid crystalline properties.",
