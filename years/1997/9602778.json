 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation, in a joint effort with Saint Joseph's University of Philadelphia, will provide funding for the renovation of eight laboratories for the Biology Department.  The laboratories, some outfitted with furnishings removed from a previous facility built in 1927, are housed in the Science Center and have never been renovated since its original construction in 1971.  In spite of inadequate space, the Department has maintained a quality undergraduate research program for the past twenty years.  Opportunities for research are broad, including the following areas:   microbiology, molecular biology, genetics, behavior, environmental biology, plant pathology, development, cell biology and anatomy.  Renovations will consist of removing antiquated and worn laboratory furniture and replacing it with modern laboratory benches and cabinets installed in configurations appropriate to individual research labs.  New and increased electrical service will be provided as well as new flooring, ceiling panels, and overhead lighting.  Two rooms will be outfitted with separate heating and air conditioning systems to meet environmental requirements, and five laboratories will be equipped with new natural gas fixtures located safely in convenient areas.  Once renovations are completed, faculty, undergraduate and graduate students will continue to engage in present research activities, as well as conduct research that is currently not feasible due to poor infrastructure.  In addition to increase efficiency in space utilization, and establishing a safe working environment, the renovated labs will attract and accommodate more faculty and students, allowing for continued growth and increased productivity.   This project will enhance the Department's ability to successfully train and prepare students, including women and underrepresented minority students in an urban environment, for careers in the life science.",
