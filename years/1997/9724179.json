 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide partial support of a planning  meeting of international physical societies to be held in  Washington, DC, on October 8-10, 1997, organized by the  American Physical Society.  The planning meeting will  include representatives from the largest national membership  societies (Deutsche Physikallische Gessellschaft, the UK's  Institute of Physics, the Japanese Physical Society and the  Japanese Society of Applied Physics, the Chinese Physical  Society) and the five international regional societies (the  European Physical Society, the Federation of Latin-American  Physical Societies, the association of Asia-Pacific Physical  Societies, the Euro-Asian Physical Society, the Society of  African Physicists and Mathematicians).  Observers to the  meeting will include the President of the International  Union of Pure and Applied Physics and the President of the  Canadian Association of Physicists.  The purpose of this meeting is to explore important common  issues affecting the international physics enterprise and to  engage in joint planning to address these issues.  The  topics which have been identified as most important by all  participants are: 1) the formulation and implementation of  national and international science policy, 2) the impact of  electronic publishing on the dissemination of research  results, 3) status and needs for physics education and  public education, 4) physics and capacity building in  developing nations and 5) the possible organization of an  international council or congress of physical societies as a  means to sustain international collaboration.  The meeting will be organized around plenary presentations  designed to outline the problems and alternative solutions,  followed by break-out groups assigned specific tasks.  A  concluding plenary will bring together the elements of the  various discussions to include a compilation of outcomes and  assignments.  The meeting is expected to produce a consensus paper on each  of the principal topics of discussion and a general plan for  further concerted action.",
