 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725756  Logan  This is an award to support conduct of a workshop to consider  advances in the knowledge-base needed to support environmental  engineering practice.  Emphasis in this workshop will be to  identify the research needed to address the engineering component  of the National Research Council's recent National Forum on  Science and Technology Goals of its six environmental research  and development needs.  Background to conduct of this workshop  will include reports from the forum on environmental engineering  research and education conducted under NSF 96-26774 in May of  1997 and the conference and workshop on environmental problems  characteristic of urban coastal communities to be conducted in  October of 1997 under NSF 97-11151.  Workshop participants will  include representation from the National Academy of Engineering  and the Association of Environmental Engineering Professors.    The product of this conference is expected to be used in planning  operation of the Environmental Engineering Research program as it  addresses outstanding issues in environmental engineering  practice.  Results are also expected to assist in advancing the  National Science Foundation's commitment to the core strategy of  integrating research and education as articulated in its  strategic plan.  ***",
