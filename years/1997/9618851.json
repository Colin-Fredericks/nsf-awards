 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethics cases are of growing use in engineering courses.  Few include design and environmental issues.  Yet, all designs have ethical implications, and increasing concern for the environment will be one of the great challenges for future engineers.  This project will create and evaluate a collection of cases that focuses on ethical considerations in the early stages of the invention and design process, cases that encourage students to think imaginatively about design in light of environmental concerns.  Using the cases in engineering education may help to produce engineers better able to make ethical decisions about creating and marketing new technologies.  Two sets of cases are planned in order to illustrate (1) the need for moral imagination, and (2) the challenge of trying to meet standards calling for the elimination of environmental risk.  The first set considers companies who make sound design decisions but find themselves in trouble because they remained unaware of the ways in which other people frame their experience.  The second set will challenge students to design products that are both environmentally sustainable and viable, or avoid social and political risks inherent in any product design. The cases and teaching notes will be tested in the classroom.  Results should appeal to a variety of disciplines including engineering, technology, environmental studies and ethics.  They will be published in the Case Bibliography of the Darden Business School and appear on the World Wide Web and in articles and an eventual textbook.  The project also allows two graudate students to pursue a special course concentration combining systems engineering and ethics as they do research and help to write and evaluate the cases.",
