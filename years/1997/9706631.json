It is a response to the new requirements  articulated by industries and by government to reinvent  education for the challenges of a highly competitive, world  wide economy.  The mission is to educate individuals so that  they can efficiently perform the tasks which make companies  competitive in a rapidly changing high-technology world.  This program will facilitate the process of collaboration  with the materials manufacturing industries in our region.  The students are provided experiences in using complex  industrial equipment and techniques in order to minimize the  change between academic preparation and industrial  employment. Workshops are planned for employers on computer  instrumentation and control systems needed for industrial  modernization.  The majority of the student body at  Southwest Missouri State University consists of first  generation college students who will benefit greatly from  this applied approach to education, where high technology  skills will be added to their core theoretical knowledge.  Most of these students have a strong desire to witness  theory applied to \"real world\" applications.  The graduates  will have the ability to work in the commercial and  industrial laboratories which require practical experience  in high-tech materials synthesis, preparation and  characterization.  This education grant is funded through  the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the  Division of Materials Research.  %%%  This grant promotes novel opportunities for students to  prepare for academic, industrial, government and non-  traditional roles (such as communication, business,  leadership, ethics, mentoring) and assists in integration of  research and training with curricula.  ***",
