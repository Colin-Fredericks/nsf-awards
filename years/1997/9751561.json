 "awd_abstract_narration": "The profound advances in computer technology during the past decade have propelled the need to educate every undergraduate student with the latest enhancements in technology to the forefront of educational objectives.  To address this need, this project enhances the digital laboratory facilities of the Engineering Technology (ET) program.  The objective is to enrich the quality of undergraduate digital laboratory instruction by providing an environment to conduct learning about, and use of, Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs), a key advance in digital electronics.    Eight personal computers, a laser printer, networking equipment, eight copies of ALTERA design software (PLD), and one programming unit are provided through this project.  This digital laboratory equipment is networked to the building's existing 10-BaseT Ethernet network, allowing each computer to communicate with the laser printer.    This project can have a great impact on ET education.  It enhances student learning through laboratory use.  Its impact on K 12 education can be even deeper.  This is realized through workshops directed to students and teachers in the Detroit Public School (DPS) system.    *",
