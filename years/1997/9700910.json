They are typically dissipative and often the different components  have a fixed feedback relation to other components.  Systems of  competitive or cooperative type and monotone cyclic feedback  systems often arise.  In this project the investigator exploits  these special features, particularly monotonicity properties, in  order to describe the asymptotic behavior of the system.  He  explores the possibility that some classes of systems with  definite feedback relations between components have simpler  long-term dynamics than their dimension implies.  For example, the  asymptotic behavior of cooperative systems of differential  equations is convergence to equilibrium, while competitive  systems behave like general systems of one less dimension and  monotone cyclic feedback systems satisfy the Poincare-Bendixson  trichotomy whatever their dimension.  The application of these  ideas to mathematical models of microbial cultures in  bio-reactors is pursued.  Of particular interest is a model of  microbial competition for limiting resource in a distributed  environment mimicking the large intestine of a mammal.  The  central questions of interest to physiologists are what factors  determine the set of micro-organisms able to colonize the gut and  what are the chief factors determining the stability of the  colony to invasion by ingested organisms.  Modeling issues arise  in order to model both advection of the lumen and the effects of  bacterial adherence to the intestinal walls.  The model is  intended to focus on these questions.  In a different direction,  the investigator continues earlier work aimed at simplifying  complicated structured population models (those models that take  account of biological structure such as age, size, physiological  state, etc of a population) to simpler mode ls consisting of delay  differential systems, possibly state dependent.  The rationale is  that there are fewer tools that apply to the hyperbolic partial  differential equations that arise in structured population models  than there are for delay differential equations.  As a particular  example, a model of microbial growth in a chemostat incorporating  effects of cell-cycle phase is investigated.       Mathematical models play a major role in the theoretical  understanding of many issues in the biological sciences.  Mathematical models, as simple caricatures of the real phenomena,  allow an investigator to more easily and inexpensively answer the  kinds of questions: \"what if we change this to that?\"  Many such  models that arise in physiology, population biology,  bioengineering and epidemiology take the form of differential  equations where it is important for understanding the  applications to determine what happens to the solutions of these  equations over the long run.  The equations that arise in the  biological sciences typically have special features not found in  mathematical models in the physical sciences.  This project aims  at developing methods that exploit these special features to  determine the long-time behavior of the solutions and to apply  these methods to problems of current interest in biotechnology,  population biology and physiology.  Improved methods will lead to  more accurate predictions from existing mathematical models and  the ability to analyze more complicated, realistic models.  As  one example among several to be considered in the proposed work,  the investigator and P.  Waltman propose to study a mathematical  model of microbial growth and competition for nutrients taking  place in the large intestine of a mammal.  As the intestines are  often a source of infection from micro-organisms, it is important  to understand the factors involved in determining the kinds of  bacteria normally present in the intestine and the factors that  determine whether an invadin g organism (e..g. a pathogen) can  successfully establish itself as a member of the colony.  They  intend to construct a mathematical model based on a flow reactor  that will exhibit the main features of the intestine (flow of  lumen through the intestine and bacterial adherence to the walls  of the intestine) in order to better understand the answers to  the questions posed above.",
