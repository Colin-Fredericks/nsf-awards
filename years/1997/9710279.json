 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710279  Bhatnagar   Description:  This award supports the U.S.-India Cooperative Research: Study of Solar  Oscillations Phase III, which will examine the Sun s interior utilizing the data set  from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG).  This recently completed  network of six identical oscillation observing stations that circle the globe will keep  the Sun under 24 hour surveillance and will yield unique data having importance not  only for solar physics, but for astrophysics, solar-terrestrial physics, geophysics, and  nuclear physics.  The U.S. team is headed by John Leibacher of the National Solar  Observatory (NSO), Tucson, and the Indian team by Arvind Bhatnagar, Udaipur Solar  Observatory (USO) Udaipur, and S.M. Chitre, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,  Mumbai.  The new field of helioseismology has evolved from the discovery of solar  acoustic waves that emanate from randomly-excited seismic vibrations from within the  Sun.  This powerful new tool for studying the Sun s interior structure and dynamics  can probe the interior of the Sun with the same precision that terrestrial seismology  can probe the Earth s interior.  During Phase III of the study, the U.S. and Indian  teams will pursue collaborative research in numerous areas that have been stimulated  by GONG data.  These include inversions; hydrostatic Sun structure; helium  abundance in the solar envelope; excitation mechanisms for solar oscillations;  background solar spectrum; global magnetic fields in the sun s deep interior; nearly  steady flows and magnetic fields; and deterministic detrending.      Scope:  The U.S.-India component of this large international project is exceptionally  well balanced.  For the United States, Udaipup has physical attributes such as  atmospheric clarity and a unique geographic position on the globe diametrically  opposite to Tucson, as well as strong infrastructural resources.  Solar physics is a field  in which Indian scientists excel.  The project will involve USO staff and world cl ass  researchers from India s premier Tata Institute.  For India, the project offers entry to  the field of helioseismology, state-of -the-art instrumentation, and involvement in an  important international effort.  This project has thus far yielded a large number of  publications under U.S.-Indian authorship.       ***",
