The motivation for miniaturization of the sensors, using a thickness of 5-50 (m and a width of 0.5-2 mm, is to permit in-situ observation of IR spectra from membranes of intact individual cells.  This will allow IR spectroscopy to be performed as a function of cell membrane potential, which will be controlled using a whole-cell voltage clamp.  Sensitive voltage-dependent IR differences spectra should thus reveal how the living cell's membrane components respond to transient shifts in transmembrane voltage.  A particular goal is to prove experimentally a set of feasibility calculations predicting that this approach will allow voltage-induced difference spectra to be measured on an ion channel expressed in a frog oocyte, or on a small channel peptide reconstituted into a giant liposome.  The cell or liposome will be held in contact with a miniature supported planar Ge waveguide.  A portion of the IR light energy propagating along the waveguide is carried in a evanescent wave that can be absorbed by molecules near its surface, including those in the cell or liposome membrane.  Detection of a reproducible voltage-dependence of the evanescent-wave absorption spectrum is the principal goal of the project, since this voltage-dependent spectrum will provide information about the structural changes involved in channel opening.      A kind of biosensor, based on a thin genmanium waveguide that conducts infrared light, will be used to detect structural changes in the membranes of single cells.  When a cell, or a single-layer biomembrane vesicle resembling a cell, is placed in contact with the germanium surface, the light transmitted through the waveguide can be absorbed at selective wavelengths, and the spectrum measured.  The waveguide concentrates infrared light along a path that maximizes the light's interaction with mol ecules in the cell membrane, relative to the light's interaction with the strongly-IR-absorbing bulk water that must also be present to allow the cell to function normally.  Selective absorption of different infrared wavelengths by the cell membrane's components will be the basis for spectroscopic analysis of their chemical structures.  A particular goal is a basic understanding of how various ion-channel proteins function.  However, this research should also advance our national technical capabilities in the sensitive chemical analysis of a wide variety of tiny samples, which may be of importance for such varied tasks as environmental monitoring.  ***",
