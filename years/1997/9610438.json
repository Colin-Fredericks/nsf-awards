 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research in Undergraduate Institution project, supported  jointly by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the  Division of Chemistry and the Chemical Reaction Processes Program  of the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems, focusses on  the synthesis and characterization of molybdenum carbide and  nitride catalysts for hydrodesulfurization chemistry.  Synthesis  of these materials and promotion by Co and Ni, evaluation by  spectroscopic studies of adsorbed probe molecules such as CO and  NO, and determination of HDS activity for a number of model  feedstocks forms the range of studies being carried out by  Professor Bussell and his students at Western Washington  University.  This work introduces undergraduates and masters  degree students to state of the art research in heterogeneous  catalysis, and provides important new information about the  fundamentals of hydrodesulfurization catalysis on novel  bimetallic systems.  The removal of sulfur from crude oil and coal is an important  application of heterogeneous catalysis.  This  hydrodesulfurization chemistry is the focus of this research  project.  Novel molybdenum carbide and molybdenum nitride  catalysts are synthesized and characterized in this  work, and the effect of Co and Ni promoters on the activity of  these materials is evaluated.  This work provides fundamental  information for the design and preparation of important new  catalytic systems.",
