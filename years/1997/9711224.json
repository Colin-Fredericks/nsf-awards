 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kevrekidis  9711224       The investigator and his collaborator Edriss Titi of the  University of California, Irvine, study the long-time behavior of  solutions to dissipative evolution partial differential equations  under perturbations; they undertake a combined theoretical and  computer-assisted approach, with a number of illustrative  applications in mind.  These spatiotemporal perturbations are  motivated physically by phenomena occurring in media with varying  properties, such as reaction and diffusion in inhomogeneous media  (leading to PDEs with spatially or spatiotemporally dependent  coefficients).  They may also be the result of a feedback control  loop on a spatially distributed system.  In the project, they are  interested in maintaining / exploiting / prescribing  low-dimensional dynamics through large amplitude perturbations  and/or scale variation effects.  The tools they build upon are the  global machinery of inertial and approximate inertial manifolds,  as well as scientific computing for the simulation and the  bifurcation and stability analysis of nonlinear evolution PDEs.  The new set of questions they address requires the extension and  combination of these tools with aspects of separation of time  scales in control theory (e.g. persistence of inertial or  approximate inertial manifolds in closed loop systems) or in  homogenization theory (when coefficients in the PDE representing  properties of the medium vary on disparate spatial scales).       This project extends, develops and implements mathematical  and computational tools that enhance our ability to study  reaction and transport processes (modeled by dissipative  nonlinear evolution partial differential equations) under  inhomogeneous conditions.  Such conditions constitute more the  rule than the exception under realistic physical circumstances,  whether due to imperfections in the process (in which case we  want to guarantee a certain level of performance) or due to  intentional design of composite media, or to fe edback control  (where we attempt to optimize a process, like the selectivity of  a chemical reaction).  The method and algorithm development part  of the project is applicable to a wide class of such systems.  The  particular applications, however, focus on the modeling, analysis  and design of novel composite catalysts for heterogeneous  reactions, and on the exploitation of modeling for the control of  spatially extended systems (such as fluid flows).",
