 "awd_abstract_narration": "When  a  acoustic wave propagates from a sound source to the  ear  drum,  wavelength-dependent diffraction by the  torso,  head  and  outer ears or pinnae produce major changes in its spectrum.   The  nature  of  this  transformation depends on the location  of  the  sound source relative to the head, and is completely specified by  the  so-called head-related transfer function.  Because the head-  related  transfer function completely characterizes the  acoustic  information  available  for  sound localization,  it  has  become  central  to  any  scientific  study  of  spatial  hearing.    The  character  of  the  head-related transfer  function  varies  from  person to person.  These inter-subject variations are often quite  significant,  and individualized head-related transfer  functions  are  needed to obtain a faithful perception of spatial  location.  It  is  hypothesized that a physically-based model of  the  head-  related  transfer  function requires  a  small   number  of  free  parameters,  and  that  these  parameters  can  be   adapted   or  customized  to  individual  listeners  by  statistical   matching  against  experimentally measured head-related transfer functions,  and by correlation with anthropometric measurements.  This effort  will  develop and validate head-related transfer function  models  using  a combination of the physical and mathematical approaches.  Extensive psychological experiments will be performed to validate  the  adequacy  of  the  resulting  filters.   This  research  has  significance for the development of novel man-machine  interfaces  and  interactive systems, for three-dimensional auditory displays  as well as for some biomedical applications.",
