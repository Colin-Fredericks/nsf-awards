The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support an eighteen-month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Gregory C. Sloan to work with Dr.  Craig Hamilton Smith at University College at the University  of New South Wales in Canberra, Australia.  Twelve months of  this research will be supported by the International  Research Fellow Awards Program, and six months will be  supported by the U.S.-Australia Program.    Drs. Sloan and Smith will study late stages of stellar  evolution using a combination of high-resolution imaging,  long-slit spectroscopy, and polarimetry in the thermal  infrared.    As stars die, they shed most of their mass back into the  interstellar medium as they evolve into planetary nebulae  and supernovae.  As this material moves away, it cools,  allowing dust grains to condense out.  This circumstellar  dust represents the connection between one generation of  stars and the next.  Increasing our knowledge of the life-  cycle of circumstellar and interstellar dust is critical to  understanding how planets form around other stars, and even  how life itself might form.  Sloan and Miller will observe  several evolved sources using direct imaging, long-slit  spectroscopy, polarimetric imaging and spectropolarimetry.  Results of this research will be high-quality images and  spatially resolved spectra of the dust around several  extended and evolved stars, from which they will be able to  determine the geometry and chemistry of the mass-loss  process.  The polarimetric imaging and spectropolarimetry  will provide information about magnetic field strengths and  distributions which can be compared with theory to assess  the importance of magnetic fields in regulating the dust  forma tion process.  One of the instruments they will use,  Smith's NIMPOL Imaging Polarimeter is the only instrument of  its type in the world.  ***",
