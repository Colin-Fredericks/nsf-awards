 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714988  Cooper  This is an award to support exploratory research on the potential  use of ionizing radiation produced by a beam of energized  electrons from an electron accelerator to control and possibly  eliminate production of nuisance odors from conduct of sludge  management processes at wastewater treatment plants.  The  investigator will conduct the research using an electron beam  research unit at the Miami Wastewater Treatment Plant on Virginia  Key.  The exploratory work will involve subjecting water  solutions of several of classes of chemical compounds identified  as responsible for nuisance odors produced during treatment of  sludges to radiation produced by a 1.5 Million Electron Volt  accelerator.  Compounds to be investigated include organic and  inorganic sulfides, mercaptans and terpenes.    The proposal leading to this award was submitted and under  Special Guidelines for Small Grants for Exploratory Research  (SGER) in NSF 95-27, Grant Proposal Guide.  This research was  suggested at the Key West workshop in February of 1997 conducted  under NSF 95-25059 that addressed potential additional uses of  ionizing radiation produced by a beam of energized electrons as a  step toward full utilization of this environmental technology in  treatment of wastewater and process residues.  This project also  relates to research under NSF Award No. 95-08728 on physical and  chemical factors that influence production and emission of  gaseous air pollutants from wastewater treatment processing of  treatment-derived sludges  ***",
