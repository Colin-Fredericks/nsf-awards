 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703932  Kelly  This award provides partial support for a development  program to build and test an new analytical instrument, a  local electrode atom probe (LEAP).  This instrument will use  very high electric fields applied to a surface to field  evaporate atoms and accelerate them toward an imaging  detector.  The atom type is determined by time-of-flight  mass spectrometry for each atom.  A three-dimensional image  which is made up of the atom positions and identities is  then reconstructed from the data.  Unlike prior instruments  of this genre, the LEAP will have the capability to obtain  these images from planar samples.  It will also be able to  record the data orders of magnitude faster than previous  instruments.  This higher speed and planar specimen geometry  will make the LEAP technique able to tackle new problems  which have previously been out of reach.  It is expected  that this LEAP will be able to do many of the jobs that  previously would have been done with a secondary ion mass  spectrometer (SIMS) and it will do them with atomic-scale  spatial resolution.    The specimen geometry for this microscope is such that it is  realistic to fabricate and analyze specimens from whole  classes of materials which have been off-limits in the past.  Semiconductors, insulators, thin film structures on planar  substrates, and even microelectronic devices are examples.    A couple of intractable problems in the microelectronics  industry are specifically targeted in this project because  of their technological and economic significance and because  they will serve as prime illustrations of the power of the  technique.  Successful analysis of these materials problems  is a goal of this program.  The combination of these  capabilities will produce a technological breakthrough in  materials characterization.  ***",
