 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705137  Blatchley  This is an award to support research to determine conditions  under which Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, Giardia lamblia  cysts, several bacterial pathogens and coliphage MS-2 in aqueous  suspension are inactivated when subjected to gamma radiation.  The inactivation experiments will be conducted in batch reactors  using a Cobalt 60 source.  Conditions to be studied include the  influence of carbonate alkalinity and dissolved oxygen on the  inactivation process.  The potential toxicological effects of  gamma radiation on organic substances in water will be studied by  subjecting samples of untreated water from public water supply  sources and treated water prior to conventional disinfection  processes to radiation from the gamma source.  Organic substances  from these water samples prior to and following radiation will be  concentrated using exchange resins and the mutagenicity of these  concentrates will be determined by use of the Ames test  procedure.    Results of this research are expected to provide guidance for  potential engineering design of processes using sources of gamma  radiation to disinfect water and wastewater.  In addition to  providing a process for inactivation of pathogens and destruction  of organic contaminants, environmental technologies based on use  of ionizing radiation for disinfection of water and wastewater  have the potential for avoidance and prevention of pollution by  providing beneficial uses for products derived from high level  radioactive wastes.  ***",
