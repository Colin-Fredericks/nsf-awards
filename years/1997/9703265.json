 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the use of perceptually-motivated  image metrics across a range of important applications in  computer graphics.  A wide variety of tasks in computer graphics  assume some measure of similarity in appearance between two  images.  Such tasks include level-of-detail generation, raster  font design, cartographic element placement, texture synthesis  and shape transformation.  Too often the metrics used in such  work are poor at reflecting what a human would visually perceive  for the given task.  This project will re-visit several areas  within computer graphics and will apply visually-based metrics to  a number of applications with the goal of producing better  images.    Replacing the techniques that are used in existing applications  with perceptually-based measures of image similarity has the  potential to improve the results in a wide range of important  applications.  Applications that can benefit from the use of  image metrics include:    - Simulators for pilot and driver training.    - Computer aided design of mechanical parts.    - Automated map-making.    - Raster font creation.    - Interactive walkthroughs of large building interiors for  architectural review    - Comparison between \"model\" organs and the MRI or CT data of a  medical patient    - Vector and tensor field visualization for applications such as  weather prediction and stress/strain simulations of mechanical  and architectural structures.    This project will investigate using techniques from image  processing and computer vision to help define image metrics for  particular tasks.  Some of the properties that these metrics may  incorporate are: sensitivity to edge strength and orientation,  frequency responses at a number of scales, relative rather than  absolute measures of intensity and color within an image, and the  masking effects that noise has on perception.  Once a metric  is defined, an optimization procedure will be used to minimize  the differences between the generated image or geom etry and the  target object.  The choice of optimization technique will depend  on the application and on the form of the image metric.  Computationally expensive optimization methods may be acceptable  for off-line tasks.  Where speed is essential, heuristics may be  suggested by observations of the optimization routine while it is  executing.    The educational goals of this project are to introduce both  undergraduate and graduate students to computer science research,  to expose the community outside of academia to important  applications of computer graphics, and to disseminate the  programs, libraries and datasets that are developed by this  project to other researchers worldwide.  Students will be  involved in research both through the computer graphics classes  that are being developed and by working within a research group.  ***",
