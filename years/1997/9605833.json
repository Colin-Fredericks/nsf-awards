 "awd_abstract_narration": "When biological thin-film thicknesses or feature dimensions are less  than or equal to the order of  magnitude as the wavelengths of solar radiation, several optical  effects are present. Nature has  developed these complex biological thin-film structures to take  advantage of these microscale  radiation phenomena in order to control the reflectance and absorption  of solar radiation. There  is a need for improved understanding in this field in order to  determine the multiple functions of  these structures. Moreover, as global changes affect the solar spectrum  reaching earth, the  effectiveness of the thin-film functions will be altered which in turn  may affect the ecology.  Additionally, there are lessons to be learned from biological thin-film  structures which may  prove to be important in sub-micron microelectronics, optical coatings,  and solar absorbers.    We propose to develop a numerical and experimental tool, the Microscale  Reflectance Spectrometer, which can be used for these investigations.  Specifically, the proposed technology will allow the radiative  properties of biological thin-film structures to be measured and also  compared against numerical simulations. The phenomenological modeling  of light/film interaction will be improved for other biological  instruments as well as for the microelectronics industry. We expect  research that will stem from the use of this instrument to play a  critical role in the understanding of the functions of the biological  thin-film structures.",
