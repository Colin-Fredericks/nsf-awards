 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harry O. Finklea of the Department of Chemistry at West Virginia   University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program   and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities to carry out fundamental   studies of the nature of electron transfer reactions at electrode   surfaces.  By using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold and other   electrodes, large overpotentials can be reached that are usually   inaccessible without being obscured by other processes taking place at   the electrode surface such as mass transport or double layer charging.    Redox moieties will be tethered to the SAM and kinetic studies will   include coupled proton and electron transfer, a comparison of electron   transfer rates through the tethering chain and through the neighboring   diluent chains, and characterization of the rates of various binuclear   systems with different attachment modes.  Redox centers based on   Co(II/III) will be used to probe the validity of the Marcus   density-of-states model for electron transfer kinetics for the case of   one-electron exchange centers with large and unequal reorganization   energies for the two oxidation states. SAMs will be made with   alkanethiolates.  The objective of this work is to extend our knowledge of the mechanisms   of electron transfer reactions.  Such reactions are at the heart of   batteries and many biological processes.  The particular avenue chosen to   accomplish this is via surface reactions at metallic electrodes covered   with a self assembled organic monolayer.  Such an arrangement makes it   possible to make the measurements required in a manner relatively free   from other electrode surface processes that often interfere.",
