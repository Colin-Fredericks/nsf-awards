The system under investigation responds to the need for new techniques for real-time process control in semiconductor fabrication and Intelligent Fiber Optic Systems (IFOS) proposes to develop a room-temperature benchtop testbed comprising a magnetic orientation electromagnet and a portion of a semiconductor substrate chuck in conjunction with a magnetic sensor based on an innovative combination of technologies including fiber gratings and magnetostrictive coatings. During Phase I, IFOS will: (1) establish details of the sensor specifications, and design and model the sensor probes and system, (2) fabricate fiber sensor probe substrates involving fiber grating with claddings partially removed and coated by magnetostrictive material, (3) construct a feasibility prototype testbed, (4) test and evaluate prototype, and (5) deliver a final report and submit a Phase II proposal. This first-time incorporation of magnetic sensors in plasma Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) is expected to offer improved process control for thin film head fabrication with higher sensitivity and reliability than conventional approaches.   The electrically passive, in-line, multiplexible, low-cost, and mass producible sensor design developed during this research can be applied in in-situ process sensing and will find additional applications in the aerospace, electricity generation, and other industries. The aforementioned features make the proposed sensors marketable and will likely attract non-federal and private sector commercialization funding. ***",
