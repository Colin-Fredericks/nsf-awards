In this follow-up study the basic  mechanisms involved will be studied and techniques will be  developed to optimize the effect using passively generated  vibrations for several target technologies, including  automotive and aircraft brakes as well as electrical  brushes.  It is expected that near the end of the study  subtle design changes can eventually be developed for  automotive brake systems which will enable passive  generation of vibrations that promote the vibration-induced  wear reduction without having any deleterious side effects  and that this could result in a very significant drop in  brake wear.  ***",
