 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sneyd  9706565       Intercellular calcium waves are a ubiquitous and crucial  feature of intercellular communication, and perform a variety of  physiological functions.  Most intriguingly, intercellular calcium  waves in mixed neuronal-glial cultures have been observed passing  from glial cells to neurons, and thus they may possibly have an  important role to play in information processing.  The  investigator uses mathematical models to study the mechanisms  involved in intercellular calcium waves.  The first part of the  work involves the study of the mechanisms underlying  intracellular calcium oscillations and waves in epithelial and  glial cells.  Secondly, in light of recent experimental evidence,  previous models are modified and used to study the mechanisms of  intercellular calcium wave propagation in glial cell cultures.  Finally, in hippocampal explant cultures the intercellular  calcium waves show a remarkable degree of spatial organisation,  forming propagating plane waves and rotating spirals.  The model  is used to determine the mechanisms by which intracellular  calcium waves can be coupled on a much larger space scale to form  intercellular calsium waves with such a high degree of  self-organisation.       Waves of calcium that travel between cells are one important  way in which cells can signal to their neighbours.  Such  intercellular communication, although not yet well understood, is  known to play a vital role in many physiological processes.  For  instance, the response of an epithelial cell layer to a wound is  governed (at least in part) by an intercellular calcium wave,  while, in the brain, waves of calcium can travel from glia to  neurons, and vice versa.  Thus, calcium waves very likely have an  important role to play in information processing.  For these  reasons, there is a great deal of interest in studying the  mechanisms that underly such waves.  Mathematics has an important  role to play in these studies.  By its very nature, wave  propagation is a complex phe nomenon, not easily understood by  intuition alone.  Although mathematics cannot provide answers to  all pertinent questions, when used in conjunction with  experimental results, it can be used to interpret and understand  existing results, while directing the course of future  experimemtal studies.  The investigator (a mathematician) and his  experimental colleagues propose a coordinated series of  theoretical and experimental investigations that will lead to a  greater understanding of how glial cells communicate by means of  calcium waves, and how such communication can coordinate activity  over large regions of the hippocampus.  Funding for the project is  provided by the program of Applied Mathematics and the Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS and by the Computational  Neuroscience program in BIO.",
