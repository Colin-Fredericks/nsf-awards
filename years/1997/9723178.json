 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN:  9723178  PI:  Rodman  The primary visual cortex of the brain is known to be an important center for conscious visual perception, but there are other parts of the brain that also handle visual information in quite complex ways, though perhaps less \"consciously.\"  If the visual cortex is severely damaged, subjects are for most purposes considered blind.  However, special tests can show that there is some kind of residual ability to detect visual targets and some properties about their location, movement and other features.  This phenomenon is called \"blindsight.\"  It offers an unusual opportunity to study how visual activity in the brain can be separated from conscious visual perception.  It is interesting that the degree of recovery from cortical loss is greater in early life, and may actually include some awareness of visual stimuli.  This project utilizes testing of blindsight capabilities to understand differences between visual capabilities in early and in later life.  Anatomical and physiological techniques will be used to see whether cells and their projections from a subcortical center called the thalamus still convey normal visual signals to remaining areas of visual cortex, and whether there are compensatory connections that develop between the thalamus and other brain regions.  Results will be important to developmental neuroscience and cognitive psychology as well as to visual neuroscience, to enhance our knowledge of the organization and development of the visual system.",
