 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Departments of Physics, in collaboration with the Departments of Chemistry and Geology and the College of Engineering, is developing a novel multi-disciplinary approach to the way undergraduate nuclear instrumentation courses are presented.  The program is introducing undergraduates to research quality activities much sooner than traditionally experienced.  It is producing undergraduates who are valuable to investigators as collaborators rather than merely technicians. One fundamental instrumentation course is being offered for many different disciplines, including physics, health physics, chemistry, geology, and engineering.  This approach is providing the fundamentals necessary for the next semester's advanced course.  The advanced course's structure involves several experimental modules, including high-energy charged particle reactions, nuclear magnetic resonance, XRF, UPS, SEM, STM, reactor approaches to critical experiments, environmental radioactivity analysis, and neutron activation.  Students, along with their advisors, are being given the opportunity to select a fraction of the available modules within a semester period, thereby building a program most suited to their needs.  Through a team teaching approach, students interact directly with researchers with expertise in each area of study.  These classes, emphasizing fundamentals of instrumentation theory, stress scientific technique and communication skills.  To make this happen, the project is establishing four experimental stations primarily applicable to the first course, but available as required in the second course.  The stations include five additional microcomputers, four multichannel analyzer cards, four advanced oscilloscopes, and two printers.  Several NIMs are also being added, including five spectroscopy grade amplifiers, one TAC, and one PNMR spectrometer.  Specialty items, including an instructional STM and two alpha spectroscopy systems, are also being acquired.  This program reduces duplication of advanced laborato ry teaching efforts and intensifies the laboratory experience for undergraduates by providing clear vistas between the fundamentals of technology and current technological applications.  *",
