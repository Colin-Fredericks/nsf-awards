 "awd_abstract_narration": "9711722  Grunow    Abstract  This award supports an exploratory program to measure the  anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) on existing samples  of the Ferrar intrusive rocks to provide preliminary magma flow  directions.  The AMS method represents one of the few techniques  available capable of determining magma flow directions and hence,  constrain magma emplacement models.  The Ferrar province (>4000km  long), along with the Karoo province in South Africa, represents  the most significant flood basalt province associated with  Gondwana break-up.  Various models have been proposed in which  the Ferrar magmas are thought to have emanated from a point  source beneath South Africa, beneath the Dufek massif, or from  multiple point sources.  The AMS method provides a direct test of  these models.  Very little AMS work has been done on the Ferrar  province and so it is uncertain whether the Ferrar rocks will  yield any magma dlow information.  Ferrar samples (75 cores) from  a 3000 km segment of this province are presently available and  more will be collected in the upcoming field season and made  available to this project.  These samples will be analyzed at the  University of Michigan paleomagnetism laboratory.  Results will  demonstrate the viability of the method on Ferrar province rocks  and may also provide preliminary constraints on Ferrar plume  versus multiple source emplacement models.",
