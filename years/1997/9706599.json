 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706599  Nachtergaele    The main focus of the project is on quantum spin models that arise in condensed  matter physics. Nachtergaele will uork on three classes of problems in quantum  spin (and related) systems. The first is the characterization of the complete  set of ground states in infinite  volume. Here, ground states are defined in  the sense of stability under arbitrary local perturbations. This problem is  best tractable for models with a unique ground state, such as the AKLT model. A  harder but also more important problem is to characterize the complete set of  ground states when this set includes non-periodic states, such as interface  states, which is the case, e.g., for the XXZ Heisenberg model. A second problem  is to study the fluctuation  properties and low-lying excitations of interface  states in quantum statistical mechanics models both at zero and non-zero  temperature. The proposal is to prove stability of the 111 interface at  sufficiently low temperatures in the Falicov-Kimball model, and, in a second  phase, to study 111 interfaces in the XXZ Heisenberg model, where new   phenomena related to continuous spectrum should be expected. The third proposed  line of research is to analyze and use a new implementation of the Density   Matrix Renormalization Group method to study various phenomena in   quasi-one-dimensional systems.      Quantum statistical mechanics is an area of growing interest because many of   the phenomena that are being discovered and studied today are intrinsically   quantum mechanical: Bose condensation, superfluidity, superconductivity,  quantum optics, quantum computation, and many of the most interesting aspects  of magnetism.  Quantum spin models are models for the magnetic properties of a  large variety of materials, many of which have only been recently synthesized.  The importance of magnetic properties is not just that they allow us to  understand the behavior of magnets. Often there is an interaction between  magnetic (spin) structure and elect ronic and geometric structure of the  material. The novel spin-Peierls materials that in the last couple of years  received so much attention are a good example of this interaction. It has been  known for some time that antiferromagnetic correlations are an important aspect  of high-temperature superconductors. Another example where magnetic and  transport properties influence each other are the Giant Magneto Resistance  materials. The approach in this project is mathematical, and is complementary  to the experimental and theoretical research on the same materials by chemists  and physicists. This proposal addresses fundamental questions about the  mathematical structure of quantum lattice models.  Nachtergaele will also work  on the implementation of new mathematical insights into more efficient  computational methods.  This research will provide hands-on learning  opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students who not only want to  become well-versed in mathematics  but also have an interest in concrete  applications. In the process these students will become familiar with the  language of physicists and chemists working on the same or related problems.  This will prepare them better for future careers in an interdisciplinary  environment.",
