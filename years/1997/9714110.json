The project is  under the direction of S.C. Sharma, University of Texas at  Arlington (UTA) and P.C. Jain, University of Delhi (UD).  The  researchers will study the effects of molecular structure on phase  transition in liquid crystalline materials and will investigate  relationships between defects and optical properties of surface-  aligned liquid crystalline films.  Using techniques sensitive to phase  transition, they will measure optical properties of surface-aligned  liquid crystalline thin films.  The outcome will be a better  understanding of the processes occurring at the surface and in the  bulk, and their effects on the optical properties of a much broader  class of layered materials.    Scope:  This collaboration will initiate a new joint research  program between the University of Texas and the University of  Delhi.  The PIs are established researchers who have published  important results obtained from their experimental techniques.   Both the expertise and facilities available at UTA and UD are  complementary.  This project has excellent potential for addressing  important scientific questions and improving the quality of liquid  crystalline films and other materials. The research is mutually  beneficial and the support requested is primarily for travel and per  diem.    ***",
