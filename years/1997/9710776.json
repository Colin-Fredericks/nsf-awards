 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project focuses on a case study analysis of American environmental toxicology in order to better understand the processes involved in the constitution of interdisciplinary sciences.  Preliminary analysis suggests that, since the early 1970's the field has developed into a well-established interdisciplinary science.  Comprised of government, industry, and academic scientists with training in various biological and chemical sciences, environmental toxicology exhibits substantial evidence of both `cognitive and social institutionalization.`  In contrast to much of the case study literature that documents the institutionalization of mostly larger and older fields representing the traditional disciplinary pantheon, environmental toxicology represents a `deviant` case of scientific development -- the successful institutionalization of an interdisciplinary science.   The project focuses on the questions: How did environmental toxicology achieve institutionalization as an interdisciplinary science? To what extent have institutional actors outside science shaped the organization of research on the ecosystemic impacts on toxins?  In answering these questions, the project draws from research on scientific disciplines and boundary-making, and on the relationships between science and social movements.  The tentative hypotheses focus on the articulation of environmental toxicology with the environmental movement in creating opportunities to establish relationships with diverse, extra-scientific audiences in order to gain legitimacy, secure resources, and recruit new professionals.",
