There are four main research topics: The first topic covers   regression and multisample data under selection bias that   depends on the response variable. A number of semiparametric   models (parametric weight functions, nonparametric  base  distribution) are studied and  maximum likelihood procedures  with related inference tools are developed. Applications to  HIV clinical trial are proposed.  The second topic focuses  on estimation in multinomial models subject to upper and lower  bound constraints on the cell probabilities. This  method is  incorporated into an  EM algorithm for image reconstruction  in discrete tomography . The third topic   extends current   semiparametric regression models to truncation-censoring   cases and heteroscedastic regression models with censored   data. The fourth topic centers on inference for   right-censored random (growth) curves, where the censoring  mechanism depends on the progression of the curve. This is  informative, nonignorable,  censoring and it poses  methodological challenges for the problems of comparing two  groups of curves (treatment and control). Methodolgy based  on U-type statistics is developed, and a semiparametric  accelerated growth regression model  is  introduced  to model relationship between the curves and their  corresponding covariates.    The research centers on statistical methods for problems  in which data collection is impaired by sampling bias,  missing observations, and models with partial information  on the  parameters.  The developed   methods contributes   directly to certain scientific areas considered of strategic  national importance. The research on estimating  cell-probabilities in constrained multinomial models is  incorporated in  an algo rithm for image reconstruction of  binary images in electron transmission tomography;   an important high-tech technology, still in research stages,  for estimating the atomic structure of a crystal layer by  taking projection measurements.  This is important in material  studies and in manufacturing.  The research on semiparametric  selection-bias models  relates to applications in   biotechnology, as it is  developed in preparation   for planned HIV vaccine trials. The goal here, is to have a   methodology  in place  for analyzing HIV-1 sequence data arising    from forthcoming  vaccine trials.",
