Ever increasing integrated-circuit transition speed and packaging density have posed severe challenge to electronic packaging designs. Accurate signal integrity analysis necessitates electromagnetic field simulations to be performed together with circuit simulations. Existing general-purpose commercial electromagnetic tools are unable to provide timely and cost effective solutions for practical electronic packages. This project will investigate a novel method that would be orders of - magnitude faster than conventional general-purpose tools in performing electromagnetic simulation in electronic packages. With the new technique, three-dimensional electromagnetic fields in multi-layer electronic packages are decomposed into several most significant modes, and each mode of field is solved with special fast algorithms. The proposed signal integrity analyzer integrates the fast electromagnetic field solver with transmission line and circuit solvers so that interactions between packages and IC chips are automatically taken into account. Applicability of the technique and feasibility of the proposed signal integrity analyzer for real-world packaging structures are to be investigated in this project.   It is  anticipated that the technique described in this proposal can dramatically reduce the electromagnetic field simulation time and lead to commercial signal integrity tools that can provide timely and cost effective means for the evaluation and design of electronic packages and printed circuit boards.  Such signal integrity tools are crucial for emerging high-speed electronic systems, and should have significant and immediate impacts once they are commercially available.  ***",
