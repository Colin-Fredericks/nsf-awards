 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop high level conceptual modeling and usage features in Object-Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMSs) to improve data analysis and querying. This work contributes to current research within the database community to provide more comprehensive data management support. Areas investigated include Geographic Information Systems (GISs), engineering and other scientific applications. GIS applications have complex data management needs because of the recent integration of thematic and spatial data into the same system. Retrieving such information is currently complex and non-standardized. Interest in GIS modeling and querying has been expressed nationally by NCGIA and UCGIS. Current work is also being done by ODMG to develop OODBMS standards for object- oriented modeling and language support. The work here continues the efforts of these groups by studying modeling and query needs of advanced applications. Another important application investigated involves complex modeling and integration of engineering linear referencing systems. The approach of this research is to analyze modeling and query needs by working within application areas, evaluating the functionality of existing application software, and consulting with domain experts. The results of this research are conceptual models and query constructs that are at a higher level of abstraction than what currently exists for object-oriented modeling and languages. These models and constructs will more closely fit the data organization and query needs of the application to allow more natural representation of the data and expression of query statements. This research will provide stronger data management and analysis capabilities for complex problem solving.",
