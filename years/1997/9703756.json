 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703756  Sela       Zlil Sela intends to complete his sequence of papers on the  isomorphism problem for hyperbolic groups and the sequence of papers  on automorphisms of free groups.  He further plans to complete writing  his work on the structure of sets of solutions to systems of equations  in a free group, and on families of such systems depending on a set of  defining parameters.  This work is based on borrowing notions and  ideas from algebraic geometry and low dimensional topology and  implementing them in group theory.       Sela and E. Rips (Hebrew University) are engaged in a  long-standing investigation of fundamental algebraic structures known  as ``groups,'' structures which abstract and capture the essence of  symmetry.  One of three key problem of the field is the isomorphism  problem, the problem of telling when two groups, presented  differently, are really the same.  It is known that there can be no  general recipe for solving this problem, one that will work for a  completely arbitrary pair of groups.  For this reason, recipes have  been sought that work within large classes of interesting groups, and  Sela is closing in on such a recipe for the class of (Gromov)  hyperbolic groups, groups whose interest derives from being attached  to geometric objects known as manifolds, both arbitrary manifolds of  dimension three and negatively curved ones of any dimension.  The  ideas and techniques evolved in this work have led to other questions  and to unexpected answers, all bearing on the deep and intimate  connection between the algebra of groups and the geometry of  manifolds.  During the last year, Sela has developed a geometric  approach to sets of solutions of equations in a so-called free group.  The approach borrows heavily from algebraic geometry.  More recently  he has pushed this geometric approach further in order to study indexed  families of sets of solutions of equations in groups.  Sela and Rips  now expect that the structure theory they have developed will find  many  applications in group theory and in mathematical logic.  In  particular, they believe that the tools they have in hand will provide  positive answers to several questions posed by the logician Alfred  Tarski around 1950.  Since their techniques borrow heavily from low  dimensional topology, they hope that their structure theory will also  find applications to basic questions in low-d topology.  ***",
