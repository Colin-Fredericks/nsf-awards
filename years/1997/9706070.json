 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to help engineers build  confidence in the correctness of their specifications of  reactive systems (such as those that appear in airplanes,  automobiles, power plants, etc.). Our specific approach  applies model checking---a technique that has proven to be  extremely successful in the hardware domain---to the  specification of systems that include significant amounts of  software. A defining characteristic of the research is the  use of hierarchical finite state specifications of real  systems, including the specification of TCAS-II, an airborne  collision avoidance system. The case studies establish the  range of properties that can be evaluated using model  checking, showing how model checking can be used in an  iterative process to design or analyze specifications. The  research defines tools (including translators from  specifications to model checkers, analysis tools for  interpreting counterexamples, and tools to support iterative  development), as well as model checking algorithms that  increase the size of the state space which is feasible to  check and that extend the capabilities of model checkers for  handling arithmetic operations. Improving the ability to  define specifications in which there is increased confidence  will improve the quality of and reduce the cost of building  specifications of reactive systems that include software.",
