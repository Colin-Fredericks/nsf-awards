 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enormous data sets are now available from high-quality  traffic measurements for communications networks.  Analysis of this data has revealed unexpected properties  of traffic behavior which may critically affect network  performance.  Unfortunately, the development of  statistical and mathematical techniques for efficiently  dealing with this abundance of data and for effectively  analyzing newly-observed phenomena has not kept up  with the rate at which newer and larger data sets of  traffic measurements are being captured, nor with the  pace at which networks themselves change.  The planned  research program responds directly to the need for new  approaches to network traffic and performance analysis  in order to effectively exploit these large data sets and  to understand the impact of the newly-observed  phenomena.    A postdoctoral research fellow will be appointed to  work with researchers at the Information Sciences  Research Center at AT&T Labs and the University of  Wisconsin - Madison.  The research associate will  provide the primary link in the planned collaborative  research program.    This project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS)",
