Thus, as proliferating fibroblasts become quiescent there is a significant decrease in the size of materials that are able to enter the nucleus.  Conversely, nuclear transport capacity increases in rapidly dividing, SV40-transformed cells.  The experiments proposed are designed to investigate nuclear transport during oogenesis in Xenopus laevis.  There are several advantages for using this system to study the regulation of nuclear transport.  First, there is a considerable amount of data, obtained from oocytes, relating to the composition and structure of the pores, as well as the cytoplasmic factors that are required for transport.  Second, since oogenesis is accompanied by a high level of nuclear synthetic activity, these cells are especially useful for studying nuclear transport.  Third, it is possible to correlate nuclear permeability changes with specific changes in RNA synthesis.  In preliminary studies, it was found that there is a size-dependent increase in the nuclear import of colloidal gold particles coated with nucleoplasmin (a Xenopus nuclear protein) as Stage 1 oocytes progress to Stage 2 (early vitellogenesis).  This is accompanied by a shift in RNA production from primarily 5S RNA (during Stage 1) to mainly 18 and 28S rRNA (in Stage 2 cells).  Studies are proposed to further characterize nuclear transport capacity at these stages, and determine: 1, if there are differences in import rates that are independent of substrate size; and 2, if there are corresponding differences in nuclear export.  Transport will be investigated by microinjecting either fluorescent labeled proteins or coated colloidal gold particles into intact cells, and subsequently analyzing the intracellular distribution of the particles.  It has also been established, using permeabilized HeLa cells, that cytosolic extracts obtained from vitellogenic oocytes are more effective in promoting nuclear import than Stage 1  extracts.  There is evidence that this difference is due either to variations in the activity of cytoplasmic translocation factors (rather than binding factors) or to the presence of transport inhibitors (particularly in Stage 1 extracts).  Experiments will be performed to distinguish between these possibilities, and also to determine if known translocation factors (e.g., Ran or p10) are involved in altering transport capacity.        The eukaryotic cell is highly compartmentalized, with various specific cellular functions and metabolic processes localized in one or another compartment.  These functions need to be coordinated and regulated.  The nucleus of the cell is the compartment which contains the genetic material, DNA, and within which all of the DNA-based metabolic functions (replication and transcription) occur.  Those proteins that are involved in these functions are manufactured in the cytoplasm, and must be transported into the nucleus; similarly, the RNA that is transcribed from the genes and serves as the templates for all of protein synthesis must be transported out of the nucleus.   Regulation of nucleocytoplasmic exchange could represent a fundamental mechanism for modulating metabolic processes in cells.  In the proposed studies, changes in nuclear transport will be analyzed during oogenesis in Xenopus laevis (the African clawed frog).  This experimental system is especially suited for examining the molecular basis of transport changes.  ***",
