The conference will explore these changes, why  they have occurred and what has been learned from these  experiences.  The impact of new IT capabilities to provide  life cycle benefits will be explored.  The conference will  highlight the owner/operator's view of this issue with  presentations from large private and public organizations  that have initiated very significant innovations in their  relationships with outside vendors in the A/E/C industry.  There will also be presentations by some major engineering  and construction firms that have participated in these  relationships as well as presentation of some research  projects that are studying the impact of new approaches and  how these can be modeled.",
