 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zardetto-Smith  9707672    Synaptic transmission is the key to understanding the basic operation of the nervous system at a cellular level.  Without transmission, there is no direct communication between neurons.  The classical view of transmission is that of a chemical signal, referred to as a transmitter, released from one neuron which then diffuses to other neurons or target cells where it binds to a receptor and triggers a signal which excites, inhibits, or modulates cellular activity.  More recently, volume transmission which uses extracellular fluid pathways has been recognized an alternative form of interneuronal communication.   Volume transmission includes not only the diffusion of humoral factors through the extracellular fluid to their specific receptors on neurons or glial cells but also the diffusion of electrotonic signals along those pathways.   Neuropeptides, which are stored within large dense-cored vesicles in nerve terminals located near extracellular space,  may be key to understanding volume transmission.  Dr. Zardetto-Smith will use this Research Planning Grant to examine the role that the neuropeptide, angiotensin II, plays in volume transmission.  Angiotensin II is primarily known for mediation of the intake of water in response to depletion of the extracellular fluid content but it will also induce seeking out and ingestion of salty fluids.   Dr. Zardetto-Smith has designed a series of experiments to examine whether angiotensin II functions in a volume transmitter mode, possibly through interactions with specific GABAnergic neurons, under conditions which challenge body fluid homeostatis.  These findings will help us better understand the paradox resulting from the dissociation between the location of transmitters and their receptors in mediating interneuronal communication.  It will also provide new information on the neural regulation of sodium appetite which is very important given the significance of sodium in intracellular mechanisms that are essential for our survi val.",
