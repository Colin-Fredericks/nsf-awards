 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712355  NADLER    Nematodes, the most abundant multicellular organisms on earth, are important components of global biodiversity, play key roles in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and impact agriculture, veterinary science, and medicine.  Certain species are important Omodel systemsO for the study of animal genetics and development.  Correct identifications of named species, correct descriptions of species not yet named, and accurate assessments of the historical (phylogenetic) relationships among species, are critically important for the future development of nematode research. However, nematode species diversity is poorly known, and presently there are few taxonomists trained to work with these animals.      In this work, Steven Nadler and James Baldwin will conduct a comprehensive monographic study of cephalobine nematodes (suborder Cephalobina), a group of nematodes found everywhere in the soil, training a new generation of nematode taxonomists in the process.  Although most Cephalobina feed on bacteria, there is evidence that they are related to certain economically important plant and animal parasitic nematodes.  This study will find out whether such relationships can be substantiated.  Cephalobina also play an important role in regulating available nutrients in healthy ecosystems, and their distribution may prove useful as indicators of environmental disturbances by humans.  This study will provide some of the accurate species identifications needed to evaluate these ecosystem effects more efficiently.  These organisms may also be of utility as simple models to understand basic biological processes such as development and aging.  The work should provide new experts in nematode taxonomy, new tools applicable to the study of all nematode groups, and information on cephalobine nematodes that is widely and conveniently accessible through Internet access to identification aids and databases.",
