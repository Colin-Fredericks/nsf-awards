 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rees    9723050    Conditions of low oxygen (hypoxia) in fresh, brackish and marine  waters are brought about by both natural processes and human  activity. Since many important metabolic processes require  oxygen, a decrease in oxygen availability is a potentially  life-threatening situation for the organisms that live in these  environments. One way to compensate for a decrease in oxygen is  to shift to metabolic pathways that do not require oxygen. This  research will evaluate this response in a common inhabitant of  coastal estuaries, the Gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis. The  activities of enzymes (the protein molecules that catalyze the  reactions of metabolism) will be determined in fish exposed to  hypoxia in the laboratory. These measurements will show whether  these enzymes change in a manner that reflects an increased  reliance upon oxygen-independent metabolic pathways. If the  initial phase of this work shows a change in enzyme activity,  then the later phase will investigate the mechanism of this  change. This research will lead to a better understanding of how  this species, and potentially other, commercially important  species, respond to environmental hypoxia.",
