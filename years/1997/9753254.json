 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award of the program for Professional Opportunities for Women in   Research and Education (POWRE) supports the research and educational   activities of Professor Leah O'Brien of Southern Illinois University at   Edwardsville.  Research focusses on high resolution molecular   spectroscopy of gas phase radicals, with particular emphasis on nuclear   hyperfine analysis and interpretation.  In academic year 1997-98, work   will be conducted at the University of British Columbia, at the National   Solar Observatory facility at Kitt Peak, and at Southern Illinois   University, in concert with undergraduate and graduate students.  The   significance of the research is not only the acquisition of the   fundamental molecular constants obtained by spectral analysis, but also   interpretation of these results, particularly as they relate to chemical   bonding and reactivities.  The opportunity afforded through the POWRE program will enhance Professor   O'Brien's research and leadership potential and her educational mentoring   of students at a predominantly undergraduate university.",
