 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drexel University has become a national leader in restructuring engineering and science education as a result of multi-year efforts.  The experimental E4 program has emerged as an international model for core engineering education in the 21st century.  Its success and the encouragement of virtually every segment of the engineering enterprise, caused the College of Engineering to initiate a program of unprecedented scale and scope to develop a totally new curriculum based on this core.  In the biological sciences, the Enhanced Bioscience Education (EBE) program has gained national recognition for the way it engages bioscience majors in experiential learning and project-based inquiry during their freshmen and sophomore years.  In keeping with the mission of our technological University, the faculty, with support from administration, are now ready to develop additional University-wide reforms and innovations.  The Initiatives for Systmic Educational Reform project is intended to provide the next steps in this continuing process.  The project focuses on overcoming the problems of scale and paradigm changes which are associated with sweeping institutional reforms.  The strategy is to continue curricular innovations of a systemic nature and at the same time expand the University's ability of create further innovations.  The strategy is being implemented using the teams of faculty and the methodologies that created the successes of E4 and EBE.  The cadre of experienced faculty is being expanded with the addition of new faculty to generate the new courses and approaches that are critically needed in our existing reform efforts.  At the same time supporting infrastructures for long-term curricular and faculty development are being established to sustain the effort in the future.",
