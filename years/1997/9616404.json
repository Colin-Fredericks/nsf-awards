 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9616404  de Zafra  Chlorine monoxide (ClO) is a product of the destruction of stratospheric ozone by chlorine, which is present in the stratosphere as a result of the breakdown of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  ClO, as well as other trace stratospheric gases which are important in the Antarctic ozone hole, can be measured from the ground by microwave receivers, similar to those used in radio astronomy.  This project will continue a decade long series of such measurements in order to extend the climatology, but more importantly, to also provide a cross calibration of a new Network for the Detection of Stratospheric Change (NDSC) ClO microwave instrument which has recently been installed nearby at New Zealand's Scott Base.  The NDSC instruments are being installed at a number of sites world-wide as part of a joint NASA/WMO/UNEP program and it is quite important to provide as much correlative information as possible so that the NDSC can be relied upon in the future to monitor the health of the stratosphere.  ***",
