 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project is to develop and implement a \"Introduction to Engineering\" course at the University of South Alabama (USA) and Bishop State Community College (BSCC). The goals of the project are improved retention of first-year students at USA who are not taking Calculus I during their first year, and career exploration and preparation for students at BSCC. The pre-engineering course has the following objectives: 1) gain understanding of the engineering profession; 2) develop problem-solving skills; 3) make connections between mathematics, sciences and engineering ideas; 4) practice teaming skills; 5) enhance written and oral communication skills; 6) develop a positive attitude of self; and 7) use email. The innovation of the proposed project is integration of Service Learning into the first-year engineering design experience: under the guidance of faculty advisors, student design teams will design, produce, and deliver to middle-school teachers educational modules and manipulatives that allow hands-on learning of mathematics. The special audiences targeted are: first-year students at USA who are not taking Calculus I in their first year, students at BSCC who want to find out about the engineering profession; and Mobile County students currently participating in an honors program (Accepting the Challenge to Excel) sponsored by the College of Engineering at USA. The proposed project is a collaborative effort by the College of Engineering at USA, Bishop State Community College, and the SECME (Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in Engineering) program of the Mobile County Public School System. The proposed project has the potential to become a model project for integrating Service Learning into the first-year engineering design experience to improve student retention and recruitment of under- represented groups.",
