 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Thews  Opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in  ongoing research projects in experimental physics are  structured in a summer REU program at the University of  Arizona.  Students may choose from a wide variety of  forefront physics activities, under the direction of senior  faculty members from the Department of Physics.  The main  student audience will be those who have finished the  equivalent of the first or second year curriculum in science  or engineering at Pima Community College, in preparation for  transfer to a 4-year degree program.  This program is also  available to similarly prepared students from regions  outside southern Arizona who will be resident in Tucson  during the summer.  Graduate Teaching Assistants from the  physics department serve as mentors for the students.  Special orientation and skills activities are individually  tailored to enable the students to continue their  associations with the research project after the completion  of  the summer REU program, most often as paid laboratory  associates.  Recruitment activities place special emphasis  on women and underrepresented minorities.  Because most  students will start in this program at a very early point in  their scientific education, we encourage continuity in their  development by allowing past participants to apply for  admission in subsequent summer sessions.  ***",
