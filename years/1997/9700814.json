 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700814  OPELL    Aptostichus is the most diverse genus of trapdoor spiders in North America.  Most species are in California, where they occupy at least 13 of the state's 16 biological regions, including desert environments.  Since many of these habitats are threatened, studies of Aptostichus can contribute significantly to an understanding of the conservation biology and ecology of these regions.  Despite its extraordinary diversity and interesting geographic and ecological distribution, this group has received little attention and only four of its estimated 25 species have been described.      In this research, Brent Opell and doctoral candidate Jason Bond will revise the taxonomy of Aptostichus and test hypotheses about how these species arose.  The phylogenetic history of the genus, and species boundaries within the genus, will be evaluated using both morphological and molecular (mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence) data.  The morphological data will also contribute to knowledge of the distributions, variations in morphological features, and natural histories of these spiders, while the sequence data will provide insights into their biogeography, speciation processes, and desert adaptations.  The approach is novel in that it integrates morphological and molecular approaches to questions of species delineation, phylogenetic history, and natural history in spiders.",
