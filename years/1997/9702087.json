 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the  development of laser based single wavelength detection  spectroscopy as a highly sensitive and selective detection  scheme.  Professor Chen and his undergraduate students at  Spellman College will experimentally determine the capabilities  of this detection scheme as applied to Raman and resonance Raman  spectroscopy.  The objective is to characterize the extent to  which unwanted spectral interferences caused by fluorescence and  absorption effects can be eliminated from the analytical signals  being measured.  This CAREER research project will expose African  American women students to a newly developed laser laboratory  experience through hands-on experiments.  As one of the nation's  two Historically Black Colleges and Universities for women, this  underrepresented minority student population at Spellman College  will have the opportunity to use this new laser laboratory and be  stimulated to consider the opportunities for them in science and  engineering as career options.  The development and characterization of laser based methods for  quantitative analysis in a broad range of scientific areas is the  focus of this CAREER research project.  Single wavelength  detection spectroscopy will be studied by Professor Chen and his  students at Spellman College in the new laser based laboratory  that has already been developed.  Undergraduate students in this  women's Historically Black College and University institution  will gain hands-on experience in the operation and use of lasers  in state-of-the-art analytical measurements.  An innovative  course integrating lasers, optics, and spectroscopy is being  taught using this laboratory facility through a cooperative  effort by chemistry, physics, and mathematics faculty.",
