 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615268  Day  There is strong evidence that the climate of the Antarctic  Peninsula has changed appreciably in this century.  Weather  records indicate that mean summer air temperatures have  risen >1oC over the past 45 yr at some Peninsula locations.  In addition to this warming trend, springtime ozone  depletion events have resulted in well-documented increases  in UV-B radiation levels.  These rapid changes in regional  climate provide a unique opportunity to assess the impacts  of climate change on vascular plants.  While the presence of  only two native vascular plant species (Deschampsia  antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis) and their sparse  distribution in Antarctica attest to the severe conditions  for plant survival, there are already indications that  climate changes are exerting a strong influence on these  species.  Regional warming appears to be leading to rapid  increases in populations of these species, based on censuses  along the Peninsula.  The influence of enhanced UV-B levels  on these species is less clear.    An experiment has been initiated in which temperature and UV  radiation levels are manipulated around naturally growing  Deschampsia and Colobanthus plants on the Antarctic  Peninsula to assess their response to these factors.  Assessment involves examining changes in photosynthesis,  growth and reproduction of these plants following warming or  exclusion of different UV components.  During the first  field season growth significantly improved under warming  treatments.  Exclusion of UV did not have any significant  effects, although conclusions from this short-term  assessment would be premature.    Field manipulations will be continued, and expanded in the  current assessment of plant responses in four key areas:  (1) photosynthesis, (2) general thermal adaptations, (3)  reproduction, and (4) soils.  These areas are critical to  understanding plant responses to climate change in  Antarctica.  (1) Photosynthesis - Antarctic plants have  unique photosynthetic charact eristics including the ability  to photosynthesize at near freezing temperatures and a high  sensitivity to moderate temperatures.  Using in vitro and in  vivo techniques including gas exchange, chlorophyll  fluorescence and enzyme assays, the mechanisms responsible  for these unique photosynthetic traits will be examined. It  will also be determined whether these species can alter  these traits in response to changes in climate.  (2) General  thermal adaptations - These plants must also possess  well-developed thermal adaptations that allow them to  survive in the Antarctic. Cell membrane stability, osmotic  potentials and supercooling characteristics of these plants  will be noted to determine how these characteristics change  in response to our field manipulations. (3) Reproduction -  Warming appears to substantially improve sexual reproduction  in these plants.  However, high levels of UV-B may reduce  reproductive success by damaging pollen.  The influence of  these opposing factors will be observed by examining the  production and viability of pollen and seeds under field  manipulations.  (4) Soils - Nutrient cycling plays an  important role in controlling plant responses to changes in  climate. Baseline information will be collected on pools of  nutrients (C, N, P) in soils and plants under our field  manipulations, which will be complimented with measurements  of soil respiration.",
