 "awd_abstract_narration": "Henning Meyer of the University of Georgia is supported by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities to investigate the structure and dynamics of   van der Waals complexes using high resolution near infrared spectroscopy   in combination with counterpropagating pulsed molecular beam scattering.    The van der Waals complexes to be studied contain an infrared chromophore   and a monomer amenable to state-specific multiphoton ionization.  Thus   vibrational excitation of the monomer can result in predissociation of   the complex, and by detecting the fragments, Meyer will measure   fundamental and overtone cluster bands with rotational resolution.  From   these measurements, he will gain information on the fragment velocity and   angular momentum anisotropies as well as the state correlation, the   dissociation energy of the complex, and state-specific cross sections for   the monomers.  Ultimately, from these experiments he will derive the   multidimensional potential energy surface.  The PI will carry out a   parallel theoretical effort:  ab-initio electronic structure calculations   and quantum mechanical solutions to the bound state and scattering   problems.    The interest in molecular clusters has been motivated largely by the   prospect of developing a more detailed understanding of bulk matter   through the access to direct quantum specific information on finite sized   cluster systems.  Dimers are of particular importance as the first step   towards describing bulk material at a molecular level.  Their structure   and dynamics can be described in terms of a multidimensional potential   energy surface which is crucial to a variety of very active research   areas like the molecular modeling of solvent effects and biomolecules.    The concept of a potential energy surface is also the basis for the   theoretical description of bimolecular reactions and vibrational energy   transfer, and therefore it plays a key role in the modeling of such   diverse gas phase processes as combustion, atmospheric warming and   pollution due to the release of man-made substances.",
