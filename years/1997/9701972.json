A new technique has been developed with which  the shear modulus and internal friction of films with  thicknesses as small as 10 nm on silicon substrates can be  measured at low temperatures.  The substrates are couleDpaddle oscillators which are  chemically etched out of 0.3 mm thick ultrahigh purity  silicon wafers.  These oscillators are to be used to study  polycrystalline metal films deposition by various  techniques. in which  exploratory measurements have revealed  an internal friction which resembles that of amorphous  solids.  It is remarkably independent of the metal used, and  at this point shows little dependence on the way in which  the film has been deposited.  As a possible explanation,  tunneling states of dislocations will be explored.  %%%  This is a renewal proposal on the elastic properties of thin  metal films.  This metal films on substrates are often used,  e.g., as current leads in the microelectronic devices.  In  order to ensure their performance, defects in such films  have to be identified and controlled.  In previous work, we  have developed a new technique for measuring elastic  constants of crystalline metal films on silicon substrates.  We have found that all films measured so far hjave an  internal friction at low temperatures which resembles that  of amorphous solids, indicating a considerable amount of  disorder.  The objective of this investigation is to  identify this disorder, and to find ways to reduce it.",
