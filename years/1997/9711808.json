Analytic solutions for  the  mechanical properties of this two-phase  material  have  been  elusive  because of the complexity  of  the  inclusion  shapes.   The  finite  element meshes are  based  on  images  produced  from  analysis  of laboratory  produced  partially  molten  peridotites.  To investigate S-waves,  the  mesh  is  strained  with a step function in simple shear as a boundary  condition  and  time is stepped forward allowing  stress  to  decay  as  the melt flows and relaxes viscously.  From  this  stress   decay  function  the  frequency  dependent  complex  elastic   moduli  are  computed,  yielding   the   frequency  dependent  seismic velocity and attenuation.  The method  is  benchmarked   by   comparing  finite  element   results   to  relatively simple cases with known analytic solution  (e.g.,  ellipsoids  and  triple junction tubule-shaped  inclusions).  Permeability  is modeled by applying a pressure differential  across  the  meshed  sample, and calculating  the  hydraulic  conductivity of the network from the bulk fluid transport.",
