 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the number and significance of concurrent software  systems continue to increase, the need for reliable methods  to ensure that these systems behave as intended becomes more  pressing.  A number of very different analysis techniques  have been proposed by researchers, but experience with these  techniques is limited chiefly to simple academic programs  and little is known about which techniques and tools are  most appropriate for particular problems, or how to use the  techniques effectively in practice. This project involves  carrying out a series of experiments to gain information on  the applicability of these techniques to real concurrent  programs.  These experiments include the analysis of several  real programs as well as controlled experiments with special  programs designed to isolate particular features identified  in the analysis of real programs as having  significant impact on the utility of one or more of the  analysis tools.  The results of those experiments will  provide guidance to software developers, feedback to  researchers developing analysis techniques, and a set of  benchmark programs and properties that can be used in the  development and evaluation of additional analysis  techniques.",
