 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support for a program to make high  resolution studies of variations in the concentration of  methane, the oxygenisotope composition of paleoatmospheric  oxygen, and the total gas content of deep Antarctic ice  cores.  Studies of the concentration and isotopic  composition of air in the firn of the Antarctic ice sheet  will also be continued.  One objective of this work is to  use the methane concentration and oxygen-isotope composition  of oxygen of air in ice as time-stratigraphic markers for  the precise intercorrelation of Greenland and Antarctic ice  cores as well as the correlation of ice cores to other  climatic records.  A second objective is to use variations  in the concentration and interhemispheric gradient of  methane measured in Greenland and Antarctic ice cores to  deduce changes in continental climates and biogeochemistry  on which the atmospheric methane distribution depends.  A  third objective is to use data on the variability of total  gas content in the Siple Dome ice core to reconstruct  aspects of the glacial history of West Antarctica during the  last glacial maximum.  The fourth objective is to  participate in collaborative studies of firn air chemistry  at Vostok, Siple Dome, and South Pole which will yield much  new information about gas trapping in ice as well as the  concentration history and isotopic composition of greenhouse  gases, oxygen, trace biogenic gases and trace anthropogenic  gases during the last 100 years.",
