 "awd_abstract_narration": "Georgia Southern University (GSU), a unit of the University System of Georgia, is the largest and leading center of higher education in the southern half of the State.  Distinguished as having been the fastest growing college or university in the United States for the years 1987-1992,  GSU has sustained a 104% increase in enrollment since 1985.  The University is committed to providing academic excellence to a diverse student body, particularly in the sciences. Establishing a partnership with the National Science Foundation, GSU will  aid the university in its endeavor to improve its scientific infrastructure by modernizing the Herty  Building.  Constructed in 1958, the facility is home to the Departments of Chemistry and Geology/Geography, and has never been renovated.  Funding from the ARI Program, combined with university and State funds, will be used to renovate five chemistry and four geology laboratories. Geology laboratories support faculty research in geochemistry, igneous and metamorphic petrology, sedimentology, invertebrate and vertebrate paleontology, economic geology, geomorphology, and palynology. Chemistry facilities support faculty and student research and training in physical chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry and analytical chemistry.  Existing research space is antiquated to support current research activities and consists of the following deficiencies:  old laboratory benches, inefficient space utilization, poor lighting, exposed ductwork and pipes, and outdated fume hoods.  Renovations will encompass:  upgrading of electrical, HVAC, and lighting systems, installing new lab benches, cabinetry and fume hoods, and installing additional fixed equipment.  The renovations will create a more efficient, functional, and safe working environment, which will permit the full use of geology research equipment currently available.  The project will provide facilities capable of supporting the rapidly growing research programs of chemistry and geology faculty and students.  The project will continue a significant university effort to improve science facilities, and upholds the institutional goals and NSF's core strategies by:  1) strengthening  the physical infrastructure, 2) integrating research and education, and 3) developing intellectual capital by attracting and supporting activities among groups and regions that traditionally have not participated as full stake holders in science, mathematics, and engineering.",
