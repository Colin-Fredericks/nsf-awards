 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615988  IRWIN  People make rapid eye movements called saccades in order to  examine the world around them.  The still periods between  saccades are called fixations.  It is well known that vision is  suppressed during saccades; therefore, visual information about  the world is acquired only during fixations.  This research will  investigate whether saccades also interfere with particular  cognitive processes.  Preliminary findings suggest that this may  be true, but the evidence is not convincing; this research will  provide some steps toward a definitive answer.  The experiments  will examine whether cognitive processes that are set into motion  during one eye fixation continue to operate while the eyes are  moving to a new position in space or whether these processes  pause during the eye movement.  People will be presented with a  simple mental task that they will begin to perform while they are  fixating one position in space and will then make either a short  or a long saccade to a different position in space while  attempting to continue performing the task.  If cognitive  processing is suppressed during eye movements, then long saccades  (which take longer to execute) should disrupt performance more  than short saccades (which take less time to execute).   Performance will also be measured in another condition, in which  the eyes do not move.  Performance in the eye-movement conditions  should be equivalent to performance in the no-eye-movement  condition if eye movements do not interfere with cognition.    The average person makes about three saccades per second (hence,  about 172,800 saccades per 16-hour working day), and the average  saccade lasts about 30 ms; thus, if suppression occurs during  saccades, it would mean that cognition is disrupted for  approximately ninety minutes each day.  If this happens, it is  truly remarkable.  Thus, determining whether this occurs is of  fundamental importance to the understanding of human cognition,  particularly for activities such as reading  and scene perception  that require many eye movements.  ***",
