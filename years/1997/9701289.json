Specifically,  Raman  mode  frequency   shifts  and  Lamb-M ssbauer  factors  will   be   measured  systematically  as a function of glass composition  to  establish  the  mean coordination number dependence of local elastic constant, C,  and  the  first-inverse moment of the vibrational density of  states,  w-1.  Random network model simulations of both C and w-1 in glasses are  now  available  from numerical experiments, provide a convenient  guide  to  compare   with  laboratory  experiments.   The  nature  of  structural  relaxation   at  the  glass  transition  will  be  studied   in   MDSC  measurements  to establish the non-reversing heat-flow DHnr  variation  with  composition.   Preliminary experiments on  chalcogenide  glasses  reveal  that DHnr also displays a minimum at the stiffness  threshold,  c=2.4   suggesting  that  only  minuscule enthalpy  changes  accompany  structural  relaxation  of a glassy liquid  when  it  is  mechanically  critical.  Mean-field constraint counting procedures also reveal  that  for  networks  possessing terminal atoms such as one-fold  coordinated  atoms (halogens) the stiffness transition in general shifts to a lower  mean  coordination c < 2.4.  These ideas will be put to a quantitative  experimental test in suitable Raman, M ssbauer and MDSC experiments in  chalcohalide glasses.  %%%  This  is  a  renewal  project  to study the  physical  nature  of  the  stiffness  threshold in chalcogenide and chalcohalide  glasses.   Many  glasses  containing the elements S or Se or Te are viewed as  networks  composed of atomic-chain fragments (with a mean atomic coordination of  2).  These  chain-fragments  can  be  progressively  cross-linked   by  alloying other atoms.  Mechanical ri gidity of such alloyed networks is  found  to  increase  progressively with  degree  of  cross-linking  as  measured  by  the  mean coordination number of a  network.   When  the  coordination reaches 2.4, theoretical calculations predict a floppy to  rigid  transition  and  stiffening of the  network  beyond  2.40.   We  propose  to carry out an experimental study on specific glass  systems  to  decode the physical nature of the underlying stiffness transition.  This  transition, which corresponds to a magic composition in a  glass  system,  is of general interest in glass science because some  of  the  best glass formers occur near this magic composition.  Furthermore, an  understanding of this transition will also help unravel the mysterious  and  elusive  nature  of structural arrest that occurs  at  the  glass  transition.   Such  information will also assist in tuning  the  glass  composition   for   optical,   thermal,  electronic   and   mechanical  applications.  ***",
