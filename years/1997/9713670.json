 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objectives of this research project are to develop a  transparent and practical set of design tools for synthesizing  controllers for guaranteeing acceptable performance in uncertain,  unstable plants under hard actuator saturation; to develop a  methodology that removes the need for integral control and more  generically the need for imbedding an internal model inside a  control loop for a large class of problems; and to demonstrate  the applicability of the developed methodologies on two  laboratory systems; one a single flexible link attached to a  rigid hub and the other a flexible link driven by a worm gear  transmission. In order to achieve the objective of developing a  design methodology, first stable, uncertain singleinput single-  output (SISO) plants under saturating control is considered.  Next, SISO, linear, uncertain plants with poles in the closed  left half plane subjected to actuator saturation are enclosed and  finally linear, uncertain plants with poles in the right half  plane subjected to actuator saturation are investigated.  Preliminary results indicate that using local feedback around the  saturation nonlinearity such that the closed loop system has an  impulse response of one sign allows the system to gracefully come  out of a saturation state so that feedback remains active for the  most part. Both time domain and frequency domain methods are  considered. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design  methodology two laboratory scale systems currently available in  the PI's lab at Texas A&M University are used. Both systems are  fully instrumented to be controlled by a PC. One of the systems  has a model linearized about a trajectory characterized  by poles  on the imaginary axis and the other has a linearized model  characterized by poles in the right half plane. The key goal of  the demonstration are to let the driving d.c. motors saturate and  to compare the performance with a controller design that does not  explicitly consider hard saturation.",
