Most known     hyperthermophiles were cultured from rock and water samples collected  at deep submarine     hydrothermal vents or terrestrial hot springs. Although much has been  learned about microbial     physiologies, phylogenetic diversity, and novel metabolic pathways from  this relatively sparse set     of organisms, the true extremes of genetic diversity and metabolic  strategies on Earth and     elsewhere are impossible to predict a priori. This concept is  underscored by the widely accepted     notion that less than 0.1 percent of all extant microbial species are  currently known. Knowledge of     microbial species thriving in extreme environments can be expanded  through the application of     innovative methods to isolate and culture novel species of  extremophiles. Like all living     organisms, hyperthermophiles are intimately associated with their host  environment. Therefore, a     detailed understanding of the geochemistry of hydrothermal environments  is likely to place     constraints on essential substrates for life. To reach this overall  goal, this project will     combine thermodynamic calculations to determine potential energy  sources with detailed chemical     analyses of hydrothermal fluids to design new media for growing a wide  variety of  hyperthermophiles.     The readily accessible and chemically diverse hot springs in the  Aeolian Islands, Italy, including     those on Vulcano, are ideal sampling sites for this highly  interdisciplinary study.",
