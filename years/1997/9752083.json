 "awd_abstract_narration": "Illnois State University, in partnership with Des Moines Area Community College and a business/industry advisory council, is directing a curriculum and materials development project designed to infuse business knowledge, skills, and attitudes into community college advanced technological education programs.  This project addresses the need for preparing a multi-skilled, technically competent workforce with teamwork skills and an understanding of business competitiveness issues.  The intent of the project curriculum is to enhance student school-to-work experiences and then ensure greater lateral and upward mobility within their advanced technical occupational arenas.  The curriculum uses a modular design and allows the instructor flexibility in using the modules as stand-alone units or together as an articulated sequence with existing programs.    The methodology encompasses a best-practice curricular content review, industry-led curriculum content analysis and development, module development, multiple pilot tests, and project evaluation by an external consultant.  The main deliverable will be a set of three cross-disciplinary modules with content determined by an industry/business advisory council.  An activity-based instructional learning cycle is used employing constructivist views of learning.  The curriculum emphasizes problem solving, real-world applications, and connections among the disciplines. Each module is highly interactive and experiential in nature to provide a variety of experiences to enhance student learning.  Instructional materials employ and integrate the latest advances in computerized role-plays and simulations, interpersonal role-plays, interactive CD ROM, video conferencing, Internet and world-wide web applications, cases for analysis, strategy formulation, and decision making.  In year two, industry-led curriculum development and pilot test data on student learning enhancement are being disseminated via publications, workshops, and seminars.    The primary goal of this p roject is to develop curricula, instructional materials, and faculty enhancement activities base upon input from an industry/business advisory council.  This industry input is used to create and develop cross-functional curriculum content that reflects the real world interconnections among business and advanced technological education.  This integrated and synthesized, activity-oriented curriculum is congruent with emerging business and industry trends.    The goals of this project also include investigation of research questions which can be grouped according to whether they relate to integrated knowledge, skills, and attitudes, or problem solving, or staff development.",
