 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence of patterns as an organizational and design tool  can help abate what Brooks calls the accidental complexity of  software development.  This project addresses practical and  pedagogical concerns of the computer science and software  engineering communities with an integrated approach to the use,  learning, and teaching of patterns.  Work in Design Patterns to  date has focused on the recognition, cataloging, and finding of  patterns with little attention to the use of patterns by  experienced software practitioners and particularly by students  and practitioners not well-versed in object-oriented  technologies.  The foundation of the project is the design,  development, and delivery of a layered support structure for  design patterns.  The first layer focuses on how to use catalogs  of patterns, idioms, and architectures accessible to those  without a deep background in object-oriented programming and  methodologies.  The second layer builds on this catalog by  developing methods for using patterns based on heuristics for  recognizing when specific patterns are applicable and relevant.  As part of both layers, the project bridges the gap between  novice and expert designers by developing resources to aid in the  recognition and discovery of patterns.",
