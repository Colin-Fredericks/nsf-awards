 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705007  Meier       Meier will continue determining feasible methods  for computing the Sigma-invariants of infinite groups.  The  Sigma-invariants of a group G determine the finiteness properties  of normal subgroups above the commutator subgroup of G; they  are also closely connected to the Thurston norm on the homology  of a 3-manifold.  A program will be started to find concrete  examples illuminating the recent extension (due to Bieri and  Geoghegan) of the Sigma-invariants to a theory encompassing  group actions on CAT(0) spaces.  In another direction, Meier  will study generalizations of Cannon's almost convex property  that are presentation independent and that still have strong  topological and computational properties.       Group theory was originally introduced into the sciences  through the study of symmetry: symmetry of naturally occurring  objects, molecules, solutions of equations, etc.  Geometric group  theory proceeds by re-introducing geometric techniques into a  field that had become highly algebraic.  Most of Meier's work  focuses on two main ideas: (1) exploring the implications of  certain geometric structures in terms of algebraic properties;  and, (2) looking for computationally effective means of working  with important families of groups.   Often a syncretic approach,   combining the geometric and computational perspectives, yields  the strongest results.     ***",
