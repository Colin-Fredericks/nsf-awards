 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one day meeting, called the East Coast Computer Algebra Day,  will be held at Northeastern University, Boston, on Saturday, May  3, 1997.  The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate interest in  and enhance understanding of the technical aspects of computer  algebra, by providing a way for those in the region who are  active or interested in becoming more active in computer algebra  to meet with each other in an inexpensive and easily accessible  way.  This meeting will be more informal than the annual ISSAC  meetings, with ample time for unstructured interaction.  Participation by the region's graduate students will be  particularly encouraged through special invitation to contribute  to the poster sessions, and through travel support.  In addition,  the offer to fund travel and hotel for graduate students makes  this is an important opportunity to attract more women and  minorities into the computer algebra community.  For many  professionals and graduate students on the East Coast, the  current meeting represents the most accessible opportunity over  two years to meet with a significant portion of the computer  algebra community.  Both ISSAC and IMACS (major computer algebra  meetings) were held in Europe last year, and will be held in  Hawaii in summer, 1997.  Northeastern University is inside Boston  itself, with excellent mass transportation, including subway  connections to bus, train and plane.    Three invited speakers will anchor the meeting and will help  attract participants.  The invited talks and poster sessions  contributed by the community will cover the breadth of computer  algebra: algorithms, software, and applications.",
