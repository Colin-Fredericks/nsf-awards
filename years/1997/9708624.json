 "awd_abstract_narration": "Configurable computing can customize the hardware of a computing environment for  each application.  Recently some configurable machines based on field-  programmable gate arrays have shown significant performance improvement over more  traditional processors.  However, this performance has come at the cost of  meticulous and time-consuming algorithm mapping.    This research consists of two projects that attempt to lower the cost of entry  to configurable computing.  In the uniprocessor domain, performance monitoring  and compilation techniques are under investigation for systems that integrate  configurable hardware with traditional processors.  Drawing on SUIF compiler  technology, this project is working toward identification and optimization of  code sections that are both time consuming and implementable using configurable  hardware.  Such code includes stream-oriented data processing, irregular logic  operations, and short integer arithmetic.    In the multiprocessor domain, FPGAs are being used to implement application-  specific cache coherence protocol processors.  The key contribution of this work  will be studying the performance tradeoffs of application-specific software,  configurable hardware, and custom hardware.  These may lead to expanded benefits  for application-specific protocols.",
