 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kopell  9706694       The investigator and her colleagues study the dynamics of  networks of neurons, especially networks whose output is  rhythmic.  The research uses methods of dynamical systems to  understand how properties at the cellular level (intrinsic  membrane dynamics) and the interconnections among the cells  (synaptic properties) affect the network behavior.  The research  focuses on two kinds of problems.  The first concerns the  mechanisms by which networks synchronize or partially  synchronize.  These problems mainly concern cortical networks in  which there are large numbers of similar cells.  The other class,  motivated mainly by smaller invertebrate networks, is concerned  with the determination and regulation of network frequency and  relative phases among cells in the network.  In both classes of  problems, the work is motivated by specific networks of neurons,  but the techniques are broad enough to allow generalization of  the results beyond the motivating examples.  The dynamical  systems methods to be used and developed exploit the many  different times scales associated with the intrinsic and synaptic  dynamical processes of the cells.  One goal is to understand how  network behavior is modulated by changing parameters that alter  which subset of dynamical processes is most important in  producing the network output.       Networks of neurons producing rhythmic output are found in  neural systems governing motor control, sensory processing, and  in both sleeping and awake states.  Rhythmic activity in the  nervous system is also seen in pathological states, such as  epilepsy and Parkinson's disease.  Though there is much detailed  information about the physiology of participating cells, it is  not understood how networks that make use of dynamically  complicated components are constructed to carry out their  appropriate tasks.  This research aims to identify mechanisms by  which coherence, frequency and phase relationships of the  rhythmic network output are regulated.   Such identification can  potentially allow scientists a deeper understanding of how the  nervous sytem uses rhythms to produce appropriate behavior, as  well as techniques for removing rhythmic activity that produces  pathological states, including tremor.",
