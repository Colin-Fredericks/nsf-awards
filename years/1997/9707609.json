St. Mary  9707609       ABSTRACT         Sex allocation theory has provided a powerful conceptual framework from   which to understand allocation patterns in a wide range of organisms,   included those that have separate sexes, as well as those that are   hermaphroditic.  However, there are some organisms for which current theory   is clearly inadequate.  Individuals of two temperate species of fish   (gobies) in the genus Lythrypnus (L. dalli and L. zebra) simultaneously   devote energy to both male and female functions, although they reproduce via   only one sex at a time.  Further, gonadal allocation varies with body size   (i.e., ontogenetically).  This overall pattern of sex allocation cannot be   explained by reference to existing theory.  The PI's recent theoretical work in   this area suggests that costs of changing sex plays an important role in the   evolution of these mixed strategies.  To examine this hypothesis the PI  will   conduct a detailed examination of the pattern of sex allocation throughout   the genus Lythrypnus.  This will be done in an explicitly historical   context, integrating studies focused on phylogenetic reconstruction and   field and lab experiments designed to quantify the costs of reallocation and   associated patterns of allocation and behavior.  The genus Lythrypnus   includes 20 species, which range over both temperate and tropical seas,   including the eastern Pacific, the Atlantic and the Caribbean.  Five species   have been recently examined histologically.  All are simultaneous   hermaphrodites; however, they differ significantly in sexual pattern.  Within the context of this proposal the PI will initate collection of the   additional data needed to understand the evolution of complex allocation   patterns in hermaphroditic organisms.  The overall program goals include 1)   development of a phylogeny for Lythrypnus based on molecular data; 2)   documentation of variation in sexual patterns in Lythrypnus (i.e.,   ontogenetic and among-individ ual variation in sex allocation); and 3)   application of field and laboratory experiments to quantify the degree of   sexual flexibility, the costs and benefits of each sexual function, and the   costs of reallocation.  Ultimately, the PI will map sexual patterns and potential   selective factors onto the phylogeny to provide an integrated test of the   hypothesis generated from the PI's dynamic model.    This work and studies of this sort provide a basic understanding of sex allocation patterns in hermaphroditic species.  Many fishes, invertebrates and plants are hermaphroditic and our management, harvesting and control of such species is predicated on an understanding of their sexual and mating systems.",
