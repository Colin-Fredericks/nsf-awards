Under this Program, the National Science  Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Office of Naval Research  are jointly evaluating and supporting research of high priority to the USWRP.            Over the past decade, a significant efforts have been directed toward research  and data collection initiatives that focus on improving numerical weather prediction.   These investments have been somewhat successful and state-of-the-art in numerical  weather prediction has truly advanced through a deeper understanding and improved   parameterizations of the physical processes involved, new and better data  assimilation techniques, and greatly improved numerical schemes.  Despite this  progress, however, precipitation still remains one of the most difficult variables to  predict quantitatively in atmospheric models.  Also, the inherent uncertainty  associated with numerical predictions often makes the interpretation of forecasts  difficult and limits their practical utility.        The Principal Investigators have proposed an interdisciplinary approach to the  problem of predicting precipitation on the storm-scale and interpreting the numerical  forecasts.  The approach will involve utilization of an advanced mesoscale  meteorological model coupled with advanced statistical techniques.  The  Investigators will address the following three objectives, with emphasis on the use of  storm-scale models, initialized using radar and other fine-scale observations, to  generate quantitative precipitation forecasts and associated ensembles to be used in  applications such as hydrologic modeling and flood prediction.          Formulate and study a suite of multiscale statistical measures of forecast     performance  which can help to detect and correct deficiencies in microphysical     parameterizations and obtain forecast assessments at application-appropriate     scales, e.g., basin-average rainfall.    Develop a probabilistic framework under which forecast improvements and the     limits of predictability of current numerical weather prediction (NWP) models     can be assessed while explicitly acknowledging forecast uncertainty and     dependence on scale.    Develop a probabilistic framework for assessing the practical utility of deterministic      forecasts for risk-based decision making.    Successful completion of this research will potentially open the doors to improved  quantitative precipitation forecasting and better utilization/interpretation of numerical  forecasts.  ***",
