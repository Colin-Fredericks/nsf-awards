 "awd_abstract_narration": "9720622  Kieffaber     In this project,  the nighttime airglow from neutral atoms and molecules will be observed at four wavelengths which originate at four different heights in the atmosphere. An existing all-sky imager will be upgraded by incorporating a cooled CCD device which produces digitzed images.  The all-sky images will record the detailed structure of airglow emissions while an eight-channel photometer measures intensities at four airglow wavelengths. These data  will be analyzed to determine wavelengths and speeds of gravity waves passing through the airglow layers. The small scale structure and fluctuations will give information about turbulence and energy dissipation caused by the passage of gravity waves. The photometer also measures the intensity of the airglow continuum at four wavelengths; analysis of these data can enhance understanding of the photochemical and dynamic processes occurring at these atmospheric heights. The research will add to an existing data base covering eight years and three latitudes.   This project is supported by the POWRE program, which will allow the PI to spend a sabbatical focusing on this research, and involve undergraduate students in the project. Despite being at an undergraduate institution, the PI has maintained strong ties to the CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) community but has not been able to devote significant amounts of her time to research.",
