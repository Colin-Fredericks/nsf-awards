The research component explores atomic  scale  synthesis  and characterization of metallic thin  films  and  multilayers grown by molecular beam epitaxy techniques.   It  focuses   on  three  main  objectives:   (1)  to   elucidate  diffusion processes during epitaxial nucleation and  growth,  and  to  develop techniques for producing tailored epitaxial  structures and morphologies, (2) to understand the nature of  spin-dependent  scattering responsible for  the  oscillatory  magnetic  coupling  and giant magnetoresistance  effects  in  metallic  multilayers,  and  (3)  to  shed  light  on   low-  dimensional    penomensa   by   exploring   monolayer    and  submonolayer systems.  The education component seeks to make  positive   impact  on  the  intellectual  climate   of   the  community.   It employs a two pronged strategy.   First,  it  focuses on improving teaching effectiveness in the classroom  by   transforming  traditional  lecture  presentations  into  participatory,  discovery-based courses.   Second,  research  and education opportunities in artificially structured nano-  materials  are  developed  for  high  school  teachers   and  students   in   the  Chapel  Hill-Durham   area.    Outreach  activities   toward  the  local  community  include   mentor  programs, lab tours, and journal clubs.    %%%    The CAREER plan seeks to enhance both research and education  in  materials physics at the University of North Carolina at  Chapel  Hill.   The research component focuses on  exploring  novel   electrical  and  magnetic  properties  of  synthetic  metallic nano-structures.  It seeks to elucidate the role of  artificial  constraints  on  material  properties,  and   to  enhance  our  ability  to  produce tailored  electronic  and  magnetic sturctures.  It is pursued by systematic studies of  atomic  scale  materials synthesis and ma terials  properties  using  state-of-th-art techniques including  molecular  beam  epitaxy   and  scanning  probe  microscopy.
