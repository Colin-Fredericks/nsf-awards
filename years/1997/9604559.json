 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604559  Kairiss    This project examines the connections between two brain  regions that are known to be involved in memory functions,  the amygdala and perirhinal cortex. It is not known how  these areas interact during the storage and recall of  memories. The project addresses this question by examining  the details of how these areas are connected, how they  communicate with each other, and how one might modulate the  ability of the other to store information. It is believed  that memories are formed in the brain when the connections  between nerve cells change their effectiveness, thereby  increasing or decreasing the communication between them.  This project examines whether signals from the amygdala  control how memories are formed in the cortex by influencing  this process in the cortical nerve cells. Insights gained  from these studies advance the understanding of the  mechanisms by which different parts of the brain interact  during information processing and storage. Such insights are  fundamental to advancing our knowledge of how humans and  artificial intelligence systems learn new information, store  it, and recall it when needed.",
