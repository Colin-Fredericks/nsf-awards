Initially, the multiple-parameter gas sensors are proposed for engines operating on a methanol reformate. Where H2, CO, methanol and other electrochemically oxidizable or reducible gases are present, the sensor design and measurement concept will also be applicable to engines which operate on distillate fuels or natural gas to power hybrid electric vehicles or building and utility equipment. Feasibility of the miniaturized sensor design and monitoring concept will be demonstrated during Phase I for hydrogen, methanol and carbon monoxide concentration measurements in the fuel stream. The electrochemical cell will be based on Giner's membrane electrode assembly techniques, using polymer electrolytes in combination with thick-film electrodes. During Phase I, collaboration with industry and research laboratories actually involved in reformer and fuel cell development will be sought in preparation for the Phase II product development program and for funding of Phase III product engineering and manufacturing transfer.   The anticipated products resulting from this project are reliable, robust, stable, and inexpensive electrochemical gas sensors for use in fuel-cell-powered electric engines.  Reformer efficiency control, fuel cell poison protection, and emission monitoring will be the main applications of these devices.  A multimillion-dollar market is expected from this market segment.  It is envisioned that these devices may also have broad application in environmental monitoring and industrial process control. ***",
