 "awd_abstract_narration": "A detector that will be constructed for an experiment  at CEBAF to measure rare radiative decays of the Phi Meson.  The experiment is a collaborative effort involving nuclear  and high-energy physicists from several universities.  It  has received the highest rating from the CEBAF Program  Advisory Committee.  The total cost of the detector will be  shared with the Department of Energy and with several of the  universities involved in the project; this funding is  already in place.  Partial support will be provided by the  NSF Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) as part of  an enabling initiative for instrumentation development.       The goal of the experiment is to measure rare radiative  decays of the phi meson in order to study the quark  structure of daughter states as well as to probe possible  symmetry violations.  Sensitivity to branching ratios at one  part in ten thousand will permit significantly improved  charge conjugation tests, as well as providing important  information about the structure of poorly understood scalar  meson states.       The detector will consist of an electromagnetic  calorimeter which will detect all-photon decay modes of the  phi meson.  The requested funds will be used to construct a  charged-particle veto wall to ensure a neutral final state,  a dedicated data acquisition system, and various ancillary  devices such as a suitable target and beam pipe and  calibration system for the calorimeter.  Graduate education  is a central but implicit element in this project.",
