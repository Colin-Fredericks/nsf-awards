Castner of  the University of Washington to work with Professor Martin  Schmal at the Federal University in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  on the influence of support and additives on Pd-based  catalysts for emission control.        The goal of this project is to clarify catalytic processes  which are relevant to environmental protection.  They will  investigate the relationships between the activity of a  series of palladium-based catalysts and their surface  structure.  They will prepare catalysts and test them with  classic techniques, such as activity measurements, surface  areas, temperature programmed reduction, and porosity.  Their surface structure and composition will be  characterized using facilities at the University of  Washington, which are not available in Brazil.  Schmal's  group has extensive experience in the characterization of  supported catalysts with reactor studies, selective  chemisorption, temperature programmed reduction and  temperature programmed oxidation and adsorbate structure.  The U.S. group brings expertise in the area of surface  analysis and the surface science of catalysis.  Findings  from this research will be useful in developing commercial  supported catalysts with optimum structures and maximum  emission control activity.  The full kinetic and mechanistic  information will identify critical barriers and operating  conditions that limit emission control activity, and  possibly provide a basis for developing strategies to  overcome barriers and limitations.  The results will also  provide information about properties that would be desirable  to have for a promotion of emission control catalysts.  *  *  *",
