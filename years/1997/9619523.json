 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619523  Constraint logic programming (CLP) is a family of  programming languages built upon predicate calculus, with  the added expressiveness of constraint-based problem  representations.  Each language in the family is  distinguished by the domain of values for the program  variables. Prolog is the best-known language in the family  and can be viewed as CLP in the domain of infinite trees.  This research focuses on CLP over a real-number domain  (CLP(R)). Implementations of CLP(R) generally restrict  constraints to linear equations and inequalities, and the  resulting languages have proven expressive enough for a  variety of scheduling, warehouse location, cutting stock,  options trading, and crew rostering problems, as well as AI  puzzles. However, CLP(R)'s usefulness is limited by the  large search space required for most problems and by the  complexity of the constraint satisfaction algorithm. Stated  more simply, it is not always possible to benefit from CLP's  expressiveness, since many useful problems take too long to  solve. The goal of this research is to identify CLP(R)  applications that would be feasible if execution could be  sped up, and to find ways to cut down on execution time  through a more efficient constraint satisfaction algorithm.  ***",
