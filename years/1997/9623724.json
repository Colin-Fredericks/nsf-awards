The general theory  has provided a new direction and impetus to classical Lie theory by  introducing a notion of order or \"positivity\" to the theory and thereby  opened up new contact points and applications to other disciplines.  At  the group level, the appropriate objects to be investigated are those  subsemigroups of Lie groups that are generated by their one-parameter  subsemigroups.  At the Lie algebra level, it is a special class of cones  called Lie wedges.  And at the level of homogeneous spaces, it is the  interrelated notions of homogeneous causal orders and homogeneous causal  structures.  The theory of these corresponding structures is the principal  focus of this investigation.       Classical Lie theory has proved itself an extremely versatile and  powerful mathematical tool with a host of applications in geometry,  mathematical physics, differential equations, and a wide variety of other  disciplines.  There has already been a substantial development and  application of Lie theory in the new directions with which this project  is concerned, the theory of optimal control of systems being an area of  notably successful application, and it is anticipated that the program of  research will significantly enhance both the theory and its applicability.  ***",
