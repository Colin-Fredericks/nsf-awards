 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704025  Naughton    A highly sensitive cantilever magnetometer will be developed for  use in pulsed magnetic fields.  It is anticipated that this  device will achieve a sensitivity of order 10-12 Am2 (10-9 emu)  in fields up to 100T, thus exceeding the sensitivity of  conventional detection methods by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude.       The motivation for this project is the thermodynamic study  of physical phenomena in the highest available magnetic fields,  which are now obtained only in transient, pulsed fields of 10-2  to 1 second duration.  At the present time, experiments in pulsed  fields are restricted to studies of magnetotransport, magneto-  optics, and magnetic susceptibility.  For the latter, an  inductive method is usually employed, wherein a voltage  proportional to the derivative of the magnetic moment with  respect to magnetic field is induced in a multi-turn coil.  If  one integrates this susceptibility signal AC=dm/dH, one obtains  information about the magnetic moment m, with typical sensitivity  to moment of 10-8 to 10-9 Am2, or 10-5 to 10-6 emu.  With the  successful development of a cantilever magnetometer for the  pulsed field regime, a very significant improvement over this  inductance method can be realized.  %%%       In this project, we will design, fabricate and test a  variety of cantilever devices configured especially for use in  long (~10-1 s) and short (~10-2 s) pulse magnetic fields.  A low  field pulse system will be assembled for local temporal  characterization of the new devices, with full characterization  taking place at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory's  Pulsed Field Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  If this  projects succeeds, it will significantly enhance the measurement  capabilities of a large and growing number of investigators  working with pulsed magnetic fields, by making sensitive  magnetometry an accessible technique to a variety of physical  systems in fields approaching 100T.  Upon successful completion  of the project, t he new devices will be made available to users  at the NHMFL @ LANL.  It therefore has the potential to benefit  many researchers in the condensed matter sciences.  In addition,  there is significant potential for the transfer of this  technology to industry.  ***",
