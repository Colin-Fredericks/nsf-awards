 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Wayne Gladfelter at the University of Minnesota is   supported by the Advanced Materials Program in Chemistry and the   Electronic Materials Program in the Division of Materials Research. The   twofold goals of the research are the development of new precursors to   gallium nitride which will permit lower processing temperatures, and the   development of synthetic schemes for the growth of nanocystalline   particles of defined size. New volatile precursors will be based   primarily on gallium hydride complexes and organogallium azides. The   chemical reaction mechanism of the deposition will be examined using film   growth kinetics and isotopic labeling. Specific labeling of the   precursors with deuterium and simultaneous profiling of H and D using   forward recoil elastic scattering spectrometry will permit the   determination of the  source of hydrogen incorporation in the films. A   novel chain-termination approach will be used to control nanocrystal   particle size using known and new gallium hydride complexes. Under this   approach, unreactive chain terminating groups will coat the surface of   the gallium and nitrogen groups on the particles and prevent further   growth or agglomeration.  Gallium nitride is an attractive candidate for optoelectronic devices   capable of absorbing or emitting blue light. This research will provide a   picture of the evolution of gallium nitride film structure as a function   of time, temperature, pressure and precursor structure. By correlating   these data with studies of the deposition mechanism, the critical   connection between growth chemistry and film composition and structure   will be made.",
