 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program is designed to bring together 8 very bright  undergraduates from colleges and universities throughout the  country, where there is little or no opportunity for  undergraduate research.  Participants will be given an  opportunity to learn how to do research in mathematical and  computational sciences and they will be involved in numerical  linear algebra and parallel computing research projects.    Activities include instruction and laboratory experience in  numerical algorithms for linear algebra, parallel programming  languages, learning how to use a multicomputer (32-processor  Intel iPSC/860, network of SUN workstations using MPI programming  environment), literature review, design of parallel algorithms  and their implementation on the multicomputer, presentation of  research results.    The program this summer begins May 30, 1997 and lasts 8 weeks.   The participants may continue on their research when they return  to their home institutions and prepare a paper for presentation.   In the past, students have made presentations at UMR, a national  undergraduate research conference, and at the Annual Argonne  Symposium for Undergraduates.",
