 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research on main group compounds by Dr. Gerard F. R.   Parkin of the Chemistry Department, Columbia University.  Synthetic,   structural, mechanistic and thermodynamic studies will be undertaken to   provide a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of main group   (e.g., Al, Ga, Ge, In, Sn, Tl) complexes and their potential   applications.   Emphasis will be placed on metal-alkyl and   metal-chalcogenide complexes and on the energetics of metal-main group   multiple bonds.  A series of  new, structurally analogous compounds will   be prepared using sterically-controlling ligands.  The ligands to be used   include poly(pyrazolyl)hydroborate, tris(imidazolyl)phosphine, and   tetraaza(14)annulene.  The steric environments created will be capable of   supporting monomeric alkyl, hydride, chalcogenolate, subvalent, and   multiply bonded chalcogenide and pnictide derivatives.  Chalcogens S, Se,   and Te are included in the study; pnictogens include P and Bi.   Complexes of main group elements find application as precursors for   ceramic materials, semiconductors, and superconductors.  For example,   binary II-VI chalcogenides (e.g., ZnSe and ZnTe) and III-V pnictides   (eg., GaAs and InP) are used in photovoltaic energy conversion devices,   light-emiting diodes, solid-state lasers and optical switches.  Ceramics   and porous solid state materials formed from chalcogenides and pnictides   are also in use.  In this study, new molecular compounds of controlled   structure will be prepared and characterized in order to better be able   to correlate the chemistry of these compounds with the properties of   materials containing them.",
