 "awd_abstract_narration": "This in an award to provide support for research on a  modification to a suspended growth biological process used for  treatment of wastewater to enhance its ability to reduce the  phosphorus content of the process effluent.  The objective of  this project is to elucidate the mechanism of the enhancement  process.  This is planned to be accomplished by isolation of pure  cultures of organisms that have been identified as capable of the  enhancement process, study of their growth characteristics,  metabolism and genetic control.  The procedures to be used in  this project include enrichment techniques for isolation of the  organisms from suspended growth reactors exhibiting significant  phosphorus removal, verification of their ability to enhance  phosphorus removal in pure culture and determination of their  growth characteristics, metabolism and genetic control.  Specific  objectives include determination of growth characteristics of  isolated organisms and their ability to shift from completely  aerobic conditions to aerobic/anaerobic cycling and back to  completely aerobic culture conditions.  The investigators plan to  determine the influence of phosphorus, carbon substrates and  anaerobic shifts on gene expression, the interactions between an  energized cell membrane and transport of phosphorus and acetate,  and the importance of intracellular storage materials.  The project is expected to provide a better understanding than  now exists of the fundamental microbial mechanisms involved in  enhanced biological phosphorus removal by suspended growth  biological reactors.  This improved understanding is expected to  improve the engineering design of suspended growth biological  reactors used for treatment of wastewaters that contain  phosphorus including adequate control to improve the efficiency  with which they meet their design objectives.***",
