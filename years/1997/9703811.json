 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703811  Sethuraman   The fluctuation behavior of a single, or \"tagged\" particle moving in certain   asymmetric stochastic dynamical systems is studied.  The stochastic systems fall into two   model classes: Conservative particle systems, and Brownian trapping models.  The first   category includes the simple exclusion and zero-range systems, while the second category   considers variants of the \"Wiener Sausage\" model.  An important difference between these   two classes lies in that the random environments presented to a particular particle are   \"changing in a comparable scale\" in the first and \"slowly varying\" in the second. Although   the tagged particle fluctuations are well understood with respect to reversible versions of   these models, little is known when these processes possess a drift.  This project focuses on   developing various estimates and limit theorems which do not depend on symmetry, so as   to identify the non-reversible tagged particle fluctuation picture.   Two sample questions which are addressed in this work are: What are the effective   statistics governing the behavior of a typical passenger interacting with other passengers   moving in a complex Customs queue? Consider a thick porous stone roof of a cave; what   is the chance that a rain drop will weave its way through the fissures in the stone to drip   into the cave, and what strategy does it take to avoid being absorbed into the stone?    These two questions fit into the framework of the so-called \"tagged\" particle problem   which is the main subject of this project.  Abstractly, a particle, such as a passenger or a   rain drop, interacts with a random environment.  The goal of this project is to understand   the fluctuation probabilities of this particle interaction in various systems with   asymmetries.  The motivation for this work is that the most general situations in many   physical phenomena of interest, such as fluid flow, queuing, and chemical ion trapping   behavior, are well modeled by these asymmetric p rocesses.  The significance of this   project is that asymmetry is a main feature of the models considered; previously, research   proceeded under the less palatable assumption of symmetry which often simplified the   models beyond application.",
