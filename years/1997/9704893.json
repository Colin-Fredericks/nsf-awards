 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704893  Rozansky       An important development in 3d topology of the last decade was a  discovery of \"quantum invariants,\" most notably, the Jones polynomial  of links and the Reshetikhin-Turaev (RT) invariant of 3-manifolds.  Although these invariants are quite effective in classifying knots and  3-manifolds, their topological nature remains mostly obscure.  The  purpose of this research is to study the topological origin of quantum  invariants by decomposing them into simpler pieces, called \"finite  type invariants,\" and trying to explain the nature of these pieces  individually.  This might be accomplished by using the tools of  quantum field theory, in particular, the asymptotic expansion of path  integrals through Feynman diagrams.  E. Witten has identified the  Jones polynomial and RT invariant as certain path integrals taken over  the classes of SU(2) connections on a 3-manifold.  This approach has  already led to a discovery of the Alexander polynomial and Milnor  linking numbers inside the Jones polynomial.  The simplest \"pieces\" of  the RT invariant were identified (at least, as a conjecture) with the  Chern-Simons invariant of flat connections, Reidemeister torsion and  SU(2) Casson invariant.  One hopes that more complicated topological  invariants, such as the Casson invariant of other Lie groups, will be  found among other pieces of the RT invariant.       A classification of knots is an open topological problem.  A knot  in topology is a closed rope (i.e., a circle) which is knotted.  Can a  particular knot be untangled by continuously deforming the rope  without cutting it?  How can one determine this just by looking at a  picture of the knot?  This problem may be solved if one finds enough  knot invariants.  A knot invariant is a number that can be calculated  by examining a picture of a knot.  The number should not change when a  knot is continuously deformed.  Thus if a knot invariant takes  different values on two knots, then these knots are different, because  they cannot  be deformed into one another.  For a long time the only  effective knot invariant was the Alexander polynomial.  A lot of new  invariants, such as the Jones polynomial, were discovered during the  last decade.  These invariants are quite effective in distinguishing  knots, but their origin is still a mystery, because their topological  interpretation is mostly missing.  The purpose of this project is to  try to fill this gap by using the tools of quantum field theory, such  as path integral and Feynman diagrams.  The relevance of quantum field  theory to low dimensional topology was discovered by E. Witten.  He  demonstrated that the Jones polynomial comes from a particle theory in  which knots appear as space-time trajectories of hypothetical  elementary particles.  The particles interact with each other in ways  that resemble the \"real life\" particles.  This approach has yielded  numerous mathematical conjectures that may lead to a better  understanding of the topological nature of the Jones polynomial and  ultimately to the classification of knots.  ***",
