 "awd_abstract_narration": "9610176  Lewis  This is an award to support research on the potential of using  phytoremediation for removal of radon from soil surrounding  buildings as a step toward reducing the pollution of indoor air  from this radioactive gas.  The objectives of this project are to  determine the amount of radon that can be removed from soil by  vegetation and to develop a soil-plant-atmosphere radon transport  mathematical model that may provide additional insights into the  mass and diffusional transport of water-soluble gases by plant  vascular systems from soil to air.  This laboratory study  involves experimental simulation of the soil-plant-concrete  basement system typical of constructed buildings by physical  models placed inside plant growth chambers with controlled  temperature, light and relative humidity.  Quantitative  determination of radon relating to controlled variables will  provide the basis for development of the simulation model.    Results of this project are expected to provide insights into the  potential for reduction of radon levels in residences.  An  expected product is a determination as to whether a field-scale  investigation is warranted, a step that would be needed to  translate knowledge to be gained into procedures for engineering  and architectural design of new buildings and addressing radon  pollution of existing structures.  ***",
