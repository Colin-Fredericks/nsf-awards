The function of GTP-binding proteins in such diverse biological processes as sensory perception, hormone action, and growth control depends on their ability to cycle between inactive (GDP-bound) and active (GTP-bound) conformations in a precisely regulated manner.  The overall objective is to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the function of GTP-binding proteins.  The experimental approach will combine high resolution structural studies by X-ray crystallography with biochemical and mutational experiments in order to identify the principal stereochemical determinants that govern the nucleotide dependent interactions between GTP-binding proteins and the structurally diverse factors to which they are coupled.  The work will focus initially on: (1) combined mutational and structural studies on the mechanism of heterotrimeric G protein coupled signaling.  The experiments will examine the significance of conserved interactions predicted on the basis of previous structural work to be important for stabilizing the active or inactive conformation of the   G( subunit.  Alanine and homologue substitutions will be introduced at specific amino acid residues.  The ability of the mutant G(( subunits to interact with the G( subunits and undergo the conformational changes associated with activation will be assessed using a variety of well established biochemical assays.  To characterize the effects on the structure, the mutant proteins will be crystallized in the GDP-bound, GTP-bound and heterotrimeric forms and the corresponding structures determined by the molecular replacement method.  The second objective is to (2) develop suitable systems for structural and biophysical studies of the interaction between monomeric GTP-binding proteins and their cognate exchange factors.  These studies will focus initially on the 13 kDa exchange fac tor Mss4 and its cognate G protein Rab3a which functions in the regulation of neurotransmission.   This study concerns a large and physiologically important family of GTP-binding proteins (known as G proteins) that play a fundamental role in diverse biological processes including sensory perception, hormone action, neurotransmission, and growth control.  The function of these proteins in such diverse cellular processes depends on their ability to cycle between two distinct forms, an inactive form in which GDP is bound to the protein and an active form in which GTP is bound.  The switch from the inactive form to the active form is controlled by a family of proteins known as GDP/GTP exchange factors.  The initial objective is to identify structural elements that are required to stabilize the active or inactive form and distinguish these from features that modulate the interaction with proteins which specifically recognize one form or the other.  Molecular biological methods will be used to alter specific amino acid residues in transducin, the G protein that mediates vision in the rod cells of the eye.  The effects on the structure of both the inactive and active forms will be determined by X-ray crystallography and correlated with changes in functional properties assessed by a variety of well established biochemical experiments.  .   ***",
