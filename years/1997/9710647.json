 "awd_abstract_narration": "In systems wherein information is represented and processed digitally, the level  of overall system performance that can be achieved is often limited by the speed  and dynamic range of the interfaces between analog and digital representations  of that information.  Since digitally encoded signals can be processed with  virtually arbitrary precision, continued progress in the scaling of integrated  circuit technology is accomplished by corresponding demand to improve the  precision and speed of so-called data conversion interfaces.  This pressure is,  in turn, accompanied by two constraining factors: the desire to embed data  conversion interfaces within large digital signal processing circuits and  explosive growth in the demand for portable electronic systems.  The integration  of data conversion circuits in VLSI technologies imposes severe constraints on  the dynamic range available to implement those circuits, while the concern for  battery life in portable systems often dictates substantial reductions in power  dissipation in comparison to traditional applications.    The principal objective of this research is to discover circuit design techniques  for digitizing signals with bandwidths of several MHz using standard digital CMOS  technologies.  The research focuses on the use of oversampling methods to encode  MHz-bandwidth radio signals centered at IF frequencies in the range of a few tens  of MHz and on methods of increasing the resolution of Nyquist-rate converters for  digitizing baseband signals with bandwidths on the order of 10 MHz.  A  complementary theme of the research is operation from a low supply voltage with  minimum power dissipation.",
