To date, most erosion and denudation studies have been confined to sites where long-term measurements of river sediment flux or reservoir sedimentation rates happen to be available.  This makes them vulnerable to variations in lithology and land use, which alter erosion rates and thus obscure the effects of topography and climate.  However, cosmogenic nuclide techniques now permit us to measure long-term erosion rates, without requiring decades of sediment yield data.  This dramatically broadens the range of sites where erosion rates can be measured.  Sites can now be chosen to isolate specific factors of interest (such as climate and topography), and to minimize the influence of other variables (such as lithology).   This project combines new cosmogenic nuclide techniques for measuring erosion rates, and an efficient experimental design, to systematically explore how climate and topography affect weathering and erosion rates in unglaciated granitic terrain.  To minimize the effects of lithologic variation, this study will focus on dirites and granodiorites of the Sierra Nevada.  Nine localities have been chosen, across which annual precipitation varies ten-fold and annual average temperatures vary by over 10oC.  Within each locality, a series of small subcatchments will be selected, encompassing at least a five-fold range of average hillslope gradients.  The site selection protocol is specifically designed to encompass the widest possible ranges of precipitation, temperature, weathering rates, and topography, in nearly all possible combinations.  With this experimental design, one can explore how weathering and erosion rates vary with topography under several different climatic conditions; conversely, one can also explore how climate affects we athering and erosion in a range of topographic situations.   At each subcatchment, long-term erosion rates will be measured from the concentration of cosmogenic nuclides in sediment draining from streams or gullies in each subcatchment.  A recently-completed pilot study shows that cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in alluvial sediments record the spatially averaged erosion ate of the contributing area (to within+% or 1cm/ka), averaged over 2-15 ka.  This method of measuring erosion rates is useful for several reasons:  (a) it reflects a spatially averaged erosion rate, rather than the erosion rate of an individual--and possibly anomalous--point, (b) it reflects long-term erosion rates rather than recent land-use disturbance (a major confounding factor in previous studies), (c) it averages over short-term fluctuations in climate and sediment yield, but predominantly reflects the Holocene climate, and (d) it averages erosion over timescales that are relevant to hillslope processes, but still short enough that the underlying topography has not changed.  At several sites, chemical weathering rates will be inferred from stream solute fluxes, and the regolith profile will be sampled to determine the degree of chemical alteration.   This research is designed to quantify, for the first time, how weathering and erosion rates depend on climate and topography in a single well-defined lithology.  It should contribute to our understanding of feedbacks between tectonic forcing, erosion, and climate, and should help us to model landform evolution more realistically.  It should help in interpreting river sediment fluxes and chemical denudation rates in continental-scale geochemical studies, and should provide an extensive new data set for process-oriented studies of weathering and erosion.  Finally, this study should aid in estimating long term \"background\" erosion rates, as a benchmark for measuring the erosional consequences of human land use.",
