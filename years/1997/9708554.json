 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry Program   is made to Drs. Paul G. Tratnyek, V. Renganathan, and David R. Boone of   the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Oregon Graduate   Institute, for studies of contaminant fate in anaerobic sediments.  The   research is supported by the Divisions of Chemistry and Earth Sciences   and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  Some contaminants   undergo reduction in anaerobic soils, but the biochemical and geochemical   factors controlling the chemical reaction are not well understood.  The   goal of this research is to develop molecular probes that can elucidate   reduction processes in sediments from coastal, estuarine, and freshwater   environments.  Initial work will use 2-chloroacetophenone (2-CAP) to   monitor the reduction process.  This chemical is reduced to   2-(chloromethyl)benzyl alcohol when it reacts by electron transfer, and   to acetophenone when reduced by hydride transfer.  By measuring the   amount of each of these three compounds present in the sediment, the rate   of reduction and the capacity of the soil for reduction will be   determined.  The formation of acetophenone implies reaction with   extracellular nicotinamide, one of the few possible sources of hydride in   such systems.  Results will be correlated with microbiological studies to   develop a model of the biogeochemical reduction process in various soils.    Additional molecular probes will be studied as means of more fully   characterizing the reducing capacity of real environmental materials.  Pollutants such as chlorohydrocarbons, sulfoxides, and quinones can be   transformed in soils by chemical reactions in which electrons are added   to the contaminant from environmental sources, both organic and   inorganic.  The details about how these reactions occur as well as the   rates and extent to which they occur in various types of soils are not   sufficiently understood to predict contaminant fate in the environment.    In this research a general method to test the environmental relevance of   various models will be developed with the long-term goal of providing a   predictive tool useful to regulatory decision-making.",
