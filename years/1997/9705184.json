 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705184  Chevalier  This is an award to support preliminary work on use of  surfactants to alter the interfacial tension of fluids that  change the characteristics of their movement through aquifers  they have contaminated.  The project involves procedures that  simulate the use of pumps to withdraw non-aqueous fluids such as  gasoline that have contaminated aquifers.  The research will be  conducted by use of a laboratory-scale model that can be used to  study the effect of the surfactants on the capillary,  gravitational and viscous forces that affect the motion of fluids  through porous and permeable subsurface formations.    The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to  an NSF Program Announcement for Research Planning Grants and  Career Advancement Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers, NSF  93-130.  Results are expected to provide information that can be  used in determining the feasibility of the process to be studied  and the basis for further research in restoration of water  quality in aquifers contaminated by non-aqueous fluids.  ***",
