 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710204  Wight  The research project will investigate the seismic response of  exterior frame connections in composite (steel-concrete)  structures, with emphasis on defining a \"repairable damage\" limit  state and investigating the effectiveness of standard repair  methods for composite connections.  Currently such connection  subassemblies are being subjected to reversed cyclic loading of  increasing displacement magnitudes, eventually reaching  displacement levels corresponding to approximately 5% interstory  drift.  This degree of interstory drift is beyond the \"life  safety\" limit state and approximately at the \"collapse  prevention\" limit state.  Approximately four of the six specimens  for repair will be retested and two additional RCS exterior  connections with designs similar to two of the original specimens  will be constructed for retesting.  These specimens will be  subjected to reversed cyclic loading to increasing displacements,  stopping the testing at interstory drift level should be below  the \"life safety\" limit state, but beyond the \"immediate  occupancy\" limit state.    Post-test analytical studies will be used to simulate the  measured RCS connection behavior during both its original and  repaired behavior.  The degree of stiffness and strength  retention, and amount of energy dissipation capacity at various  interstory drift levels, will be compared between all specimens,  with special emphasis on the comparison of the results for the  same connection in its \"original\" and \"repaired\" conditions.   Analytical models will be developed for use in trial designs of  RCS frames structures.  The analytical modeling and trial designs  will be coordinated with current U.S. research projects on RCS  frames at other U.S. universities and Japanese research  institutions.    This is a project supported under the NSF initiative No. 94-154  \"Composite and Hybrid Structures\".  ***",
