 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern cryptography relies heavily on assumptions about  the asymptotic intractability of certain number-theoretic  problems. However, at the implementation level, assumptions  about the concrete complexity of problems of a fixed size  must be made (e.g. the intractability of factorization  assumption in practice is \"factoring 1024-bit cryptographic  numbers is impossible\").  Determining what \"small-size\" is  too small to be secure is the focus of this project: to  design and implement algorithms which solve, in practice,  those number-theoretic problems which are the pillars of  modern cryptography.  These problems which are vital to  modern cryptography are i) the discrete logarithm problem;  ii) deciding quadratic residuosity modulo a composite  number; iii)  factorization of cryptographic numbers.  These  three problems will be central to this project.  The project  will also consider a host of problems peripheral to these  three:  primality testing, fast arithmetric with large  numbers, diophantine approximation, rapid factorization of  small numbers, factorization of random numbers, and other  problems that will surely arise as research progresses.***",
