 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluvial geochemistry of the Himalayan orogen and the Tibetan  Plateau will constrain three important issues in paleoenvironmental  geochemistry:    1.   The extent to which the uplift has accelerated aluminosilicate  weathering over pre-collision conditions.  such an acceleration has  recently been postulated to be the cause of a reverse greenhouse  effect responsible for the climatic deterioration of the last ~50  my.    2.   The generality of the enhanced flux of U observed in the  preliminary sampling of a few of the Himalayan streams and the  Ganges-Brahmaputra.  This flux appears to be between 10 and 15% of  the global total and could help account for the ~50% increase in  the U/Ca in foraminiferal calcite now in the process of being  developed.    3.   The origin and cause of the uniquely high fluxes of radiogenic  Sr observed in the rivers sampled to date.  This flux accounts for  the dramatic rise over the last ~40 my in the seawater 87Sr/86Sr  ratio as recorded in marine limestones.  If such a flux enhancement  is characteristic of Himalayan-style continental collisions then  the isotope curve must be regarded as a marker of specific geologic  events rather than a proxy for weathering rates in general as  assumed in current model simulations of paleo-pCO2.    A very extensive suite of samples has been collected from the  headwaters of the Indus in Northern Pakistan, the Indus and  Brahmaputra tributaries in Tibet and the headwaters of Ganges  tributaries in Nepal.  This sampling program is on-going.  These  will be analysed for the major species and for U, Sr, 87Sr/86Sr,  Rb, Cs and Ba.  This data suite will constrain the deconvolution of  the aluminosilicate versus limestone and evaporite contributions to  the flux and hence the magnitude of the net CO2 sink.  Coupled with  existing data and geological information it will help identify the  sources and causes of the elevated fluxes of U and radiogenic Sr.",
