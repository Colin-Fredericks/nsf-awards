Proposal Number:  CTS-9702699  Principal Investigator: Fabio H. Ribeiro  Institution:    Worcester Polytechnic Institute    This study will be focused on the hydrodechlorination of chlorofluorocarbon compounds on Pd single crystal and Pd supported on carbon and other supports. Better understanding of these catalytic reactions will impact environmental technologies of remediation as well as pollution prevention. The scientific issues are the identification of mechanisms of dechlorination and of Pd deactivation, and of the structural effects on catalytic activity and selectivity. Among the possible structural phenomena, the PI will address organic compound structure effects, metal structure sensitivity, support effects, and crystallite size effects. The techniques to be used include surface structure and composition analysis under UHV conditions (LEED, AES, XPS, TPD), in-situ ultraviolet Raman in a high-temperature (500 C) and high-pressure reactor (1.5 atm), and isotopic exchange reaction in a separate batch reactor. The restructuring of Pd on supports other than C will be studied while addressing in detail the role of the support in the reaction. The educational plan includes the strengthening of an environmental orientation for WPI chemical engineering students. Projects at the junior through graduate levels will involve students studying and solving real problems prompted by existing environmental agency regulations or defined in accordance with industrial collaborators.",
