 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616851  Prahl         Determining how much of the organic matter found in marine  sediments originates from marine primary production and how much  was transported from land is one of the major problems of modern  organic geochemistry. The question of terrestrial contribution to  deep-sea sediments impacts upon our understanding of the evolution  of the sedimentary record, including its usefulness in  understanding past, and future climatic trends in relation to the  global dynamics of carbon and carbon dioxide. To the extent that  transport from land to the deep ocean is aeolian, as is generally  the case for the transport of iron, there may even be links with  factors controlling oceanic primary production.         In this study the principal investigator will use plant wax  analysis and carbon-13 measurements to estimate the amounts of  terrestrial and oceanic carbon in sediment from several deep-ocean  sites. He will use the C-13 and wax chemistry of modern-day marine  plankton and terrestrial plant materials as end-members of a scale  along which analytical results for arbitrary sediments may be  placed. The approach will involved development and validation of  this method for characterizing the deep-sea sediment carbon pool.",
