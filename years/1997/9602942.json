 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to build a multi-user facility for       the growth of plant material in the Division of Biology at the       University of Tennessee in Knoxville. The primary goal is to grow       plants for experimentation under tightly controlled environmental       conditions with respect to light intensity, light quality,       temperature, and humidity.            Reflecting similar developments in animal systems, a small       number of plant species have been selected to represent the plant       kingdom as models for research purposes. This group of one       principal investigator (PI) and four Co-PIs employs Arabidopsis as       a model angiosperm, Pinus as a model for both gymnosperms and       trees, Ceratopteris as a model fern, representing lower plants,       and soybean and Lotus japonicus as models for the interaction       between higher plants and nitrogen fixing bacteria. To take full       advantage of their model characters, optimal but distinct growth       conditions need to be established for each species. The five (Co-       )PIs and two additional major users propose that the diverse and       expanding requirements for plant growth in the Division of Biology       are best accommodated by a cooperatively administered multi-user       facility.            The plant growth facility (PGF) will consist of a core plant       growth unit which will comprise two walk-in growth chambers, six       reach-in growth chambers, and two tissue culture incubators, all       fitted with microprocessor control over light and temperature       conditions.            The PGF will optimize the growth conditions for all the model       organisms used. The new facility will be centrally located and       within easy reach of the major users. A cooperative style of       management will be devised, which shall ensure access to part of       the facility for researchers other than the five (Co) PIs on a       case by case basis. The PGF will serve as a crucial support for        our interdepartmental plant science graduate training program.       Apart from drastically improving our research infrastructure, the       PGF will allow the (Co-)PIs to enliven their teaching programs at       the undergraduate level, for instance by devising an experiment       that will bring plant evolution into the classroom. In building       the PGF, the (Co) PIs seek to create a multi-purpose environment       for the efficient and reproducible culture of plant material,       which will satisfy their diverse and multidisciplinary research       approaches and teaching obligations.",
