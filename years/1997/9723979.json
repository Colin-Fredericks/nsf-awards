 "awd_abstract_narration": "Like the entire body, the brain is composed of cells.  Neurons, the \"thinking\" cells of the brain are unique in  that they connect to each other by long, extensions which  received and transmit electrical signals.  The transmitting  connections (\"axons\") are quite long, and are maintained by  an internal skeleton (the \"cytoskeleton\") that is comprised  of an unique interconnected network of fibers. These fibers  themselves are assembled from repetitive subunits that are  manufactured in the neuron's body and transported into the  axon by a process called \"axonal transport\".  It remains  unclear how the major fibers (\"neurofilaments\" NFs and  \"microtubules\") are organized and how they undergo axonal  transport.  What is clear, however, is that the proper  development of axons (and therefore that of the entire  nervous system) is dependent upon the proper transport and  accumulation of neurofilaments and microtubules within  developing axons. Furthermore, failure to maintain these  fibers during later life can lead to axonal atrophy and the  progressive neuronal death associated with aging and  Alzheimer's disease.      In other cell types, microtubules are known to slide past  one another by means of associated motor-like proteins that  \"walk\" one microtubule along another one.  Similar proteins  are used to move membrane-enclosed packets of material along  microtubules into the axon. Dr. Shea and colleagues  hypothesize that neurofilaments make their way out into the  axon by traveling as cargo of microtubules, perhaps via  similar associated motor proteins.  They will test this  hypothesis by introducing drugs that cripple several  distinct aspects of microtubule assembly and axonal  transport.  If their hypothesis is correct, Dr. Shea and his  colleagues anticipate that these drugs will also cause  axonal transport of neurofilaments to cease.",
