 "awd_abstract_narration": "A  new, state-of-the-art 600 MHz NMR spectrometer and an upgrade for  an  existing  500  MHz spectrometer is requested for shared use by  six  major  users  or  major  user groups at the Department of Biochemistry  at  Tufts  University  School of Medicine and the Department of Medicine at  The  New  England  Medical  Center.  The new instrument  and  the  upgrade  will  be  incorporated into the existing biological NMR facility at Tufts University  School of Medicine and will be located in the Department of Biochemistry.    The  major  user  groups are currently working  on  eleven  NIH  or  NSF  sponsored  projects  that  require modern  NMR  instrumentation.  The  new  instrument and the upgrade are therefore needed for application in a  wide  range of basic biological and biomedical research. The projects include:      (i)  Structural analysis of the domain from SV40 T antigen that bind to    the origin DNA replication, including structure        determination of the protein origin DNA complex.  (ii)      Structure and mechanism studies of serine proteinases.  This    includes work on the type A hepatitis virus 3C proteinase and the glutamic    acid specific proteinase from S. griseus.  (iii)  Development of improved NMR sensitivity through electron-nuclear  cross polarization.  (iv)  Structural analysis and characterization of synthetic crosslinkers  of T cell surface receptors.  (v)   Structural analysis of papillomavirus E2 protein and its complex  with DNA.  (vi)  Structural analysis of human papillomavirus inhibitor proteins.  (vii)  Structural analysis of SH2 domains and other signal transducing  elements.  (viii) Structural analysis of blood coagulation proteins and their  interaction with phospholipids.  (ix)  Structural analysis of cellular adhesion domains.  (x)   Structural analysis of the extracellular domain of the thrombin  receptor.  (xi)  Structural analysis of an anti-DNA antibody.",
