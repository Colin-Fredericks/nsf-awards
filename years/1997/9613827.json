The First Joint Conference was held in 1982, also in Beijing.  This was a highly successful conference that served as a \"door-opening\" meeting to Chinese chemical engineering by the U.S. delegation.  The Second Joint Conference will serve as an ideal forum for U.S. opportunities for cooperation.  As in the First Conference, the AIChE and its Chinese counterpart, Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC), will be sponsors of the Conference.  In addition, the counterpart chemical engineering societies of Germany, Japan and Korea will join as co-sponsors, thus expanding the scope and impact of the Conference.  The Second Conference will be the largest formal international conference in Chemical Engineering.  The proposed budget of $25,000 will provide for 20-25 partial travel grant awards to U.S. authors of papers and invited plenary lecturers at the Conference.  Travel awards will be made based on the following considerations:  (1) scientific or technological merit of the paper; (2) availability of other sources of travel funding; (3) professional qualifications relative to age and position; (4) institutional and geographical distribution.  All awards will be made in full compliance with the Civil Rights Acts of 1964.  NSF travel policies with respect to U.S. air carriers will be followed.  ***",
