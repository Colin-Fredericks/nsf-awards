 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Planning Grant is supported by the Analytical and  Surface Chemistry Program.  Professor Messmer and her students at  Lehigh University will study the structure of polymeric interfaces  with the aim to understand how the structure of polymeric chains  affects the tribological properties of these surfaces.  This work  will correlate the orientation of surface chemical bonds and their  conformation with properties such as phase transitions and  frictional characteristics.  In situ sum-frequency generation  spectrometry will be used to determine the degree of bond order and  structure for these polymeric surfaces because this second order  optical method is sensitive only to interfacial regions and not to  bulk properties that often dominate signals in surface  spectroscopy.  The work will begin with model diblock polymers  composed of polyolefins and polyethylene oxide films on fused  silica surfaces so that C-H stretching, and C-C bending and rocking  modes can be quantified as a function of compositional and  environmental variables.  Results from this work will identify  surface properties that strongly influence the frictional character  of these interfaces.  This work aims to develop a foundation for predicting the surface  frictional properties of polymeric materials through the use of a  surface sensitive spectroscopic method, in situ sum-frequency  spectrometry.  Model diblock polymers will be studied initially.   Through sensitive measurements of the composition and structure of  these polymeric surfaces, small features that greatly control  surface friction will be established.  This work has broad  application in many important technological areas such as  lubrication, anti-flocculating agents, and protective coatings.",
