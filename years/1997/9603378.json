 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in astrophysics between   the NSF Science and Technology (STC) for Particle Astrophysics at the University of   California, Berkeley, and the Laboratoire de Physique Corpusculaire at the College de   France.  The U.S. and French research teams are led by Bernard Sadoulet, Director of the   STC at Berkeley, and Yannick Giraud-Heraud, leader of the French group.  Specifically,   support will be provided to advanced U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral researchers   affiliated with the Berkeley STC for their travel to France.    The U.S. and French teams will focus on the fundamental problem of dark matter, a topic   identified as the highest priority in astrophysics research.  Evidence indicates that 90% or   more of the Universe is made of dark matter, and that this matter may be in the form of   particles dating back to the beginning of the Universe.  The study of the dark matter   problem has important implications for understanding the origin of the Universe and the   fundamental nature of matter.  In this project, the U.S. and French teams will perform   experimental searches for dark matter either in the form of weakly interactive particles or   in the form of massive astrophysical compact halo objects.",
