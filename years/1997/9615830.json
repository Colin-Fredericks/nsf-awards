 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615830  Wirsen    New processes of sulfur metabolism are continuously being  described, yet aspects of chemolithotrophic metabolism of  marine sulfur oxidizers have not been well studied. These  organisms may have adaptive mechanisms for energy yielding  oxidations in the highly buffered marine environment  compared to the extreme acid conditions in which many of  these types of organisms grow in freshwater environments. A  new aspect of oxidation of polymetal sulfides has recently  been described which demonstrates this process is carried  out by natural marine populations and by pure cultures at  the near neutral pH of seawater. Isolates of marine non-  acidophilic sulfur oxidizers from different hydrothermal  vent habitats will be studied to determine the mechanism of  this process, what component(s) of metal sulfides (e.g.  pyrite, chalcopyrite) are utilized for energy, what role  abiological solubilization plays, what the intermediates and  end products of the oxidation are, and what some of the  limitations are that can control this process of polymetal  sulfide oxidation in the vent environment. Radioisotopic  procedures to follow carbon fixation; chemical assays and  EDX to determine substrates, intermediates and endproducts;  factors controlling growth such as pH and oxygen;  epifluorescent microscopy for total direct counts and  attached cells; and traditional cultural techniques will all  be used in addressing the above objectives. It is likely  that this process of circumneutral metal sulfide oxidation  may play a significant role in augmenting abiological  processes of sulfide geochemistry and mineralization. That  the massive accumulations of metal sulfides which are  deposited around hydrothermal vent areas constitute a new  and important long term supply of chemolithotrophic energy  for autotrophic processes necessitates a clear and better  understanding of the importance of this mechanism in the  overall transfer of geothermal into biochemical energy.",
