Gerald Kooyman and  Scott Eckert, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  This  is a three-country (U.S., Malaysia and the Philippines)  cooperative study on whale sharks, Rhincodon typus, in the  Sulu Sea.  The project will be carried out by a team of researchers  from three U.S. institutes: the Scripps Institute of  Oceanography, Hubbs Sea World Research Institute, and the  University of Florida, and four Malaysian and Philippine  institutes: the Universiti of Sabah (Borneo Marine Research  Unit) and Sabah Parks (Marine Division) in Malaysia, and the  Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and Silliman  University in the Philippines.    Dr. Kooyman, who is the U.S.P.I., requests funds for U.S.  components of student support and for travel and field costs  for studying the migration and movement patterns of the  whale shark, Rhincodon typus.  The team of researchers plans  to use satellite telemetry and Spaghetti tagging to define  the home range and distribution of whale sharks in the Sulu  Sea. There is little information available on whale shark in  the Sulu Sea.  This is a very important conservation and  biological study of a species, which has been exploited  extensively by humans for its meat and fin products.   This  is the first time that satellite telemetry is being used to  track whale sharks.  The experience gained from this study  can be applied to many other large fish species in other  parts of the ocean.   The data collected from this study can  not only provide vital information leading to a more precise  estimate of the overall shark population, and on its  migration and home range, but also can lead to improvement  in the conservation of this species despite increased human  exploitation. This project is jointly supported by Sabah  Parks (Marine Division) in Malaysia, the Bureau of Fisheries  and Aquatic Resources, Philippine, and NSF.",
