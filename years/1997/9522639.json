 "awd_abstract_narration": "9522639  Kaufman  Critical care patients have often suffered a disturbance to the  normal operation of their cardiovascular system; this disturbance  could have been generated by surgery or some sort of trauma.  A  responsibility of the critical care physician is to maintain  certain patient states within an acceptable operating range.  Often, the anesthesiologist will infuse several drugs into the  patient to control these states close to the desired values,  historically, this has been done using a manual (open-loop)  strategy.    Towards the important goal of using feedback for aiding the  anesthesiologist, the Departments of Biomedical (BME), Chemical  (CHE), and Electrical, Computer, and Systems (ECSE) Engineering  at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute are proposing an  interdisciplinary research project in the development and  analysis of a human-aided supervisory adaptive control system and  its application to a representative drug delivery system.  This  system will regulate the infusion of multiple drugs in order to  simultaneously steer several hemodynamic states (eg blood  pressure, cardiac output) towards desired values.  This system  can also be considered as an interactive human aided supervisory  system in which the human operator or anesthesiologist commands  the desired state and interacts with the control drug selection  logic.  From a set of measured signals, the patient state is  constructed and then used by the anesthesiologist to command a  desired state and with the help of a supervisory program, to  select the controls or drugs.  These drugs, along with the  commanded values, are then used by the control system to steer  the states towards their commanded values.  Fuzzy and adaptive  control concepts are to be used and an expert system will be used  to select the proper (adaptive or fuzzy) controllers for the drug  infusion rates.    The novel contributions expected to result from the proposed  research include:         A system that manipulates the infusion of a variety of     drugs, in response to some trauma, in a manner so as to steer the    hemodynamic states towards their desired values.         Procedures for studying the behavior of complex nonlinear    systems that include a mixture of fuzzy controllers and    conventional and/or adaptive controllers.         Procedures for deciding what controls or drugs should be    used and which should be nulled out for a specific state and    mission.    Control strategies that incorporate almost continuous  measurements of cardiac output.  ***",
