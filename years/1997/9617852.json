The learning outcomes align closely with the national standards for geography education for grades K-4. The project will revise and elaborate on a pilot version of a computer-aided learning tool and develop an accompanying teacher's guide. The software and print materials are to help students develop their ability to translate mentally between their visually-perceived, three-dimensional physical surroundings and a schematic representation of that reality (i.e., a map). Students will use the CD-ROM to learn about and practice mapping skills and will apply those skills in developing and following maps in the area in and around their school. The product will be commercially published and disseminated as a CD-ROM with supporting print materials.",
