 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712853  Wodicka  The object of this proposal is the development of a new  acoustic method to guide endotracheal tube (ETT) placement  and monitor the ETT position and patency over time.  The  method consists of measuring the reflections of an audible  sound pulse that is introduced into the ETT lumen and  propagates into the airways.  Patency and position  information is derived from the timing of the reflections  from the lumen and airways, respectively.  This approach has  proven extremely reliable in preliminary studies performed  using adult-size ETT's in anesthetized canines.  Thousands  of patients including roughly 83,000 infants per year in the  United States require placement of an ETT for ventilatory  support.  In every patient, insertion of the ETT is attended  by the risk of life threatening and costly complications due  to improper placement in the esophagus or a bronchus, or  blockage due to secretions.  The current standard of care  that attempts to avoid catastrophic complications is  expensive and requires the continuous monitoring of carbon  dioxide in expired gas, in concert with regular assessment  of tube location via chest radiographs and regular  auctioning of the tube lumen to ensure patency.  Despite the  vigilance of health care providers, a significant number of  complications associated with ETT use occur each year with  the disproportionate number occurring in infants where the  smaller tolerances by geometry predicate higher risks.",
