 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this research are to improve the computational  efficiency of error-correcting codes and to apply techniques  from this effort to other problems of computation and  information theory.  Error-correcting codes are essential  components of all electronic communication systems.  New  constructions for error-correcting codes that could be  encoded and decoded very efficiently have recently been  developed.  The objectives of this research are to extend  this initial work by: Improving the error-tolerance and  speed of the explicit constructions of error-correcting  codes based upon previously developed codes. Developing  algorithms that can certify the quality of the randomized  constructions. Using related techniques to improve the  computational efficiency of other tasks vital to information  theory and electronic communication. Developing quality  implementations of the codes that will make it easier for  engineers to test how these codes would perform in their own  application areas. The educational goals of the proposed  investigation are broader in scope.  They involve the design  of classes that teach graduate students about the larger  mathematical framework on which this research rests.  These  classes should attract students from mathematics as well as  computer science to learn about the new fascinating ways in  which ideas from mathematics can be applied to solve  important problems in computer science.  These classes are  designed to teach how connections in research are made as  well as provide them with many areas ripe for connection.  Eventually, these classes will teach the students another  essential element of the principal investigator's research  methodology:  that of using computational experiments in  mathematical research.  They will learn how one can use  computer experiments to make and test combinatorial  conjectures.  As they begin to see the computer as a tool  that can aid them in their own research, they will  inevitably become concerned with the efficie ncy of  computational algorithms and gain intuition for which  mathematical ideas might result in practical algorithms.***",
