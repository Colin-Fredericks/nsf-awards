 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704021  Jarell  This is a renewal grant to support work on a theoretical  study and numerical simulation of strongly correlated  electron materials.  The specific subjects include the high  temperature superconductors, heavy fermion materials, non-  Fermi liquid metals and exotic magnetic materials.  Quantum  Monte Carlo methods are combined with statistical inference  to calculate the dynamical response of the models of these  systems.  The study has two main objectives: The first is to  calculate, numerically and analytically, relevant properties  of the model systems as accurately as possible.  The second  is to explore the non-perturbative features of these models,  with the hope of finding new physical phenomena.  %%%  This grant continues the support of an active and  enthusiastic young PI who is rapidly emerging as a leader in  the general area of strongly correlated electrons.  This is  a class of materials which have wide ranging applications  but whose properties are not as well understood, at least so  far.  The class of materials include the high temperature  superconductors, heavy fermion materials, non-Fermi liquid  metals and exotic magnetic materials.  The proposed research  program utilizes a variety of theoretical and numerical  techniques and hopes to gain insight in to the observed  properties as well as discover new physical phenomena.  ***",
