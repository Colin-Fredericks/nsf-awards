 "awd_abstract_narration": "The District 11 Weather Study Program (DEWS) is an innovative district-wide, weather-education project, involving all fifth-, and eighth- grade students in District 11 which is located in the northeast section of the Bronx.  DEWS capitalizes on the most-recent advances in satellite and Internet telecommunications technologies.  The predominant principle governing the project is that pupil participation in activities that are directed toward the utilization of near-real time weather information can help to motivate young students to develop an interest in science.  Current satellite-cloud imagery, radar graphics, and National Weather Service (NWS) numeric and text information are used extensively in lessons at the Northeast Bronx Weather Station (NBWS), the center for weather-education activities in District 11.  Current state and local forecasts, storm and flood advisories, warnings, and summaries, climatological reports, and hourly surface-weather observations are only a few examples of the national and international NWS information products available to pupils for study.  Each student activity at the NBWS is designed to take full advantage of the data streams available at the facility.  All of this information is accessible for display on four personal desktop computers.  The monitors presently on site, however, do not allow for effective full-class viewing of weather graphics and imagery.  The equipment requested for this project will allow for full-screen display of real-time data that will greatly enhance large group presentations both for student and staff programs at the NBWS.  In addition, partial support is requested of real-time data services that will enable the NBWS to maintain its present level of real-time weather data.",
