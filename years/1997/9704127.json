 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704127  Rabolt    This award provides partial support for the acquisition of a  new Raman system for the departments of Materials Science,  Chemical Engineering and Chemistry at the University of  Delaware.  The Raman instrument utilizes a high sensitivity  Charge Coupled Device (CCD) for detection of the laser light  scattered from the materials under investigation.  In order  to be able to investigate a large collection of materials  ranging from catalysts to polymers, the input laser  excitation must be varied from the visible to the near  infrared region (532.-950. nm.).  Hence this Raman system  will include a frequency-doubled diode pumped Nd:YAG laser  which will be used to pump a tunable solid state Ti:Sapphire  laser together which will provide the large range of  wavelengths needed to study the problems of interest in all  three departments.    The proposed instrument will be used by researchers in a  number of different areas of advanced materials design and  characterization.  These include high surface area materials  used for chemical separations, transition metal oxygen-anion  catalysts, organic self-assembled monolayers on metallic  substrates, microemulsions, high temperature  superconductors, polymers and ionomers.  This Raman system  will serve as a focal point for materials research, bringing  together a multidisciplinary group of researchers who have a  common goal-to understand the structure/property  relationships in advanced materials.  The presence of such  an instrument in the Materials Science Department at the  University of Delaware will serve to facilitate interaction  and collaboration between the different research groups on  campus but, just as importantly, it will also promote  industrial interaction/collaboration in the more global  materials community in Delaware.  A number of small  companies have expressed interest in exploring the use of  Raman spectroscopy in the characterization of materials in a  process-monitoring mode, a capability which could be  acc omplished with fiber-optic probes.  Limited feasibility  studies could be conducted at the university with the  proposed Raman instrument.    This instrument will also be utilized as part of a larger  course in materials characterization which is required for  all graduate students pursuing an advanced degree in  materials science.  In addition it will be used to train  students in chemical engineering, physics and chemistry  because of the large amount of materials-intensive work that  is currently being carried out in those departments.  ***",
