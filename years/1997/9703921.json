 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703921  Kirsch    WGBH is requesting $100,000 for a two-day conference for 75 outreach professionals from public television, museums and science-technology centers, and community-youth organizations.  The conference will be developed in  collaboration with the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  The conference will provide professional development for outreach staff in key organizations that conduct local and national outreach project in informal and formal education.  Participants will have the opportunity to:    * learn how they can extend the impact of major outreach projects by establishing local coalitions that build on the strengths and resources of public television, science centers, youth-serving organizations, and other agencies focused on science education.    * find out how outreach is carried out by organizations outside their fields of expertise in order to identify new approaches and strategies that they can adapt for their own projects, and    * develop a plan of action for implementing an outreach initiative that takes advantage of the skills they have gained from the workshop and will benefit their communities.     Beth Kirsch, Director of Educational Outreach for WGBH, will be PI.  She will work closely with Judy Kass, Director of Outreach Programs at the AAAS, and Joan McIntosh, an independent consultant and trainer, to develop and manage the conference.",
