 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616868  Schafrik    The National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council,  through its National Materials Advisory Board (NMAB) of the  Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems (CETS), is  conducting a study to determine methods for improving the  exchange of information between the materials science and  engineering community and the producers, users, and  disposers of materials.  The goal is to accelerate the  application of new materials and processing innovations.  The NMAB developed this project as result of a strategic  planning session at the September 1995 board meeting, and it  was approved by the NRC Governing Board Executive Committee  at its meeting on April 9, 1996.  The board considers this  effort to be an important step towards unifying the field of  materials science and engineering (MSE) by improving its  ties to the user communities so that MSE can provide  realistic choices that solve problems with the applications  of the materials.  The study is conducted as a joint program  between the NMAB and the Board on Manufacturing and  Engineering Design (BMAED).  The staffs of these two boards  are a representative cross-section of the materials and  manufacturing communities in industry and academe.  %%%  It is expected that successful completion of this study will  lead to improved selection of materials in future  engineeering systems through enhanced communication between  the materials specialists and user communities.  ***",
