 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT DMS-9706891    Nussbaum      Nussbaum proposes research to gain insight into the solutions of   nonlinear functional differential equations or \"FDE's\".  Functional   differential equations are equations in which the derivative of a   function x(t) is a specified function of the history of x up to   time t. An example which plays a central role in this  proposal is ax'(t)=f(x(t),x(t-r)), r=r(x(t)). Here f and r are   specified functions, and a is a positive real. Under natural   assumptions on f and r and for a small, there exists a slowly  oscillating periodic solution x(t), dependent on a. Nussbaum will  seek to describe precisely the limiting shape of the graph of this  solution x(t) as a approaches zero.      Nonlinear functional differential equations (sometimes called  differential-delay equations) have been suggested as models in a  variety of areas, particularly in biology. For example, A. Longtin   and J. Milton propose such equations in studying the human eye's  pupil-light reflex; and M. Mackey and J. Milton are led to consider  nonlinear FDE's in their studies of oscillations in the human body's  red blood cell population. Considered from a pure mathematician's  viewpoint, the equations which arise are highly nontrivial. In this  proposal,  Nussbaum studies classes of nonlinear FDE's which are,   in part, motivated by examples from biology; and we seek to understand the  behaviour of solutions of such equations.",
