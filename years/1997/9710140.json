 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710140  Nelson    The aim of this proposal is to achieve an improved  fundamental understanding of the dynamical and structural  evolution of amorphous and partially disordered materials.  Density dynamics of super cooled liquids in the picosecond  through millisecond range will be examined, together with  the mode-coupling theoretical predictions of supercooled  liquid behavior.   Linear and (primarily) nonlinear lattice  dynamics in crystals near structural phase transitions will  be studied to elucidate anharmonic crystalline potential  energy surfaces that dictate phase transition mechanisms as  well as the dynamics of phase transitions under the  influence of short laser pulses.  Measurements will also be  conducted on thin film structures using laser generated  acoustic waves to carry out a systematic study of adhesion,  and to develop a new kind of photoacoustic imaging of  patterned films and film-substrate assemblies such as those  used in microelectronics.  %%%  An understanding of condensed materials such as glass  forming liquids and sol-gel glasses with viscous liquid  guests are of tremendous importance to industries involved  with the advancement of various technologies dependent on  both bulk and thin film materials applications.  For  example, this project will develop new techniques that will  allow for the first-time a thorough characterization of  adhesion mechanics in highly spatially resolved film  substrate structures, the study of semiconductor transitions  under the influence of short laser pulses, and density  dynamics in glass forming liquids that will allow more  complete testing of theoretical predictions and additional  guidance for theoretical development.",
