 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632390  Raman        The meteorology over the Western Pacific Ocean is not well-known, but has  a great influence on the global climate.  A field program named the Tropical Ocean  Global Atmosphere, Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA  COARE) had as one of its objectives to increase understanding of the characteristics  of mesoscale convective systems  (MCS) over the Western Pacific.  Of special  interest is the potential for MCSs to significantly modify air-sea momentum, heat  and moisture fluxes over a large area relative to that of an individual cumulonimbus  cloud.         The Principal Investigator will investigate and quantitatively describe the  interactions between MCSs and the ocean mixed layer in the Western Pacific warm  pool (WPWP) using a nested-grid, coupled ocean-atmosphere mesoscale model.   Specific objectives include:  (i) improve understanding of the effect of the WPWP  on the equilibrium and transient structures of the marine atmospheric boundary  layer;  (ii) identify and quantify the feedback effect of wind, air temperature and  precipitation associated with MCSs over the warm pool on the horizontal and  vertical density distributions of the ocean mixed-layer, and on the air-sea heat and  moisture fluxes;  (iii) identify and quantify the feedback effect of changes in air-sea  heat and moisture fluxes, sea surface temperature  and sea surface temperature  gradients due to convective and mesoscale processes on subsequent development of  convective and mesoscale events;  (iv) assimilate important parameters in the  atmospheric and oceanic boundary-layers using a coupled mesoscale model.        Successful completion of this research will assist in improving knowledge of  the impact of MCS on planetary scale events such as El Nino.  ***",
