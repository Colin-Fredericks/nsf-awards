BES 970786     An  interdisciplinary approach is taken for the  development  of   systems  for the regeneration of bone using polymeric materials,   ceramics  and  cells.  Possible clinical applications  of  these   proposed cell-polymer matrices would be in areas of grafting for   atrophic  non-unions  of  bone, for  surgical  arthrodeses,  for   healing   cranio-facial  defects,  and  for  use  as  prosthetic   implants  or coatings. This is a renewal proposal of  our  grant   (first funded in July,. 1990 and renewed in July, 1993).   After   successfully fulfilling the objectives of our 1990 funded  grant   in  which we developed and fully characterized cultures of  bone   cells   using   cell   culture   techniques,   constructed   and   characterized    2-dimensional   matrices   of    biocompatible,   degradable   polymers,  and  studied  cell-polymer   interactive   phenomena via cell attachment, spread, growth and DNA expression   experiments, we moved on to the design of 3-dimensional matrices   for  bone  cell support. Through our 1993 funded grant  we  have   made remarkable progress toward achieving our overall goals.   A   new   3-dmensional   matrix  system  was   formulated   and   by   biomechanical  analyses and electron microscopic studies,  found   to  be similar to cancellous bone.  Bone cells were successfully   seeded  onto  these  matrices and demonstrated  not  only  their   ability  to  attach  and  grow, but when placed  under  suitable   environments,  demonstrated the ability to lay  down  a  mineral   matrix.    Finally  novel  methods  were  designed  to  evaluate   cellular  growth  and  phenotype in  these  opaque  mineralizing   matrices.      In  this  grant proposal the optimization of these 3-dimensional   bone  bioerodible polymer systems is performed by further  study   of  the  nature  of  the mineral matrix formed  in  vitro  using   material science techniques, and the further study of the nature   of  the  bone cell response to op timized 3-dimensional  matrices   using  confocal  and  immunofluorescence  cell  characterization   technology  we developed during the previous grant.  Finally,  a   series of experiments will be undertaken to evaluate the ability   of  these materials to effect healing of bony defects alone  and   with bone cells.   ***",
