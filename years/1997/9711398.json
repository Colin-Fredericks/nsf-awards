 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the widespread use of object-oriented programming  languages, including C++ and Java, programs that do a  significant amount of heap storage allocation are becoming  increasingly widespread and important.  This project  investigates aggressive implementation policies that can  improve reference locality in allocation-intensive programs,  both in languages with and without garbage collection.  Specifically, the approach followed here uses profile-based  optimization and predicts the objects that are likely to  be highly referenced at the time they are allocated. It also  investigates object splitting, in which the representation  of objects is split into multiple parts, and the more  frequently referenced parts are co-located. There are three  primary contributions arising from this research.  First,  it investigates the empirical properties of programs in  languages that use manual (e.g., C++) and automatic (e.g.,  Java) storage reclamation. It shows that C programs exhibit  exploitable behavior, and it expands these results to other  languages.  Second, this project develops, evaluates and  compares alternative algorithms for identifying and  exploiting predictable reference behavior.  Finally, it  shows  that prototype implementations of the algorithms  being investigated can significantly increase performance in  substantial programs.",
