 "awd_abstract_narration": "Profs. Gorte and White will investigate the interaction of chemisorbed molecules with Bronsted acid sites in high-silica zeolites, such as ZSM-5.  They will identify the reaction intermediates, determine the energetics of formation of 1:1 stoichiometric complexes and their long-range interactions, and model the surface chemistry by molecular dynamics.  They will examine adsorbed intermediates derived from industrially significant reactant molecules, such as alcohols, thiols, aldehydes, esters, phenols and substituted aromatics, and will identify molecular probes suitable for the characterization of long-range interactions.  The spectroscopic characterization will be done with TPD, TGA, multi-phase solid-state NMR, NQR, and IR.  For the NMR work, the zeolite will be in the form of large single crystals mounted with random orientations in capillary tubes. The NMR spectroscopy will involve multiphase-pulse sequences, line-narrowing sequences, magic-angle spinning and isotopic substitution, with techniques such as REDOR and PISMA.  Particularly important is the addition of H NMR of methyl groups to investigate the environment of the acid sites.  Information from microcalorimetry of weakly basic molecules having various functional groups will be correlated with the spectroscopy, with the objective of rationalizing the energy barriers for surface reactions.  Those results will be complemented with ab initio quantum chemistry  calculations of structures and energies, and ab initio quantum molecular dynamics of the chemisorption and reaction steps of probe molecules in cluster models of the zeolites.",
