This project will be a vehicle for providing opportunities for parents to become familiar with these standards.  The project will undertake a three-stage approach to parental outreach:  (1) awareness activities, including the development of materials printed in both English and Spanish, public television, and a Website; (2) increasing involvement of parents through establishing a clearinghouse for information; and (3) activation activities to help parents work more effectively on mathematics and science reform efforts at the school, district, and state levels.",
