 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708913  Complex, evolved software is constructed from a tight-knit  composition of computational structures, called strands, each  of which is responsible for achieving some requirement, goal,  or subset of system functionality. Program strands are  interwoven and sometimes even merged in order to share  resources. This phenomenon is called interleaving, and  understanding how interleaved strands compose is the purpose of  the proposed work. There are two key objectives to the  research: to formulate a rigorous characterization of the  compositional relationships among interleaved strands and to  design a new representation for expressing their composition.  To form a rigorous characterization, a case study of an  existing corpus of software will be performed in which  interleaving of design patterns will be investigated and  compositional mechanisms will be classified. Existing  formalisms for representing strands and their relationships  will be surveyed and extended to create a new formalism that  expresses strand composition. The understanding gained will  suggest what types of documentation, programming language  features, and design abstractions are needed to enable  software engineers to make interleaving decisions explicit.  This will alert future maintainers of interleaved software to  the fact that the interleaving was intentionally introduced and  mitigate problems with understanding it.  ***",
