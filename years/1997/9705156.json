This research will extend the   theory and computation for hierarchical models in general, and   especially for versions of them that seem promising for practical   applications, as suggested partly from the investigators' experience   with them for medical quality assurance, meta-analysis, image   processing, traffic engineering, and for other situations.  The   investigators will study and develop procedures for fast fitting of   exponential family models, of generalized linear models, and of   multivariate models.  They will work on making inferences and on   foundations.  They will study and evaluate diagnostic methods needed to   assess the modeling assumptions made for the (second level)   distributions that govern the individual parameters.  Operating   characteristics and risk functions are to be calculated.  Mindful of   the computational burden of these methods, the investigators will seek   good mathematical approximations and the efficient implementation of   these more precise, computationally intensive methods.    While multi-level models are still new, they are the focus of much   research because their applications and potential applications abound in   scientific, engineering, commercial, medical, and governmental contexts.    Applications of hierarchical models have been and are being made to   image processing, agriculture, genetics, health services, and to many   other areas.  For example, the Principal Investigator's past research   has included using and adapting multi-level statistical models to   extract more accurate information from satellite imagery data by having   the t wo levels represent separately the measurement error distributions   and the uncertainty about the ground truth.  The investigator also has   used these models to assess more accurately, from non-experimental   traffic data, whether specified highway safety improvements actually   reduce accidents.  Two-level models are needed because direct   treatment-control comparisons made without them tend to be biased when   safety improvements have been made mainly at high hazard locations.    Concern for these and other applications of multi-level models motivate   this research, which is aimed at advancing their proper use and at   optimizing their computational efficiency.",
