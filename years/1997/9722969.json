 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9722969   Gabor Tigyi    The goal of this research is to understand the fundamental  mechanisms that regulate the development of neuronal  connections in the brain.  Past research by this group has  led to the discovery of a novel group of molecules  (lysophosphatidates) that inhibit the outgrowth of neuronal  processes that provide the wiring of the nervous system.  Interestingly, these molecules are generated after injury to  the central nervous system and might impair its regeneration  and recovery of function after such events as spinal cord  injury, stroke, and brain hemorrhage.  The work proposed for  the next 6-12 months will investigate the molecular signals  that mediate this inhibitory effect.  Specifically, we will  generate, using molecular biological techniques, special  cell lines that are deficient in one of three key molecular  switches, Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, which are presumably involved  in the inhibitory effect.  By using these engineered neuron-  like cells, we will be able to answer which of these three  switches need(s) to be turned on for the inhibition to take  place.  Once the switches mediating the inhibitory effect  are determined, they will become potential targets for drug  development and therefore could lead to novel treatments  that can prevent paralysis in patients suffering from lack  of regeneration in the central nervous system.",
