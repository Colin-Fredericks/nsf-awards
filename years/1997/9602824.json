 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will be used to support the renovation of two analytical instrumentation laboratories,  and one graduate environmental research laboratory for the Department of Environmental Engineering at Purdue University.  Engineering faculty at Purdue are actively engaged in research within  new areas of national interests that include hazardous waste treatment and minimization, soil and groundwater remediation, and environmental fate modeling.  With new acquisitions of advanced analytical equipment, the department is dedicated to make the environmental engineering graduate research program internationally competitive.  It is an opportune and critical time for the University to renovate facilities that house these and future acquisitions, and the laboratories that house graduate and faculty research.  Because environmental systems research is interdisciplinary,  modern facilities are required to accommodate and maintain analytical instrumentation.  Research space in the Civil Engineering Building, constructed 33 years ago, is deteriorated and deficient in the modern utility systems.  Fume hoods lack proper compressed air, vacuum, natural gas, and water outlets.  There is a lack of adequate space for large instruments that require full access ventilation.  Limited aisle space between benches restricts access and thus does not comply with ADA regulations.  Renovations will eradicate physical research barriers and add to the existing capabilities.   Modernized facilities will improve accessibility and functionality of instruments for research and research training, and enhance the quality of the research experience for faculty, graduate and undergraduate students, and visiting scientists.  This project will positively impact the Department's ability to recruit exceptional students, including those of under-represented groups and women in this nationally vital area.",
