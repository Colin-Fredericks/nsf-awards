 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700860  Harris    The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development project is  to study the fundamentals of electrohydrodynamics and mass  transfer with chemical precipitation that occur in electro  dispersion precipitation processes. This proposal addresses the  physical, chemical and engineering issues that govern electro  atomization in liquid-liquid systems and the formation of solid  particles from microdroplets.  The drawback to improving  electrodispersion precipitation processes in liquid-liquid  systems is the lack of a fundamental understanding about the  electrohydrodynamics of the atomization process and the mass  transfer with chemical precipitation that occurs in the dispersed  phase.  A tremendous amount of literature has been generated on  the electroatomization of pendant and sessile drops in liquid-air  systems.  However, very little research has been done to  understand the effect of static and pulsed electric fields on  conducting pendant/sessile drops and liquid streams emanating  from a nozzle and immersed in a low dielectric constant liquid.  Specific questions include the effect of static and pulsed  electric fields on pendant drops and the conditions under which  shells form rather than microspheres.  Additionally, this  research project will be integrated into a series of graduate-  and undergraduate-level courses that the PI is developing on the  \"Science and Engineering of Colloidal Systems.\"  The courses will  discuss the fundamentals of hydrosol and organosol synthesis,  surface science and engineering, and the effect of electric  fields on colloidal systems and surfaces.  The PI also will spend  at least two weeks per year during the summer conducting science  and engineering camps to encourage junior high and high school  minority students to pursue degrees in science and engineering.  %%%  This work will have a significant impact on increasing the  throughput of all liquid-liquid electroatomization processes and  on the production of microparticles with co ntrolled morphologies,  size, and composition.  Improvement of this technology will lower  the cost of ceramic starting powders for high technology  applications.  ***",
