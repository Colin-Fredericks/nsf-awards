 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kimelman  9722949    Gastrulation is a pivotal time in the development of the vertebrate embryo, when major aspects of cell fate are decided. Earlier views of vertebrate development focused on the dorsal organizer (the Spemann organizer in frogs) as the center of these patterning decision. Recent studies have shown that the entire embryo actively participates in cell fate specification, through the use of signals and genes expressed both within and outside of the organizer.    This proposal is focused on genes that regulate the formation of the embryo during the gastrula stages. One of these genes is the novel Xenopus homeobox gene, Vox, which was isolated and studied in this laboratory. Vox is expressed in the ventral and lateral regions of the embryo, and is proposed to interact with the Centralizing signal BMP-4 during the process of establishing the non-organizer regions of the embryo. Using both Xenopus and zebrafish, the role of the Vox genes in vertebrate development will be examined. Xenopus will be used to ask specific questions about the interactions between Vox and BMP-4, whereas zebrafish mutants that perturb early ventral development will be used to understand where the Vox genes fit in the hierarchy that regulates non-organizer development.    To broaden the understanding of early vertebrate development, an in situ hybridization-based genetic screen will be used to identify new mutations that regulate early dorsal-ventral development. Finally, 7 new zebrafish homeobox genes will be analyzed to define new regulators of early embryonic patterning. Since many aspects of embryogenesis are conserved among all vertebrates, including the expression of related homeobox genes, these studies will have broad implications for understanding fundamental processes in vertebrate development.",
