 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618099  Lipka    The University of Alaska Fairbanks in collaboration with a Yup'ik teacher group,  Ciulistet  Leaders , and Yup'ik elders will develop 15 ancillary modules or prekindergarten through sixth grade mathematics curriculum.  These modules, which are developed from Yup'ik Eskimo culture, language, and everyday practice, connect the embedded mathematics in Yup'ik culture to Western mathematics.  These modules will conform to the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards  of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.  Previously, this team developed math manipulative prototypes (the Yup'ik math Tool Kit) based on Yup'ik language and culture.  The Yup'ik Math Tool Kit takes advantage of Yup'ik conceptions of numeration, nonstandard measures, and patterns.  This tool kit will be refined and will form an integral part of this inquiry-based approach to teaching mathematics.  The team plans to develop computer software that children can use to copy, identify, analyze, and create Yup'ik patterns.    This four-year project is designed to serve a historically underrepresented group, indigenous Alaskan students, by linking mathematics with their culture.  This project will also provide these contextually rich mathematics problems to an audience well beyond the state of Alaska, with the intent of being national in its appeal.  To accomplish this, the project team will pilot and field test the modules in Alaska among school districts with an almost 100% indigenous population and outside of Alaska.  Lastly, the curriculum development team will form a partnership with the Alaska Rural Systemic Initiative in developing this curriculum and in providing teacher enhancement.",
