 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hofmann   9723063      This project will examine the ecological significance of heat shock   proteins (hsps) in marine fish. The hsps are a family of   highly-evolutionarily conserved proteins that are expressed in cells in   response to stressful conditions such heat stress or exposure to   chemicals. Physiologically, the hsps are an emergency response to   stress but, they are also present in cells to perform normal cellular   duties such as folding newly synthesized proteins. At the basic   biochemical level, the function of the hsps is very well described and   the PI's know how the hsps perform their protein folding tasks.   However, very little is known about how these proteins have evolved in   organisms that are adapted to different temperatures and, whether there   are differences in the hsp protein folding abilities at ecologically   relevant temperatures. Since all organisms must by necessity fold   proteins, hsps in the natural world, fold proteins over a wide range of   temperatures; literally that over which life occurs. This range is   estimated to be approximately 115  C, from the -2  C encountered by   Antarctic fish to 1 1 3 C for hot springs bacteria. The research will   use biochemical techniques to address an ecological and evolutionary   question: is there diversity of function in the highly evolutionarily   conserved hsps in marine fish adapted to different temperatures?",
