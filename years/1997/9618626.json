Variations  in  the  carbon-13/carbon-12  ratio  have variously  been  interpreted  as  arising from changes (or differences) in temperature, the  amount  of   dissolved  carbon  dioxide  in  seawater,  growth  rate  and  productivity  of  phytoplankton, among other possibilities.   The  phenomenon  is  not  only a major feature  of  present-day  ocean  chemistry   but,  moreover,  may  be  of  use  for  understanding  historical  variations in global carbon dioxide through  isotopic  studies of the sedimentary record.          In  this  study the principal investigator will  conduct  a  series  of laboratory experiments and field comparisons  to  test  the   strength  of  a  mathematical  model  for  carbon   isotope  fractionation   resulting  from  uptake  by  phytoplankton.    In  collaboration with colleagues at the Alfred Wegener  Institut  in  Bremerhaven,  Germany,  and the Monterey  Bay  Aquarium  Research  Institute,  he  will  study the effects of several  processes  on  carbon  isotope  fractionation  by  phytoplankton  species.    If  successful,  this  work could lead to a new predictive  tool  for  understanding  the  carbon isotope chemistry of  the  present-day  ocean  and  perhaps  provide a key to understanding  paleoclimate  through analysis of marine sediment cores.",
