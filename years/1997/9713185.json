 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9713185      This proposal requests funds for partial support of the Gordon Research  Conference on the Chemistry of Supramolecules and Assemblies to be held on August 10- 15, 1997, at Salve Regina University in Newport Rhode Island.  The funds request will be used primarily to cover the fixed fee expenses for attendees, i.e. speakers, discussion leaders and graduate and postdoctoral students who work in engineering and applied research.    The purpose of this conference is to encourage the transfer of ideas and information in the community of scientists who work in the fields of colloidal assemblies and supramolecular aggregates.  The conference has met biennially since 1979 and the areas covered and the speakers who attend consistently represent the most active areas of research from industrial applications of thin films and engineered crystals to basic research in molecular recognition and association colloid chemistry.    A broad range of speakers and participants in a variety of research areas are participating in the conference this year.  Topics include, nanosized materials, structure and dynamics, clean chemistry in structured systems, photochemistry in organized systems, chemistry in aggregates, macromolecular architecture, and biomolecular assemblies.  Approximately one half of the speakers and discussion leaders are either engineers or working in applied chemistry.  One session is devoted to short talks by new participants in the field.    The schedule for the week is that of a traditional Gordon Conference, sessions in the morning and evenings with plenty of time for discussion.  The afternoons are free for informal discussion and meetings and two poster sessions are planned for attendees, including graduate students and post doctoral fellows as well as faculty members, to present their recent work.",
