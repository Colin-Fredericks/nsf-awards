 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604799  Wessel    How do biophysical neuronal mechanisms interact to achieve  the computations required for proper function of  neural  circuits? Largely due to recent advances in optical imaging  of neuronal activity we now believe that the single neuron  is far more complex and dynamic than previously known from  single electrode studies. A combination of electrode  recording and optical imaging methods on the nervous system  of he leech has been developed recently. This combination of  methods will be used to investigate the integration of  synaptic inputs in the dendrites of single neurons. The  following specific questions will be asked: (1) What is the  cellular basis of a non-linear response to sensory synaptic  inputs ?  (2) Do portions of a neuron act as relatively  independent functional units ? The leech offers spatially  extended neurons with evidence, from past work, for non-  trivial processing. The established neuronal circuitry and  anatomically localized connections between identifiable  neurons in the leech are particularly advantageous in the  study of single neuron computation. It is thus possible to  stimulate one or more identified cells presynaptic to the  cell under study, and monitor the dynamic interaction of  postsynaptic potentials along neuronal processes. In  addition, due to the small number of neurons in the leech  ganglion, single neuron computation can be understood within  the network context. The proposed project will extend our  understanding of neuronal computation from the level of  biophysical mechanisms of single neurons to the collective  computation of a small neuronal network that produces  behavior. Since the results focus on the properties of  single nerve cells, they will likely generalize to all  species, including humans.",
