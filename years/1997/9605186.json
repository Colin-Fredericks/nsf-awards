 "awd_abstract_narration": "New experiments at Brookhaven and CERN will probe  matter at high temperatures and densities, achieved only  during the very early stages of evolution of the Universe.  The next generation of Astrophysical experiments will also  offer a glimpse of the Physics of the Early Universe through  the imprint left by the physical processes as anisotropies  in the Cosmic Microwave Background.  Particle Physics  predicts that several phase transitions have occurred during  the very Early Universe that are responsible for these  anisotropies.  My project is to develop and implement the  tools of non-equilibrium quantum physics to provide a  detailed analysis of the dynamics of these phase  transitions.  The goal is to be able to recognize and  quantify their Cosmological consequences and their  experimental signatures and to compare predictions from  theories to the experimental data that will become available  through these new experiments.  It has been recognized that  only a consistent study away from equilibrium can address  effectively the Physics of the extreme environments that has  taken place in the Early Universe.",
