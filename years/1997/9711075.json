 "awd_abstract_narration": "9711075  Muller-Parker  Coral reefs are highly diverse, productive, and economically  important communities that depend on the symbiotic  association between algae (zooxanthellae) and corals.  This  collaborative cross-disciplinary study linking optics,  chemistry of pigments, and biology will determine the  sequence of events during disruption of the symbiosis in  tropical anemones and corals during exposure to stressors  linked to global climate change. Three aspects of coral  bleaching will be studied, using anemones and corals  subjected to ultraviolet light and high temperature: 1)  changes in the optical spectra of symbiotic associations  during bleaching, 2) changes in photosynthetic pigments of  zooxanthellae, and 3) changes in animal-algal biomass  parameters and photosynthetic performance of zooxanthellae.  The project team includes both science and science education  undergraduate majors who will develop research projects and  curricular materials for use in field teaching and  introductory courses.  The PIs will also develop a new  interdisciplinary course entitled \"Marine Life and Light\"  which will involve aspects of physics, biology, chemistry  and environmental science and will include students from all  of these disciplines.    Coral reefs are the \"rain forests\" of the ocean.  These  highly diverse, productive, and economically important  communities depend on the symbiotic relationship between  algae and corals.  Widespread coral \"bleaching\" (the loss of  the algal symbionts) is attributed to environmental stresses  linked to global climate change.  This project will study  how the intimate intracellular relationship between  photosynthetic algae and their animal host is affected by  environmental stress, using a collaborative and cross-  disciplinary team approach linking optics, chemistry of  pigments, and biology. This project also provides a model  for integrating science and science education programs by  involving undergraduates from both disciplines in the basic  researc h and in the development of educational materials  which will benefit school children and the general public.  The PIs will also develop a new interdisciplinary course  entitled \"Marine Life and Light\" which will involve aspects  of physics, biology, chemistry and environmental science and  will include students from all of these disciplines.",
