 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703693  Liao   This project is concerned with the dynamical theory of stochastic flows generated   by stochastic differential equations on manifolds. The PI plans to investigate the following   problems.  It has been shown in some examples that a stochastic flow may be decomposed   as an asymptotically deterministic flow followed by a random \"rotation\". The PI plans to   look into the possibility that some general type of stochastic flows possess this kind of   decomposition. If this is understood, then a theory of random sources and sinks can be   developed for stochastic flows. It has been established for stochastic flows contained in   finite dimensional Lie transformation groups that the limiting stability of stochastic flows is   completely determined by the structure of the group. The PI plans to investigate to what   extent this holds for general infinite dimensional stochastic flows.   The dymanical theory studies the motion of a system, whether this is a mechanical,   a biological or an environmental system. An important question is whether the system is   stable or what kind of long time behavior the system exhibits. The stochastic flows provide   models for systems whose motions depend on some random elements. Although one may   not be able to predict with certainty the path of a random system, the study of stochastic   flows enables one to project the long time behavior or pattern of the system with   confidence. The proposal is concerned with some basic problems in the dynamical theory   of stochastic flows.",
