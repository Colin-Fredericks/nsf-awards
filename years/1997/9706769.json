 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT      Lakic         This project addresses problems concerning metric and   analytic properties of infinite dimensional Teichmuller spaces.    Properties of some recently introduced new Teichmuller spaces   will be explored.  These new spaces appear to have interesting   applications to the study of complex dynamics.  Three closely related   areas will be considered in this project.  The first concerns the   classical Teichmuller theory, and it is based on classifying the   automorphisms of infinite dimensional Teichmuller spaces and on   studying uniquely extremal Beltrami coefficients.  The second area   focuses on two recently introduced Teichmuller spaces, the Teichmuller   space with asymptotic conformal equivalence and the Teichmuller space   of a closed set in the plane. Finally, some applications will be   considered. A special emphasis  will be placed on studying the   invariant line fields on a Julia set, and on exploring the smoothness   properties of the mapping by heights for quadratic differentials in   the disk.       Recently, scientists have been able to apply several new   analytic and geometric methods to a number of important  nonlinear   problems in dynamics, ranging from physics and chemistry to ecology   and economics. In particular, the methods of Teichmuller theory have   contributed to the depth and scopes of research in complex dynamics   and renormalization. A special emphasis will be placed on studying   the Julia set, that appears in the iteration theory of holomorphic   functions that gave birth to the Mandelbrot set and to fractals.",
