 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Physiology Society (APS), in collaboration with the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) and the Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS), are fostering improvement of undergraduate life sciences education by supporting the formation of collaborative working relationships among life sciences faculty at 2- and 4-year colleges (including community colleges), physiology research faculty, and physiology teaching faculty.  Specifically, the project is promoting the creation of ongoing working relationships among triads of faculty from the three groups noted above through research and curriculum development experiences, and computer networks; and promoting the adoption of national reforms for undergraduate content and effective pedagogical techniques among undergraduate faculty through curricular materials and in service activities developed collaboratively by these triads. The project is promoting the establishment of long-term collegial relationships that benefit all members.  Initially, the 2- and 4-year college faculty members work with a physiology research faculty member on a summer research experience, attend sessions on effective pedagogy during a summer institute at the HAPS annual meeting and, subsequently, work with the other members of the triad to collaboratively develop new curricular materials for the undergraduate life sciences classroom.  Interested triads will then go on to develop and conduct a local professional development workshop for life sciences faculty in their geographic area.  Curricular materials developed during the project will be field-tested, edited, and published by NABT.  The project is designed to allow the continuation of these activities as a part of the long-term activities of the APS Education Office.",
