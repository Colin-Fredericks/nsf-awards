 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three living members of the small Misumalpan family represent  the majority of the population still using an indigenous language  in Nicaragua, and the family is well represented north of the  Coco River, in Honduras, as well. Thus, despite its small size  Misumalpan is the most important indigenous linguistic entity in  the region popularly termed the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua. It  is important sociopolitically, since speakers of the two largest  languages, Miskitu (70,000 speakers) and Northern Sumu (8,000),  have been strong and effective proponents of the political,  cultural, and economic rights of the indigenous peoples of the  Atlantic Coast, and they have worked successfully to secure a  position of dignity and official status for their languages  within the Autonomy Project of the Nicaraguan government of the  1980's, Speakers of the third much smaller, Misumalpan language,  Ulwa (or Southern Sumu, with approximately 400 speakers), have  also been vocal and effective in expressing their right to have  their language documented and to reverse the process of language  loss which, if unchecked, will quickly lead to its disappearance.  Ulwa is now confined to Karawala, a village of 750 people,  predominantly Miskitu in linguistic practice, near the mouth of  the Rio Grande de Matagalpa, a dramatic reversal of its fortune,  given that it was the most widespread Misumalpan language in the  17th century. Although there are great numerical disparities  among the languages of this small family, there is a sense of  common interest among the speakers, a sense that the fate of even  the smallest language is relevant in the general program of  promoting the welfare of the indigenous languages and cultures of  the Atlantic Coast. The proposed Manual of Misumalpan Languages  is inspired very largely by the clearly perceived need for a  single reference work which brings these linguistic traditions  together for use by the growing number of Misumalpan-speaking  scholars and teachers, as well as  other Nicaraguan involved in  various ways with language matters on the Atlantic Coast and a  Nicaraguan public becoming increasingly aware of the country's  diverse cultural and linguistic heritage.        In the domain of linguistic scholarships the Misumalpan  family is important for both historical and synchronic research,  It is a classic example of the effects of intense bilingualism,  developed since the Miskitu ascendancy of the 17th century and  resulting in large-scale changes making the languages very close  in grammar, while maintaining differences in vocabulary, This has  given rise to a number of theories about the origin of Miskitu  which the present project will attempt to evaluate through  careful comparison of grammatical features and vocabulary. In the  realm of grammar, Misumalpan furnishes us with new data on  certain important linguistic processes, including among many  others the expression of possession (e.g., the child's dog),  cause (e.g., 'the wind makes the house shake') the problem of  \"keeping track\" of the participants in a sequence of events  (e.g., who is 'he' in John came in and he sat down' -- is it John  or someone else? Misumalpan makes this clear at all times). The  manual will cover these and the full range of other constructions  and processes which are of central interest to linguists and  language learners. It will contain three parts - Grammar,  Lexicon. and History and it will be prepared for publication in  Spanish and English.",
