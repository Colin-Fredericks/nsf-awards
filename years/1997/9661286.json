These sensors employ a unique molecular electronic technology, originally developed for geophysical sensors.  In this application, a polymer-metal compound is used to adsorb and dissociate water molecules, thereby creating a conductive path through the polymer film.  The change in conductivity is measured and will be used to determine water vapor concentration.  Since no molecular water is retained in the sensor, it is impervious to changes due to freezing.  They will have excellent repeatability and linearity and ultralow hysteresis.  They are expected to be rugged, contamination- and condensate-resistant, and produced by standard thin-film technology.  Phase I will determine the feasibility of these sensors and to prepare prototypes for field testing.    These sensors will be used in various branches of atmospheric and environmental sciences to provide wide range three-dimensional monitoring.  Their low cost, small size, and high performance will also make them useful in many industrial and commercial applications.  ***",
