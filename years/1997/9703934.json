The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a six-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. James L. Maxwell of Louisiana Tech University  to work with Dr. Mats Boman at Uppsala University in Sweden.    This project involves the study of laser-induced chemical  vapor deposition (LCVD) and, in particular, the use of LCVD  to manufacture three-dimensional micro electro mechanical  systems (MEMS).  Few traditional micromachining processes  are capable of producing highly-three-dimensional MEMS  devices.  Three-dimensional LCVD (3D-LCVD) is a mode of  pyrolytic vapor deposition where high-aspect ratio  microstructures can be generated. Using 3D-LCVD, the  researchers plan to fabricate a three-dimensional micro-  inductor, a superconducting micro-inductor, and coils which  will be used to test the feasibility of laser-deposited Ni-  Ti shapememory actuators in MEMS devices. Dr. Boman was the  first to produce complex shapes and useful devices via 3D-  LCVD and Dr. Maxwell was the first to demonstrate feedback  control of growth rates during 3D-LCVD which allows precise,  continual control of layered and freeform growth. The  University of Uppsala has the best equipped laboratory for  3D-LCVD in the world.  ***",
