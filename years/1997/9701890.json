The focus is on the contributions of the NSF-  funded VELACS project (Verification of Liquefaction Analysis  by Centrifuge Studies), the applications of the VELACS  concepts to practice, determining additional research needs,  and disseminating this information.    A previous international workshop held at the University of  California, Davis, in February 1992, also addressed this  topic.  Since then, numerous contributions have been made to  the field of geotechnical earthquake engineering, and some  limited applications to engineering practice have been  achieved.    The objectives of this workshop/conference are: 1) to  evaluate the progress that has been made in the past four  years in the areas of verified numerical procedures, site  characterization to obtain insitu properties for use in  numerical procedures, and application of verified numerical  procedures in engineering practice; and 2) to determine the  research needed to make further progress.    This workshop/conference is expected to lead to further  advancements in the field of geotechnical earthquake  engineering.",
