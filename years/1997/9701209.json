 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701209  Tessier  Aging, as measured by the physiological deterioration of animals as they grow older, is the subject of much current research.  Why aging occurs and what underlying genetic mechanisms are associated with aging are also topics of considerable research.  Traditional laboratory genetic work has confirmed much of the theoretical work.  However, relatively few scientists have examined genetic variation of aging in wild populations, or the ecological context in which this variation exists.  The proposed research will address these gaps in our knowledge through life table experiments and detailed descriptions od sources of natural mortality.  Daphnia, a common freshwater crustacean, will be studied because its ecology is well known and it will reproduce clonally.  This mode of reproduction allows sampling of the natural genetic variation in the lab, where life tables can be constructed under controlled conditions.  Thus, rates of aging for natural populations can be estimated without interference from extrinsic mortality.  Aging rates can be compared to data from field estimates of mortality rates.  Sources of mortality (e.g., predation, disease, habitat seasonality) can then be used to examine the relationship between intrinsic lifespan (and other aging indicators) and the expected wild lifespan.  The research will also test theoretical predictions that rapid aging could be indirectly advantageous in certain ecological contexts.  The investigators will characterize early life history traits (e.g. growth, maturation) and look for tradeoffs with rates of aging.  A high rate of aging should be sustainable only if there are correlated advantages early in life, such as accelerated growth.  Conversely, poor reproduction or growth early in life should be sustainable only if it benefits an animal through longer life.",
