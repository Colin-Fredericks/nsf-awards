Because these  interactions are strong, it is important to treat the  molecule-surface as a single system.  Theoretical models  will be developed and applied to increase our understanding  of the electronic, structural and vibrational properties of  molecules interacting with metal surfaces.  The methodology  to be used will be state-of-the-art quantum mechanical  density functional theory.    The educational component of this award involves extensive  participation of undergraduates in research projects and the  development of distributed research projects for all  undergraduate science majors.  %%%  This is a CAREER award to a new faculty member.
