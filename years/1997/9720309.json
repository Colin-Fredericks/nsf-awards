 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of learning indicate that one can define two broad categories: declarative learning (e.g., verbal statements of fact) and procedural learning (e.g., how to ride a bicycle).  This research aims to clarify principles of procedural learning, and thus have an impact on understanding how to train people or machines to accomplish complex sensorimotor tasks in changing environments.  The researcher's goal is to combine studies on animals and robots in order to explore a biologically-inspired architecture for agile procedural learning systems (APLS).    Existing agile procedural learning systems include humans and animals.  Even simpler animals, such as insects or mollusks, show a remarkable agility in solving survival problems.  After encountering novel terrain, or novel food, these animals can adjust patterns of body or ingestive movements to handle the new situation rapidly.  Example engineering systems that would benefit from a theory of agile procedural learning include robots and manufacturing workcells.  In particular, considering the application domain of agile manufacturing.  The key requirement of an agile manufacturing workcell is that it be capable of flexibly and rapidly adjusting to changing assembly line demands, perceived errors, and new tasks.  Though manipulators have gotten more dextrous and sensors more accurate, though processors have gotten faster, memory cheaper, and software easier to write and maintain, truly agile engineering systems that learn and exhibit intelligent behavior have not been demonstrated.  The substrate is not lacking; a theoretical approach yielding engineering principles is needed.  Top-down (cognitive) and bottom-up (reactive) approaches to learning and intelligent systems (LIS) have yielded successes, but only for highly-complex programs performing high-level tasks in highly-structured environments and for simple agents performing low-level tasks in mildly-changing environments, respectively.  In contrast, agile procedural learning systems possess a  middle-level competence between reactive behavior and cognitive skills.  They are complex, constrained, and must work in environments whose structure changes.  Thus, the problem of agile procedural learning confronts the investigators directly with building a theory of LIS that bridges the gap between the traditional \"top down\" and \"bottom up\" approaches.  The missing \"middle out\" theory the investigators propose will be pursued with the following approach: (1) identify principles used in existing agile procedural teaming systems; (2) develop models and mathematical tools that bridge the gap between \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" methods; and (3) transfer these findings to engineering practice.    More specifically, they will explore the following biologically-inspired architecture as a means of solving the problem of agile procedural learning: plastic local reflex circuitry coordinated and comodulated by higher-level state- and environment-dependent circuits.    The investigators research effort has three core thrusts:  (1) they will pursue experimental studies in simpler animals that are capable of procedural learning to determine how this architecture is actually used for learning tasks; (2) they will develop models and mathematical tools that formalize these findings, make an integrative symbolic-reactive theory possible, and improve understanding of the influence that learning and environment have on the dynamics of intelligent autonomous agents; and (3) they will incorporate both into animal-like robots and an agile manufacturing workcell the middle-out theory and architecture, evaluating their utility in producing learning and intelligent behavior, measured by improved performance.    The middle-out approach generates overarching scientific questions about low-level sensorimotor learning and higher-order learning that can only be answered using an interdisciplinary approach. Overlapping task teams interlinking these efforts will synergistically improve each of them.",
