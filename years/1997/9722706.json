 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF-supported experimental Elementary Particle  Physics (EPP) group at the University of Chicago consists of  several research teams which involve themselves in the four  experiments discussed below:       The `Kaon at the Tevatron` (KTEV) experiment is now  running at Fermilab.  Its intent is to study CP violation  and the rare decays of long-lived K-mesons.  CP violation is  thought to be the origin of the a symmetry between matter  and antimatter in the universe.  KTEV is an experiment of  fundamental importance to our understanding of the origins  and evolution of the universe.       At the `Collider Detector at Fermilab` (CDF)  experiment, the focus is to study high momentum transfer  events in proton-antiproton collisions at 1.8 TeV (the  highest energy available in the world today).  The Chicago  group has the responsibility of constructing the electronic  systems for the first level calorimeter trigger and the  silicon tracker processor.  The CDF experiment is being  upgraded so that it can exploit the higher luminosity to be  provided by the new main injector ring now under  construction.  The CDF experiment was one of the co-  discoverers of the top quark.       The `Omni-Purpose-Apparatus-at-LEP` (OPAL)  collaboration at the Large Electron-Positron collider (LEP)  at CERN has completed a program that uses Z boson decays to  conduct several important tests of the `Standard Model` of  particle physics: a measurement of the Weinberg angle, a  study of various B-meson decays, and a search for exotic  particles that would indicate physics beyond the `Standard  Model`.  The collaboration is now taking data at `LEP200`,  where with double its present energy, the accelerator can  make W meson pairs and hence obtain direct measurements of  the W mass.  Searches for new particles are also being  conducted at these higher energies.       ATLAS (A Toroidal Large Angle Spectrometer) will be a  general-purpose detector designed to exploit the potential  of the future LHC proton-proton collider.  LHC will provide  10 times higher center-of-mass energy and 100 times higher  proton-proton collision rates than previous colliders, thus  opening up a new frontier of physics.  Discovery of the mass-  generating mechanism or spontaneous symmetry breaking, which  predicts the existence of a scalar particle, the Higgs boson  is a primary objective of ATLAS.       The Chicago group is the leading group in the EPP  program in its education and outreach activities.",
