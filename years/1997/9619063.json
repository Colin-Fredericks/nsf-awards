 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  overall goal of this instrument development for Systems Neurophysiology  is  to  create  functional devices to enable recording from very large ensembles  of  neuronal  spike trains in behaving animals. The plan is to develop and integrate  three  tasks  to be done in parallel. First, a new fabrication process  will  be  employed to create thin film silicon recording probes, each with sixteen  sites.  The  probe  shapes and surface recording site properties will be  optimized  for  long-term  chronic  recording  to match the effectiveness  of  microwire  arrays  previously  perfected  by  the  P.I. Different  spacing  and  sizes  of  surface  recording sites will be patterned on the probe and different recording  surfaces  will  be tested. A novel technology for fabrication of flexible microcables  and  multichip  modules will be adapted to lead signals from the recording probes  to  external signal processing electronics. A second task is to create a design  for  a  VLSI microchip to detect and amplify- signals from 16 channels. and multiplex  signals  to  a  single  output lead. The chip will also  provide  switches  with  control  to apply test/stimulation to a selected input. Later goals will  be  to  produce  a  multisite  probe with integrated active electronics  and  to  create  multiple  probe  assemblies.  The processes to be  developed  are  exceptionally  favorable  for commercial production methods. A low-cost, high-volume commercial  product  will  be  facilited through later participation of  the  staff  at  the  Microelectronic Center of North Carolina (MCNC), Research Triangle, NC. A  third  task  is  to  assemble  a  demultiplexer with control hardware/software  and  an  advanced  digital  signal processing capability will be  added  to  an  existing  workstation to support spike sorting from 256 channels or more. All three  tasks  will  be  done in parallel to incrementally add function to an existing,  usable  system.  This  complex, integrated project is made more feasib le by  preliminary  advances supported by NSF and elsewhere over past decade.         This  project aims to bring closur,9/to a decade-long development effort of  the  P.I.  and  his  associates. The aim was to create and demonstrate the  potential  large  scale  neuron ensemble recording for decoding of information in  patterns  within distributed neuronal activity. Multivariate statistical methods have been  applied to process the large volumes of data yielded by the new data acquisition  methods. Recent publications by this group and others on multichannel recordings  have  created  enthusiasm and momentum toward further advances  in  multichannel  recording and analysis instrumentation. Advances in this capability are critical  to  enable a basic paradigm shift in the study of conceptual issues in the study  of physiological neuronal networks.",
