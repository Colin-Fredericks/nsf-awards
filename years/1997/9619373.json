 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tripathy  9619373    The principal objective of this grant is the detailed  investigation of a novel phenomenon recently observed under  NSF-DMR funding.  A number of NLO polymers with tailored  molecular architectures including Interpenetrating Polymer  Networks were fabricated.  A large number of the NLOphores  incorporated in these systems were based on azo dyes.  In  fact azo chromophores have been extensively employed in  designing NLO polymers over the past decade.  In the course  of the study on optical recording under NSF-DMR funding,  laser-induced surface relief holographic grating formation  on a number of azo-dye containing polymer films was  observed.  Large amplitude (>1000 A) holographic surface  relief gratings on azobenzene containing NLO polymer films  were optically produced significantly below the glass  transition temperature without any subsequent processing  steps.  It has been established that the recording is not  due to a thermal process.  Early research also indicates  strong polarization-dependent writing behavior.  Such large  scale motion of polymer chains significantly below Tg and  its relationship to incident light polarization and  intensity variation is unusual and begs careful study and  interpretation of the phenomenon.  The focus of this  proposal is 1) to design and synthesize polymers with  different chemical structures and 2) to investigate the  surface grating formation process under a variety of optical  exposure conditions to explore the mechanism of this novel  process.  The role of each structural element (i.e., the  chromophore side groups, the polymer backbone, and the  spacers between them) will be systematically investigated in  these polymers.  The roles of photo-induced processes of the  chromophores (such as photoisomerization and photo-induced  orientation of the azobenzene groups) in creation of the  relief gratings will be examined.  Cooperative motions of  the polymer backbones along with the chromophores will be  investigated.  The effect s of changing wavelength,  intensity, and polarization of the writing beams will be  explored.  A comprehensive experimental investigation of the  mechanism will help establish a theoretical model for the  process.  %%%  This project will provide fundamental understanding in the  area of novel surface-grating techniques for electro-optical  applications.  ***",
