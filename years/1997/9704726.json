 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704726  Lin       The landscape of the study of knots and 3-manifolds has undergone  a dramatic change in the past decade.  Through the advent of the Jones  polynomial, quantum invariants and Vassiliev invariants, it transpired  that knots, 3-manifolds and other lower dimensional topological objects  could be studied extrinsically as combinatorial objects, with topological  equivalence as a kind of symmetry.  The investigator recognized the broader  roles these topological objects may play, and this fresh point of view  is reflected in the many topics studied in this project: the representation  varieties of the fundamental groups of homology 3-spheres over finite  fields and their relations with Ohtsuki's invariants of homology  3-spheres; the probabilistic interpretation of certain string link  invariants closely related to quantum invariants; integral and projective  geometry of Gauss integrals, the classification of Legendrian knots, the  study of various energy functionals with respect to the geometric  structures on knot spaces, and the topology of level sets of Gauss  integrals; and calculation of relations among (alternating) multiple zeta  numbers, using string links as devices.       Knots are fascinating objects.  When fastening a rope, the  distinction between a knot and a \"slip-knot\" (one that can be undone by  pulling) must have been recognized very early in human history.  However,  a mathematical study of knots was started only around the end of the  nineteenth century and has finally in recent years matured into a useful  scientific tool.  Nowadays, basic concepts in knot theory are crucial for  DNA biology and foundational physics, and they are related to many other  fields in mathematics.  On the other hand, easily pictured but difficult  questions in knot theory still remain beyond the reach of mathematical  techniques.  Two basic features of knot theory, the diversity of different  kinds of knots and the role played by symmetry in their classification,  may well provide hin ts and tools for many different kinds of scientific  research.  ***",
