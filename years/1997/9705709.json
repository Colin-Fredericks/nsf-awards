 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9705709  Wolf    Prof. Joseph Wolf will continue his research on Lie groups, harmonic analysis and representation, with some applications to complex analysis, Riemannian geometry, numerical analysis and control theory.  This includes (1) his work on double fibration transforms  and the structure of spaces of maximal compact subvarieties in flag domains, (2) his work on infinite dimensional Lie groups that are direct limits of finite dimensional groups, (3) his study of the Harish-Chandra--Schwartz space of a general semisimple Lie groups, (4) applications of his results with Milicic, Hecht and Schmid on equivalence of various constructions of representations of semisimple Lie groups, and (5) his line of   research connecting semisimple representation theory with certain aspects of applied mathematics.  Here (1) has already proved useful in automorphic cohomology, in indefinite metric quantization, and in geometric realization and understanding of certain singular representations of interest in physics.  The new work proposed is to complete the precise description of the linear cycle space and apply the result to concrete analytic properties of the associated double fibration transforms.  (2) is now at the point of understanding the direct limit analogues of the discrete series from both a geometric and an analytic viewpoint.  (3) is a matter of completing a very beautiful topic in harmonic analysis.  (4) is a question of direct reading of the character and growth properties of a representation from its defining basic datum.  And (5) combines methods of control theory with the theory of Riemannian symmetric spaces.  That line of research concentrates, at the moment, on the development of point placement techniques for observation of the heat equation on the sphere, along with various associated quadrature and approximation techniques.    These research projects all are investigations of the role of symmetry in pure and applied mathematics.  Symmetry simplifies calculations by eliminatin g variables or constraining their range, and the structure of the symmetry group and its representations imposes patterns that always lead to better understanding of complex situations.  Thus indefinite metric quantization, which is tightly connected to project (1), has applications in particle physics.  In fact it is essential for modern understanding of quantization of the photon and other particles that require a subquotient structure.  The point placement and quadrature aspects of (5) are closely allied to the development of non- invasive methods of observation and methods of efficient computation.  That sort of consideration comes up in many situations, such as medical applications of tomography and location of toxic spills.  All five projects are closely related.  In project (5), especially, methods developed for use in pure mathematics (specifically abstract harmonic analysis and differential geometry) turn out to have extremely interesting consequences for observability, controllability and   practical computation.",
