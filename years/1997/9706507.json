 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706507    Yang    Yang proposes to study three problems in an analytic approach to conformal  geometry. The first problem is the variational problem: to minimize the square  integral of the Weyl tensor of a four dimensional manifold. The optimal   conformal class which achieves the extremal will have a canonical metric  which is often Einstein, conformally flat, or half conformally flat. The second  problem is to find apriori estimates for solutions of the prescribed scalar  curvature problem on spheres of dimension greater than three. It is expected  that there will be a new phenomenon to be understood which does not arise  in the case for spheres of lower dimensions. The general goal is to find   general conditions for the solvability of the Nirenberg problem in  these dimensions.  The third problem is to investigate regularity property of   critical maps of conformally invariant energy functionals. For biharmonic  maps in four dimension, such regularity result will permit the construction  of biharmonic maps of four dimension which represent an arbitrary homotopy  class.  Yang has already made good progress on this problem.    The project represents an analytic approach to the study of four dimensional  spacetime which may or may not model the actual physical spacetime in which  we live. The idea is to study various global quantities attached to each  spacetime that reflect the local geometric structure. We then look for  the spacetime that optimizes these global properties. The ones that do   often have nice properties and may allow one to eventually classify  the set of all possible spcetimes. The three projects outlined above  are technical aspects that need to be developed to carry out such   a program.",
