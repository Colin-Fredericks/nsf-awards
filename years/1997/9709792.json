 "awd_abstract_narration": "9709792  Morgan    The hypothesis that  plumes may entrain some outer core material  will be tested by examining the coupled 187Re-187Os 190Pt-186Os  systematics of plume-derived rocks.  190Pt decays to 186Os, so  the Pt/Os of the outer core should be much greater than  chondritic, using asteroidal cores as analogs.  Limited data  suggest that, unlike with the Re-Os system, crustal recycling  would likely not significantly affect the Pt/Os ratio of a mixed  mantle source.  The objectives of this study are to:  1)  Precisely measure the 186Os/188Os of a variety of potentially  plume-derived rocks for which Pb-Os relations suggest the  involvement of non-crustal 187Os-enriched materials, and assess  if there is a positive relation between 186Os and 187Os  enrichment.  2) Precisely and accurately measure the concentrations of Pt and  Pt/Os in a variety of mantle and crustal materials that may be  recycled into the mantle.  The goal of this aspect of the  research is to confirm or deny the preliminary evidence that  suggests recycling of crustal materials into the  mantle little affects the Pt/Os ratio of mantle-crust mixtures.  The ultimate result of this study may be a better understanding  of whether there is chemical interaction between the Earth's  outer core and lower mantle.  ***",
