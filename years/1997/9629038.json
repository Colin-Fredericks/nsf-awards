 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research plan will develop novel engineering systems for  genetic (DNA) analysis. The work will use silicon microfabrication  technology to assemble complex, integrated, DNA biochemical analysis  devices. The silicon fabrication resources created for the  microprocessor industry have the potential to make DNA analysis systems  that are inexpensive, robust, and miniaturized. Examples of a few of  the scientific fields that may benefit from these devices include: (i)  multigenic trait analysis, (ii) infectious disease diagnostics, (iii)  agricultural genetics, and (iv) the Human Diversity Program.    Specific c Aims      The biochemical and electrophoretic manipulations for DNA  genotyping and sequencing are well characterized, but have not been  assembled into a simple automated processing system. On the basis of on  established methods, the proposed effort will develop the  electrophoretic, detection, and control components of a fully  integrated technology for DNA sequencing. The use of silicon  photolithographic fabrication techniques will allow components to be  compatible, readily assembled as a single device, and inexpensive to  mass produce. The planned work will complement and extend existing  efforts in the lab to construct silicon devices for DNA genotyping.    Microfabricated sequencing devices will be developed with the following  experimental plan:  1. Construction of a miniature high resolution electrophoresis system.  Existing electrophoresis technology is able to  sizefractionatesequencingreactions800basepairsandgreaterusing gels  50-100 m thick and 50 cm long. The lab will duplicate these results  using silicon micromachined 5-100 m diameter channels. Beginning with  short (I cm length) channels, the channel length and detector  resolution will gradually be increased. For longer channels (> 5 cm),  folded columns will be used. The necessary gel channels, DNA detectors,  and controllers will be designed, fabricated, and tested. 2. Fluidic  and electronic integration of t he sequencing system. Template  preparation, biochemical reactions, and electrophoresis systems will be  integrated on a single device using silicon microfabricated components.  Integration of electronic components (detector, heaters, liquid  detectors, and temperature sensors) should allow the construction of a  self-contained sequencing system. Interconnections with external  fluidics and circuitry will be developed.  3. Elimination of sequencing bottlenecks using intelligent systems. The  proposed system of integrated fluid-handling, electrophoresis,  detector, and circuitry components allows feedback and decision-making  directly within the device. Information-based processing will be used  to reduce both the systemic and random errors for each sequencing  sample. Sequencing strategies will be tested for improved  reproducibility, error-detection, length of readable data, and  compatibility with existing sequencing; protocols.    Research description.      The initial proposed device will contain several components: liquid  injection ports, self-pumping channels based upon surface-force  gradient phenomena, thermally-isolated reaction (PCR) chambers,  decision split points, and gel electrophoresis channels. Next to, and  underneath, these components are the system's electronic detectors and  controlling circuitry. Within the system a purified DNA sample is  injected, moved to a specific location, and the enzymatic sequencing  reactions are performed. A portion of the sequencing product is  isolated and sent to a preliminary electrophoresis gel for screening.  Using the preliminary information, sequence data acquisition can be  optimized by dividing the remaining product between electrophoresis  gels with different resolution characteristics.      Increasingly complex devices can be assembled from the individual  components and basic functional modules described above. The initial  components do not perform any preliminary template handling, and  consequently well characterized template must  be used as starting  material. The proposed work will start from the basic DNA sequencing  reaction and gel electrophoresis system and work \"back\" through the  sample processing stream. Since the production of high-quality template  is one of the current difficulties in \"on-site\" DNA sequencing,  development of integral template synthesis will be essential.  Eventually, it is anticipated that the entire processing stream will be  incorporated onto the device, with all steps included within the  silicon-fabricated environment. In the limit, this will eliminate  process bottlenecks, since each sample will have its own dedicated  series of instruments.      Using silicon micromachining techniques, it may be possible to  design and build reaction and separation units that are impractical to  build by any other techniques. For example, silicon fabrication can  construct an electrophoresis chamber with hundreds of DNA detectors  along its length for the same cost as constructing a chamber with only  one sensor. The same technology that makes transistors in integrated  circuits inexpensive will allow these complicated, integrated systems  to be produced for a fraction of larger-scale equivalents. This work  will integrate proven biochemical technology with the existing  technology for micromachining and microelectronics to produce a  sequencing system that is fast, accurate, and cheap. A broad range of  disciplinary knowledge, including nucleic acid biochemistry, silicon  fabrication, circuit and sensor design bioseparations, and surface  chemistry will be essential to completing the project. Therefore,  research will continue to take advantage of established faculty  collaborations in Chemical Engineering (Dr. Mark Burns) and Electrical  Engineering (Dr. Carlos Mastrangelo), but will occur primarily within  my laboratory group.",
