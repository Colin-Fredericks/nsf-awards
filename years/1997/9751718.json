 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project integrates process control equipment in order to revise the curriculum of the Electromechanical Technology (EMT) associate degree in response to technology changes in the manufacturing industry.  The requested equipment enables the development of process control training to prepare technicians better for the maintenance and operation of sophisticated processing systems that are prevalent in modern facilities.  The process control curriculum is integrated with the current motion control training by replacing outmoded segments of the curriculum, redesigning the course structure, and developing two new courses.  The final segment of the curriculum modification requires new process control equipment to offer real-world experimentation opportunities to student technicians.  A unique feature of the Electromechanical Technology associate degree program design is that all of the course material is formatted for individualized instruction providing greater accessibility to the technical education needed by the nontraditional students and special populations who are primarily enrolled in this degree.  This model of instruction for electromechanical training has created widespread national interest in replication for other colleges as a method to address enrollment problems in traditionally designed programs and minimize equipment investments within limited budgets.  *",
