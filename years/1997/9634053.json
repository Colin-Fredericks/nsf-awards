 "awd_abstract_narration": "96-34053  Landry  This research project is part of the US Joint Global Ocean  Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1 ) a  better understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both organic  and inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2) identifying the  physical, ecological and biogeochemical favors and processes  which regulate the magnitude and variability of these  fluxes, and (3) placing these fluxes into the context of the  contemporary global carbon cycle.    The Southern Ocean is a vast and variable environment with a  potentially large role in global carbon cycling. The JGOFS  Southern Ocean Program seeks to advance the understanding of  this region by investigating seasonal and spatial dynamics  in two important subsystems -- the Ross Sea shelf and the  Antarctic Polar Front Zone. This project will contribute to  this effort by determining microbial community structure and  by assessing rates of phytoplankton growth and  microzooplankton grazing on four cruises covering the  spring, summer, and autumn seasons in the open-ocean frontal  zone. The overall goal of this research is to understand how  physical processes (advection, mixing, and light),  iron-limitation, and grazing interact to determine plankton  community structure and production in the open oceans.    Population abundances and biomasses of the plankton  community will be assessed by analytical flow cytometry  (bacteria and phytoplankton) and microscopy (nano- and  microplankton) to determine their temporal and spatial  patterns relative to physical features of the polar front.  Growth rates of phytoplankton and bacteria, and  microzooplankton herbivory and bacterivory will be measured  with a suite of complementary methods including dilution,  fluorescently labeled prey, size fractionation, and a  Iysozme assay for bacterivory. Results of this project will  contribute to the general understanding of phytoplankton  control mechanisms and trophic interactions in  high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions of the world's  ocea ns. They will also help to identify how potential global  change affects water-column stability and how physical  forcing in the Southern Ocean may alter food web structure,  carbon storage and export from the euphotic zone.",
