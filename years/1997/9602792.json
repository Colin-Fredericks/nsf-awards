 "awd_abstract_narration": "Founded in 1901, Grambling State University (GSU), a historically black university, is the recipient of an award for the renovation of Carver Hall.  Constructed in 1958, Carver Hall is home to the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science.  Realizing the importance of providing students with opportunities to gain research experiences, GSU continues to develop research programs that have been key to their success in preparing students for graduate studies.  However, current research laboratories in Carver Hall are inadequate to support modern research and research training activities.  Deficiencies include: the improper functioning of fume hoods, insufficient electrical outlets, poor ventilation, antiquated plumbing, and inadequate bench space that places severe constraints on research personnel and hinders productivity.  Funds from the ARI Program will be used to renovate thirteen laboratories and relocate two labs that are housed in a portable building.  The renovations involve removing asbestos, upgrading existing and installing new fume hoods, correcting structural problems, upgrading heating and cooling systems, and installing communication wiring.  Extensive plumbing and electrical work will be performed as well as installing gas, compressed air and vacuum lines.  Improvements will be made to the drainage system of the animal facility and the animal housing area will be partitioned to allow for the housing of more than one species.  This project will allow faculty to continue to conduct innovative research, assist in the recruitment of outstanding faculty and students, and aid in increasing the number of underrepresented scientists in the nation.",
