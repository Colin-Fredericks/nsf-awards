Ms. Gaddam will  work with Dr. Keiichi Tanaka, Director of the Process  Synthesis Laboratory, on a research project entitled,  \"Titaniumdioxide Films as an Efficient Photocatalyst for the  Degradation of Organic Pollutants in Waste Water\".    The proposed research will examine how catalytically-active  high-surface area titaniumdioxide films act as an efficient  photocatalyst for the degradation of organic pollutants.  Although titaniumdioxide powders are used widely for this  purpose, there has been complications using catalyst powders  in slurry photoreactors as a result of filtration problems.  One of the main objectives of this research will be to  improve the surface area distribution of the catalyst so as  to improve its relative effect in the degradation process.  The primary goal of the research is to develop a viable  catalyst that would effectively and immediately mineralize  environmentally harmful pollutants, volatile  hydrochlorocarbons in particular, to harmless chemicals.  ***",
