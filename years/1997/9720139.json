 "awd_abstract_narration": "Garcia, G.   MCB 97-20139  1. Technical  The biosynthesis of tRNA is a surprisingly complicated process.  One, much neglected aspect of this process is the incorporation of modified bases.  The physiological roles of modified bases are largely unknown, however, there is evidence that they are involved in differentiation, proliferation, and ribosomal frameshifting.  A key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway in E. coli of the modified nucleoside queuine is tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT).  Experiments designed for this study have three specific aims, the first of which is to extend previous studies of the recognition of tRNA by TGT.  A collaboration has been established with Dr. Ralf Ficner (University of Marburg, Germany) to determine the structure of a tRNA TGT complex as well as structures of mutant enzymes and interesting tRNA analogues.  Concurrently, the generation and evaluation of tRNA chimeras and a biochemical investigation of ribose phosphate backbone recognition by TGT is carried out.  The second specific aim involves a combination of analogue design/synthesis and site-directed mutagenesis to study heterocyclic substrate recognition by TGT.  The third specific aim is to use the mutant TGTs with altered tRNA and heterocyclic substrate recognition developed in specific aims 1 and 2 to probe the role of the queuine modification.    2. Nontechnical  The biosynthesis of tRNA is a surprisingly complicated process.  One, much neglected aspect of this process involves the incorporation and physiological role(s) of modified bases.  This project is undertaken to advance previous studies of the key enzyme involved in the modification of tRNA with queuine, tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT).  The specific aims of the project are to elucidate how proteins recognize nucleic acids (tRNA) and small molecules, and to understand the physiological role of the queuine modification.",
