The proposed technology is expected to provide two or three orders of magnitude increase in sensitivity over existing near infrared technologies and allow the development of diode-based, portable instruments for high sensitivity (ppm-ppb range) point monitoring of trace gases. This technology also allows for the development of versatile sensors suitable for the detection of chemical/biological agents in both gas and liquid media for a broad scope of applications in science and industry. During Phase I, PXL will design and test a proprietary sensor component and will develop, and experimentally confirm a numerical model that simulates the proposed system. Using the confirmed model, numerical simulations will be conducted to develop the instrument's optimized design and to predict its performance. The Phase II research program will develop a point sensor based on the proposed technology for the remote monitoring of ammonia in off-gas waste streams in real time.   The proposed sensor will particularly benefit industrial process control, underground pipeline and tank leak detection, and geological exploration for oil and natural gas. It will also find applications in clinical/medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, detection of battle field chemical and biological warfare agents, and other personal safety devices. The broad scope of applications indicates a large potential market for this technology. ***",
