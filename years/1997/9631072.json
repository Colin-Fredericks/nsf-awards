This research will determine how specific cellular RNA molecule is targeted to the distinct subcellular compartments by testing to hypothesis that the intranuclear maturation and targeting of U3 small nucleolar RNA to nucleoli is the result of specific interactions between discrete sequence domains of the U3 RNA and specific proteins and other intranuclear structures.  Important U3 RNA nucleotide sequences will be identified by microinjecting \"tagged\" variant U3 RNAs and hybrid RNAs into Xenopus oocytes and assaying the ability of these RNAs to become localized to nucleoli.  The intranuclear distribution of radioactive or fluorescent-tagged U3 RNAs in oocyte nuclei will be determined by both subnuclear fractionation and light microscopy.  The general significance of observations of U3 RNA will be tested by similar analysis of the closely related U8 small nucleolar RNA.    RNA transport and localization are required steps in the gene expression pathway essential for the growth, differentiation and development of all eukaryotic cells.  This research will determine how a specific cellular RNA molecule is targeted to the distinct subcellular compartments by testing the hypothesis that the intranuclear maturation and targeting of U3 small nucleolar RNA to nucleoli is the result of specific interactions between discrete sequence domains of the U3 RNA and specific proteins an other intranuclear structures.  U3 RNA is required for the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA into mature ribosomal RNA in the nucleolus; failure localize U3 RNA in the nucleolus will prevent ribosome production and result in cell death.  This research will provide general insight into the mechanisms that direct trafficking of RNA to subcellular sites of function.",
