 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Deborah Tahmassebi, Department of Chemistry, University of San Diego   is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Program of the Chemistry   Division under a Research Planning Grant to explore the synthesis of new   pyrene-based fluorescent DNA base analogues.   Commercially available,   fluorescent pyrene based aromatics will be halogenated, converted to the   corresponding Grignard reagent, and reacted with cadmium chloride to   afford the organocadmium derivative.     1(alpha)-chloro-2-deoxy-D-ribofuranosyl bis(p-toluate) will be   synthesized from commercially available 2-deoxy-d-ribose and reacted with   the organocadmium derivative to achieve the desired fluorescent   nucleoside.   By eliminating the flexible hydrocarbon link to the   lumiphore, this methodology removes the ambiguity inherent in currently   available probes.   The spectroscopic properties of the fluorescent   nucleoside will be established and compared to those of the nucleoside   incorporated into DNA to probe the micro-structure and -environment of    the nucleic acid in solution.   Given the interest in determining the   solution phase structure of DNA, a Research Planning Grant at this point   in Dr. Tahmassebi's career will provide the basis for a competitive NSF   proposal.  Molecular structure is a significant determinant of the properties of a   molecule. Large biopolymers, such as DNA, possess flexible structures   that assume different configurations, and hence different properties in   fluid solution.   The synthetic methodology developed here will afford a   series of fluorescent nucleosides that can be incorporated into DNA.     The fluorescence of the incorporated molecules is then used as a   spectroscopic probe of the dynamics of duplex DNA formation and the   structure of the biopolymer in fluid solution.",
