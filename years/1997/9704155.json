 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704155      Hunter      The proposal is to study a number of nonlinear partial  differential equations which model various physical and biological  systems.  The first equation is a free-boundary value problem which  models the deposition of surfactant on a surface by a liquid droplet.   There is a complex interaction between the motion of the droplet on the  surface and the deposition of surfactant. The second equation is a system  of reaction-diffusion equations which models an islet of beta-cells in  the pancreas. The aim of Professor Hunter's research is to understand the  collective dynamics of the beta-cells and the formation of spatial  patterns in an islet.  The third equation is a two dimensional Burgers  equation which models the diffraction and reflection of weak shock waves  in two space dimensions, where there are longstanding discrepancies  between theory and experiment.  The fourth equation is a modulation  equation which describes the propagation of nonlinear gravitational waves  in Einstein's theory of general relativity. Professor Hunter proposes to  study this equation with the aim of understanding the formation of  space-time singularities in a nonlinear gravitational wave.    Mathematical models of physical and biological systems provide a way to  understand, predict, and control the behavior of those systems. The  proposed research involves the study of a number of mathematical  models of systems of importance in engineering, biology, and basic  science. One model describes the deposition of surfactant on a surface by  droplets.  Surface deposition has many applications in materials science,  including the printing of very small structures on surfaces for the  control of fluids, and as an experimental means of preparing liquid  crystal display screens. A second model describes the collective  behavior of beta-cells in the pancreas. These cells produce insulin and  play a central role in diseases like diabetes. A third model describes  the propagation of shock waves, which  are generated by transonic or  supersonic aircraft, in turbines, and in many other high-speed fluid  flows.  The mathematical theory of shock waves remains very poorly  understood. The fourth model is a set of equations which describe the  propagation of nonlinear gravitational waves in Einstein's general theory  of relativity.  The general theory of relativity is the fundamental  physical theory of gravity, and it describes the large scale cosmological  structure of the universe.  The main obstacle to understanding the  predictions of the theory is the nonlinearity of the Einstein equations.  This work is directed towards an increased understanding of the effects  of this nonlinearity.",
