 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, in the laboratory of Professor Ted Madey at  Rutgers University, addresses questions of the energy transfer and  charge exchange in the interaction of very low energy ions with  various surfaces.  Support is provided by the Analytical and  Surface Chemistry Program to probe the interaction of low energy  atomic and molecular ions with overlayers of inert gases, thin film  metals and oxides, and condensed molecular layers.  Ions are formed  at low energies by electron stimulated desorption, and the energy  distribution and identity of emitted ions is probed as a function  of overlayer composition and thickness.  Experimental results will  be compared with calculations which simulate these processes.  This  information is basic to our understanding of many ion based surface  analysis techniques, as well as the dynamics of radiation chemistry  and low energy plasma processing of materials.  The interaction of low energy ions with surfaces is crucial in the  application of analytical methods using ion probes of surface  structure and composition, as well as in the interaction of low  energy ions in materials processing and in radiation chemistry.   This research project explores the detailed mechanism of the  interaction of low energy ions with a variety of surfaces, with the  goal of obtaining a molecular level understanding of these  mechanisms.  Detailed experimental measurements will be coupled  with calculational studies of these processes.",
