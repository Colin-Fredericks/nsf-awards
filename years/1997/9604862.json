 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604862  Jeftinija    Two of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters in  the brain are the  amino acids glutamate and aspartate. The effectiveness of  information  transfer within the brain depends on the release of these  excitatory amino  acids from neurons, the interaction of these amino acids  with specific  receptors on target cells, and the termination of these  interactions by the  uptake of glutamate and aspartate from the extracellular  milieu. This latter  function is accomplished by glial cells. However, recent in  vitro studies  have shown that glial cells can also release these  excitatory amino acids  when stimulated by specific neuroligands such as bradykinin,  and in turn  cause neurons to release their neurotransmitters.  Neuroligand-stimulated  glial release of glutamate and aspartate is receptor  mediated and calcium  dependent, resembling neurotransmitter release from neurons.  Glia may thus  be far more important for normal brain function than  previously imagined,  and may even serve to convey information in the nervous  system, a role  previously reserved for neurons.   The main objective of this proposal is to determine how  glial cells  actually release glutamate. There are three possible  mechanisms: (i)  neuroligand binding may cause reversal of the cross-membrane  glutamate  transporter which is know to be present in glial cells; (ii)  neuroligand  binding may cause glial swelling, which in turn might  release glutamate  through pores formed in the stretched cell wall; (iii)  neuroligand binding  may cause glutamate release by an exocytotic mechanism  similar to that which  neurons use to release glutamate and other  neurotransmitters. It will be  determine which of these possible mechanisms is responsible  for  neuroligand-stimulated release of glutamate from glial  cells, studying  isolated cultured glial cells as well as brain slice  preparations in which  glial cells maintain their relationships with surrounding  cells.   Understanding the mechanism of rel ease of excitatory amino  acids from glial  cells will allow us to elucidate the crucial roles of these  cells in the  transmission of information within the brain.",
