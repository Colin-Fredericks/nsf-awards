 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723842  French  Among mammals, infant care is commonly limited to maternal care.  However, in a  small proportion of species, fathers and other group members  contribute to the  care and provisioning of dependent infants (paternal and  alloparental care,  respectively).  Although we know much about the patterning of this  care, little  attention has been directed toward the underlying mechanisms that  regulate the  delivery of parental care by individuals other than the mother.  The studies proposed  will examine the physiological and experiential determinants of  parental care in the  black tufted-ear marmoset (Callithrix kuhli). In the marmoset,  maternal effort is limited  essentially to nursing, and adult males and older offspring  provide the majority  of care to dependent infants.  Initial observations indicate that  older sons and fathers  living in family groups undergo breast elaboration in the presence  of infants, suggesting an  endocrine involvement in infant care by males.  Through the use of  unobtrusive  behavioral observations and noninvasive urine sample collection,  French will test the  degree to which responsiveness to infants and levels of parental  behavior are affected by  gonadal steroids (estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone) and  pituitary peptides  (prolactin). The generality or specificity of the physiological  responses to infants will be  tested by comparing the endocrine responses of both marmosets and  squirrel monkeys  (a non-paternal species) to infant-associated stimuli.  Further,  the strength of the social  attachment between male and female partners, assumed to be  critical for the evolution  of male parental care, will be tested by providing pairs with a  variety of threats to the  integrity of the pair (e.g., temporary separations, encounters  with strangers).  Together,  these projects will provide insights into the mechanisms that  control responsiveness to  infants and adult social partners in a species characterized by  high levels of male parenta l  care and strong heterosexual relationships.",
