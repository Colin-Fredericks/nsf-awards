 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is widely believed that NP does not equal coNP.  This  means that there are coNP sets for which some elements  require superpolynomial length proofs of membership.  Are  there coNP sets for which the average element requires  superpolynomial length proofs of membership?  Exponential  length?  One goal of this research is to find evidence that  such sets exist.  For example, what is a plausible  complexity theoretic assumption under which these average  case hard coNP sets exist?   Such a result would generalize  the study of average case complexity to work against  nondeterministic algorithms.  Furthermore, arguing for the  existence of these sets is part of an approach to proving  the independence of P not equal NP.  It has already been  argued that the existence of doubly exponentially -hard one  way functions rules out P/poly-natural proofs that  SATISFIABILITY requires superpolynomial circuits.  Furthermore, this implies that propositional proof systems  with the interpolation property do not have polynomially  bounded proofs that SAT is not in P/poly.  It might be  possible to generalize the `natural proof/interpolation'  approach in order to prove an important independence result  for SAT not in P/poly.  If average case hard coNP sets of  the right type do exist, then there are no NP/poly-natural  proofs of SAT not in P/poly.  This would imply that  propositional systems with the existential interpolation  property do not have polynomially-bounded proofs of SAT not  in P/poly. Hard coNP sets would have two important  consequences.  1) Generalize the known limits of P/poly  natural proofs to NP/poly-natural proofs.  2) Extend  independence results from systems with the interpolation  property to systems with the existential interpolation  property.  The more powerful independence tools might be  extensible to a proof system such as Extended Frege.",
