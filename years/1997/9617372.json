Eigenmann, Rudolf  Purdue University    CISE Research Instrumentation: Symmetric Multiprocessor for Research on Parallel Architecture, Compiler, Applications and On-demand Network-computing    This research instrumentation grant enables collaboration between two universities in four areas of research:-Hierarchical Processor-and-Memory Architecture for-High Performance Computing - An Advanced Program Analysis and Compilation Infrastructure- Characterization of Large (Petaflop) Computational Applications - Metaprogramming and On-demand Metacomputing for Network-based Computational Hubs. The focus of this project is on advancing the state of the art in high-performance computing on the four fronts:- the design of high-performance computers capable of 100 trillion operations per second (i.e. 100 TOPS),- advanced tools for analysis and compilation of programs for execution on machines with multiple processors,- the characterization of applications that require computation rates of 100-1000 TOPS and- the design of a network-based software infrastructure that allows the use of linked computers and linked programs (i.e., metacomputers and metaprograms) through conventional network browsers. The main ideas currently under investigation are being validated through extensive computational experiments and computer simulations. The equipment acquired with the funds provided by this grant provides the computational speed, memory, storage and communication demands of the experimental component of this project which would otherwise not be possible or take unacceptably long times to perform. The experimentation made possible by the availability of a symmetric multiprocessor is essential to the validation of research ideas and results pursued in this project. This work is being carried collaboratively by researchers at Purdue University and Northwestern University.",
