 "awd_abstract_narration": "Everyday objects like paper clips, pencils, and aluminum cans are taken   for granted, yet their design and production present tremendous challenges to   engineers in terms of working tolerances, quality control, and economy of   manufacture, not to mention aesthetics and ergonomics. Thus, these simple   artifacts provide ideal case studies for introducing students to a wide   variety of engineering concepts, principles, and problems in already familiar   and readily accessible real-world contexts. In this project, a variety of   analytical and computer models of simple objects like paper clips will be   developed, in conjunction with desk-top experiments, to introduce students to   the methods and limitations of design, analysis, and development in   engineering. The simplest models will be accessible to firstyear students, yet   will necessarily involve enough restrictive assumptions and simplifications to   make them suitable also for refinement, extension, and further use in   subsequent courses. The analytical and computer models, as well as the   complementary desk-top experiments employing actual paper clips and, to the   extent permitted by the scope of the project, other manufactured objects, will   be suitable to introduce and guide individual and group design exercises   focused on the redesign and improvement of the artifacts explored. In addition   to the development and use of models for design and redesign, this project   will also develop larger contexts into which to present the design problem, so   that students will be exposed to other aspects of product realization,   including marketing and sales considerations. In this way, the analytical   aspects of engineering will not be presented in a vacuum. Finally, the   pedagogical resources developed in this project will be presented in articles   for wide dissemination and use throuqhout the enqineerinq curriculum.",
