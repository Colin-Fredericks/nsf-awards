 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study looks at a neglected field in American natural history. It examines American participation in an international `extinction` controversy involving the location of fossil bones of an animal incognitum found on the banks of the Ohio River.  The focus is on a debate involving a network of correspondence between Americans and Europeans in which knowledge in the form of written and visual descriptions, specimens, and publications flowed back and forth across the Atlantic.  This network was the principal means by which naturalists obtained knowledge about distant objects of Nature.  The location of these fossil bones in North America gave the contributions of American naturalists unique epistemic importance in the debate.  The study examines American participation in the controversy as a means of understanding the social relations that governed this transatlantic community of naturalists.",
