 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710138  Morss    This grant outlines a development Web page effort to seek out the  existing sources of stratospheric data and analyses from available  Government and military sites.  This grant will accomplish three  specific tasks:  1) To search out, using Internet search engineers  and personal contacts within the scientific community, all  pertinent sites with data or analyses pertaining to the  stratospheric portions of the Earth's atmosphere. 2) To design and  create an appropriate set of Web pages to bring this information to  one location; this would be comprised of a master homesite with  links to appropriate sub-pages relating to specific topic or data  areas.  This approach keeps the site manageable in terms of  updating in the future and relating the information page content in  a more meaningful manner.  3) To revise the syllabi of those  courses the PI teacher to reflect the content of the stratospheric  pages and their relationship within the course structure.    The results of this development will bring widely scattered  information to one reference site for future use by Creighton  students, as well as by the other member institutions of the  Unidata community interested in middle and upper atmospheric  studies.  The exposure to real-world data in addressing problems  within the classroom will serve the students well in preparing them  for the work force.",
