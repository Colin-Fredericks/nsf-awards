This Dissertation Research Improvement project addresses this gap through systematically examining the effects of social network structure on labor market mobility.  The investigator argues that structural holes, defined as non-redundant contacts within networks, can increase the: (1) total amount of information an employee has about \"a better job,\" (2) information an employer has on potential employees, and (3) usefulness of the information an employee obtains.  A series of models and testable hypotheses are formulated based on these assumptions.  Data will be gathered from the population of television station managers in the United States.   Specifically, 600 television station managers will be asked to complete a mail survey which requests information on the respondent's social network, job history and sources of job information obtained when looking for a job.  Include in this survey will be mangers who changed as well as those who did not change jobs during 1996.  ****",
