 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prasad Polavarapu of Vanderbilt University is supported by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities to (i) develop a step-scan polarization   division interferometer with double polarization modulation and digital   signal processing capabilities, and (ii) use this instrument to   investigate protein-anesthetic interactions and host-guest interactions   for carcinogens encapsulated in cyclodextrin cavities.  Enantiomers of   chiral molecules show differences in their effectiveness as anesthetics.    To better understand the stereospecific interactions at the molecular   level, the PI will study the absolute configurations of chiral   enantiomers and the conformations in which the anesthetic molecules   exist.  For elucidating guest-host interactions, a series of substituted   oxiranes will serve as guest molecules trapped in cyclodextrin cavities.    Isotopic substitution will be exploited to isolate the spectral bands due   to the guest molecule, and to determine the perturbations imposed by the   host.  The PI will probe the vibrational transitions of chiral molecules   using circularly polarized light.    These studies have tremendously important implications in the area of   drug design, where differences in the effectiveness of enantiomers can be   quite dramatic.  For example, one enantiomer of the infamous drug,   thalidomide, is known to be a sedative while the other causes severe   birth defects.  Why two molecules of `nearly` identical structure could   have such completely different effects on the human body is not at all   clear.  This is fundamental chemistry, the results of which will have a   significant impact in the area of biotechnology.",
