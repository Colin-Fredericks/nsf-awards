 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for DMS-97-03877  H. Alexander         Alexander will study five problem areas in several complex  variables: 1. Boundaries of Analytic Varieties and Linking. Given a  smooth manifold M in complex space, when is M the boundary of  a bounded analytic variety? Our aim is to formulate a global  geometric condition that M bounds in terms of linking numbers.  The main tool here is the Harvey and Lawson theory.  2. Analytic  disks and Gromov's method. The method of Gromov's well-known  1985 paper on Lagrangian manifolds and pseudo holomorphic  curves was adapted and applied in a paper of the proposer to  study analytic disks with boundary in totally real manifolds. This  study will be continued. 3.  Hulls of sets in the torus. Well-known  examples of Stolzenberg and Wermer give polynomial hulls  without analytic structure. The proposer is interested in the  problem of finding hulls, without analytic structure, of sets in the  unit torus.  4. Fabre's Theorem. 5. Integrals involving  analytic functions. Possible quantitative versions of Siu's recent  lemma on the inheritance of non-integrability by restriction will  be explored.          This project involves the study of problems in complex  analysis. The word \"complex\" here does not mean \"complicated\"  but rather makes reference to \"complex numbers.\"  Complex  numbers are nowadays routinely studied in high-school and a  college course in \"complex variables,\"  because the material is so  useful, is part of the basic undergraduate curriculum for  engineers and scientists. The current project is directed toward  better understanding \"multidimensional complex space.\" Recent  research in this area of mathematics continues to have  applications; for example, in the engineering field of control  theory.",
