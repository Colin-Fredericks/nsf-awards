Rural areas of Oklahoma contain one of the largest and most diverse populations of American Indians in the world.  Over 35 tribal groups have their own education officers and special education support systems, and most American Indian Students in Oklahoma attend public schools.  Rural Oklahoma also has a significant, growing population of Hispanics and a significant concentration of African Americans.    The proposal has linked to broad-based partnerships and plans to develop coherent linkages with existing programs to target systemic reform in Oklahoma.  The primary focus will be the establishment of a foundation for implementation of systemic reform in science, mathematics and technology education throughout the state, including the development of an implementation proposal to NSF.",
