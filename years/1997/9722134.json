 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bell 9722134        Lake populations of the threespine stickleback fish  (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are believed to be derived from  marine populations that migrate to fresh water to breed. Lake  populations have diverged morphologically and behaviorally  from the marine condition. Stickleback in some lakes feed on  plankton in open water and are often exposed to predators.  Stickleback in other lakes feed on bottom-living  invertebrates and frequent vegetated habitats that provide  refuge from predators. Adults that differ in feeding mode  show body-shape variation that is probably related to the  swimming styles favored by different foraging behaviors and  predation risks. Little is known of foraging mode,  locomotion, and body shape in larval and juvenile  stickleback. The proposed study will quantify variation in  (1) morphological features that affect predator evasion and  foraging locomotion (using new methods involving  morphological landmarks) and (2) swimming ability (by  measuring steady and evasive swimming performance) in larvae,  juveniles, and adults from different lake populations in  Alaska. Variation in vertebral number, which may affect  evasive swimming, will also be analyzed. Lake populations  will be compared with a migratory population (the putative  ancestral form). Field observations and stomach-content  analyses will be conducted to assess variation through  development and among populations in diet, foraging behavior,  and microhabitat use.",
