 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will construct a database of dorsal fin images  of Tursiops truncatus (bottlenose dolphins) sighted near the  Texas and California coasts, and software to automatically  identify individual dolphins based on fin morphology. The  system will be used to match individuals in new photographs  to existing known individuals by finding the database member  that most resembles the new input data. An existing resource  of many thousands of images of dolphins will be processed by  the system and will constitute the largest searchable  database of dolphin sightings available.  The database will  provide new information regarding the site fidelity and  migratory patterns of dolphins. The system will be developed  for immediate use in marine biological research, and will be  demonstrated and tested using images of the dorsal fins of  dolphins. However, the system will be sufficiently versatile  for many other applications requiring identification of  individual animals.    The project will be conducted by two collaborating teams of  investigators: computer scientists and biologists. Each team  has specific objectives, but their coordinated work will  result in a computer-based biological research tool that  will be useful to investigators conducting studies requiring  the identification of individuals within a population.    The computational objectives of the project will be to:    1.Extract the individuals' fin shapes from photographic  data; 2.Calculate of characteristics of the shape that can  be used to    distinguish one individual from another;  3.Create of a database of images, indexed by the features    extracted from the images;  4.Provide capabilities for entering data, building,    searching,  and modifying databases, with a convenient    user interface.      The software system will be offered to biologists needing to  identify individuals of any species on the basis of  photographic data. The image processing portion of the  system will be suitable for recognizing a profile of a bo dy  part, such as a fin or an ear, having distinctive  irregularities. The database system, however, will not be  limited to descriptions of profile shapes, but will be  applicable to any situation where some distinctive aspect of  an animals appearance can be measured.    The dolphin database will be made available to investigators  interested in behavioral biology of cetaceans, and to  ecologists interested in the environmental influences acting  upon abundance and distribution patterns.",
