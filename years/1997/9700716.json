The   symmetry,  anisotropy,  and  temperature dependencies  of  spin  and  charge  excitations  will  be  studied  to elucidate  the  unconventional  ground  and low-lying excited states of Kondo insulators. Studies  of the magnetic field and pressure dependencies of the charge and  spin  excitations  will  be performed. Finally,  studies  of  the  phonon  anomalies  in Kondo insulators will  be  carried  out  to  clarify  the nature of the strong interaction between charge  and  phonon degrees of freedom.  %%%  This  research  project  involves experimental  light  scattering  measurements from \"Kondo insulators\",  a poorly understood  class  of  insulators containing rare earth and actinide elements. These  compounds  display  unusual magnetic and  electrical  properties,  believed  to  be  due  to the interaction between  tightly  bound  electrons on the heavy rare earth or actinide elements,  and  the  outer  shell electrons from the lighter elements. It is desirable  to  carefully  measure the novel behavior,  and,  ultimately,  to  extend the theory of crystalline solids to cover these cases.  If  this  is done the theory can be more confidently applied  to  the  wider  range of solids which includes semiconductors, metals  and  others,  which find wide application in technology. Results  from  this  research may include unusual new effects or materials which  may find new application in technology. This research project  is  interdisciplinary  in  nature  and  involves  both  graduate  and  postgraduate  students who will be excellently trained  to  enter  positions in industry, government or education.  ***",
