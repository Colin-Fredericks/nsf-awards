 "awd_abstract_narration": "Daubechies    ABSTRACT    Daubechies will concentrate on several aspects of wavelet algorithms   and their applications: a) Riesz bases of wavelets on the sphere:   Recent constructions of  wavelet algorithms on the sphere lead to   good numerical performance; so far no proof exists that they   correspond to Riesz bases for the square integrable  functions on the sphere. Traditional methods for planar   constructions exploit translational invariance, absent for   triangulations on the sphere. b) Irregular subdivision schemes   construct curves or surfaces from irregular grids, placing new grid   points in positions that are not equally spaced (even locally) as   the grids are refined. Similar to the equally spaced  case, preservation of polynomial behavior plays an important role in  determining the smoothness of the limit curve or surface. Such   irregular subdivision schemes are being explored. c) Approaches to   decompose wavelet filters into elementary matrices in an  efficient manner, and possibly using only integers. d) Frames of   wavelets can be used for multiplexing of signals, similar to  CDMA, as well as for sending information efficiently over multiple  channels. e) The role of smart coding strategies in realizing the   full potential of wavelet-based nonlinear approximation theorems.    Wavelets are a mathematical technique that allows us to view a   complex structure as consisting of several, increasingly detailed   layers. This \"multi-resolution analysis\" is analogous to viewing   a painting from a distance, where only large features can be   distinguished, and then, as we approach closer, perceiving more   detailed, smaller features, until, when we are very close, we can   detect even individual brush strokes. As a  mathematical tool that has this potential to \"fill in\" detail at  increasingly small scales, and only where needed, wavelets have   turned out to be useful in computer aided graphic design, in image   and data compression, and in mathematical analysis and numerical    computation, in particular for composite materials. Several of the   mathematical problems in this proposal are inspired by such   applications of wavelets, and their solutions will widen the scope   of settings in which we can use multi-resolution analysis.",
