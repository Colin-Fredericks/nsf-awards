 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field research outlined in this proposal is designed to assess the potential of the last unexplored region of Africa's Great Rift Valley for augmenting our knowledge of human origins.  Extensive archeological and fossil evidence for human evolution has been found in and adjacent to the Great Rift Valley in Malawi, Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia.  A research team from the University of Florence has already found a partial fossil human skeleton in the Eritrean Rift, associated with abundant fossil animal remains.  No doubt, further clues, necessary for a fuller understanding of humankind's past will be located in the Eritrean Rift Valley.  Due to a 30-year-long conflict in the Horn of Africa, access for field work in Eritrea has been impossible.  The research outlined in this proposal will be conducted in collaboration with the Eritrean Ministry of Mines, Energy and Water Resources, as well as the National Museum and the University of Asmara.  These organizations are eager to develop manpower and explore the Eritrean Rift Valley for fossil and archeological information relevant to human evolution. Information gathered in this initial reconnaissance will permit us to identify specific sites for in-depth survey, collection and excavation in subsequent field seasons.",
