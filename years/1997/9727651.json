 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727651  Shonnard  The PI's propose to create an open internet-based workshop  devoted to pollution prevention (P2) research and education in  academia.  The goal of the open workshop and the associated face-  to face meetings of a group of core participants is to focus a  diversity of technical backgrounds and practical experience on P2  issues in higher education.  These core participants will be  chosen based on a brief position paper from a list of national P2  experts which will be compiled as part of the project goals.  The  objective is to formulate a set of recommendations and guidelines  for the conduct of P2 research in academia which will help to  establish the foundation for research scholarship and encourage  technology transfer to industry.  An additional goal is the  establishment of pedagogical approaches designed to ground  students in various technical disciplines on basic environmental  literacy and the fundamentals of P2 and it's implementation in  industry.  Results of the open workshop and meetings will be  summarized within a section of the proposed web site, will be  published in peer-reviewed literature, and will be presented at  professional meetings.  Additional P2 information and links will  form an integral part of the web site.  Abstracts from the  environmental technology program and results from NSF funded  research in the area of P2 will also be highlighted.  ***",
