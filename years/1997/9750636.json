 "awd_abstract_narration": "Georgia Southern University requests matching funds to purchase a modern laser-based fluorescence spectrometer. This purchase will enhance middle and upper division elements of our dynamic undergraduate curriculum, and will provide experimental capabilities not currently available at this institution, or in the entire South Georgia region. Several new experiments, as well as some of a more traditional nature, are proposed. This instrument provides a unique opportunity for undergraduates to investigate chemical phenomena on the picosecond timescale in addition to being able to perform standard fluorometric investigations ALL within the same routine, user-friendly environment. Student exposure to the instrument will begin at the sophomore level and continue throughout the chemistry curriculum, allowing for critically needed enhancement of our existing upper-level classes. A new course will be developed as a direct result of a successful proposal. Further, dozens of chemistry students and faculty from area universities will have access, allowing the benefits to reach far beyond the confines of GSU. Finally, our department is committed to local outreach, frequently hosting K-12 students on campus for interactiw demonstrations. Lasers are traditionally excellent captivators of student interest and their presence will further enliven these visits. A successful proposal will bring much needed modern technology to a strong department composed primarily of young and enthusiastic chemistry educators committed not only to the highest quality of chemistry education, but also to innovation and reform in the discipline.  *",
