It was carried out from the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer in the austral winter of 1994.  The work proposed here concerns  long time series measurements of upper ocean temperature, salinity, and current speed from a drifting buoy anchored to the sea ice.   The eastern Weddell Sea is a region where a warm regime, defined by the intrusion of warm circumpolar deep water with temperatures near +1 deg C, and a cold regime exist side by side.  The cold regime occurs to the west, where deep water is overlain by a thick near-freezing mixed layer. In both regions however enough heat is seasonally carried to the sea ice to melt it completely.     The specific objective of the proposed work is to improve our understanding of how the intense mixing events associated with frequent storms affect the structure and seasonal evolution of  the upper layers of the ocean and the sea ice cover.  The structure of the upper layers in turn affects the stability of the deeper ocean, and determines the depth of convection and the longer term variability in temperature and salinity of the deep ocean.  ***  ??",
