The researchers aim to understand the effects of  forest fragmentation on patterns of habitat selection and  movement by fruit-eating birds.  This understanding is  important because birds disseminate the seeds of many  tropical forest plants.  For this study, the researchers  will examine the relative influence of patch-level  (vegetation structure, fruit abundance) and landscape-level  factors (habitat placement in the landscape) on patterns of  habitat use by studying  bird use of three common habitat  types in a landscape dominated by pasture in the Los Tuxtlas  region of Veracruz, Mexico.    The research will have three basic objectives: 1)  determination of use patterns of distinct habitat types; 2)  development of a series of hypotheses (matrix models) to  predict bird movement; and 3) validation and refinement of  these models through comparison with an independently  derived data set on movement patterns.  The Mexican  counterparts at the Institute of Ecology in Xalapa have been  studying the role of isolated fig species in promoting seed  dispersal by fruit-eating vertebrates in Los Tuxtlas.  Data  collected in this study will complement the work of these  collaborators by examining the roles of patches and riparian  corridors in patterns of habitat selection and movement  by  fruit-eating birds.  ***",
