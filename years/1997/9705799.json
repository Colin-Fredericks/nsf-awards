 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal:  ECS-9705799    Principal Investigator:  Steven Turley (Congress Chair)      The International Conference on Soft X-Rays in the 21st Century, which will be held in Midway, UT, on January 8-11, 1996, has been organized to promote progress in this field by disseminating current research results and by projecting where these technologies will lead in the next century.  Soft x-ray technology is maturing to the point that it will facilitate breakthroughs in diverse fields.  Current and future applications of this technology will impact biology, medicine, materials research, high density circuit fabrication, plasma diagnostics, astronomy, and other areas. Student support for attendance at the conference is provided in this grant. The supported students who attend this conference will have an opportunity to interact with experts in soft x-ray science and technology.  They will become aware of research opportunities and techniques to extend this technology as part of their graduate experience and future careers.  Student applicants will be ranked by the conference Scientific Committee by the following criteria: first authorship versus co-authorship of an oral or poster paper, capability and interest, geographical and institutional diversity, and membership in any underrepresented group in science and engineering. These selection criteria are very compatible with the NSF strategic plan.",
