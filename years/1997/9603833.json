 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the effects of exercise on bones,  focusing on the two most important processes by which bones  respond to loading:  (1) growth (modeling) in which a bone  increases its size, and (2) repair (Haversian remodeling) in  which bones replace old, damaged tissue.  Preliminary data  indicate that the relative percentage of growth versus  repair tends to vary within individuals inversely down the  limbs, with more growth occurring near the body's center and  more remodeling occurring distally.  It is proposed that  growth preferentially occurs where there is a low cost to  additional mass increase, but that repair is favored in  regions such as the ends of the limb where mass increases  impose an exponentially higher energetic cost and which,  therefore, tend to be thinner and weaker.  Modulation of  growth versus repair responses to loading suggest that  different regions of the skeleton are adapted to tolerate  different strains levels.       This proposal has significance for anthropological,  palaeontological and other osteologcial research on humans  and other vertebrates.  Of special interest is testing the  hypothesis that recent, industrial-era  humans tend to have  overall thinner bones than hunter-gatherers and early  farmers because of generally low levels of mechanical  loading, particularly during childhood.",
