Organizers are Dr.  Christopher Chase-Dunn, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,  Md.,  and Dr. Nelson Amaro, Universidad del Valle, Guatemala  City, Guatemala.  The seminar will bring together social  scientists and policy experts from the United States  and  Guatemala, to present research and analyses of the  trajectory of Guatemalan social change in  its comparative  regional and global context.  The main purpose is to further  policy-relevant social scientific research on the issues of  Guatemalan economic development and democratization in the  context of changing global constraints and opportunities.  Researchers will evaluate a range of proactive responses to  forces that should be considered by participants from all  sectors of Guatemalan society, as well as by those abroad  who are interested in facilitating Guatemalan democracy and  development.    Guatemala is the largest country in Central America, and the  last to negotiate an end to civil war.   The peace process  has created an important moment in Guatemalan history.  Formerly excluded groups are becoming participants in legal  and institutional processes for formulating policies of  development and democratization.   While the process still  has a long way to go before Guatemala can be considered a  full-fledged member of the family of democratic nations, the  direction of recent developments is clear.  The prospect of  a new multiethnic nation that recognizes the cultural,  political and economic rights of its poorest and least  powerful citizens is a real possibility for the first time  in decades.    The focus of the seminar will be on the most salient  problems and their potential solutions during the next two  decades.  The dissemination of the results will help social  scientists share perspectives and formulate research  strategies that are relevant for  policies that can  contribute to resolving the emergent problems in post-war  Guatemala.  ***",
