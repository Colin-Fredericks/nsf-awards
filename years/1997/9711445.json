 "awd_abstract_narration": "9711445  Bevis    This award supports research aimed at an integration of two  technologies which have proven useful for monitoring motion of the  Earth's crust. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is currently  capable of measuring baselines (the distance between two GPS  receiver location points on Earth) with a precision in the  millimeter range at distances of hundreds of kilometers.  Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (INSAR) cannot offer a  comparable level of precision, but has the advantage of being able  to measure relative motion of the crust over a continuous area (as  opposed to a limited number of discrete points on the surface).  Combining the two approaches will provide greatly enhanced  capabilities for understanding such phenomena as earthquake related  motion (pre-, syn-, and post-seismic), volcanic activity, plate  tectonic motions, groundwater movement, and other local and  regional crustal strain processes. The research is a collaboration  among geoscientists at the University of California, San Diego,   Stanford University and the University of Hawaii. The approach by  the collaborators will be: (1) to reduce the so-called orbital or  baseline error of INSAR by deploying radar reflectors or  transponders at selected GPS receiver sites and thereby pin down  the precise locations of those points to serve as anchors for the  INSAR interferometry, and (2) use meteorogical models and satellite  data to reduce the error in GPS locations due to the effect of  water vapor in the atmosphere.  ***",
