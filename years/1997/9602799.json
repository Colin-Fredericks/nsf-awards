 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Minnesota at Duluth, the second largest of the four campuses of the University of Minnesota system, will receive an award from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program to renovate, reconfigure, and modernize research and training space in the Chemistry Building.  Constructed in 1948, the building houses research programs that focus on analytical, inorganic, and organic chemistry, and biochemistry and molecular biology.  Current conditions, such as inadequate utilities, substandard fume hoods, and the lack of environmental controls adversely affect experiment work and in some instances prohibit the pursuit of research problems.  This project will modernize research space by installing fume hoods and computer network lines, and reconfiguring bench space to accommodate additional students and new research areas.  Renovations will improve the HVAC infrastructure to create an environment that supports research programs, and renovate research support areas to comply with state and federal regulations, thereby creating a safer and more efficient research environment.  A new synthetic chemistry laboratory will be created to enhance research training by supporting the growth in student enrollments and provide efficient space for state-of-the-art  instrumentation.  This project will sustain a growing program benefiting 58 faculty members and their students.",
