 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529609  Donnelly    Turbulence  is undoubtedly the most outstanding unsolved  problem  of   classical  physics.  From  a  practical  turbulence  is  the  'limiting  factor' in the design and operation of various  energy  systems in aeronautical, chemical and mechanical engineering.  It  is  a  central theme in geophysics, meteorology, and other  areas  which  strongly impact human life. For these reasons, an enhanced  ability  to  understand and predict turbulent flows will  have  a  large  payoff.  This  project focuses on  fundamental  turbulence  research using a non-traditional fluid: cryogenic helium near its  critical  point  of  5  K.  Helium is  theoretically  capable  of  providing the highest Reynolds and Rayleigh number conditions for  controlled  turbulence  experiments in  a  laboratory  on  earth.  However,   the  working  temperature  range  of  4-5  K  presents  challenges   to  existing  techniques  and  instrumentation   for  turbulence  measurements. In addition, to  reach  the  limits  of  ultra-high Reynolds and Rayleigh numbers requires major cryogenic  facilities which are currently found only at high energy  physics  projects requiring large volumes of cryogenic fluids for  cooling  superconducting magnets or other apparatus. This  project  brings  together for the first time a team to meet these challenges.  The  team   is  composed  of  faculty  at  the  University  of  Oregon  (Professor  Russell  J. Donnelly) and Yale University  (Professor  Katapali  R.  Sreenivasan), together with co-workers (Michael  S.  McAshan  and James R. Maddocks) who will conduct on-site research  at  the  Brookhaven  National Laboratory Relativistic  Heavy  Ion  Collider  (RHIC) Cryogenic Facility (Dr. Satoshi  Ozaki,  Project  Director).  The  members  of the team include  world  leaders  in  helium  turbulence, fluid hydrodynamics and cryogenic technology.  The  project goals are to develop instrumentation for  turbulence  measurements  using cryogenic helium, to use this instrumentation   for fundamental turbulence measurements, and to construct a major  convection chamber at RHIC. Successful completion of this project  will  place the U. S. in a world leadership position in cryogenic  helium  turbulence  research and lay the  foundation  for  future  research in ultra high Reynolds and Rayleigh number phenomena.  %%%  Turbulence  is undoubtedly the most outstanding unsolved  problem  of   classical  physics.
