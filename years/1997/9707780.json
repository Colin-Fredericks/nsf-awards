Brooks        The concept of the WISE was proposed in 1978 in response to concerns of the engineering community that few engineering students have the opportunity to learn about public policy, legislative and regulatory processes, and their relationship to technological change.    The WISE program is designed to accommodate 15 to 16 students each summer.  Since 1983 the number of students selected for any given summer has depended on the level of support provided by the sponsoring engineering societies.  Those provided by the sponsoring engineering societies include:  AICHE, ANS, ASAE, ASAE, ASEE, ASHRAE, ASME, ASTM, IEEE, NSPE, ORSA, SAE, and SME.    Engineering students entering their last full year of engineering make up the eligible students population.  Students are drawn from a national pool and the competition is extremely keen.  From these candidates, the sponsoring societies have selected 12 students to participate in this year's program.    During the 10 week program, WISE interns meet with government policy-makers, attend seminars and conventions, and visit agencies and corporations to learn how technological issues are legislated.  This year, the interns will visit the Office of Technology Assessment, the House Committee on Science,  Space and Technology, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Science Foundation and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission-to name only a few.",
