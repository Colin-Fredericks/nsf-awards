Research on planning within AI has led to  the development of computational techniques for generating a plan to achieve a specified goal from a  specified initial state, given definitions of the available actions.  Until recently, however, much  of this research has been governed by a number of simplifying assumptions, notably that  there is no indeterminacy either in the planning agent's knowledge, in the effects of its  actions, or in the notion of goal satisfaction, and that there are no changes either in the  goals presented to the agent or in its environment. This award supports research aimed at  relaxing the latter assumption.  Specifically, the research investigates the issues involved in  extending planning technology to a dynamic setting, in which the agent's goals and environment  are both subject to change.  A study is being made of both the theoretical and practical issues  presented by situations that call for integrated generation, maintenance, and execution of plans  for multiple, changing goals.  The project addresses these issues from two complementary points  of view.  The first is designing and implementing a dynamic planning system that is flexible  enough to allow for the experimental investigation of the consequences of adopting different  reasoning strategies in different dynamic planning environments.  Secondly, but in parallel, a  formal analysis is being carried out of the dynamic planning problem, with a special emphasis on  providing a clean semantic analysis of the implemented system.  The  aim of the project is more  flexible and realistic planning models and systems.",
