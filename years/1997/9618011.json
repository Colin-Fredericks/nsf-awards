 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is considerable debate regarding the major processes  that determine population sizes of organisms inhabiting  rocky and coral reefs. Most of these organisms have complex  life cycles that include widely dispersive propagules and  relatively sedentary juveniles and adults, such that the  `birth rate` at a particular reef is equivalent to the rate  of settlement of propagules. The controversy focuses on the  extent to which supply of propagules vs. post-settlement  processes determine local population size and dynamics. To  resolve this issue we must know whether, and how, the  demographic rates that determine population size at a  particular site (settlement, immigration, mortality, and  emigration) change with population density (i.e., are the  changes in these rates density-dependent).  Answering this  question is of more than academic interest because, first,  it provides the basis for understanding how local population  size is regulated naturally, which is essential for  effective management of fisheries and other natural  populations, and second, it has seldom been answered  adequately for any organism.      This collaborative research is designed to answer the  question of what drives local population dynamics in a  comprehensive manner for four species of marine fish  inhabiting two very different environments: temperate and  tropical reefs. This multi-species, multi-system approach  will provide some generality which can perhaps be applied to  other marine systems, including demersal and bottom  fisheries. Using well-proven methods, the combined  experimental and observational design of this study will  examine the roles of larval supply, settlement, recruitment,  immigration, emigration, competition, and especially  predation and its mechanisms, in driving local population  dynamics. Results of the field work will be incorporated  into mathematical models of population dynamics to provide  conceptual generality applicable to other similarly  organized systems.",
