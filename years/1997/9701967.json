 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701967  Akylas    Internal gravity waves are of considerable geophysical interest:    large-amplitude internal wave disturbances frequently occur in the ocean   thermocline both in deep water and in coastal regions, as well as in the   lower atmosphere.  This effort focuses on the dynamics of internal-wave   groups, particularly the coupling of the short-scale carrier   oscillations with the envelope of the group.  This is a fully nonlinear   mechanism that plays an important part in the generation of   gravity-capillary solitary waves on deep water and in the radiation of   oscillatory tails by nonlinear wave groups.  The main objective is to   understand this coupling mechanism in the context of stratified flows,   both from a physical and a mathematical point of view.    The results of this research effort are expected to be useful in   detecting and controlling the propagation of nonlinear wave disturbances   in various applications.  In the ocean environment, for instance,   knowledge of internal-wave activity is important in under-sea navigation   and in the design of deep-water offshore facilities.  In the atmosphere,   internal waves play an important part in the initiation and organization   of thunderstorm squall lines, the modulation of rainfall and the   dispersal of atmospheric pollutants.  Nonlinear pulses are also used in   high-speed transmission of data in optical fibers and in optical   switching devices; understanding the propagation characteristics of   nonlinear pulses is essential to the transmission of noise-free signals   over long distances.",
