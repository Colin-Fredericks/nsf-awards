Shankar  University of California, Berkeley    Challenges in CISE:  Virtual Environments for Telesurgery and Surgical Training: Efficient  Computation, Visualization and Interaction    This research is focused on virtual environments for telesurgery and will   result in software testbeds for eye and abdominal surgery.  The development   of these testbeds depends on the integration of the following research   activities:    Tissue modeling and rendering.  For effective surgical training in virtual environments, deformable models   of tissue are needed with sufficient accuracy, yet fast enough for real   time interaction. Beginning with continuum models of solid behavior,   suitable approximations will be developed that account for the compliance   of tissue and the deformation of organs in the presence of a surgical tool.   Methods for representing and rendering tissue shape, especially aspects   that affect lighting models that provide important visual cues, will be   compared.    Haptic interaction with simulated models.  There has been little work done or kinesthetic perception and display of   compliant surfaces.  Subjects' perception of compliance will be measured   under a variety of conditions to provide requirements for object modeling   algorithms, and for teleoperation and haptic display schemes with high   fidelity.    Real time data fusion and 3-D visualization.  Although surgeons have a variety of data sources available, they are not   integrated into a useful 3-D model.  A major difficulty in integrating real   time data during surgery is compensating for shape changes due to   deformability.  Vessels and ducts will be used to provide road-maps to locate   important features.    Training and interaction with simulation.  Modeling, rendering, and display factors that contribute to an environment   that will be effective for training, yet efficient enough to run in real   time will be determined.  Using a set of fundamental skills, the   contribution  of these factors to training transfer in students and   experienced surgeons will be experimentally studied.",
