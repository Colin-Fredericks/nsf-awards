Proposal Number: IBN-9723920    From our own sleep-wake cycle to the chirping of crickets on  summer evenings, examples of circadian (daily) rhythms in  behavior are abundant in nature. These rhythms are driven by  internal biological clocks in the nervous system that are  synchronized with the daily cycles of light and temperature  in the environment. In the past decade, researchers have  deciphered the basic mechanism by which biological clocks  keep time: the clock's central gears are genes that turn on  and off every day. While rhythmic behaviors and clock genes  have been identified in a variety of organisms, the cellular  mechanisms by which clock genes produce their behavioral  effects are relatively obscure. This project examines the  mechanisms by which clock genes act within cells and tissues  to produce circadian rhythms of behavior. Experiments allow  for direct studies of cells regulating rhythmic behavior and  how the properties of those cells are regulated by the clock  genes within them. These studies represent a significant  step towards understanding the physiological mechanisms by  which clock genes and the cells that express them can  interact to generate circadian rhythms in behavior.",
