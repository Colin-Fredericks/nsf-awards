This regular conference is a very important  forum in which participants from all 19 EPSCoR jurisdictions  (there are 18 EPSCoR states plus the Commonwealth of Puerto  Rico) can come together to exchange information and ideas  critical to research and development (R&D) in EPSCoR states.  The award will provide travel, subsistence, and conference  registration support for five participants from each EPSCoR  state and for a number of additional important invited  speakers and guests.  For the 1997 conference teams from  each state will be featured with prominent representatives  from their academic, industrial, and state governmental  communities.  These teams will present success stories along  with strategies for addressing changing R&D funding  scenarios.  Such sharing can provide very valuable insights  for participants because a success story in one realm for a  particular state may suggest a promising strategy for  another state to pursue.  Conference proceedings will be  produced for distribution to all participants.",
