 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616834  WASER  The proposed research will develop, test and apply new molecular genetic techniques to questions of basic and applied importance for animal populations.  The genetic techniques are based on a new form of DNA fingerprinting using \"microsatellites\", short, highly-variable components of DNA common to all animals that can identify parentage as well as the population from which an individual comes.  The study species, the banner-tailed kangaroo rat, is chosen to take advantage of an extensive long-term data base on birth, death and migration rates.  Field methodology is proven and the species is not currently endangered.  Thus kangaroo rats will be used as a model to answer general questions; the results are expected to be widely applicable to other mammals.  The goals of the project fall into two categories.  First, methodology will be tested to estimate the rates of movement of animals between isolated small populations.  Rates of movement between fragments of suitable habitat determine such basic population characteristics as within-population genetic variation and between-population differentiation.  Movement rates also have important applied consequences related to the conservation of wild populations, since dispersers can \"rescue\" declining populations and spread important genetic variation.  It has also been recognized recently that some apparently healthy wild populations are actually \"sinks\", maintained only by immigrants from other populations.  As yet, there is no economical way to measure interpopulation dispersal rates or to determine which populations are the \"sources\" that are most important to conserve.  Second, the rates and consequences of inbreeding in natural populations will be determined.  Inbreeding is widely believed to be deleterious in animals as it is in humans, but few data exist on the degree to which wild animals inbreed, on the mechanisms they might use to avoid it, or on how deleterious it actually is.  Genetic techniques will allow identification of pa rentage, thus detecting inbreeding when it occurs and comparing the survival rates of inbred and outbred animals.  The results will contribute both to basic understanding of the conditions under which inbreeding occurs in nature and to the ability to conserve small populations that are thought to be especially vulnerable to inbreeding problems.",
