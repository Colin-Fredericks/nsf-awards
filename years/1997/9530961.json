 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530961  Measures         Antarctic waters are generally characterised by low standing  stocks of phytoplankton and low rates of primary production despite  the abundance of inorganic nutrients in the water column. Many  researchers have speculated on the deficiency of iron in these  waters to explain this paradox but no conclusive evidence of the  importance of iron or its mechanisms in stimulating productivity  have been presented. The major goals of the JGOFS Southern Ocean  Process Study are, in part, to unravel the factors and processes  that regulate the magnitude and variability of primary productivity  and use this knowledge to determine the response of the Southern  Ocean to naturally occurring climate changes both in the past and  in the future. In this study, the principal investigation will  measure iron and other reactive trace metals in the water column of  various productivity regimes of the Polar frontal region of the  Southern Ocean. These measurements will be used to further our  understanding of the supply and distribution of iron in Antarctic  waters and, in concert with the measurements of other P.I.'s its  importance in affecting the structure of the microbial food web and  the dynamics of the various biogeochemical cycles in the water  column.  As the complex role that iron plays in the magnitude and  sequence of biological processes becomes better understood, these  measurements will grow in importance in modelling the interaction  of iron and its biological effects and indirectly, its impact in  global biogeochemical cycles.",
