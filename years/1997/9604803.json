 "awd_abstract_narration": "The requested funds will be used to upgrade a Bio-Rad MRC-600  confocal microscope. The items to be purchased are: a Krypton/Argon  laser with fiber optic mount, improved photomultiplier tubes, a 60X  1.2 NA water immersion lens, and a computer for image processing.  The new laser will dramatically improve the color separation in  double label immunofluorescence experiments and allow triple label  experiments to be performed. The fiber optic mount will decrease  vibrations in the scan head and improve resolution at high  magnification. The new photomultiplier tubes will allow the imaging  of fainter objects and the water immersion lens will improve the  quality of images from thick specimens. By having a second computer  for off line processing, one researcher can be collecting data  while a second is processing data.       The equipment will be used in both cell biological and  developmental experiments. The cell biological experiments center  on the trafficking of molecules through the cell. Studies will be  performed to understand how the Drosophila Wingless secreted  protein is taken up by cells and the potential role of transcytosis  in the formation of a gradient of Wingless protein. These  experiments should lead to a better understanding of how pattern is  generated in developing organisms. In other work the role of the  Rab 7 protein in the endocytic pathway will be examined. The goal  of this work is to understand how molecules are targeted to various  organelles. The third main area of cell biological study is the use  of cationic lipids for delivering molecules into cells. This  technology will be used to study a variety of cellular processes.  All these studies require co-localization experiments in which it  is critical to maximize color separation. In addition, the ability  to follow the subcellular distribution of molecules requires the  best possible resolution and highest sensitivity.       The Developmental studies are focused on Drosophila. In  addition to the Wingle ss experiments described above, research is  being conducted on the transcriptional regulation of leg patterning  and the role of cell lineage in the patterning of the central  nervous system. Both of these studies require an ability to carry  out triple label experiments in which three molecules can be  followed simultaneously. The goal of the leg patterning experiments  is to understand how a gradient of positional information is  interpreted and leads to the specification of individual cell  fates. The neuronal lineage experiments will examine the relative  contribution of lineage and positional information to the final  phenotype of individual neurons. The Krypton/Argon laser is  essential for the triple label experiments and the water immersion  lens will allow neurons and their axonal projections to be followed  throughout the embryo.",
