This field has made a large number of fundamental  contributions to the understanding of geometric  structures and geometric computation.  This  combination of theory and practical significance  has been key to the vitality of this field.  This  continued vitality depends on a healthy balance  between these two influences.  This project is  concerned with the design and analysis of  fundamental algorithmic tools for geometric  problems with applications in computer vision,  pattern recognition, computer graphics,  computational statistics, and computer-aided  manufacturing.  Emphasis will be placed on  practical, implementable solutions to these  problems, and both theoretical and empirical  analyses of their performance.",
