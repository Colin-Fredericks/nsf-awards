 "awd_abstract_narration": "US scientists are increasingly aware of public distrust about research participation following some abuses, most notably the Tuskegee study which failed to appropriately inform and provide treatment for African American men with syphilis. This project will assess the strength and impact of the `Tuskegee effect` on the attitudes of African American and European American parents and youth regarding social science research and associated ethical issues. A major goal of this project is to enhance community trust in the scientific enterprise by gathering information that can improve approaches to informed consent for research conducted with adolescents at-risk for health compromising behaviors, juvenile delinquency, and academic failure. A two-pronged methodology will draw upon community perspectives and incorporate both qualitative and quantitative techniques that can document common and unique dimensions of ethical attitudes in different ethnic groups. Ultimately it will empower individuals in ways that improve ethical procedures. Qualitative data will be collected through focus groups on parents' and adolescents' opinions on (a) trust and suspicion of social science research; (b) the perceived value and potential cost of adolescent risk research to individuals and communities, and (b) attitudes toward different ethical arguments on requiring and waiving guardian consent.  Building on the qualitative data, the PI will create culturally valid questionnaires to quantify significant aspects of parent and adolescent responses to ethical issues in informed consent procedures for adolescent risk research. Focus groups for community input at the outset and throughout the project will insure that the issues raised in the qualitative portion of the project reflect community concerns, that the terminology and format of the quantitative instruments are appropriate for the participants, and that conclusions drawn from the study are culturally valid. Project results will be disseminated through scholarly publications, meetings with IRB members, and newsletters reaching both scientists and African and European American community members. At the end of the second year a Community Forum held at Fordham University will engage the original participants, their community leaders, and scholars from diverse ethnic backgrounds in open dialogue about how to improve ethics-in-science practices and how to increase ethnic minority interest in social science research and sensitivity to both its promise and risks. The community forum will provide an opportunity for African American and European American clergy, teachers, parents and youth to work in partnership with developmental scientists to create socially meaningful and ethically responsible guidelines for social science research. It will provide the basis of a Guidebook for Informed Consent Procedures for Ethnic Minority Adolescent Risk Research to be distributed to developmental scientists, IRB members, ethnic minority scholars, and community members.",
