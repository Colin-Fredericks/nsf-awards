The phase transition of excitons to spontaneous  coherence, which is exactly analogous to Bose condensation of  atoms, will be studied in two and three dimensions, namely, in  semiconductor quantum wells and in bulk semiconductors.  The  proposed teaching program involves creating a photonics  curriculum which prepares students for the growing job market in  optics and bioengineering, including tpaining in techniques such  as time-resolved spectroscopy and acousto-optic modulation, as  well as introductory courses which make modern physics more  accessible to students of all kinds.  %%%  The proposed CAREER program combines research and teaching on  contemporary topics of modern optics, or \"photonics.\" The  proposed research centers on novel physical effects of  \"excitons,\" which are essentially photons in an optical medium  which act as though they have mass.  Under proper experimental  conditions, these \"heavy and slow photons\" can self-organize into  a coherent wave with a wavelength hundreds of times less than  ordinary light.  The proposed program of teaching involves  working with other members of the University of Pittsburgh to  create a photonics curriculum which prepares students for the  growing job market in optics and bioengineering, as well as  introductory courses which make modern physics more accessible to  students of all kinds.  ***",
