 "awd_abstract_narration": "9716144  Randall  This is an award to support research the objective of which is to  provide a more rational basis than now exists for design of  biologically based wastewater treatment processes that have the  capability for reducing the phosphorus content of their  effluents.  The research involves determination of conditions  that necessitate the need for a prefermentation phase to produce  nonvolatile fatty acids in comparison with conditions where the  anaerobic/reaction phase of the treatment process precludes need  for a prefermentation phase.    Results of this research are expected to be used in determination  of conditions under which prefermentation is a necessary step in  enhanced removal of phosphorus from wastewater by use of  biological processes.  This knowledge is expected to be used in  improving the engineering design of biologically-based,  phosphorus removal processes and systems.  Biologically-based  processes have the advantage over physical-chemical processes in  reducing the amounts of process residuals, improved dewatering  characteristics of the residuals and capability of being  integrated with biologically-based denitrification processes.  ***",
