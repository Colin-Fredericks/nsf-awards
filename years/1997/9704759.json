 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704759  Wiggins    This research project is concerned with developing analytical and   computational tools for studying the global dynamics of semiclassical   models of molecules. The emphasis will be on molecular models with three   or more degrees-of-freedom and the analytical approach is that of the   geometric theory of nonlinear dynamical systems. In particular, we will   investigate how geometrical structures in phase space are manifested in   experimental spectra, the local to normal mode transition in molecules with   three or more degrees-of-freedom, energy transport and the role of invariant   manifolds in determining this, and the dynamics of rotational-vibrational   interaction in molecules with three or more degrees-of-freedom. In addition,   we will investigate mechanism for global instabilities in  Hamiltonian   systems with three or more degrees of freedom; in particular, the Arnold   mechanism.    The research is concerned with the development of techniques to study   classical and semiclassical dynamics of molecules with three or more   degrees-of-freedom, as well as a fundamental study of mechanisms for   instability in Hamiltonian systems with three or more degrees-of-freedom.   Over the past 10 years experimental techniques have been  developed in   chemistry to the point where real time dynamical data related to molecular  interactions and dynamics can be obtained, which has resulted in the area of   research known as  \"femtochemistry\". In some ways the experimental   situation in chemistry today bears a strong resemblance to the experimental   situation in fluid mechanics in the late 1970`s. At that time new laser based   experimental techniques were developed that resulted in global, real time   dynamical data from fluid flows. Such data played a key role in the   dynamical systems analyses of fluid flows. In fact, one could make the case   that these experimental advances were the reason that fluid mechanics   became (probably) the main application area for dynamical sy stems theory   throughout the 1980`s. Today we are in an analogous situation for   theoretical chemistry vis- -vis the relation of  experimental advances in   fluid mechanics and dynamical systems theory in the late 1970`s.   Consequently, a focused, interdisciplinary research effort in dynamical   systems and theoretical chemistry could play an important role in the   interpretation of this new experimental data, as well as the further   development of the field of theoretical chemistry.  This award will be   supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Division of   Chemistry, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate   for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.",
