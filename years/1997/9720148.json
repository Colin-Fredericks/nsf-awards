Dr. Ustad has several years of experience and has  been very effective in assisting SBIR researchers and  entrepreneurs in South Dakota with preparation of successful  Phase I SBIR proposals.  He also has a an impressive track  record in the conversion of Phase I to Phsae II SBIR awards.     This award will provide funds for establishing a  Phase O   program of small awards to industry/university partnerships;  these awards will support research to strengthen anticipated  Phase I SBIR proposals.  A series of seminars will be  presented throughout South Dakota to increase awareness of  SBIR programs and the center will provide direct assistance  with Phase I and Phase II SBIR proposal preparation and  submission.  Graduate students from the School of Business  will be involved in helping to solve problems relating to  the commercialization process.  To increase the prospects of  business successes an SBIR support network will be developed  that includes accountants, lawyers, and venture capital  firms.  Overall this award is anticipated to develop a  stronger entrepreneurial environment and awareness of SBIR  opportunities in South Dakota.  Such strengthened awareness  and capabilities will be important in the state s transition  from an economy based on extractive industries depending on  natural resources to one including high technology  industries which utilize the intellectual resources of  university researchers and SBIR entrepreneurs to foster  economic growth and development in South Dakota.",
