 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gordon  9603639         Like a brain or an embryo, a social insect colony  functions without central or hierarchical control. Simple  decisions by individual units, the workers, lead to the  complex behavior of the colony, though no individual directs  the behavior of others. Colonies perform a variety of tasks  outside the nest, including foraging, nest maintenance work,  and patrolling. As conditions change, the numbers of ants  required for each task also change. Task allocation is the  process that results in the right numbers of ants performing  the right tasks for the current situation. How do colonies  accomplish this without central control? Individuals make  decisions based on local information. These decisions  determine whether an individual will switch tasks, an  whether it will pursue a task actively or instead remain  inactive inside the nest. The proposed work will investigate  what cues ants use in making task decisions.       The proposed research explores the possibility that the  rate or number of interactions among nestmates is one of the  cues involved in tasks allocation decisions. The work will  use laboratory colonies of marked individuals, in which all  behavior inside the nest is visible, and computer  simulations based on a mathematical model of task  allocation. Because the rate of encounter among ants depends  on how they move around, an image analysis system will be  employed to track the paths of ants as they move around the  laboratory nest and arena. How ants respond to the rate of  brief interactions with other ants, will be examined in  undisturbed colonies and in experiments that manipulate  worker density, and thus encounter rate. Chemical analysis  of the hydrocarbons on the surface of an ant s body will  test whether ants engaged in a particular task might carry  an odour specific to that task, which other ants could use  to distinguish the task of the ants they meet.       This research should provide new insight into the ways  that fairly simple individ ual behavior can generate the  complex behavior of social systems.",
