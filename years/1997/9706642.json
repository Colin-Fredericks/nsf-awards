It is jointly organized by the Industrial Electronics Society and the Robotics and Automation Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the Dynamic Systems and Control Division of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  The conference is aimed to provide a forum for researchers to meet and discuss the latest developments in mechatronics, a synergistic integration of mechanical engineering with electronics and intelligent computer control in the design and manufacture of products and processes.  The theme of this first conference is Imformatics and Communication in Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics.       This conference is the first of its kind and is important to the future advances in the knowledge creation in mechatronics with many practical applications.    ***",
