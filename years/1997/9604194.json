 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lustig  9604194  In this project, a series of molecular biological, genetic and biochemical approaches will be used to develop a clearer understanding of the mechanism of telomeric silencing in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The current view is that the telomere binding protein Rap1 p recruits Sir3p to the telomere, after which silencing is nucleated, spreading unidirectionally from the telomere. Three interrelated approaches will be taken. First, a Sir3p tethered silencing assay will be used to address several fundamental questions concerning the mechanism of Sir3p in silencing. Two questions will initially be addressed: What is the role of Sir3p in the formation and inheritability of the silent state?; and Is the function of Sir3p regulated by the cell cycle? Two models that may explain the function of Sir3p will also be tested: a) the possibility that Sir3p nucleates silencing by acting as a bridge between telomeric and subtelomeric sequences and b) the hypothesis that Sir3p nucleates silencing by recruiting histone deacetylases. Second, the role of the Sir3p N-terminus in telomeric silencing will be investigated. This region has been implicated by our previous genetic assays as being critical for telomeric silencing. The tethering assay will first be used to dissect the N-terminus of Sir3p using both deletion analysis and the generation of N-terminal mutations. In addition, N-terminal fusions will be characterized functionally in terms of a) their role in formation and inheritability of the silent state, b) the link between nucleation of silencing and the distance silent chromatin is propagated, c) their role in subtelomeric/telomeric interactions and d) the dependence of N-terminal Sir3p tethered silencing on other gene products involved in telomeric silencing. Third, in vivo and in vitro techniques will be used to define the proteins that interact with N-terminal Sir3p domains. The in vivo techniques will rely on both immunological techniques for known proteins and two-hybrid analysis  for novel proteins. The in vitro techniques will be designed to test for direct interactions between protein candidates suggested by the in vivo studies.  Telomeres, the protein-DNA structures present at the termini of eukaryotic chromosomes, confer transcriptionally silent states onto adjacent subtelomeric sequences; a likely reflection of the role of the telomere in establishing the spatial arrangement of chromosomal domains. The goal of these studies is to understand the long-range position effects conferred by the telomere using the genetically-manipulatable yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model eukaryote. Findings in this yeast are likely to serve as a paradigm for the behavior of the telomeres of higher eukaryotes and are likely to be highly informative in elucidating the protein/protein and protein /DNA interactions taking place at the telomere.",
