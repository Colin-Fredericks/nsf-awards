 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from the University of Michigan.  The project is to conduct a case study of how families in Culver City, CA, a diverse community in Los Angeles, understand and act in their roles as family members.  The basic questions are to understand how the nuclear family has changed in light of the decline of the prevalence of the standard `married-couple-with-children` family to only 26% of all households in 1993.  Using multiple methods of surveys, formal interviewing and participant observation, the student will test the hypothesis that increasing numbers of non-traditional, non-nuclear family arrangements will be overtly seen as `normal` by a diverse set of respondents in light of the socio-economic changes of post-industrialism that the community is adapting to.    This research is important because it will advance our understanding of the ability of people to reinterpret their lived experience in a positive manner, by redefining the meaning of key concepts like `family`.  Understanding the lived process by which these core cultural features are changing will allow policy makers and social actors to develop programs and policies to facilitate and develop a more cohesive civil society.",
