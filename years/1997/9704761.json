His recent work has been concerned with achieving a better   understanding of the global structure of homotopy theory.   This work combines two hitherto disjoint approaches, the \"chromatic  approach,\" and the \"calculus of functors\" approach.  In joint work with  M. Mahowald, the investigator examined the Goodwillie derivatives of  unstable homotopy theory and used them to prove a new result about  unstable homotopy of spheres.  In other work, the investigator   studied the Taylor polynomials (as opposed to derivatives)   of unstable homotopy theory and provided an explicit space-level  description of these.  One of the key ingredients of the investigator's   contribution to his joint work with Mahowald was a combinatorial   analysis of the poset of partitions of a finite set, which turned   out to have consequences for the chromatic filtration of spheres.  Further   investigation of the combinatorics involved has led the investigator  to discover seemingly new and mysterious recurrence patterns.  He   believes that some of the deep periodic phenomena in homotopy   theory can be studied via this combinatorial periodicity.   In very recent work, the investigator utilized this combinatorial   periodicity to construct certain \"self maps\" on the derivatives   of unstable homotopy theory, which imply, among other things, the   existence of finite complexes whose cohomology realizes certain   finite subalgebras of the Steenrod algebra.  The investigator believes that   these finite complexes will be useful for localization and   periodicity.       In the investigator's area of Algebraic Topology, he is interested in  how to analyze the space of continuous functions between two topological  spaces.  It turns out that an analogue of the theory of Taylor series can  be developed, and one can study the space of continuous maps via its  \"polynomial approximations\" (an idea due to T. Goodwillie).  The  investigato r combined this theory with more classical methods in topology,  and he used it (in joint work with M. Mahowald) to prove a new result on  the global structure of an important algebraic tool of the trade, the  so-called unstable homotopy of spheres.  He now intends to use the  aformentioned polynomial approximations to construct certain spaces with  interesting (cohomological) properties, spaces whose mere existence should  lead to further insights in topology.  His work has a strong combinatorial  flavor (specifically, one of the main gadgets in his work is the lattice  of partitions of a finite set), and he hopes that some of his results will  be of interest to combinatorialists.   ***",
