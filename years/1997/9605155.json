Undergraduate students will be chosen from applicants recruited from throughout the country.  They will be selected on the basis of their academic credentials and their potential to benefit from an intensive research experience.  Each student will be directed in an independent research project by a faculty mentor who is an investigator at the MBL.  Students will also attend selected lectures and seminars, group discussions directed by faculty mentors, and the program's own seminar series in which selected MBL researchers discuss the value of different marine models in specific areas of biological investigation.  Students will have the opportunity to interact with leading scientists from throughout the world, to be introduced to the latest research technologies, and to experience first-hand the intensity, enthusiasm, and excitement for which the MBL summer experience is well known.",
