 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers   (PECASE) award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research   and educational efforts of Dr. Erick M. Carreira of the Department of   Chemistry at the California Institute of Technology.   Dr. Carreira is   one of sixty young, independent researchers to receive the first annual   PECASE award.  There are twenty PECASE awardees from the Foundation this   year.  This highly prestigious award is being given in recognition of   excellence and promise for future success in scientific and engineering   research, and the potential for eventual leadership of the awardees in   their respective fields.  In his generation, Professor Carreira is a   leader in the area of organic synthesis as his total synthesis of   zaragozic acid and his development of new catalysts for enantioselective   aldol condensation reactions have shown.  His two teaching awards and his   active outreach efforts point to excellence in his educational activities",
