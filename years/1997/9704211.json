 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, focuses on the study of multiple electron  transfer systems with emphasis on two electron transfer processes.   Professor Evans and his students at the University of Delaware will  use low temperature fast scan cyclic voltammetry at  microelectrodes, electrochemical impedance measurements, and  electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements to study  multiple electron transfer reactions of substituted anthracenes,  durenes, and bicyclooctane compounds.  Of particular interest in  this work will be multiple electron transfer reactions that are  coupled with atom transfer reactions.  Through a deeper  understanding of these reactions better electroorganic synthetic  schemes that can produce fine chemicals in environmentally superior  ways will be developed.  The preparation of organic chemicals by electrochemical means is an  under- developed area of synthesis due to the need to combine  expertise in both electrochemistry and organic synthesis.  This  work aims to develop electroorganic synthetic procedures that will  have technological impact and also be attractive for their  economics and environmental advantages.  Multiple electron transfer  processes that are coupled with atom transfer processes will be of  central interest in this work due to their common occurrence in  several areas of practical synthesis.",
