 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725068  Christensen  This is an award to support research on methods for relating  organic pollutants in the aquatic environment to their sources  considering the effects of fractionation between sources and  their receptors.  Emphasis in this project will be on polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons principally derived from incomplete  combustion of fossil fuels and on polychlorinated biphenyls that  are derived from many industrial applications in sediments from  lakes and streams.  Sources of sediment cores for polychlorinated  biphenyls will be the lower Fox River of Wisconsin and for  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the Black River of Ohio.  Reference cores will be obtained from Lake Michigan and Lake  Erie.  The investigator's objectives are to fully develop a  source-receptor chemical mass balance model for the target  aquatic contaminants, apply an iterative factor analysis model to  analytical profiles of these contaminants and develop an optimal  factor analytical model incorporating uncertainties for  apportionment of the contaminants to their sources.    Results of this project are expected to provide knowledge that is  needed for effective abatement of pollution.  Understanding the  transport characteristics and fate of environmental contaminants  are important steps in changing the way pollutants of air, land  and water are controlled.  Emergence of nonpoint sources of  pollutants from urban and agricultural land and atmospheric  deposition has made knowledge to be gained from this project  potentially useful in addressing engineering approaches to  abatement of pollution by identification of sources as a step  toward coping with emissions by either prevention of their  production or treatment at the source.  ***",
