 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research portion of this project advances the study of simultaneous  multithreading, a processor architecture technique aimed at increasing the  utilization of the execution resources in processors that issue multiple  instructions in each clock cycle.  The research objectives are threefold:  (1)  to re-evaluate memory system architecture in light of a simultaneous  multithreaded workload;  (2) to investigate processor issues such as  synchronization methods and strategies to deal with large register files;  (3)  to address the implications of simultaneous multithreading on the software  system.  The work entails revamping of an existing simulator for multithreaded  processors, and use of the new simulator in evaluating alternatives.    The educational portion concentrates on a revamping of the department curriculum  in computer architecture.  New graduate courses on computer architecture are  being introduced, and simultaneous multithreading is being integrated into the  core architecture courses for undergraduates.  All course work is being enhanced  with hands-on experimentation with instruction-level simulation.",
