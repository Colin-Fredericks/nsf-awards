 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of   Texas at Austin supports the research of Professor Jason B. Shear.  The   theme of the research is ultraviolet fluorescence detection of biological   chromophores.  The work investigates the mechanisms and extent of   multiphoton-excited degradation of monoamine neurotransmitters excited   using different numbers of photons of different characteristic   wavelengths.  Comparisons are made of the photodestruction quantum yields   for three-photon excitation of neurotransmitters using a modelocked   titanium:sapphire laser in the near-infrared wavelength range, and for   two-photon excitation using a frequency doubled titanium:sapphire laser.    Sources of background in both two- and three-photon excited fluorescence   measurements are evaluated and used in combination with the   photodestruction measurements to optimize ultraviolet fluorescence   detection of natively fluorescent neurotransmitters analyzed with   capillary electrophoresis.  The research will advance efforts toward quantitative measurement of   neuronal chemistry at the subcellular level.  Improved detectability of a   variety of natively fluorescent neurotransmitters will provide new   capabilities for characterizing fundamental mechanisms of chemical   signalling between cells.",
