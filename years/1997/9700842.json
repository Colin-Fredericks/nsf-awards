The conference is organized by a national committee, with advice from an International Scientific Advisory Committee.   This is the first conference of this type to be held in Madras, although a similar Chemical Engineering conference was held in Bangalore about ten years ago.    The conference possesses several unique features: (a) an opportunity to discuss and learn about the most recent scientific and technological advances in a broad range of areas of chemical engineering, particularly areas of current importance in Asia and Europe; (b) there will be an industrial session, with several keynote speakers and other presentations on R&D and  New Technologies; ( c ) coverage of applied, as well as fundamental, aspects; (d ) discussions of recent and future trends in chemical engineering education with leading educators from India, Japan and Europe.",
