 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9706755  Harrell    This is the block travel grant for the 1997 Congress of the International Association of Mathematical Physics and for development of new scientific collaboration in the Asian-Pacific Region    The XII-th International Conference on Mathematical Physics is to be held in Brisbane, Australia in July, 1997. This is organized by the International Association of Mathematical Physics. The project supports participation of 25 U.S. scientists and mathematicians.  It is also a vehicle to initiate new scientific contacts in the Asian-Pacific Region.    The competition for these funds is national. The criteria for selection is scientific excellence and an indication that the applicant's future research and professional growth will benefit from participation in the conference and further contacts in the Asian-Pacific region. Preference is given to recent Ph.D.'s and outstanding graduate students. The organizers are organizing contacts with established researchers who are  willing to act as hosts and organize new contacts.    This international encounter covers the full spectrum of recent developments of mathematical physics, from the dynamics of classical systems to relativity and quantum field theory. It includes new mathematical techniques as well as the analysis of increasingly complex physical systems.",
