 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632580  Hobbs       Cyclones in middle latitudes affect large regions of the world.   Consequently, improvements in understanding and forecasting of weather  associated with middle-latitude cyclones has been one of the major goals of 20th  century meteorology.  Although very significant advances have been made in  the basic understanding and ability to forecast extratropical cyclones on the  large (synoptic) scale, progress in forecasting local precipitation and severe  weather associated with these systems has been much slower. This is attributed  to insufficient understanding of processes and phenomena on the convective  scale (~0.1-10 km) and mesoscale (~10-1000 km).       For the past twenty years or so, the cloud physics research group at the  University of Washington has studied extratropical cyclones, with emphasis on  the microphysics and mesoscale aspects of precipitation.  These studies led to a  classification and study of rainbands on the west coast of the United States, and  studies of cyclones on the US east coast and in the central US.  The latter two  studies led to a proposal for a new conceptual model for cyclones that are  generated in the lee of the Rocky Mountains, as well as to the identification of  two large-scale rainbands that can produce severe weather in the central United  States.  The present research is an extension of these studies.       Three main areas of research will be pursued.  The first is to carry out  further evaluations of the new conceptual model for cyclones in the central  United States in order to improve its observational and theoretical foundation,  and to increase its utility as a weather forecasting aid.  The second task is to  investigate the mechanisms responsible for the formation of narrow cold frontal  rainbands, which are a ubiquitous feature of extratropical cyclones and can  produce severe local weather.  The formation of wide cold-frontal rainbands,  another common feature of cyclones, will also be investigated. These studies will  be  carried out through detailed analyses of special data sets collected in three  already completed field projects, and through numerical modeling studies of  these cases using an advanced mesoscale model.  ***",
