 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724290  Lau    The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts/Amherst will purchase a commercial organometallic chemical vapor deposition (OMCVD) system which will be dedicated to support research in compound semiconductor materials and devices.  The OMCVD system will be used for many research projects, including in particular:    (1) Resonant tunneling injection lasers,    (2) Selective-Area Growth of Compound Semiconductors by OMCVD,    (3) Application of the Two-Dimensional Electron Gas Medium to THz Detectors and Heterodyne Receivers,    (4) Optically-Pumped THz Sources/lasers,    (5) Quantum Well Solar Cells,    (6) Alternate sources for OMVPE of Ill-V semiconductors.    Acquisition of the OMCVD system will allow the PI to continue his pursuit of  advanced device concepts such as resonant tunneling injection lasers, 2-DEG detector and mixer arrays, THz sources, etc.  In addition, it will also allow us to work more closely with industrial companies who are interested in further development of more mature devices such as PHEMTs (pseudomorphic high-electron mobility transistors) and HBTs (Heterojuction Bipolar Transistors).  In the development of new device structures, testing of material concepts, and compatibility of different technologies, device wafers (full 3\" or 4\") with various structural designs grown in this system can be placed in the process lines by the companies for comparison.  This system will also greatly increase his capacity of training students in semiconductors in general and with familiarity of OMCVD specifically.    In summary, this piece of equipment is essential to some of our major projects and will provide new opportunities for us to collaborate with industrial researchers, as well as training students who are in high demand by the semiconductor, microwave, and photonic industries nafionwide.  ***",
