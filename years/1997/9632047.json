 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  long term goal of the project is to fully understand the the   mechanism of the ethylene-forming enzyme.  The focus of this research is   to use bioorganic methods to study the identity of critical active-site   residues; to provide an unambiguous demonstration of a suspected radical   mechanism; to finalize the enzymatic reaction stoichiometry; and to   create a reasonable model for the mechanism of oxygen activation.  Since   enzymes of this class do not follow classic  Pauling  theories of   enzymatic catalysis,  the need to develop new theories of enzymatic   catalysis for multi-transition state conversions provides further   significance to the work. With this award the Organic Dynamics Program is   supporting the research of Dr. Michael C. Pirrung  of the Department of   Chemistry at Duke University.  Professor Pirrung will focus his work on   understanding the mechanism of the ethylene-forming enzyme as an   available and significant member of the class of non-heme iron oxidizing   enzymes.  Among other reasons, the work is deemed important since the   process of natural ethylene production is a key step in the ripening of   fruit.",
