The first objective is to develop a local a posteriori  error estimator or indicator, so that spatial errors can be localized.  We  propose to estimate the error by exploiting the equivalence between mixed and  non-conforming methods for rectangular elements.  The second objective is to  develop up-scaling or homogenization techniques for highly variable  coefficients and point-like sources, i.e., for resolving fine length scales in  the model system that are below the size of a practical computational mesh.  The error associated with using these up-scaling techniques must be  quantifiable.  We propose to base our techniques on the discrete equations, and  use the coarse scale Raviart-Thomas projection operator which preserves the  flux across any element face.  The third objective is to demonstrate the  applicability of the techniques in a practical setting; we consider the  simulation of subsurface flow.  The first two objectives are complementary.  Error estimation would allow us to refine the mesh where the solution is ill  behaved, as near sharp fronts, local heterogeneity, or sources (i.e., wells),  so that computational effort can be concentrated to resolve the major length  scales in both the data and the solution.  Up-scaling would allow us to further  resolve some scales below the mesh size.      Our understanding of fluid flow underground is important to a range of  activities, including the clean-up of ground-water contamination and oil and  gas production.  Ground-water supplies are increasingly threatened by  contaminants introduced into the environment by improper disposal or accidental  release.  U.S. petroleum production has declined markedly in recent years.  These problems can be ameliorated by  complex engineering processes that require  careful design and monitoring, which in turn depend on our ability to simulate  on a computer the movement of fluids underground.  Our computer simulations  must be sufficiently detailed that we can further predict physical, chemical,  and biological processes and the consequences of human intervention.  Such  simulation requires that we approximate accurately the differential equations  governing the movement and interaction of the fluids.  It is difficult to do  this for a number of reasons, but the most basic is a lack of resolution: we  can only use data and compute fluid velocities at a small number of grid points  in space.  To date there has been no effective way to estimate the error in the  approximation to the fluid velocity.  If we knew that our errors were large, we  could take corrective action by increasing the grid resolution, up to the  limits of the computer resources available.  Beyond that limit, it is necessary  to approximate certain very small-scale quantities below the grid scale (such  as local variations in rock properties) by replacing them by some appropriately  defined average quantities.  We address these concerns in this proposal, and  demonstrate the applicability of our techniques in practical settings to gain  their acceptance by engineers.",
