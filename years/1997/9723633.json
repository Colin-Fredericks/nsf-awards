The enzymes share 19% sequence identity and have secondary structures that resemble one another.  The enzymes differ in their use of metal ions and  regulation by feedback inhibition. Thus the ultimate goal of these studies is to determine the similarities and possible homologies between these enzymes.  These enzymes catalyze the condensation of  phosphoenol pyruvate with a sugar molecule containing four (erythrose-4-phosphate) and five (arabinose-5-phosphate) carbons, respectively.  In both cases, an unusual cleavage occurs, in that the carbon-oxygen bond of phosphoenol pyruvate is cleaved and not the oxygen-phosphorus bond.  Both enzymes are at important points of a biosynthetic pathway, one leading to aromatic end products, the other leading to the lipopolysaccharide of the outer membrane in Gram negative bacteria.  The overall goal of this structural investigation by X-ray crystallography is to understand the similarities and differences in substrate binding and mechanisms of action of these two enzymes, and whether these two enzymes are homologues or have arisen by convergent evolution.  ***",
