 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jayne  9615047     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses both performance and cost issues associated with developing commercially viable Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs). Specifically, a high utilization, low catalyst loading membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) for a direct methanol proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell will be developed. During Phase I, PSI Technology's (PSIT's) patented electrochemical catalyzation (ECC) technique was successfully adapted to electrodeposit Pt-Ru alloys with specific composition and morphology. Methanol oxidation performance for the resultant ECC anode with a catalyst loading of 2.0 mg/cm2 was shown to be equivalent to the unsupported Pt-Ru alloy at a loading of 5.0 mg/cm2, which exceeded the goals of the Phase I program. The Phase II research will encompass both the anode and the cathode of a DMFC. The cathode work consists of both electrode structure and ECC optimization. The anode research continues the Phase I work by attempting additional alterations of the electrode structure and/or increasing the catalyst loading, both of which could lead to still higher performance. In addition, the technique developed during Phase I for alloy electrodeposition will be applied to ternary alloys such as Pt-Ru-WO3, for which recent literature suggests even higher methanol oxidation activity. Lastly, the Phase II research targets another high cost component of DMFCs by investigating procedures to prepare the MEA without using the costly carbon fiber paper backing that is currently employed. By widening the scope of the research to include optimization of the cathode and anode, investigation of ternary alloy electrodeposition, and alternative, less expensive support structures, hindrances to commercializing the direct methanol PEM fuel cell are more fully addressed.   Successful commercialization of this technology will substantially improve the cost effectiveness of DMFCs for vehicular applications as well as for stationary power generation.",
