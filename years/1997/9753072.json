 "awd_abstract_narration": "9753072  Axe  Hydrous Fe and Mn oxides are ubiquitous in natural aquatic  systems.  Because of their high surface areas, affinity for  trace metals, and tendency to form coatings on other mineral  surfaces, they can control the transport and fate of metals  in aqueous systems.  Unfortunately, predicting contaminant  transport has been unsuccessful.  In this research  enhancement proposal, advanced methods in x-ray absorption  spectroscopy (XAS) will be learned and applied under the  direction of Professor Grant Bunker, Illinois Institute of  Technology.  Access to the Advance Photon Source at Argonne  National Laboratory will be provided through the Biological  Collaborative Access Team (BiocAT) sector 18 undulator  beamline of which Professor Bunker is director and the  Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MR-CAT)  undulator beamline (sector 10) through IIT's membership in  MR-CAT.  XAS studies will be conducted to develop  mechanistic, microscopic models of a metal interaction at Fe  and Mn oxide surfaces.  Previous studies have been limited  to relatively high concentrations (in the range of 1 mM)  with respect to typical contaminant concentrations found in  the environment.  With the higher flux available at the  Advanced Photon Source, it is theoretically possible to  obtain valuable measurements from samples at least two  orders of magnitude lower in concentration.  Techniques  developed here will be used in future spectroscopic studies  of complex, natural substrates.  Results from this work will  enhance further complimentary laboratory studies in  understanding and modeling contaminants in the environment.  ***",
