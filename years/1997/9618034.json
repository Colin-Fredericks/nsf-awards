 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this proposal is to develop the underlying computational and design tools to take advantage of the confluence of current distributed computational resources and emerging rapid prototyping technologies.  Recent advances in physical prototyping allow the production of freeform solid objects directly from a computer model without part-specific tooling or human intervention. These technologies have been termed Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF).  Benefits of this technology include greatly reduced fabrication time and cost, and the capability to achieve, in one operation, shapes that would otherwise require multiple operations or in some cases would be impossible to manufacture with standard techniques.  In addition, advances in high performance computational networks enable rapid dissemination of information related to the analysis and design of engineering components and systems.  Researchers and industrial manufacturers have noted similarities between the potential for layer-based SFF technologies in mechanical component manufacture and VLSI for microelectronic component manufacture.  For SFF to gain status as a viable manufacturing approach comparable to VLSI, several technological shortcomings must be addressed.  First, an appropriate method for transmitting design data must be developed, as current standards are inaccurate, incomplete, and unextendable.  Second, design/fabrication knowledge for assessing manufacturability of designs must be encoded for use by both designers and SFF fabricators.  This research project will develop and demonstrate the technology base needed to integrate advances in both SFF and distributed computation; specifically to: (1) develop and investigate a new data exchange standard for geometric data that incorporates three-dimensional part geometry, spatial material variations, and fabrication directives (e.g., tolerances); (2) develop a two-dimensional interface that can be used to transmit fabrication information generated from the 3D data; (3) encode and demonstrate design rules checking for the SLS process; and (4) test the exchange standards and design rules with design examples from industrial partners.  The focus of work will be the selective laser sintering process, particularly for tasks 2 and 3.  However, the work will be performed with an eye for generality for all layer-based SFF processes and for integration with the work of other research groups.  Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) technologies offer the potential for significantly reducing product realization cycle times in many economic sectors, from electromechanical and consumer products to the automotive and aerospace industries.  SFF currently finds application mainly for prototype fabrication and limited production, but many researchers and commercial developers are intent upon developing these technologies into valid and viable manufacturing technologies.  This research focuses on two keys to realizing this goal:  (1) developing appropriate and robust data exchange standards for representing fabrication information; and (2) formalizing design-for-manufacture rules specific to SFF fabrication techniques. Similar challenges faced the microelectronics industry in its early days, and many researchers and practitioners have noted the similarities of integrated circuit fabrication and SFF manufacture.  Completion of this research will provide a foundation for the computational aspects needed for SFF to realize success similar to the microelectronics industry.",
