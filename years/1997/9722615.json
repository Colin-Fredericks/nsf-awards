Topic cuts across the disciplines of cell biology, molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, environmental biology, and biomedical science.  The organisms studied range from microbes to plants and animals, including humans.  Topics fall under the general headings of methylation of DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules, as well as S-adenosyl amino acid metabolism.  Approximately 60% of the program will be devoted to DNA methylation with the additional topics comprising the remaining 40%.  This is the third conference on Biological Methylation as a biennial series within the framework of the FASEB Summer Research Conferences, and it will be held June 14-19, 1997, at the Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, VT.  Three types of presentations are scheduled: oral presentations, poster discussion, and posters.  Oral presentations will be given in morning and evening sessions with the afternoons free for viewing posters, attending poster discussions, holding informal discussions, and partaking of social and recreational activities.  The primary criterion for participants is publication of research on biological methylation.  The conference is international in character.  %%%  This award will support attendance of young investigators at the FASEB conference on Biological Methylation in the summer of 1997.  This meeting will bring together investigators interested in all aspects of methylation to discuss their work.  Both nucleic acid and protein methylation, as well related aspects of metabolism will be discussed.  ***",
