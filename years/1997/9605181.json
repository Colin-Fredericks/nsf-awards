Agrawal, Indian  Institute of Technology, Kanpur.  The research entitled Laser and Plasma  Deposition and Adhesion of Diamond and Diamondlike Films will  Effect  and Specific Heat in Amorphous Alloys will determine the correlations  between the electrical and magnetic properties of metallic glasses.  While  considerable progress has been made in cataloging and explaining  electrical transport in paramagnetic glassy metals, the relative importance  of nonmagnetic processes and those associated with magnetism and  magnetic scattering processes in amorphous magnetic alloys has not been  completely established.  The U.S. group has been among the most active  studying electron transport and surface chemistry of nonmagnetic  amorphous alloys, and the Indian group has been a mahor factor in the  study of electron transport in magnetic glassy metals.  The expertise and  experimental capabilities of the two groups are highly complementary and  will combine well to accomplish the research objectives.     Scope:  In the United States the study of amorphous metals had, at one  time, been far more intensive than in India.  However, research priorities  in the United States have shifted to other areas.  Presently, no research  programs are funded solely for the study of amorphous metals.  The main  effort on this topic in India and perhaps worldwide will be performed by  Majumdar and his group at Kanpur.  U.S. collaboration will insure access  to major experimental research on amorphous metals, access to the  resulting technology at low cost, and the furthering of basic understanding  on transport in amorphous alloys.  This award is jointly funded by the  Division of International Programs and the Division of Chemical and   Transport Systems.        ***",
