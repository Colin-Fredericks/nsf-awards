Additional support is being provided by NASA, The  Barringer Foundation, JEOL USA, Inc., Cameca, Inc., and Pallasite  Press. The principal scientific focus of the meeting is on  meteorites as clues to the origin and evolution of the solar  system.    Annual meetings of the Meteoritical Society are technical  conferences, not conventions, and are international in nature.  Because of the latter the venue generally alternates between  Europe and the US, reflecting the sub-equal Society membership  from the two continents.  Countries represented at most of the  meetings include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,  France, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia,  Switzerland, the UK, and the United States.  Attendance at the  meetings over the past 14 years has mostly been in the range 250-  400 persons, including guests.  The largest meeting on record was  Vienna, with 449 participants plus guests.  Because of the  location of the 1997 meeting in Maui, Hawaii, attendance is  expected to be very high, probably in excess of 400.    The subject matter of the conference is dominated by mineralogic,  isotopic and chemical studies of meteorites, theoretical studies  of early solar system processes, and field and theoretical  studies of impact phenomena.  The overall scientific theme is  learning about the formation and evolution of our solar system  and its components, and solar systems in general.  Recent topics  of great interest at Meteoritical Society meetings have included  the nature and origin of interstellar grains that have been found  preserved in chondrite mete orites; the distribution of short-  lived radionuclides in the newly-formed solar system and their  possible role in early planetary melting; the nature of volatiles  in Martian (SNC) meteorites and their implications for the  volatile budget on Mars; the possible astrophysical sites (star  types) from which isotopically-anomalous material known to be  present in the early solar system was derived; and possible  secular variations in the meteorite population bombarding Earth  over the past several tens of thousands of years.    The Maui meeting is comprised of five days of  two concurrent  technical sessions, as well as Poster Sessions. Most of the  papers  are contributed rather than invited; many are given by  students.  The usual format is 10 minutes for presentation  followed by 5 minutes for questions.  All sessions, will be held  in the Maui Prince Hotel, which has new, superb lecture  facilities. The Meteoritical Society Meeting will be preceded by  an LPI-HIGP-sponsored Workshop on \"Parent body and nebular  modification of chondritic materials\", and it is anticipated that  many of the participants of the Meteoritical Society Meeting will  also participate in the Workshop.
