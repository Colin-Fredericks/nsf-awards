 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704020  Sarma    This award provides partial support for the development of  instrumentation to perform acoustic propagation experiments at  the two sites of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory  (Tallahassee, Florida; Los Alamos, New Mexico), by the Division  of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities of the National Science Foundation, and by the  University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  The primary quantities to be  measured are the velocity and attenuation of high frequency sound  waves, which would be studied as a function of magnetic field and  absolute temperature.  The materials of interest are primarily  highly correlated electron systems; our specific expertise  involves the high electron effective mass (heavy fermion)  systems, such as the interrnetallic compound UPt3, and the high  temperature superconductors.  For the heavy ferrnion materials,  the interesting physics arises from the fact that the magnetic  energy of the spin system, H (where  is an effective magnetic  moment), can be made comparable to a characteristic f-electron  energy describing the heavy fermion state (loosely, a Kondo  coherence energy or an f-electron resonance bandwidth).  For the  high temperature superconductors, an interesting area of study  involves observing changes in the elastic constants (as mirrored  in the sound velocity) accompanying phase transitions or  structural changes in the Abrikosov vortex system and  accompanying changes in the dissipation (as mirrored in the  acoustic attenuation); an example, though not relevant here, is  the two dimensional, liquid-solid melting transition.  %%%  The Tallahassee and Los Alamos sites focus on steady state and  pulsed magnetic fields respectively, which necessitates some  differences in the acoustic measurement techniques employed.  We  will utilize the pulsed-transmission/phase-sensitive-echo-  detection approach developed earlier at Milwaukee, Northwestern  and elsewhere.  Steady state fields permit the use of a low  repet ition acoustic pulse rate with relatively long averaging  times (via \"box car integration\") of the received acoustic  echo(s).  Pulsed acoustics requires very high repetition rates  (essentially at the reciprocal of the echo decay rate) and  separate sampling and storing of the received echo(s).  For this  purpose digitizers of the type used at the Los Alamos site will  be incorporated in instrumentation purchased from this proposal..  ***",
