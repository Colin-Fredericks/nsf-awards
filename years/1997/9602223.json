 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602223  Wessler  This award provides additional support for a multidisciplinary  training research training program focused on the mechanisms  of plant evolution.  The program, a joint effort of 9 faculty  from three departments, aims to educate and train students in  plant systematics,  population biology and molecular genetics.  Following three lab rotations and appropriate coursework,  graduate students undertake interdisciplinary thesis projects  that are meant to span at least two of the three focal areas.  Advanced students are required to undertake an internship with  a participating faculty member whose expertise is  complementary to that of their thesis advisor.  This  internship occurs during the period when thesis research is  underway, and is meant to include studies integral to the  thesis., thereby facilitating interdisciplinary projects.  In  addition, the program provides training of undergraduate  students through a summer intern program targeted at students  at the University of Georgia and nearby colleges.",
