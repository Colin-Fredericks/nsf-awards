Although people born with Williams syndrome are like the majority  of mentally disabled people in being weak in most cognitive  processes, such as in arithmetic and in solving simple problems,  many with the syndrome have enhanced language skills and uncanny  musical abilities.  To date, however, most of the observations of  their musical abilities come from reports of teachers and  parents.  Hence, one of the goals of this research is to document  and measure those abilities in order to help researchers get at  an understanding of how the brain is able to handle music  information, such as recognizing pitch, learning melodies and  lyrics, keeping rhythm, and retaining such information for  periods of years.    People with Williams syndrome constitute a unique population,  each lacking a piece of the same chromosome and sharing many  behavioral traits.  Among those shared traits appear to be the  way they hear and process musical information.  Mounting  anecdotal evidence regarding the innate musical abilities of  those with Williams syndrome is becoming quite compelling:    (1)  While Williams children are thought to have short attention  spans, their attention span for listening to and participating in  musical activities appears to be surprisingly long.  (2) Although  most can not read musical notation, many have absolute and  relative pitch.  (3) A number have uncanny rhythm, being able to  learn complex drum beats, such as 7/4, in a short session.  (4)  Many  are able to retain complex music (some in a variety of  languages), including both the words of many verses of long   ballads and the melodies, for periods of years.  (5) Those who   learn and sing in foreign languages have near-perfect accents.   (6) Experienced Williams musicians have a facility with harmony.   (7) A n umber can improvise and compose lyrics with great  facility.  (8) Virtually all lack stage fright, which often   plagues professionally trained musicians.    More recently, the part of the brain, the planum temporale,   shown to be enlarged in professional musicians with perfect   pitch, was also shown to be enlarged in a random population of   Williams people.  Another goal of this project, thus, is to   determine if there is a link between that part of the brain and   the processing of musical information.    The mechanism by which the brain processes musical information is  one of life's great mysteries.  Studies of music in Williams  people, in whom musical abilities are not generally confounded  with any general cognitive capabilities, may offer clues to  understanding those mysteries of musical cognition in the general  population.  ***",
