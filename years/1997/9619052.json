 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dresner  9619052    In each of three years 40 middle and high school teachers from the  Pacific Northwest will participate in field-based experiences in  forest ecosystem functioning.  The teachers' institute begins with  one week of background study in forest ecology at Portland State  University followed by four weeks of field research at a National  Forest site.  The final week of the summer session includes  teachers meeting with participating agencies (National Forest  sites) near their school who have agreed to be partners.  Teachers  receive 8-units of graduate credit from PSU.  The summer teacher  teams are from the same school, and during the academic year their  students will do research and collect data for use in their science  classes and by the Forest Service.  During the second and third  summers teachers who have completed a year in the program will work  as leadership teachers for the new participants.  This forest  research project for teachers will become institutionalized as it  becomes a permanent part of PSU's new Masters in Science Teaching  Program.  Partners on this project are US Forest Service scientists  and faculty from PSU, Oregon State University, and the Oregon  Institute of Technology.",
