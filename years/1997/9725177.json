This will be a 7250 sq. ft. interactive exhibit with associated public programs and materials that link the exhibit with formal education.  The goal of Adventures in Science is to promote understanding of biological diversity, the forces that have change it over time, and how scientists study and affect change.  The exhibit will consist of three areas.  \"Our Ever-Changing World\" will feature \"dual scene\" habitat dioramas that will convey at-a-glance how environments change over time.  \"The Natural History Museum\" will be a reconstruction of a museum laboratory and collections area to protray behind-the-scenes scientific and curatorial activities that further the study of biological diversity, ecology and systematics.  An \"Exploration Center: will bridge these two areas and will be designed to accommodate live presentations, group activities and additional multimedia stations for Internet and intranet access.  Using interactive devices, visitors will be encouraged to make hypothesis, examine evidence, compare specimens, construction histories of biological and geological changes, and develop conclusions about the science behind biodiversity and extinction issues.  Visitors should also come away with an increased understanding of the role of systematic collections in understanding biological diversity.  Information on MPM research programs will be highlighted in \"The Natural History Museum\" section and will be updated frequently.  Annual Teacher Training Institutes for pre-service and in-service teachers will present strategies for using the gallery's multimedia stations, lab areas, and Web site links.  Special attention will be given to reaching new audiences including those in the inner city and people with disabilities.",
