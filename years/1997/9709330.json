 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Elena Galoppini, Department of Chemistry, Rutgers University at   Newark is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Program of the   Chemistry Division under a Research Planning Grant to establish a   synthetic methodology leading to novel organic cage molecules.     Derivatives prepared from commercially available adamantanes and   tetraphenylmethanes are coupled to achieve robust, rigid cages with   internal cavities ranging from 18 to 28 angstroms in diameter.     Professor Galoppini presents a clever approach to the synthesis of   organic cage structures that possess the rigidity needed to serve as   moduli for the synthesis of extended, porous, supramolecular organic   networks.  A Research Planning Grant at this stage in Professor   Galoppini's career offers a means to exploit the chemistry, and develop   the methodology needed for an NSF research proposal in a very competitive   area.  Porous organic materials of tailorable architecture are an attractive   complement to currently available porous, inorganic materials.   The   synthesis of such materials, however, rests on building blocks of   sufficient rigidity to support an extended three dimensional array of the   individual units.  A synthetic methodology using commercially available   reagents will be developed to afford a series of rigid organic cages that   will serve as building blocks. Three dimensional materials will be   assembled with tailorable porosities to allow the diffusion and   encapsulation of different reagents.",
