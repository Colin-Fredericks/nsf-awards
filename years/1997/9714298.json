Large in volume, these  environments contain sufficient bacteria to form a major  component of biomass on earth. Oligobacteria, the dominant  pelagic organisms present, are almost totally unculturable,  perhaps because their growth strategies favor nutrient  collection over induction and regulation against excessive  transport of extracellular solutes. Pure cultures of the  more numerous and probably more typical oligobacteria  virtually always fail to propagate. Thus the environment of  oligobacteria is extreme because conditions have been  impossible to formulate sufficiently well for dependable  growth, a condition stemming from the extremely small  concentrations involved. General strategies for growth in  terms of biochemistry, molecular biology and kinetics are  therefore not well understood.  The aim of this effort is to  bring bacteria more representative of the oligotrophic  environment into cultivation and report their properties. To  do this, extinction cultures will be prepared from seawater  and culturabilities established. From the number of species  detected, estimates of the number of culturable species in  the parent water can be determined. Cultures are  continuously mixed and dialyzed against native seawater for  nutrient supply and waste-product removal. Pure cultures  will be selected from these on the basis of flow cytometry  patterns and investigated for basic nutritional properties  in order to produce useful quantities of biomass. The  resulting cultures will be used for more detailed  investigations to include i) size, DNA content, and cell  density, ii) phylogenetic location, iii) cytoplasmic and  particularly membrane protein distributions with attention  to permeases, and iv) detailed nutri tional properties  including the kinetic constants that specify nutrient  uptake. These data will be used to advance concepts of  oligotroph functionality.",
