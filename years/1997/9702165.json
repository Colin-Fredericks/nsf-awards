 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702165  Hernandez  While  much research effort is already directed at characterizing  aquatic  and  terrestrial microbial processes, relatively  little  work has approached microbiological aspects of air pollution from  an  engineering  perspective.  Rapid,  quantitative,  microscopic  aerosol  assays  will  be  used  to characterize  the  viability,  identity  and  distribution of bacteria and  fungi  suspended  in  indoor air.  Using direct epi-fluorescent microscopy, the goal of  this   work   is   to   accurately  characterize   the   airborne  concentrations of cellular and sub-cellular microbial  components  prevalent in commercial and residential aerosols.  The work  will  focus  on  both laboratory chamber studies and field measurements  to determine the biostability of airborne microorganisms commonly  encountered indoors.  Biostability is defined here as the ability  of  microorganisms  to  retain their metabolic  capabilities  and  their  physical integrity; it does not constitute the ability  to  be isolated or quantified by culture.    The  overall  goal of this project is to expand and  improve  the  research and teaching of microbiology germane to modern civil and  environmental  engineering practice.  As an educational  goal,  a  new  coursework  series on applied environmental microbiology  is  being    developed   for   permanent   integration    into    the  civil/environmental engineering curricula at  the  University  of  Colorado.   This  series  will  consist  of  a  total   of   four  undergraduate  and  graduate level courses, including  associated  laboratories.   The  courses will be structured  according  to  a  novel, problem-based cooperative learning format and taught in  a  brand  new,  state-of-the-art engineering  facility  specifically  designed to combine computer aided, multi-media presentation with  classroom   instruction   (Integrated   Teaching   and   Learning  Laboratory (ITLL)).  The undergraduate level courses will provide  fundamentals needed to und erstand microbial processes and ecology  in  engineered systems.  The graduate level courses will  analyze  environmental microbiology applications emphasizing the interface  between    modem   molecular   biology   and   civil,   sanitary,  geotechnical,  and  atmospheric  engineering.   The  applications  courses  will  intensively examine the microbiology  of  domestic  water  supply, wastewater treatment, aquifer/soil bioremediation,  biofouling, industrial corrosion, and air pollution.  The courses  have  a  dual  purpose: they are designed to  prepare  practicing  civil engineers and other environmental scientists with a working  knowledge   of  applied  microbiology,  as  well  as  provide   a  coursework,  laboratory  and literature foundation  for  research  oriented students.    Results  from  this work may have several important  implications  for understanding human exposure to airborne microorganisms while  expanding  environmental  engineering curricula  to  include  the  atmospheric  environment as a biosphere.  The projected  benefits  of  this  work stem from the development of a robust  microscopic  technique  capable  of stringent microbial characterization  with  relatively  minor  modifications to  commonly  used,  inexpensive  sampling  equipment.  Direct microscopic measurements  have  been  widely adopted in water treatment engineering and health sciences  as  they  provide  a superior basis for process  evaluations  and  epidemiological   studies.   These  visual   techniques   provide  absolute  measurements  that offer a  more  accurate  picture  of  bioaerosols   than   their  enrichment  based   counterparts   as  nutritional  selection and culturabihty do not bias the  results.  Applications  of  direct aerosol microscopy  include  a  reliable  means  to  evaluate  the effectiveness of engineered  rnitigation  methods  to  help  control  common  microorganisms  and/or  their  fragments  present  in  indoor aerosols.  Using  widely  accepted  fluorescent biological s tains and fluorescent genetic probes, the  technique  will  also  be  applied to  determine  the  ecological  structure of bioaerosols and the presence and activity of a  wide  range   of   pathogens.   The  project  will  directly  integrate  bioaerosol    research   into   new   environmental   engineering  microbiology  courses  as  well  as  into  courses   offered   in  mechanical  engineering  and public health.   This  project  will  serve  to  pilot  the new arm in its service as  a  \"building  as  laboratory\"   function   for   teaching   applied   environmental  microbiology in a civil and environmental engineering context.  ***",
