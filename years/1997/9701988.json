 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal deals with the dynamic control of large networks that  integrate real-time and non-real-time applications with heterogeneous  Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements.  To meet these requirements,  adaptive algorithms are needed for the routing, scheduling and admission  control components.  Routing provides a selection of routes, which  should have sufficient resources to satisfy the applications' QoS.  Scheduling allocates link resources (bandwidth, buffers, etc.) among the  different service classes.  Admission accepts or rejects a new incoming  application, based on the requested QoS and the available resources.  Because each control component causes and reacts to changes in the  network state, there is a strong time-dependent interaction among them.  By taking this interaction into account, the proposed work will develop  QoS routing algorithms that will provide significant improvements in  performance.  To this end, we will develop dynamic integrated models.  A  novel numerical-analytical technique, called \"Z-iteration\", will be used  to solve these models.  The Z-iteration promises to provide rapid and  accurate solutions to transient performance of integrated networks  consisting of both wired and wireless links.  Networks based on ATM and  integrated services IP will be considered. The proposed work will  develop software educational tools and projects for integrated networks,  and will experiment with providing QoS support to educational multimedia  applications.
