In  recent years,  the study  of relaxation and diffusion has grown  and become  interdisciplinary in nature  with  involvement  from colleagues in  condensed matter physics, chemistry,  chemical engineering  and  materials science and engineering.   Rapid developments  across  many areas in this  vast  field  on  an international  level make  it profitable  to  bring  together researchers  from  around the  world to  discuss  the  recent advances,  explore  new  ideas,  promote  collaborations  and stimulate  future research.  The  Conference at  Vigo,  Spain (June  30  - July 11, 1997) is  organized to follow two  very successful  previous meetings.  The  meeting is supported  by several  agencies of Spain, by the Max  Planck  Institut  fur Polymerforschung-Mainz  and the Naval  Research  Laboratory. Application is made to NSF for a grant to  support  partially the travel expenses of American colleagues,  particularly the young investigators.  %%%  The  main  objective  of this International  Meeting  is  to  discuss  the  current important issues  in  the  studies  of  relaxations  in  complex materials and systems.   Scientists with  backgrounds  as  varied as condensed  matter  physics, statistical  mechanics, physical chemistry, materials science and   engineering,  glass  science,  polymer   science   and engineering,  metallurgy,  thermodynamics and  rheology  will have the opportunity to discuss  critical issues which impede progress  in  this  vast  interdisciplinary  research  field. Following  the tradition of the  past two Meetings (Heraklion 1990,  Alicante  1993),  the  conference  will  cover  recent advances in relations in the  following areas:  a)   Theories and models of  relaxation  b)   Computer simulations  c)   Glass transition, relaxations in supercooled liquids, glasses,       co lloids and melts  d)   Relaxations in polymers, physical aging, plastization and       antiplastization  e)   Polymer dynamics on surface, at interface and in confined  spaces  f)   Viscoelastic and rheological properties of polymers,       solutions, ionomers, polyelectrolytes, copolymers and blends  g)   Polymer diffusion  h)   Solid State Ionics, conductivity and NMR relaxation, ionic       diffusion  i)   Structural relaxations of electronic and optical materials,       gels and ceramics  j)   Dielectric studies  k)   Optical and laser relaxation spectroscopy  l)   NMR, X-ray and neutron scattering  ***",
