There is a major need for improved low pressure/high density plasma sources which are scaleable to large areas with precisely controlled and uniform plasma density profiles.  The proposed Rotating-Field Plasma Source (RFPS) is a new type of source which is expected to meet the demanding requirements for etching and processing at feature sizes <0.5  m.  The RFPS relies on a novel high-frequency rotating magnetic field drive concept to generate and shape the plasma density in a way that will not be affected by insertion of semiconductor wafers.  It is expected to operate over a pressure range of O.1-lO mtorr with reactive gases.  The specific objectives of Phase I are to: (1) design and assemble a Phase I RFPS feasibility experiment; (2) perform experiments to demonstrate plasma generation with controlled uniformity; and (3) develop the conceptual design for a laboratory prototype RFPS system to be operated in a commercial etching system in Phase II.  A major dry etch equipment supplier has expressed great interest in the RFPS concept and will participate in Phase I.  This project contributes to National Critical Technologies in the Microelectronics and Optoelectronics area.   This project will provide a superior method for generating well controlled plasmas for a wide range of semiconductor materials processing applications.  The RFPS advantages include:  (1) scaleable to wafer diameters of >400 mm with good uniformity;  (2) excellent controllability;  and (3) low capitol and maintenance costs.  This source will substantially enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry.  ***",
