 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support for a three year program to study  stress transmission at three ice stream shear margins.  The  objectives are to determine how much of the motion of the ice  streams is controlled from the inter-stream ridges, to compare  the magnitude of this lateral drag with the driving stress on the  ice stream, and with ice stream width and to determine whether  lateral drag support is associated with lateral migration of the  margin.  The net force per unit ice-stream length transmitted  between ridge ice and ice-stream ice will be deduced from  measurements of strain rate.  Field work will entail Twin Otter  installation of remote camps that will each be occupied for about  12 days during the first season and about 6 days during the  second.  The Support Office for Aerogeophysical Research in  Antarctica (SOAR) facility will conduct aerial surveys to  determine ice thickness on the inter-stream ridges, as well as  the ice thickness and surface slope on the ice streams.  The  field measurements will be complemented by repeat SPOT imagery of  Ice Stream E adjacent to the field site, to allow velocities in  the ice-stream side of the margin to be determined.  Comparing  these velocities to those obtained from the strain-grid surveys  will provide an estimate of the amount of softening of the ice in  the margins.",
