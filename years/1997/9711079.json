 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made under the innovative technology connections portion of  NCRI's \"Connections to the Internet\" announcement, NSF 96-64, which covers  K-12 education institutions (including vocational technical schools),  public libraries and museums.  It provides partial support for twelve  months to investigate the use of FSK modulation (Frequency Shift Keying) on  unused Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) bands.  This is an  application of FSK modulation, which traditionally is used in spread  spectrum communication systems, to the ITFS microwave bands.  This  engineering study has the following objectives:      Develop a test plan that addresses both adjacent channel and co-channel  testing and test equipment requirements.    Systematically field test the use of FSK modulation techniques on  Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) and ITFS frequencies, providing a  matrix of test results.    Determine the interference capabilities of an FSK signal into  conventional NTSC analog transmissions.    Prepare a document consistent with the format of the Request for  Declaratory Rulemaking on the Use of Digital technology in MDS and ITFS  frequencies.    The results of the test will be submitted to the FCC, and could assist the  FCC in its decision on allowing widespread use of this technology.",
