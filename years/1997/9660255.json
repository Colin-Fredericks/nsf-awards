A trade study will be performed to select a feasible concept for future implementation. The concept will be rapidly prototyped for a proof-of-concept experiment, for feasibility evaluation of the proposed concept, and for providing a preliminary design and demonstration plan for Phase II, which will involve development, building, and testing of a brass-board model of the optical security system.   The commercial market is desperately in need of a simple, inexpensive scheme to stem the $2 billion fraud rampant in this sector. In addition, there are ample military uses in entry into secure or sensitive areas, and the verification of parts, such as computer chips purchased by the government. It is very likely that phase-encoded encryption schemes could solve both these problems. ***",
