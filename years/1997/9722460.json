The  investigators plan to study the effect of expression of  a  newly  isolated  gene,  NP-1, on the initial formation of  neural  crest  cells.   The new gene, isolated and sequenced from avian  embryos  by  Dr. Bronner in collaboration with two other researchers,  has  no  obvious similarities to other known gene families.   However,  although  the  chick system has many  advantages for experimental  embryology, it is difficult to ectopically express gene  products  in  birds.  Therefore, the researchers have initiated studies  of  the  Xenopus system, which represents an ideal system in which to  pursue ectopic expression of molecules in early development.   To  that  effect. they plan to isolate the Xenopus homologue of NP-!.  Their research will combine molecular biological approaches  with  experimental  embryology, with the long-term goal to characterize  and   understand  the  function  of  the  gene  in  neural  crest  formation.    The   collaboration  will  benefit  greatly  from  the   combined  expertise and research intereqt of both researchers. The proposed  experiments will take place in Dr. Mayor's laboratory, who is  an  expert on the Xenopus system and has a long standing interest  in  neural crest development.  .  ***",
