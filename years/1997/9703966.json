An initial commitment of $2 million from each country and funds from the private sector have allowed the Foundation to support two rounds of collaborative research, underwrite summer grants for young Mexican faculty to spend time with senior U.S. investigators, and provide fellowships for graduate students to complete their thesis work at U.S. laboratories.  In addition, the Foundation has supported the travel of outstanding scientists and engineers to Mexico for lectures and scientific interactions.  The Foundation intends to use these funds to support visits by distinguished U.S. experts to Mexico, summer visits by young Mexican faculty to the U.S., academic year fellowships for Mexican graduate students to U.S. universities, and a workshop to deal with environmental issues on the U.S.Mexico border.  This United States contribution includes funds provided by the National Science Foundation and the Environmental Protection Agency.  ***",
