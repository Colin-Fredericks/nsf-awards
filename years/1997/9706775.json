 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT      Nazarov    Nazarov will investigate exponential polynomials and lacunary series   and on weighted norm inequalities. The objectives of the proposed   research are: 1) to get a complete  version of the Turan Lemma, 2) to   investigate the distribution of  values of trigonometric polynomials   with random spectra, 3) to complete the theory of weighted norm   inequalities for singular  integral operators with one matrix weight   and 4)to start an attack  on the scalar two-weight case.    The problems described in this proposal are of fundamental character   and have numerous connections to other fields some of which in their   turn  have a direct impact on science and technology. For  example, fast computing  and data compression based  on wavelets.   The idea of the wavelet compression is strikingly simple: you just   take the wavelet expansion of your image  and drop all small terms,   memorizing only several \"large\" ones.   The problem is that you   should be sure that the large terms are really few and that the small   terms together cannot add up to  something huge. The formal requirement   (which is more or less just  the above phrase translated into   mathematical language) is that the  system of wavelets should form a   basis in a certain function space.",
