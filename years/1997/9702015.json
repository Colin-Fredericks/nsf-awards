 "awd_abstract_narration": "An in-depth study of reliable communication over unknown channels with  memory is proposed. Channels with memory are important in mobile wireless  communication where they model random disturbances and distortions that  vary in time due to the relative motion between the end-users and the  dominant scatterers. In many applications the fast variations in the  channel law are impossible to track, so that the encoding at the  transmitter and the decoding at the receiver must be performed under  channel law uncertainty.    For this scenario Feder and Lapidoth have recently demonstrated the  existence of a universal decoder. A universal decoder can be designed  without knowing the channel in use, and yet it performs asymptotically as  well as the optimal maximum-likelihood receiver tuned to the channel in  use. The implementation of the universal decoder proposed by Feder and  Lapidoth is, however, too complex, and in the proposed study a more  efficient universal decoder will be sought.    The issue of the transmitter design will be also addressed, and  particularly the problem of designing error correcting codes that perform  well on any channel in some family. Such codes should perform uniformly  well and should lend themselves to universal decoding. The above problems  relate to an additional problem that will be studied, namely the  calculation of the compound channel capacity of a family of channels with  memory. This capacity is the highest rate at which reliable communication  can be guaranteed irrespective of which channel in the family is in use.  This capacity is thus the ultimate bound on reliable communication when  both transmitter and receiver are ignorant of the channel in use.  Extension to the multiple-access channel, which models many-to-one  communication (as in the reverse link from mobile subscribers to the base  station in cellular telephony and in personal communications (PCS)), will  be also considered.    While the above problems are asymptotic in nature, a non-asymptotic   analysis of the bit-error-rate that results when a convolutional code is  decoded using a Viterbi decoder tuned to the wrong channel law is also  proposed.    This research is part of a five year career plan encompassing both teaching  and research in information theory. The proposed research aims at bridging  the gap between information theory and practical wireless communications  and at simplifying some of the key ideas of information theory. Such  simplifications will be used in order to supplement the electrical  engineering and computer science undergraduate curriculum by introducing  the notions of entropy, source coding, and channel coding early in a  student's program.
