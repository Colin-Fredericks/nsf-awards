 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Environmental Geochemistry and Biochemistry Program is   supported by the Divisions of Earth Sciences and Chemistry and the   Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).  Dr.   Carrick M. Eggleston and Dr. Steven R. Higgins of the Geology and   Geophysics Department, University of Wyoming, will develop methods to   achieve crystal-face specificity in the measurement of mineral surface   charge.  The goal of the research is to move beyond a surface-average   approach to information helpful to understanding mineral surface   reactivity.  The surface charge and potential as a function of pH and   ionic media will be measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and   in-situ optical second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy for   representative mineral surfaces, such as, corundum, hematite, rutile and   quartz.  These measurements will be compared to results obtained after   the adsoprtion of organic molecules at the mineral-water interface.  Of   interest are citric, oxalic, p-nitrobenzoic, and   4,5-dinitrobenzene-1,2-dicarboxylic acids and rhodamine.  Understanding reactions of organic and biological compounds with mineral   surfaces are increasingly important to complete characterization of   complex geological and environmental processes at the molecular level.    The methods currently used in mineral surface geochemistry are not   adequate.  Here, the capabilities of AFM and SHG instrumentation will be   tested as means of characterizing the surfaces of mineral surfaces found   in `real world` samples.",
