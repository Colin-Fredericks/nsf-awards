 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational Methods for Mixed-Effects Models        Douglas M. Bates, U. of Wisconsin - Madison              Abstract    This research extends current computational methods and software  implementations for the estimation of parameters in mixed-effects  models.  There is a special emphasis on extensions to models where  there are several levels of random effects nested within each other.  Another emphasis is on models where the within-subject response  depends nonlinearly on the parameters of interest.  The primary  implementation is in the S computer language and complements current  graphical and analytical methods available in that language.    When a response is measured on several occasions for each of several  \"subjects\" or experimental units, the resulting data are called  repeated-measures data.  If the data on each experimental unit are  collected over time, they are also known as longitudinal data.  A  statistical model for such data will usually incorporate both fixed  effects, parameters that describe the typical behaviour in the  population from which the experimental units are selected, and random  effects, quantaties that describe the variation within the population.  Models with both fixed effects and random effects are called  mixed-effects models.  This research provides new computational  methods for fitting mixed-effects models to observed data.  The new  methods are suitable for use with parallel computers and with other  high performance computing environments.  This is important because  some of the applications of mixed-effects models in manufacturing  (evaluation of integrated circuit designs) and biotechnology  (modelling of genetic effects in animal breeding) involve fitting  complicated models to thousands and sometime millions of observations;  a task that pushes the limits of current computers.",
