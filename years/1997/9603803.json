 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pepperberg  9603803    The PI's goals are to examine the cognitive and  communicative capacities of Grey parrots.  Results from  these studies will provide insights into the evolution of  intelligence, how input affects learning, and comparative  neurobiology and anatomy.  (1) Comparisons with other  \"language\"-trained animals (e.g., on representational  abilities and how well problem-solving skills are  transferred to new contexts) will demonstrate the extent to  which intelligence has evolved (independently) in mammals  and birds: It is not yet known, for example, if labels  acquired by Grey parrots represent board or narrow  (specific) concepts:  Do parrots that, for example, label a  particular sound pattern as \"3\" understand that this concept  of \"threeness\" extends to physical entities?  The PI will  examine how well such transfer occurs without training.  In  addition, can a bird extend concepts, such as  bigger/smaller, that are learned in one context (e.g., mass)  to respond to questions in another context (e.g., ordinality  of number)?  The experiments will provide information about  parrots' comprehension of such concepts and data for cross-  species comparisons.  (2) Data on how various aspects of  input affect learning and the extent of parrots'  communicative abilities may enable us to improve programs  for other interspecies communication projects and possibly  for dysfunctional humans: Parrots that are taught a human-  based code can undergo experimental manipulations to  determine optimal conditions for learning the code; these  conditions may be extended to other species.  The  experiments focus on the extent to which acquisition is  affected by (a) species identity of the trainer and (b) the  amount of reference, functionality, and social interaction  in the training input.  (3) Showing how parrots, with brains  and vocal tracts so unlike those humans, acquire meaningful  English speech provides comparative data on neuroanatomical  correlates of cognition and on how differen t anatomical  structures produce similar sounding utterances. Differences  exist in psittacine and human neural and auditory  mechanisms, yet speech patterns are mutually comprehensible;  my data should provide insights into speech perception and  information processing.  Parrots and humans differ with  respect to lungs, bronchi, trachea, nasal cavity, larynx,  and tongue, and parrots uniquely use air-sacs and a syrinx  whereas humans uniquely use lips and teeth; I am therefore  studying alternative mechanisms for producing human speech.  (4) Finally, elucidating the intelligence of Greys may  encourage conservation efforts for all psittacids.",
