 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616947  Gelhar  This is an award to provide support for research on the behavior  of dense, nonaqueous phase liquids when present in an aquifer  being considered for or being subjected to decontamination.  The  objectives of the project are to determine the role of aquifer  heterogeneity in field-scale flow of immiscible liquids, the  distribution of residual nonwetting liquids and the rate of  dissolution from the residual phase, and to develop strategies  for data collection and analysis during aquifer decontamination.  The research will involve a stochastic characterization in which  local scale behavior is assumed to be well represented by  conventional equations used to describe conservation of mass and  momentum.  The field-scale response will involve using linear  perturbation methods that relate the statistical description of  heterogeneity of soil properties to the observable field-scale  response.    The investigator plans on adapting techniques he has successfully  applied to understanding unsaturated flow in porous media while  also addressing additional factors that must be considered  including flow of a nonwetting phase, trapping by capillary  forces and subsequent dissolution.  Addressing as it does the  effects that dense, nonaqueous liquids have on decontamination of  aquifers, one of the expected outcomes of this research will be  to improve the engineering design of aquifer decontamination  procedures.  However, results will also be applicable to a range  of environmental protection and resource development problems  that require prediction of field-scale transport processes such  as radioactive waste management and enhancement of petroleum  production.  ***",
