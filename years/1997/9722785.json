Mechanisms of Long-Term Transynaptic Regulation of  Neurotransmitter  Release\"    Competitive interactions between synapses innervating the  same target cell are critical in the establishment and  refinement of connectivity in the nervous system, and in the  adjustment of synaptic strength with use or experience. One  of the most intriguing forms is known as \"Hebbian\"  plasticity, in which synaptic inputs that are active  simultaneously with postsynaptic activity are retained or  strengthened, while synapses that are  not active at the same time as the postsynaptic cell are  suppressed or lost.       A particularly clear, accessible  instance of such pre-synaptic suppression is that observed  in synapses between Xenopus motoneurons and muscle cells in  culture. Transmitter release at a synapse is suppressed by  manipulations that elevate the calcium concentration in the  muscle cell, simulating activation of another synaptic  input. The synapse can be protected from suppression if it  is active during the time of calcium-induced feedback.  The mechanisms of suppression and protection are unknown.  We have developed techniques for patch-clamping synaptic  terminals and postsynaptic cells simultaneously in this  system, allowing us to analyze rigorously the magnitude and  time course of ionic currents in the terminal and the  associated  neurotransmitter release. With a third patch  pipette it is possible to introduce reagents into the  synaptic  terminal through the neuronal cell body. Since calcium  influx during a presynaptic action potential  is critical to neurotransmitter release, we will first (1)  determine whether long-term  suppression of  synaptic function is associated with a decrease in calcium-  influx either by  direct modulation of calcium channels or  by changes in other ionic currents in the terminal, and  what these changes are at the level of single channels. If  suppression of release can be explained by changes in ionic   currents, we will determine (2) whether the suppression  effects are mediated by G-protein associated receptors, and  whether this is by a direct (\"membrane delimited\") or  indirect (second messenger mediated) pathway, and (3)  whether cyclic  nucleotides help mediate the effect.   In addition, we will  test (4) whether protection by simultaneous synaptic  activity is due to prevention of the suppressive influence  or to some compensatory change,  and (5)  what aspect of neuronal activity is responsible for  this protection.      The Xenopus motoneuron-muscle cell  synapses are robust, characteristic in most respects of  mature synapses. The Hebbian character of the modulation,  the evidence for activity-dependent protection of synapses,  the accessibility of the preparation, and above all the  ability to monitor and manipulate pre-synaptic events make  this an ideal  preparation in which to obtain insights about mechanisms of  long-term synaptic remodeling and plasticity.",
