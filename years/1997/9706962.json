 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years CPU execution speed has increased at a much greater rate than  DRAM access speed.  This disparity has produced a large speed penalty for access  to memory by today's computer systems, which may reach several hundred  instructions within a few years.  Performance of future computer systems may be  limited by this effect to the speed of memory rather than the speed of logic.    This project investigates a new memory architecture which reduces the speed gap.   By integrating a small, wide cache on each DRAM IC, expected DRAM access time  will be reduced.  By employing dedicated high-performance connections between  processor and memory, memory-bus latency will be eliminated.  Finally, by  incorporating hardware to predict memory access and prefetch data, DRAM latency  will be further hidden.  These innovations will be evaluated using  architectural-level simulations based on traces of memory-intensive programs.",
