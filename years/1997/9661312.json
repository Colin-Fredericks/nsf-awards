This all-plasma-deposited low-k dielectric could provide a strong competitive advantage in both cost and performance. The semiconductor industry's need for an insulating material with a low-k dielectric constant arises from the fact that chip speed is limited by the resistance of the metal line and the surrounding insulator. Dielectrics today have a constant of 4 to 3.2.  Higher chip speeds require a switch to a new type of material, very possibly a plastic-like organic. Such materials could reduce dielectric constants to 2.0 or lower. The push for low-k dielectric materials is motivated by a desire to reduce capacitance. Reducing capacitance also minimizes crosstalk between adjacent metal lines, an increasingly severe problem.   The US market for low-k dielectrics is estimated to be 2 billion dollars by the year 2000. Low-k dielectrics are applicable to a broad spectrum of applications sensitive to ever finer geometries, crosstalk and higher frequencies. Prime candidates for a new class of low-k- materials are: IC manufacture to enable faster devices; high density MCMs with high density interconnects and less crosstalk for computers; and high frequency devices used in the telecommunications industry by allowing greater design latitutde and better performance on high frequency devices. ***",
