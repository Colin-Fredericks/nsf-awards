 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626380  Horel        The National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric   Administration (NOAA) have established a joint program to support research of  mutual interest.  Generally, research supported under this program involves activities  that are interesting research efforts, address a need of NOAA, and ones that can  benefit from the resources and computer models of the NOAA National Center for  Environmental Predictions.        This research will be supported under this joint program and is aimed at  evaluating and using the NOAA Eta forecast model and its associated adjoint model  that have been developed at the NOAA NCEP.  The ongoing development of the  mesoscale Eta model makes it possible to evaluate mesoscale weather phenomena  that have not been adequately documented before, especially in the western United  States, where mesoscale atmospheric motions are tightly coupled to the underlying  complex terrain. The Principal Investigator will build and expand on research  underway now and continue to evaluate the performance of the mesoscale Eta modal  over the Western United States.        The adjoint of the Eta model has been developed at NCEP for using an  advanced data assimilation method know as 4-dimensional variational (4DVAR) data  assimilation.  4DVAR assimilation has been shown in several case studies to lead to  improved forecast skill for Eta model forecasts.  As this data assimilation procedure  begins to be tested on a routine basis at NCEP, additional information will be  available to model developers and, eventually, operational personnel regarding the  sensitivity of the model forecasts to initial observational error and other factors.  The  major goal of the proposed work is to participate in the development and application  of the Eta adjoint model and associated data assimilation methods.  Specifically, the  solutions in terms of both the initial conditions and adjoint sensitivities obtained as  part of the data assimilation method will be evalua ted as a function of differing  synoptic situations.  ***",
