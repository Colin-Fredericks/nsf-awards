 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9604238  PI:  Jen      During sensory signal processing, the brain has the built-in ability to edit and   adjust the flow of information that reaches it.  It is known that the cortex has   neural pathways, called corticofugal pathways, that descend to influence the   neural activity carrying information coming up to the cortex by the ascending   sensory pathways.  We know very little about how and when these descending   pathways exert their influence, but in the auditory system they are believed to be   important in functions such as pattern recognition and localization of acoustic   signals.  This project uses a physiological approach to determine how   descending cortical pathways can affect the response activity of single auditory   nerve cells in a midbrain auditory structure called the superior colliculus.    Electrophysiological recordings will examine corticofugal regulation of intensity   coding, frequency tuning, and auditory spatial sensitivity of these neurons.  This   system may be a way for the brain to 'focus in' on important but faint auditory   signals in a noisy environment, for example in echolocation behavior.     Results from this work will be important for developing a more realistic and   dynamic model of central auditory processing.  It also will enhance our   understanding of active regulation of signal processing by the brain, and so will   have a potential impact on understanding other sensory systems, as well as on   fields such as neuroethology, animal behavior, and on bioengineering including   development of aids for hearing.",
