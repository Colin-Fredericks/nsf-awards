 "awd_abstract_narration": "The reaction of the Si(001) surface with unsaturated organic  molecules via a 2+2 cycloaddition is studied in this research  project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.   Professor Hamers and his students at the University of Wisconsin  will study ordered organic films formed by this route using  scanning probe microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,  Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  These  organic films can be derivatized, and functional strategies  developed to form overlayers with specific electronic and optical  properties.  The chemical and structural properties of these films  are correlated with the possibility of interesting electrical and  optical properties.  The spatially dependent probes used to  characterize these overlayers allow the determination of the  spatial anisotropy which is expected to arise.  The adsorption of unsaturated organic molecules on the silicon  surface forms the focus of the research supported in this project.   The ability to develop a flexible synthetic chemistry for organic  films on silicon promises to allow the connection of silicon  process technology for electronic devices with the broad range of  properties possible with organic overlayers.  A range of spatially  dependent methods will be used to characterize the structure and  properties of these synthesized overlayers.",
