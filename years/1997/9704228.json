 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704228  Boolchand    This award provides partial support for implementing a new  concept of a 67Zn M ssbauer spectrometer which will yield  significantly larger (at least a factor of 20) signal to noise  ratios than hitherto possible using standard velocity drives in  transmission measurements of materials.  The novel features of  the present concept includes (a) use of a phase modulation drive  which avoids any relative motion between source and absorber  matrix, and (b) time-filter the re-emitted radiation to  discriminate the short lived (10-12s) non-resonant radiation from  the long-lived (10-5s) resonant one to enhance the signal to  noise ratio.  Feature (a) will be implemented by using a rotating  wheel consisting of Al wedges which interrupt the -beam from a  source to modulate the energy with respect to a stationary  absorber.  Feature (a) will also permit region of interest  velocity scans, an option that will permit a more efficient  collection of information with the short-lived M ssbauer parents  (67Ga and 67Cu).  Feature (b) will be implemented by using a  shutter wheel with narrow slits, that will block the -beam from  the source while a scintillation detector registers the re-  emitted -rays and conversion electrons from the absorber.  Implementation of these features at 4.2K will be done by  supporting the wheels in an exchange gas column of a liquid  Helium dewar.  The project will demonstrate the enormous cost  advantage of obtaining Zn spectra using the new spectrometer and  should make possible obtaining spectra of Zn compounds of normal  enrichment.  Such an experimental facility will have important  consequences in the field of basic materials research.  High  resolution studies of Zn based inorganic compounds in absorption  and Cu- and Ga-based compounds in emission spectroscopy will  permit addressing outstanding materials science issues in a wide  variety of materials including II-VI, III-V and II-IV-V2  semiconductors, cuprate superconductors, galvanization of steels,   Zn-ferrites, Zn-spinels and zinc based enzymes.",
