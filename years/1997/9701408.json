 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to investigate extensions of a design methodology  for a class of low noise integrated oscillators in the applications areas of  telecommunications, high speed microprocessors, and oversampled data conversion.   The goal of the teaching plan associated with this research is for the Analog  Microelectronics Laboratory to become an integral resource for educating both  undergraduates and graduate students in the complete integrated circuit design  process.  This project will improve the design of analog and mixed signal  integrated circuits for telecommunication systems in which system-level  performance is ultimately limited by fundamental circuit-level considerations.   A critical component in any integrated communication system is an oscillatory  that provides a time/frequency reference for the data transmission and detection  process.  The broad class of ring oscillators offer many advantages for  integrated oscillator design, but until recently there were no procedures  available to design for a desired level of noise performance.  This project is  based on a new design methodology for ring oscillators that has been proven  successful to the frequencies up to 155 MHz in a bipolar IC process.  The goal  is to extend and broaden the low jitter oscillator design techniques to higher  speed in the GHz range, reduced supply voltage of 3.3V and below, and other  fabrication technologies including CMOS.",
