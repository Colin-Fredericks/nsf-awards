 "awd_abstract_narration": "As systems improvements move toward the exclusive use of microelectronics for sensors and distributed processing, it is imperative that high-performance technicians who install and maintain Direct Digital Control systems and the engineers who design these systems achieve higher competency levels in the application of this technology.  The university improves the teaching of direct digital controls and related process instrumentation, data communications, electrical/electronic control applications, and air conditioning and refrigeration courses with the transformation of the campus Student Union into a live laboratory.  Using real-time microelectronic systems controls, students monitor and control mechanical systems operations that maximize environmental comfort and energy efficiency in full compliance with ASHRAE Standards.  In a live laboratory, students interface and monitor microelectronic control systems in full compliance with building engineer design specifications; calibrate, tune, and maintain heating ventilation and air conditioning direct digital control systems to ensure operation at building engineer design specifications; operate microelectronic control systems and mechanical devices from remote locations; and link ethernet local area networks into a fiber-optic and copper communications infrastructure.  The development of the direct digital controls live laboratory can result in curriculum improvements, higher levels of student learning, and better prepared high-performance technicians for the emerging workforce.  This project serves many nontraditional students: the campus' average student age is 26.6 years, and the racial distribution is more diverse than the state population.  Student pre- and post-tests can document the project's success in producing more broadly trained and competent technicians.  Project reports can be offered to electrical/electronic and HVAC technical societies and publications, to educational associations, and on the Internet home page.  *",
