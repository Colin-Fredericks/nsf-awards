 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposed project is to improve the quality of science instruction, primarily to students enrolled in the General Physiology course, at St. Mary's University.  St. Mary's is an Hispanic Serving Institution with a 69% Hispanic undergraduate student body.  Biology is the largest major at the University with over 300 majors.  The activities of the proposed plan are intended to improve learning and stimulate the interest of our students in variety of careers in  the biological sciences.  The goal of improving instruction will be achieved through reaching the following objectives:  enhancing knowledge and insight about the roles of different physiological systems; improving collaborative skills; improving critical thinking skills; improving writing and speaking skills.  These objectives will be realized by creating an interactive learning environment and a hands-on approach to learning in the physiology lab; by improving the quality in and variety of instructional delivery; and by providing students with opportunities to present results of laboratory experiments to others.  The addition of modern instrumentation and enhanced classroom technologies will increase the hands-on experiences of our students in data collection, integration and synthesis of data, and will improve the communication of the results of the experiments.  The major equipment purchases include six Power Macintosh computers, MacLab hardware and software, software for data analysis and presentation, and specific physiograph components for collection of data.  This equipment will be used to upgrade current experiments and add new experiments to the physiology course and lab.  St.  Mary's University is contributing an equal amount to this project.",
