 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental support is needed to augment the treatment of electron spin in lecture courses.  This project is focused on the experimental verification of electron spin concepts across the chemistry curriculum using an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer and a magnetic susceptibility balance.  Two purposes will be served:  (1) experimental reinforcement of the fundamental concept of electron spin and (2) improved understanding of the breadth of magnetic resonance spectroscopies (EPR and NMR).  Specific EPR and magnetic susceptibility experiments are proposed for six different chemistry courses:  Intermediate Inorganic, Organic Spectroscopy, Physical Chemistry, Advanced Inorganic, Biochemistry, and Advanced Analytical.  These experiments will demonstrate specific electron spin concept such as magnetism and electron configuration of transition metal centers, hyperfine coupling in organic radicals and transition metal complexes, and molecular orbital theory.  A unique undergraduate biochemistry EPR experiment involving the paramagnetic copper center of plastocyanin extracted from spinach leaves is proposed.  Chemistry majors and minors, including some pre-service secondary science teachers, will be most affected by this project.  A primary reason for the scarcity of electron spin experiments at most institutions is lack of proper instrumentation and the lack of cohesive plan to implement such experiments in the curriculum.  The proposed multi-course approach to electron spin experiments provides such a plan and will be shared nationally through appropriate presentations and publications and shared locally through a workshop once this project has been initiated.",
