 "awd_abstract_narration": "Higgins  9604875  A new method has been developed to probe the structure of bacterial chromosomes inside living cells.  This technique, which is called Muprinting, uses PCR reactions to generate a high-resolution picture of the transposition target sites in a bacterial population infected with phage MU.  With Muprints, it is possible to detect the location of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins like repressors and RNA polymerases, to identify hot spots and cold spots for transposon insertion, and to follow changes in chromosome structure when cells are placed in different physiological environments.  Two primary objectives will be pursued.  First, detailed Muprint maps will be made for a 40 kb segment of the S. typhimurium chromosome, which includes the cob and pdu operons (1% of the whole genome).  These operons are tightly repressed under aerobic growth conditions but become actively transcribed and translated under anaerobic growth conditions.  The Muprint profile will provide detailed information about the binding of proteins involved in repression or activation of these operons, including ArcA, ArcB, PocR, and CRP.  The second objective is to use the Muprint mapping to discern how a large segment of DNA can become shielded from transposition.  Transposition immunity means that when a copy of phage Mu already exists at one chromosomal site, the frequency of a second Mu transposon moving near the first is very low.  Thus, as a chromosome becomes infiltrated with replicating Mu elements, immunity guarantees that the replicating Mu elements become spaced relatively evenly over the bacterial chromosome.  The immunity distance will be measured for a Mu insertion in the cobT gene.  Genetic factors and DNA sites that influence how and how far immunity spreads through a chromosome will be defined.    Developing methods to systematically investigate the mechanics of protein-DNA movement inside living cells has been one of the most challenging and perplexing problems in modern molecular biology.  T he information gained from Muprinting technology will provide a perspective on chromosome structure that may stimulate new genetic and biochemical models for genome function.  It will also provide a model for understanding processes that generate stochastic gradients along the DNA sequence like silencing in yeast and immunoglobulin recombination in higher vertebrates.",
