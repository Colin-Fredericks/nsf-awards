 "awd_abstract_narration": "9711151  Christensen  This is an award to support conduct of a workshop to  consider environmental problems that are characteristic of  urban coastal waters of the United States.  Co-Chairman of  the workshop will be Dr. Charles R. O'Melia, Department of  Geography and Environmental Engineering, The Johns Hopkins  University.  A resource document to be used for addressing  this topic will be Managing Wastewater in Coastal Urban  Areas, a report of the National Research Council's Water  Science and Technology Board.  Topics to be addressed  include research needs associated with approaches to  determine the nature and scope of the environmental problems  resulting from the presence of contaminated sediments,  prevention of future accumulations of contaminants and  appropriate conditions and approaches for their  decontamination.    While point-sources of water pollution are generally readily  identifiable, non-point sources such as those attributable  to runoff from developed and undeveloped land as well as  deposition from the atmosphere are not.  The product of this  conference is expected to be a report that can be used in  planning operation of the Environmental Systems research  program as it addresses problems of special significance to  coastal communities.  Results of this research are expected  to lead to improved models that can be utilized in  engineering design of systems to prevent pollution,  facilities for pollution control facilities and  decontamination of polluted aquatic resources.  ***",
