 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mogilner  9707750       Certain kinds of cellular movements are driven by actin  polymerization.  The most conspicuous examples are the  lamellipodia of spreading and migrating embryonic and metastatic  cells.  A variety of pathogenic bacteria also propel themselves by  constructing behind them a polymerized tail of cross-linked actin  filaments.  Collective cellular movements mediated by cell-cell  interactions can generate interesting spatial patterns.  These  patterns can shed light on intercellular communication and can be  used as novel assays for understanding the molecular mechanisms  of cell signaling.  The goal of this research is to understand at  the molecular level (i) the mechanochemical basis of force  generation by polymerizing and depolymerizing actin networks,  (ii) the mechanisms of spatio-angular cytoskeletal organization,  (iii) patterns of collective cell motion.  The investigator and  his colleagues formulate a mechanochemical theory of how the  thermal fluctuations of the filament tips and the membrane can be  rectified by actin polymerization to generate a propulsive force.  This force is controlled by soluble and transmembrane proteins  that stimulate actin polymerization.  The investigators also  formulate a theory for retrograde flow of lamellar cytoplasm.  This theory is based on two sources of contractile force: (i) the  contraction of the actin gel that must accompany  depolymerization, and (ii) actin filament contraction driven by  myosin.  The results of these models determine the relative roles  of actin polymerization and myosin crosslinking and contraction  during cell locomotion.  These studies help forge a link between  the basic biophysics of cell motility and the chemical control of  cell motion.       The crawling of cells over surfaces is the basis for the  vitally important phenomena of phagocytosis and the migration of  metastatic cells.  Despite the ubiquity of cellular motions, the  molecular mechanisms underlying these movements remain  mysterious.   The investigators undertake theoretical modeling that  provides a solid quantitative basis for understanding the  detailed working cycle of the cell's molecular engines.  This  description provides a new interdisciplinary level of  understanding cell movements and new methods of predicting cell  behavior in medically and technologically important situations.",
