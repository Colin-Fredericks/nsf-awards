The program involves a synergism of analytical and numerical   studies of problems in combustion and flame propagation, which has been   successful in elucidating solution behavior of the highly nonlinear systems   of PDEs which we study. In particular, interest centers on problems exhibiting   complex spatiotemporal dynamics in gaseous combustion as well as in solid fuel   combustion. In gaseous combustion, we consider four different problem areas:   (a) flames with sequential reactions, (b) flames in stretched flows,   (c) flames stabilized on a burner, and (d) flames in gas filled tubes.  We also consider problems in solid fuel combustion, in which  combustion waves are used to synthesize advanced materials. In this  relatively new and innovative technological process, which appears to  enjoy many advantages over conventional technology, the combustion  wave propagates through the sample, converting unreacted solid powder  mixture to solid product. Our analytical studies are based on  bifurcation and nonlinear stability theories, which employ asymptotic   analysis and singular perturbation theory in the neighborhood of  bifurcation or other transition points, resulting in a local  description of the solution in a neighborhood of the appropriate  critical point. Then an adaptive pseudo-spectral method, developed by  the proposer and A. Bayliss, is employed for large scale   scientific computations, with which the local description is globally   extended. The solutions of the problems considered exhibit layer type  behavior, i.e., localized regions in which the solution varies very  rapidly. It is a challenge to numerical methods to accurately and   efficiently resolve such behavior. The adaptive pseudo-spectral method  has been shown to successfully meet this challenge. As critical  parameters of the problem are exceeded, transitions to   states with successively greater degrees of  spatio-temporal complexity occur.    Our goal is to describe the transitions as well as the resulting   spatio-temporal patterns. The analytical studies, in addition to  elucidating system behavior, e.g., parameter dependencies, also serve  as benchmarks for the ensuing numerical computations. Codes are thus   validated not only for simple solutions, but for complex  spatio-temporal behavior as well. In addition to studying specific   combustion problems, we contribute to the development of both analytical and   numerical methodology for the investigation of these and other  problems. Finally, where possible, comparisons to relevant  experimental observations will be made.    We investigate mathematical problems describing combustion processes. The   primary concern in these studies is the understanding of basic mechanisms,   including cause and effect, influencing combustion,  which is a necessary   prerequisite to any attempt to control the combustion process. In particular,   we study the characteristics, e.g., structure, propagation speed, stability,   etc., of combustion waves.  An example of the problems considered is the use   of combustion waves to synthesize advanced materials. In the conventional   technology, a powder mixture of components is placed in a furnace and \"baked\"   until it is well done. In combustion synthesis the mixture is pressed into a   solid and ignited at one end. A combustion wave then propagates through the  solid converting it to desired product. The process is significantly  faster and cheaper than the conventional technology. The nature of the  product is determined by the manner of propagation of the combustion  wave, which is the subject of our investigation.",
