 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724049  Postle    Energy for the active transport of iron-bearing  siderophores, vitamin B12, and other ligands across the  outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is transduced from  the cytoplasmic membrane to high-affinity outer membrane  transporters by a cytoplasmic membrane protein complex  consisting of TonB and a set of auxiliary proteins.  Postle  and colleagues have previously demonstrated, using in vivo  crosslinking, that Escherichia coli TonB directly contacts  both cytoplasmic membrane proteins and the outer membrane  receptors. Preliminary data, which are based on separation  of cytoplasmic and outer membranes by sucrose density  gradient fractionation, indicate that TonB can associate  with the outer membrane in the absence of the cytoplasmic  membrane.  These results suggest that TonB might shuttle  from cytoplasmic to outer membrane in the process of energy  transduction, and thus serve as the springboard for  characterizing the interactions between TonB and the outer  membrane.  By exploiting the ability of TonB to form stable  associations with the outer membrane, it should be possible  to determine the nature of these associations.  Biochemical  approaches will be used to define TonB-outer membrane  interactions and their relationship to the process of energy  transduction.  The cytoplasm of Gram-negative eubacteria is surrounded by a  protective envelope consisting of three concentric layers: a  cytoplasmic or inner membrane; a cell wall composed of  peptidoglycan (murein), proteins, and polysaccharides; and  an outer membrane.  Between the inner membrane and the wall  is the periplasmic space, which is known to contain a number  of important enzymes.  This envelope poses a barrier to  harmful agents in the environment.  However, it also poses a  barrier to the bacterium's access to vital nutrients such as  minerals and vitamins from the environment.  The bacteria  possess a complex mechanism for selectively bringing such  nutrients into the cytoplasm.  This mechanism inv olves  active (i.e., energyrequiring) transport of siderophores  (carrier proteins that bind to nutritionally vital minerals  such as iron), vitamin B12 and other ligands across the  outer membrane.  The source of the energy for this process  comes from cytoplasmic metabolism, and thus this mechanism  requires the transduction of energy from the cytoplasmic  membrane (transduction of the membrane protonmotive force)  across the periplasmic space to the outer membrane.  This  energy transduction involves a membrane protein complex  consisting of a protein called TonB plus other associated  proteins. TonB was long thought to be located exclusively in  the cytoplasmic membrane.  However, using in vivo  crosslinking and subcellular fractionation, Dr. Postle  showed that TonB has direct contact with both cytoplasmic  membrane proteins and the outer membrane receptors, and that  TonB can exist in 3 distinct milieus:  by itself in the  cytoplasmic membrane, in contact with both membranes  simultaneously, and by itself in the outer membrane.  Further work will use genetic, biochemical, and  other approaches to define the interaction  between TonB and the outer membrane and to  relate this to the process of energy  transduction. The significance of this work  extends far beyond merely the function of TonB.  In Gram-negative bacteria, there are more than  100 distinct transport systems where  cytoplasmic membrane proteins are postulated to  interact with outer membrane proteins (e.g.,  multidrug efflux pumps, excretion of colicins,  hemolysins, and degradative enzymes).  The  proposed studies on TonB may well be directly  relevant to these other systems also. These  studies are therefore anticipated to greatly  enhance our understanding of how bacterial  metabolism is linked to the environment.  ***",
