 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Correspondence of Charles Darwin is making available, for the first time, full, authoritative texts, edited according to modern textual principles and practices, of all the extant, known letters written and received by Charles Darwin.  Darwin's correspondence, because it is so rich in information about his life and work, is a prime source for understanding the intellectual revolution in which he was the central figure.  As is well known from his publications, Darwin was a great questioner, observer, experimenter, and synthesizer, and his letters illustrate these capacities in abundant detail.  They also reveal how he went about his work and, what does not appear in his publications, his doubts and anxieties, his false starts and disappointments.  The letters concerned with his research reveal the extraordinary extent of Darwin's relationships with other scientists and informants--relationships that constitute a remarkable intellectual network among the leading scientists of the nineteenth century--and in the aggregate they give striking evidence of the how heavily Darwin relied upon correspondence to complete his research.  The Correspondence has a wide audience, including historians of science, biologists, geologists, philosophers, scholars of the nineteenth century, and general readers, for whom are brought together materials now widely dispersed among scattered repositories.",
