 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deicing  is  an  important problem  for  operating  aircraft  fleets  and space shuttle under cold environments.   Deicing  from  power lines, flood gates in dams and bridge piers  are  important  for  avoiding power outrages and floods;  deicing  from  airfields,  roads, and vehicles is important  in  both  civilian and defense sectors.       The  aim of this proposal is to understand the physical  mechanisms  that  govern the adhesion of ice  to  structural  surfaces, and subsequently, to tailor the microstructure  of  the  interfacial  region which will  result  in  the  lowest  possible  interface  strength.  The microstructure  will  be  modified  by  using  new  type of  hydrophobic  coatings  of  varying  internal structures and thickness, by using surface  contaminants,  by  changing the roughness of  the  substrate  surface  which  besides  affecting  the  interface  strength  through  modification of the ice layer grain-size, can  also  lead  to entrapment of flaws at the ice/structure interface.  The  effect  of  time and temperature on the above  strength  will  also be studied.  The ice/structure interface strength  will  be  measured  by adapting a recently  developed  laser  spallation    experiment.    The   proposed   research    is  multidisciplinary  in  nature as it involves  use  of  novel  experimentation  (laser,  optics,  materials  science,  wave  mechanics), surface science concepts and development of  new  type  of  hydrophobic coatings based on SAMS (Self Assembled  Monolayer  System) technology developed  in  the  fields  of  chemistry and polymeric sciences.",
