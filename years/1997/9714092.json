 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Oak Lake Field Station (South Dakota) State  University) is a 570 acre facility located in the  prairie pothole region of the Northern Glaciated Plains.  This station provides a unique setting to support long-  term research and instruction for topics on northern  prairie ecosystems.  Unusual soil types, glaciated land  forms and naive prairie vegetation together with field  station facilities provide opportunities The Oak Lake  Field Station has experienced continued growth of programs  and utilization (3,700) user-days per year and growing)  over its brief eight year history.  Facility and equipment  challenges have been generated from increased research and  instructional emphases in prairie ecology, limnological  studies of prairie potholes and assessment of hands-on,,  inquiry-based environmental  education materials.  These  challenges demonstrate a need to establish a research and  instructional science agenda and strategic management plan  to support future use of the site.    The objectives of this planning effort are to (1) define a  science agenda (research and instruction)for the Oak Lake  Field Station, (2) identify facility and equipment needs  to support expanded scientific efforts, (3) establish  collaborative working relationships with programs at other  biological field stations, (4) establish communication  with other field stations for the exchange of research  data and instructional materials and (5) develop a  strategic plan and cost estimates for proposed changes  in the  facility to be used in subsequent funding requests  for field station programs.  These objectives  will be addressed through a combination of interactive  workshops and intensive design efforts over a two year  period.  Information developed from these planning efforts  will be used to develop support for station renovations  and guide management for the next 510 years.  The final  product of this two year effort will be a strategic  management plan to support objectives defined within a new  science  agenda.    This planning effort will enhance the capabilities of the  Oak Lake Field Station to support regional and national  science efforts in prairie ecosystems. These capabilities  will be evident from enhanced facilities (housing), field  laboratory, supporting equipment) and implementation  of collaborative research and instructional programs  within the next few years.  Field station directors and  faculty at other institutions will become aware of  environments and facilities at the Oak Lake Field Station.  This increased awareness will enhance interbiome research  and learning activities for a broad group of scientists  and students interested in prairie environments.",
