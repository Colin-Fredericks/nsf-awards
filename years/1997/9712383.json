 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last few years has seen a dramatic growth of interest in the  application of computer-aided interactive proof checking.  The  technology underlying interactive proof checking has improved as  a result of developments in theorem proving and model checking.  There is also a growing awareness of the risks of digital  hardware and software systems, the increasing complexity of these  systems, and the greater exposure to security threats.    Interactive proof checking is still not an effective tool in the  hands of nonspecialists because of the lack of insightful  explanations from both failed and successful proof attempts.  The  main problem addressed by this project is that of reconciling the  development and maintenance of proofs with the presentation of  proofs.  The main thesis of this project is that powerful,  appropriate, and transparent automation can improve the  productivity of proof construction and maintenance while  enhancing the value and cogency of the resulting proofs  and counterexamples.  The project will result in the transparent  inference procedures, structured and readable proof  presentations, and automated support for counterexample  generation.",
