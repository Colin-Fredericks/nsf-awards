 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615209  Wilson  This award is for support for a one year study to further  test the use of bacteria preserved in permafrost, as  indicators of paleoclimate at the time the sediments were  deposited and frozen.  Changes in climate, especially major  ones, are thought to be recognizable in the bacterial  fingerprints of the sediment layers.  A one year pilot  project was conducted in which drilling was performed and  cores were collected at a number of sites in the McMurdo Dry  Valleys region of Antarctica.  Viable bacteria and bacterial  products (methane and enzymes) were found in the cores.  The  ice content of all samples was unexpectedly high (at least  25% and up to over 50%).  These results provide strong  support to the idea that Martian permafrost may contain  ground ice and that ancient permafrost on Mars may contain  samples-possibly viable-of life forms from an earlier,  wetter period.  Continued analyses of the existing core  samples will be undertaken in this project",
