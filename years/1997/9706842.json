 "awd_abstract_narration": "9107990     Zumbrun    Kevin Zumbrun proposes several projects originating   from fluid dynamics.  These concern structure and   stability of interfacial solutions arising in singular   limit problems, specifically SHOCK WAVES and PHASE   BOUNDARIES.  Stability is a central topic in shock   wave theory, connected with such issues as physical   admissibility of hyperbolic waves, convergence of   difference schemes, and the inviscid limit problem.    Zumbrun proposes to study a variety of related questions,   from stability of  multidimensional viscous shock waves   in compressible Navier-Stokes equations to physical   significance of oscillatory shock layers in a nonlocal,   dispersive sedimentation model. The planned methods of   analysis include, among others,  pointwise, Green's   function techniques which have proved to be useful in   other situations of delicate stability, spectral analysis   using matrix perturbation theory, and Evans function   techniques borrowed from the study of reaction diffusion   fronts.  Likewise, structure of phase boundaries is a   central topic in the study of phase transitions.  In the   limit of zero transition layer thickness, Cahn-Hilliard   models for phase transition reduce to idealized minimal   surface problems, and the phase boundaries to minimal   surfaces.  This link is a rich source of intuition,   suggesting new problems in both the geometry and pde   setting.  Zumbrun proposes several of these for study,   most notably the regularity of \"Neumann\" solutions   for the minimal surface problem.  The planned method   of analysis is by a combination of pde and geometric   measure theory techniques.    The behavior and structure of interfaces is a topic  of basic physical interest, as the organizing principle   for a variety of effects seen in nature.  For example,   soap bubbles are well known to form minimum interfacial   energy structures identified by the property that they   have minimal surface area.  These are also STABLE under   small perturbations , by the principle that systems move   always toward lower-energy states, in this case back toward  the minimal energy configuration.  At the same time, the    large-scale distribution of matter in the visible universe   seems to have a similar structure, with vast voids surrounded   by  thin layers of galaxies. Apparently, we live on an   interface--evidently, also, the minimization of quite   different energies can lead to similar structure through a   common mathematical mechanism.  The examples given above  are just two  instances of the interfaces known as  PHASE   BOUNDARIES.   Other important interfaces are SHOCK WAVES,   or moving boundaries separating substances of very different   properties (most usually, a \"front\" separating air of very   different temperature or pressure).  Like phase boundaries,   these are ubiquitous in nature, from sonic booms to \"waves\"   of concentration in a chemical reaction.  Again, it is   stability or instability that determines whether a particular  shock structure will persist or break up.   The mathematics   governing stability of  interfaces is rather subtle and is   by no means completely understood.  Indeed, the projects   proposed by Zumbrun concern basic theoretical questions   that must be answered before we can confidently pursue   practical applications such as computer modeling of these   phenomena in the variety of settings to which they pertain.",
