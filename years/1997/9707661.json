 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707661    Simon    The spectral analysis of Schrodinger operators with slowly  decaying or ergodic potentials will be studied.  Making use  of recent results of Last-Simon, Kiselev-Last-Simon, and  Jitomirskaya-Last, the project examines fractal properties  of spectral measures and related issues of long time for   quantum dynamics.  A major thrust will be to attempt to extend  to general dimension the ideas, techniques, and results  developed for one-dimensional systems.  Among open questions  which will be examined is the existence of   mixed singular continuous and absolutely continuous spectra  in explicit models.    Spectral analysis of differential operators has been a major  theme of twentieth century analysis and theoretical physics.  Recent studies have shown that potentialities that were allowed  by classical works of Weyl, Titchmarsh, Hartman, and Wintner  not only occur, but are not pathological as was suggested  by these classical works.  Links were made with ideas of   chaos science, particularly with notions of Hausdorff dimension.  It is proposed to study these ideas further, to extend them from  the model one space dimension of earlier works to physically  relevant three dimensions,  and to explore the consequences for  the long-time dynamics of quantum systems.",
