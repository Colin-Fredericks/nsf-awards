The base alloy has a composition of  Ti-48at%Al.  To this stoichiometry, additions of the ternary  elements V, Nb, Cr, Mo, Mn, and Fe are added.  Initially the  work concentrates on the V, Cr, and Mn series from row four  of the periodic table.  By utilizing the University of  Vanderbilt's undercooling, rapid quench technology, unique  nonequilibrium microstructures are formed that should help  clarify present confusion regarding the site preferences of  ternary additions to gamma TiAl.  The rapidly cooled, splat-  quenched samples are analyzed using optical microscopy, X-  ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy  and  analytical electron microscopy.  By employing ALCHEMI to  compare the non-equilibrium microstructures of undercooled  and rapidly quenched TiAl ternary alloys with equilibrium  conditions, the site occupation of the ternary elements can  be characterized as a function of Ti/Al stoichiometry.  %%%  Knowledge of the influence of ternary atom additions on the  unit cell structure is critical to the understanding of the  atomic mechanisms responsible for improved  mechanical  properties observed in the Ti-Al 48at% ternary alloys.  The  high cooling rate, solid-state transformations explored in  this research give some insights onto other nonequilibrium  processes such as those found in the heat-affected zones of  welded alloys.  ***",
