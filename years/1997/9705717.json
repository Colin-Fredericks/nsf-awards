 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705717  Elimelech  This is an award to support research on colloid-facilitated  transport of contaminants in groundwater aquifers.  Objectives of  the project are to develop a theoretical model for release of  colloidal particles from porous media of groundwater aquifers and  to conduct experiments to evaluate the model's constituent  hypothesis that colloid release from chemically heterogeneous  porous media surfaces following reductions in ionic strength is  controlled by colloid to colloid interactions rather than by  interactions between colloids and grain mineral. The experiments  will be conducted using laboratory columns packed with porous  media having varied ratios of clean and surface modified grains  using well-defined colloidal suspensions.    Results of this project are expected to improve our basic  understanding of the mechanisms that control the transport and  mobility of colloids in groundwater.  This knowledge can be  directly applied to engineering design of systems for  decontamination of groundwater and may have broader significance  in improving design and operation of filtration processes,  chromatographic separations and other processes that involve  separation of particles from fluids in which they are suspended.  ***",
