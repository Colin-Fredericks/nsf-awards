 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to an organization called Women in Endocrinology provides   funds to help support travel to beginning women endocrinologists who are   presenting their work at the annual meetings of the Endocrine Society.  By   having a small but stable base helping to defray travel costs for these young   investigators, the organization will increase the participation of women in the   main annual event in this field.  It provides an excellent opportunity to enhance   the human resource infrastructure by increasing accessibility to a major scientific   meeting by young women, particularly from under-represented groups, to   establish important professional contacts, and the emphasis is on supporting   young researchers, rather than clinicians, in line with NSF's mission of   supporting basic research.  The organizers have planned to use the NSF   contribution to leverage increasing matching funds from other sources for future   years.     This award will have a substantial impact on the career development of the   many young women who receive the assistance, to become known as active   basic researchers in this important and growing field.",
