 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent   Systems (LIS) initiative. It is concerned with learning that is   incremental in nature, resulting in skills that improve over time.  Such   learning is responsible for the development of perceptual   discriminations, stimulus associations, and motor skills, and is seen in   both humans and animals.  The goal of the research is a systems-level   neural theory of incremental learning.  The project combines computer   simulations with neurophysiological recording from the brains of   behaving rats and monkeys, functional magnetic resonance imaging in   humans, and robotic implementation. It is known that many parts of the   mammalian brain contribute to incremental learning.  Although the cortex   may play a central role, other brain areas known to make vital   contributions include the basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala, and   cerebellum.  It is important to understand the roles of these various   areas and their interactions with each other during learning.   Experimental work to be performed includes recording from various areas   of the brains of rats and monkeys during learning and imaging the brains   of humans performing analogous tasks.  Models of neural function will be   developed based on the monkey experiments and will be implemented on a   mobile robot.  These implemented models will allow the training of the   robot, and a comparison of the learning that takes place with that   observed in humans and animals.  The development of theories of   incremental learning will provide a better understanding of how the   process occurs and may result in improved approaches to the development   of skills in both humans and machines.",
