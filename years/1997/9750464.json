 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to enhance student understanding of computer science. This goal is being achieved by instilling in students an appreciation for the conceptual links between the principles and techniques of the varied areas within computer science.  In particular, the project is designed to (1) integrate courses to present material within the context of the  discipline as a whole, (2) design courses to focus student learning on realistic projects that demonstrate a synergism of concepts and techniques from multiple areas within computer science, and (3) deliver the content and projects of the upper-division curriculum through a medium that supports collaborative team learning.    Many current approaches to undergraduate curricula seem to encourage students' misperception of computer science as a loosely linked collection of technical topics.  Students do not experience, and often fail to appreciate, the synergetic integration of topics that occurs during the analysis, design, and implementation of practical computer science applications.  *",
