 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615228  Luzzi    An opportunity exists to carry out a basic investigation of  the relationship between interfacial structure and diffusion  along interfaces in intermetallic alloys.  The  crystallographically sharp twin-like and fault interfaces  found in the lamellar structure of the technologically  important intermetallic compound TiAl provide a model system  which is ideal for such a study.  The structure of the  interfaces in this alloy system allow high-resolution  electron microscopy (HREM) analysis to be used to study the  location of atoms.  Together with high resolution  compositional analysis, electron energy loss spectroscopy,  and theoretical atomistic modeling, the location of solute  atoms on well-characterized interfaces in TiAl are  determined.  Large crystals of the lamellar TiAl are grown  by optical float zone processing.  High temperature  Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy experiments measure  the time for penetration of the solute atoms along the  interfaces at various temperatures through a thin film.  Incorporation of the results of the HREM analysis allows the  interface diffusion coefficients and activation energies to  be calculated via a Hwang-Balluffi analysis as a function of  interface structure and diffusion direction.  Theoretical  studies are tied to the experimental program through the  determination of minimum energy interfacial structures by  molecular statics calculations employing potentials that  include the directional character of bonding in TiAl.  An  important aspect of the theoretical studies is the  development of these potentials.  The diffusion properties  at the interface are investigated through a detailed  analysis of vacancy configurations within and near the  interfaces and vacancy migration energies.  The results of  this theoretical analysis are correlated with the  experimental measurements to develop a clearer understanding  of the atomic level diffusion processes on interfaces.  This  research program which combines synergistic expe rimental and  theoretical studies provides an excellent vehicle for  graduate education in which the students will be immersed in  in-depth experimental or theoretical investigations and will  be continuously exposed to the complementary approach.  %%%  Intermetallic alloys are candidate materials for high  temperature applications where stability of structure is  important.  This research should provide increased  understanding of the influence of structure on diffusion of  alloying elements.  ***",
