 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Michigan has been selected as one of ten recipients of the National Science Foundation's Recognition Awards for the Integration of Research and Education.  The university has recognized the importance of engaging students in research experiences early in their undergraduate careers.  The university has begun to implement an institution-wide change process by focusing on female and minority students, two groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering.  Through collaborative research with faculty and graduate students and through the creation of living/learning/research communities, first and second year students are electing to become and remain science majors in increasing numbers.  The university's efforts to integrate research and education were designed with specific outcomes in mind: increasing the diversity of participants in science and engineering through to graduation; building coherent and lasting communities of students engaged in group inquiry experiences; and increasing student confidence, performance, and career aspirations.  The university has achieved noteworthy success in attaining these goals.  The university is being awarded $500,000 with the goal of expanding, documenting, and disseminating its exemplary practices over the coming three years.  Plans for the use of the award funds include: expanding the linkages between the undergraduate research program and the Women in Science Residential Program to extend research experiences into the third and fourth undergraduate years; evaluating the newly expanded activities; creating and distributing a handbook for other institutions seeking to establish undergraduate research programs; workshops for teams from other institutions; developing Web sites; presentations at professional society meetings; and publication of articles in peer-reviewed journals.",
