 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made to plan and conduct a workshop on `Planning, Design, Management, and Control of Transportation Systems.`  Changing requirements for transportation in a climate of constrained resources, environmental sensitivity and growing demand; increasing capabilities in new technology, telecommunications and control, and computer simulation; and evolving future requirements of the transportation professional workforce indicate the importance of holding this workshop in the near future.  The workshop will convene some of the current and future leaders in transportation research, practice and education to identify areas where the generic science base necessary for the planning, design, management and control of multimodal transportation systems is inadequate (or not sufficiently related to applications); articulate a set of research and education topics that NSF can consider as recommendations consistent with its mission of advancing the progress of science and engineering; identify, develop, and relate knowledge bases to practical transportation applications; and stimulate collaboration of research professionals across the modern and traditional disciplinary lines.  The workshop will focus on three major topics:  5) intelligent planning and design of transportation systems; 2) real-time management, learning, and control for transportation systems; and 3) interdisciplinary education in transportation systems.  Approximately 40 representatives of industry, academia and government will participate.  Attendees will include a diversity of individuals who can provide the interdisciplinary expertise necessary to define the generic science base and research and education topics that will define planning, design, management and control of multimodal transportation systems in the coming decade.  The workshop will include keynote speakers from government, industry, academia, and one invited from Europe.  The outcome of the workshop will be a report that will be widely distributed.",
