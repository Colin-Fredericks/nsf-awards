 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712489  Economy  The broad based objectives of this GOALI project ( co-funded  by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities of MPS) are primarily to pursue  new and improved activated carbons for removal of  environmental contaminants and second to explore the design  of novel catalytic  systems which are based on activated  carbons.  This will be a collaborative effort between the  University of Illinois and 3M Corporation with the end goal  being the scale-up and commercialization of these materials.  It will include a 3-month sabbatical stay by a 3M researcher  in Professor Economy's laboratory.  Several other companies  have also expressed interest and may participate.  The  objectives are focused on the following three themes: 1)  continued research and development of the activated carbon  on a glass fiber substrate with emphasis on tailoring the  pore size and shape and pore surface chemistry for selective  removal of impurities from both air and water, 2) use of  activated carbon fibers as catalysts and catalyst substrates  based on some very recent observations in our laboratory and  3) to provide developmental quantities of these fibers for  evaluation by our industrial partners.  %%%  This work is in the area of polymer-based  carbonaceous materials for activated catalytic  systems of applicability to environmental  solutions.  ***",
