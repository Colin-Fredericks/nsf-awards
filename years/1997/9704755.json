The conference has been jointly sponsored by the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University, Rice University and the University of Houston. The conference is designed to enhance both the educational and the research atmosphere of the community of Texas geometers and topologists. The conference has three specific goals: to bring researchers of national and international statue to Texas to discuss their research and to interact with mathematicians from Texas and surrounding states; to make it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from Texas and surrounding states to meet and share mathematics on a regular mathematics; to contribute to the development of graduate students and young faculty in geometry and topology.      4",
