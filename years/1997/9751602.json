 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this proposal is to move our current laboratory experience for the era of \"brass-instrument\" technology to computer-controlled, virtual experimental instrumentation.  The goal of this project is to use the advanced computerized and multimedia technologies to provide students with the following three learning experiences:       1.  direct laboratory research experience or interactive laboratory demonstrations to the largest number and broadest range of our student population;       2.  instruction for all of our students in modern research skills, including computer-controlled research design, implementation, and data acquisition and analysis; and       3.  laboratory experiences in a wider range of areas than we currently offer, e.g., cognitive neuroscience, learning, perception, cognition, human factors, cross-cultural psychology.       In order to provide these experiences, we will develop a laboratory  complex consisting of a central laboratory/classroom, three specialized  satellite laboratories, and a portable two-way audio/visual system that allows teleconferencing any lab with any appropriately wired classroom.  These laboratories will be used by three types of courses:  (1) dedicated laboratory courses, (2) large theater-style classes which, through the distance-teaching technologies, will expose students to interactive laboratory demonstrations  conducted in the specialized satellite laboratories.       It is expected that the added hands-on training provided by this instrumentation and the proposed curricular changes will enhance students' compentecies in conducting social science also expected that students will gain deeper appreciation for the theories, findings, and applications of psychology and science more generally.",
