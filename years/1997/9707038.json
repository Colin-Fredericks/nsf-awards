 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Dynamics Program supports Professor Wesley G. Bentrude, of   the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah, for his studies of   free radical and photochemical reactions of organophosphorus systems.    Professor Bentrude is exploring the use of three-coordinate phosphorus   molecules as traps for biradical intermediates and the selective   diversion and functionalization of free radical intermediates through new   uses of phosphoranyl radical chemistry.  Fundamental aspects of the   influence of electronic structure on the efficiencies of   triplet-sensitized intramolecular photorearrangements of allyl phosphite   triesters, cyclization and fragmentation reactions of radical cations of   three-coordinate phosphorus molecules, and the radical pair vs. concerted   nature of the photo-Arbuzov rearrangement are also under investigation.  With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Wesley G.   Bentrude, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah,   studies the chemistry of phosphorus-containing molecules.  Such compounds   are found in a number of important settings, with practical applications   as antioxidants, fuel additives, and antitumor and antiviral agents, and   are also key intermediates in a number of biochemical transformations.    Through the discovery of new reactions of phosphorus-containing molecules   and elucidation of the pathways by which these reactions occur, Professor   Bentrude contributes to our fundamental understanding of the chemistry of   these important compounds.",
