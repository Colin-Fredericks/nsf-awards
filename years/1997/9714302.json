These  hyperthermophiles are the most closely related to the universal ancestor  for all life (from small subunit rRNA and gene duplication data) which  supports the theory that life arose in highly reduced, high temperature  environments such as those encountered at hydrothermal vent systems.  Recently scientists  proposed a mechanism for the synthesis of the first  molecules for life in which pyrite can be synthesized abiotically with  hydrogen as a product, laying the framework for the evolution of the  first metabolic cycles. The central hypothesis of this study maintains  that the abiotic synthesis of pyrite provides the essential properties  for sequestering the energy sources for chemoautotrophic metabolism of  the deepest lineages of life. Drs. Luther and Reysenbach believe that  under an extreme chemical and physical environment microorganisms can  utilize the resources provided on the pyrite surfaces for sustained  metabolism. They also believe that these organisms will closely represent  early life forms that may have occupied similar extreme habitats.  Furthermore, since molecular phylogenetic evidence exists that the  deepest of these thermophilic lineages inhabit iron and sulfidic-rich  environments at deep-sea hydrothermal vents, they are well-positioned to  test these assertions.   The objective of this research are: 1. To  establish whether pyrite and the associated adsorbed trace metals and  simple inorganic molecules will mediate the microbial community structure  in high temperature aquatic environments. 2. To determine whether pyrite  synthesi s can be predicted, through the simultaneous measurement of FeS  and hydrogen sulfide. This project clearly addresses most of the primary  mandates of the LExEn research program. In this interdisciplinary study  these collaborators will integrate molecular genetic approaches with in  situ geochemistry to study the diversity, ecology, and evolutionary  history of the microorganisms thriving in extreme habitats where intense  redox and temperature gradients exist.  This project is cooperatively supported by the Divisions of Ocean Science  and Chemistry, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the  Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate",
