 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, directed by Assistant Professor Luis A. Colon at   SUNY-Buffalo, is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry   Program in the Division of Chemistry.  The work will use sol-gel   technology to synthesize chemically bonded stationary phases for use with   chromatographic methods, particularly high performance liquid   chromatography (HPLC) and electrochromatography in open and packed   columns.  The incorporation of the desired functional groups into the   sol-gel reagents during the fabrication of the silica will create Si-C   bonds that do not undergo hydrolysis and provide a material that is   multilayered.  These characteristics are especially promising for solving   the existing problem of suitable packing and surfaces for separations at   high pH. Studies will be done of the variables affecting the chemical   reactions involved in the glass formation process.  A number of   techniques (ESCA, SIMS, FTIR and others) will be used to examine the   physicochemical properties of the glasses, followed by examination of the   chromatographic performance.  The overall objective is to correlate the   processing parameters, the material characteristics and the separation   performance.  Liquid chromatographic methods are powerful techniques to separate   complex mixtures of compounds into their individual constituents.  The   purpose of this work is to provide an entirely new way to synthesize the   materials upon which the separation takes place.  Applications of such   separations are wide-spread in areas such as environmental analysis,   pharmaceutical analysis, and many others.  The focus of the project is to   make materials with properties superior to those now available.",
