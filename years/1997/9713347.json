This 1997 Symposium built on the major new themes initiated in the 1996 Symposium: 1) enabling minority-serving faculty to present papers on strategies for increasing the number of CISE-discipline students from underrepresented populations and to share these topics with representatives from major research universities, and 2) providing for significant participation by students, giving them valuable experience in presenting research papers and providing for their involvement in graduate study workshops.  Participants were chosen by a selection committee following submission of their papers.  A Conference Proceedings is being published containing all of the papers presented at the conference.",
