 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns equational reasoning, with emphasis on  word and unification problems. The investigation comprises  graphs, congruence closure and equational unification, along  with further development of these topics, and combinations  of these topics. The objective is to develop new  decidability and complexity results, and to design and  implement efficient algorithms.  The approach to word  problems will use the rewriting paradigm, concentrating on  procedures and data structures for computing  complete/canonical sets of rewrite rules.  In particular,  the method using SOUR graphs for completing rewrite systems  will be investigated, particularly the way in which SOUR  Graphs can be used to develop procedures for solving the  word problem in certain classes of theories.  The first part of the research will be to examine the  procedure in its simplest form, on string rewriting systems.  Once methods are developed to solve the word problem in its  simplest form, those methods will be moved back into pure  equational logic, and finally into full first order  equational logic.  For ground equational theories, the plan is to investigate  techniques for computing congruence closures based on the  rewriting paradigm developed in studying Shostak's  congruence closure method.  Applications to combinations of  decision procedures will be investigated.  The relationship  between the congruence closure method and SOUR graphs will  be investigated and exploited.  In unification, the concentration is on semantic  unification, where some of the function symbols have  semantics associated with them, usually specified in the  form of an equational theory.  The main focus of the  applications is automated reasoning and symbolic  computation.  E-unification problems arising in process  algebra. Knowledge representation and constraint solvers  will also be investigated.  Both theoretical and practical  issues will be studied: (1) on the theoretical side,  decidability and complexity issues on various eq uational  unification and disunification problems will be investigated-  --this is a continuation of work done over the past several  years; (2) on the practical side, the goal is to come up  with efficient algorithms along with fast implementations,  making use of heuristics. Implementations will be  incorporated into the Unification Workbench, a library of  unification algorithms.",
