 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and   Education (POWRE) program for the research and educational activities of   Professor Cynthia McClure of Montana State University is supported by   funds provided by the National Institutes of Health through interagency   transfer to NSF.  The research enabled by the POWRE award aims at a new   synthetic methodology for production of nitrogen heterocycles of   biomedical significance.  Professor McClure, an established researcher in   organophosphorus chemistry, will undertake exploratory study of the   oxa-di-pi-methane photochemical rearrangement of a series of aza-bicyclic   systems, with a view to using the reaction as a method for constructing   the ring system that is present in a number of pyrrolizidine and   indolizidine alkaloid structures. Many of these alkaloids exhibit potent   antibiotic and anti-tumor properties.  The opportunity afforded through the POWRE program will enhance Professor   McClure's research and leadership potential and her educational mentoring   of undergraduate and graduate students.",
