 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports study of the Zapotec language spoken  in San Lucas Quiavin, Oaxaca, Mexico (and by immigrants to  the Los Angeles area), a language that is gradually losing  speakers and thus threatened with eventual extinction. The  project will produce the most extensive dictionary of any  Zapotec language, along with a text collection and  theoretical accounts of the language's syntax, morphology,  phonology, and phonetics. Like other Zapotec languages, San  Lucas Quiavin Zapotec (SLQZ) has an unusual phonological  structure, with fortis/lenis consonant contrasts and a  complex syllable template. Up to three vowels, individually  specified as breathy, creaky, checked (glottal), or plain  (modal), may occur in the \"vowel complex\" of a single  syllable; contrasting tone patterns appear to be predictable  from the sequence of vowel types in a vowel complex. SLQZ  verbs display considerable paradigmatic complexity: for  example, there are six basic verbal aspects, which may be  inflected for eighteen different combinations of person,  number, and formality features. The language has verb-  subject-object word order. Data will be collected from  speakers both in Los Angeles and in Oaxaca. The first year  of the project will focus on SLQZ morphophonology and  syntax, especially verb structure. The second year will  address the phonetics of SLQZ, developing rules for the  realization of surface tone. Work on the dictionary and text  collection will continue throughout the project.   Publications resulting from the grant will provide an  important resource for general linguistic theory, for the  study of the relationships among the different Zapotecan  languages, and for the SLQZ people. Results will be produced  in as accessible a format as possible, to provide resources  for the development of literacy materials for users at all  levels.",
