 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704712  Jennings  The objective of the proposed project is to develop the Arkansas  Center for Membrane Biology at the University of Arkansas for  Medical Sciences (UAMS). The rationale for choosing membrane  biology for development is that expertise in the study of  membrane receptors, transporters, and channels will complement  and augment several existing basic research strengths at UAMS,  including neuroscience, glycobiology, endocrinology, virology,  and toxicology. The Chancellor and the Dean of the College of  Medicine at UAMS have made a major commitment to building in this  area with the hiring in 1995 of the P.I. of this proposal,  Michael L. Jennings, as Chairman of the Department of Physiology   and Biophysics. Newly renovated laboratory space and salary lines  to hire six faculty (three new positions and three replacements)   have been provided to Dr. Jennings. Two additional faculty  recently hired with adjunct appointments in Physiology and  Biophysics will also contribute importantly to the critical mass   of investigators in membrane biology. NSF EPSCoR funds are  requested to enhance the equipment startup packages for new  faculty and to support core facilities that are needed for  competitive research in membrane biology.             Development of the Center will focus on two themes. The first is  the regulation of function of membrane receptors for hormones and  neurotransmitters. There are currently four members of this  group, with one established investigator, Lawrence E. Comett. The  others are George T. Blevins, Jr., Richard C. Kurten, and Dana  Gaddy-Kurten, all of whom study different aspects of peptide  hormone receptors. Dr. Blevins has been Assistant Professor for  three years; Drs. Kuden and Gaddy-Kurten were hired as Assistant  Professors in August, 1996. Two additional faculty will be hired  in this area.         The other group of investigators will use biophysical approaches  to study membrane transport and electrophysiology.  The nucleus of  this group consists of M.L. Jennings, Gerald Dienel, and Z. Jimmy  Zhou. Dr. Dienel was hired as Associate Professor in April, 1996,  and Dr. Zhou was hired as Assistant Professor in August, 1996.  Two additional faculty will be hired in the area of transport  biophysics and electrophysiology. The two areas of focus  (receptors and biophysics) will not be isolated from each other;  there will be constant interaction between the groups, and the  faculty to be hired will very likely have interests that overlap  both groups.         EPSCoR funds are requested for the purchase of equipment and the  support of core facilities that will enhance the competitiveness  of the target faculty: Blevins, Kuden, Gaddy-Kurten, Dienel,  Zhou, and four faculty to be hired. The core facilities are a  molecular biology laboratory, a transgenic mouse facility, and  computer facility for access to DNA sequence data bases. Funds  are also requested for an extensive extramural seminar program,  which will allow faculty to interact closely with leading experts  in membrane biology. Other funds will be used for summer salary  for visiting faculty from neighboring undergraduate institutions  and for stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.         Three major equipment items are requested. The first is a work  station for the laser manipulation of cells (laser scissors and  tweezers), to be used by Drs. Kurten and Gaddy-Kurten to enable  them to select rare cells from a population and to do a variety  of other cellular manipulations. The second item is equipment for  optical imaging of calcium, to be used by Drs. Zhou and Blevins  to quantify the time course and spatial pattern of calcium  release from intracellular stores or entry across the plasma  membrane. The third item is a brain imaging system to be used by  Dr. Dienel and several collaborators for analysis of transport  and metabolism in intact central nervous system. Additional  equipment funds are requested to enhance the startup  packages for  the four additional faculty to be hired.         A plan is in place for the professional development of the  faculty in the Center, including the provision of protected time   for junior faculty, publication goals, and assistance in  preparing grant proposals. The national reputations of faculty  will be developed by participation in national meetings and other  off campus learning experiences; hosting visits by seminar  speakers; presentation of seminars at other institutions; and  participation as peer reviewers of manuscripts and grants. The  goals over the next few years are for individual faculty to  become established investigators with extramural funding, and for  major multi-investigator grants to result from common interests  and complementary expertise among members of the Center.",
