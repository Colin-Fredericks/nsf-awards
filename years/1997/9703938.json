The Vermont Technology Council has established four   Centers of Excellence as part of the state Science and Technology  Plan and funding is provided to help bring three exemplary  research projects from three of these Centers to fruition and  commercialization.  The three projects are 1) utilization of  whey-based edible film technology, 2) development of a reagent  kit and instrumentation for rapid determination of platelet  activation thresholds (of use for various clinical cardiovascular  applications), and 3) development of a thin film blister testing   system for microelectronics manufacturing.  Salary support is  provided for a technology transfer assistant to Dr. Paul Huyffer,  Executive Director of the Vermont Technology Council and recently  appointed University of Vermont Special Assistant for Economic  Development.  Emphasis on facilitating technology transfer is  expected to strengthen partnerships between university  researchers and industry and contribute to economic growth and  development for Vermont.",
