Norman function of tissue (and hence organs) is regulated by  a complex balance between soluble factors, cell-cell  interactions, and cell-matrix interactions.  Understanding  the details of these interactions becomes even more  complicated in organs that accomplish multiple physiological  functions (e.g., the liver).  In these cases, tissue  engineering becomes a valuable means for studying tissue  function and morphogenesis in vitro, and for affecting cell  growth and function in vivo.  The later application includes  the development of bioartificial tissues.  In the specific  case of bioartificial liver development, research efforts  are currently underway to provide the medical community with  alternatives in treating patients with acute liver failure  since less than 4100 (i.e., 4058 in 1996, 3440 in 1993)  liver transplants are performed annually in the United  States, although 50,000 Americans died of liver disease in  1993.  A successful bioartificial liver support system must  at least be able to maintain good hepatocyte function since  hepatocytes are the major parenchymal cells of the liver and  participate in a variety of liver functions including fat,  lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism; protein and bile  production, and chemical detoxification.  Since hepatocytes  are anchorage dependent cells, the use of matrix materials  that are biodegradable and promote attachment, while  simultaneously supporting acceptable levels of cell function  are critical.  Collagen type I and EHS matrix (e.g.,  Matrigel) are two such extracellular matrices (ECMs).  Both  yield good hepatocyte function, yet each promotes a  different cell morphology (planar and aggregated,  respectively).  Consequently, collagen I and EHS matrix are  commonly employed in in vi tro models of the liver.  The  proposed project focuses on the engineering of one  particular liver tissue system - hepatocytes on Matrigel,  and uses the double gel collagen I system is used as a  comparative.  In addition to the formation of aggregates,  Matrigel is of particular interest because its composition  resembles that of the basement membrane.  Of the three  processes that direct cell aggregation (i.e., soluble  factors, cell-cell, and cell-matrix interactions), the  proposed project specifically contrasts aspects of the cell-  matrix interaction, with particular cell-cell interactions.  The governing hypothesis is that cell-matrix interactions  drive early aggregation, while cell-cell interactions  dominate aggregation in time.  In the proposed work, the  physical properties of Matrigel are characterized and the  forces hepatocytes exert on the ECM are quantified  experimentally.  The experimental results are then  implemented in a predictive aggregation model based on the  exerted forces (a cell-matrix parameter), ECM deformability,  the density of the hepatocyte population, and degree of cell-  cell contact (cell-cell parameter).  ***",
