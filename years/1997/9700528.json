 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans  and  robots have need to work together in  factories,  in  nuclear  facilities,  in  space and in  medicine.   To  make  the  interaction  inherently safe, this research is investigating  the  concept  of controlled passive robotic interface.  The  interface  under  study is essentially an arm with only dissipative  (brakes  or  clutches)  or  conservative (transmissions) coupling  between  joints.   No motors are used.  Forces applied at the end  of  the  arm result in motion that can be computer controlled according to  the  purposes  of  the device:  to follow a prescribed  path,  to  restrict access to some regions of the workspace, or to provide a  haptic  display  representing the nature of a virtual  or  remote  environment.    Experiment and analysis will produce a model of the human-machine  interaction.   An  experimental test bed  developed  under  prior  funding will be enhanced to support the current research.  At the  same time a much smaller scale device is planned with a focus  on  haptic  displays,  enabling wider exploration  of  the  range  of  potential applications of the basic concept.  Experiments will be  conducted on the device and on its interaction with a human user.  The   information  transmission  capability  and  the  trajectory  enhancement  capability are two related  aspects  to  be  studied  experimentally  and incorporated into the model  of  interaction.  Theoretical  studies will be conducted to predict the  bounds  on  the performance to be expected with different controllers.",
