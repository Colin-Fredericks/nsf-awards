The  discovery by the PI  of  the  solid-liquid  transition   undergone  by  the  flux  lattice  in  the   cuprate  superconductors spurs investigation more generally among Type  II  superconductors of this phase diagram. Of particular interest are  the  effects  that anisotropy, disorder and thermal  fluctuations  have  on  creating the newly observed vortex liquid  and  related  states  of  the  Type  II superconductor.  The  experiments  will  measure  the temperature and magnetic field dependencies  of  the  linear and nonlinear resistivities which arise by flux motion. In  addition,  the critical currents, and energy barriers (activation  energies) will be measured. The experimental measurement of flux-  flow voltages will cover a very broad voltage dynamic range: sub-  picovolt  to  nanovolt  range  using a  custom-built  SQUID-based  voltmeter,  and from nano to millivolts using state  of  the  art  commercial  voltmeters. The materials to be studied include  both  cuprate  and  conventional layered superconductors. The  proposed  research  will  be  integrated into an  education  plan  to  help  enhance   student  learning  and  to  train  future   scientists,  including members of under-represented minority groups.  %%%  This  CAREER  grant  project  involves  fundamental  experimental  research   on  the  interaction  of  magnetic  fields  with   the  superconducting   state.   It  is  focused   on   the   Type   II  superconductors, which are more tolerant of magnetic  field  than  Type I superconductors, in that magnetic field can penetrate  the  Type II superconductor in the the form of quantized flux lines or  vortices,  without  necessarily destroying  the  zero  resistance  state.  Electrical  resistance, and  therefore  heating  effects,  occur  in Type II superconductors when the current density, exerts  a  sufficiently strong force on the flux lines to cause  them  to  move. This field of research therefore is relevant to the current  handling  capacity  of superconductors in applications  involving  high  currents  and high magnetic fields, such as electric  power  cables and windings in motors or generators. A new phenomenon  in  this  connection, melting or liquid-like motion of the  quantized  flux lines, has been discovered in the past few years in the high  transition   temperature  cuprate  superconductors,   which   are  particularly  promising  for  applications  in  current  carrying  cables.  The  fundamental research carried out  in  this  project  therefore  is  expected to contribute in  the  long  term  to  an  improved  electric  power  technology.  The  research   will   be  integrated  into  an  education plan  to  help  enhance  students  learning  and  to train future scientists, including  members  of  under-represented minority groups.  ***",
