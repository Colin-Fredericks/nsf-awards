 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712538  Shapiro  This is an award for Research at Undergraduate Institutions  (RUI).  The principal investigator will be utilizing high  performance computers to conduct molecular dynamics  simulations of cluster-surface and ion-surface interactions.  Specific topics will include: the evolution of incident ion  trajectories in solid targets following the impact of very  energetic clusters; the consequences of intermediate to high  energy cluster bombardment (damage, electronic excitation,  sputtering); cluster emission from targets following ion and  cluster bombardment, with emphasis on the relationship  between the statistics of sputtering events and cluster  emission; the utility of cluster beams to desorb material  for mass spectograph studies; the charge state properties of  energetic cluster components traversing thin targets; the  use of both low and high energy cluster beams for  micromachining.  Research will be carried out in  collaboration with the Basic and Applied Physics Group at  Caltech and with the Le Beyec Group at Orsay.  The goals of  the research are to extend the fundamental understanding of  cluster-surface interactions; to guide future experimental  research; and, to involve promising undergraduate students  in research.  %%%  This grant will support research at a predominantly  undergraduate institution.  The research involves computer  simulations of clusters of atoms and charged ions striking  surfaces of materials.  These type of interactions are  important for materials processing, materials wear and for  understanding fundamental aspects of surfaces.  The research  will involve undergraduate students and involves  collaborations with groups at Caltech and Orsay in France.  ***",
