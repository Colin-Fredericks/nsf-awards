Professor Buntrock  will work with Dr. Terunobu Fujimori, Professor of the  Center for Collaborative Research and of the Institute of  Industrial Science at the University of Tokyo, on a research  project entitled, \"Studying Post-Fordist Manufacturing and  its Exploitation by Architects.\"    Post-Fordism - identified by increased flexibility,  adaptability, and efficiency in the manufacturing process  that allows for variable control in production output - has  evolved by and large outside North America, and as such its  implications for architectural practice are not presently  understood by North American architectural professionals.  As systems of flexible production developed in Japan much  earlier than they did in North America, it is possible to  project opportunities for North American architects to  exploit Post-Fordist techniques by studying the manner in  which architects, contractors, and manufacturers work in  tandem in Japan.  The proposed research will explore the  process of innovation in Japan that occurs between  architects, contractors, and manufacturers and will compare  the relative effectiveness of this interaction with that  which is now occurring in the United States.  The goal of  the research is to obtain insights into the Post-Fordist  manufacturing process that will provide immediate and useful  advantages to the United States.  ***",
