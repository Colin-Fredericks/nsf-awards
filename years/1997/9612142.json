 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences will continue  to administer the conference series known as the NSF/CBMS  Regional Research Conferences.  In the twenty-eight year history  of this series, a total of 257 such conferences have been held.   Under its cooperative agreement with NSF, CBMS solicits proposals  for individual conferences, organizes a panel review for the  proposals, and oversees the publication of the monographs.    The purpose of these conference is to stimulate interest and  activity in mathematical research.  Each five day conference  features a distinguished lecturer who delivers ten lectures on a  topic of important current research in one sharply focussed area  of the mathematical sciences.  The lecturer subsequently prepares  an expository monograph based upon these lectures, which is  normally published as a part of a regional conference  series.  Depending upon the conference topic, the monograph is  published by the American Mathematical Society, the Society for  Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly by the American  Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical  Statistics.  Each conference is funded separately by NSF. Support  for about 30 participants is provided and the conference  organizer invites both established researchers and interested  newcomers, including postdoctoral fellows and graduate students,  to attend.",
