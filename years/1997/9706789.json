 "awd_abstract_narration": "Simon  9706789       The investigator collaborates with Prof. G. Buck, St. Anselm  College, to study knots and their applications.  Knots are closed  loops in space that may be tangled in complicated and essential  ways.  While knots usually have been studied as idealized one  dimensional filaments, the focus here is on \"physical knots,\"  knots made of real physical stuff, from rope to DNA or other  large flexible molecules.  These are modeled as mathematical  knots endowed with physical like properties such as self  repelling energy or thickness.  The twin goals of physical knot  theory are to mathematically model and help understand the real  physical systems, and to use the physically inspired measures of  knot-complexity to develop novel methods for knot recognition and  classification.  The specific targets of this project include:  determining precise relations between different measures of knot  complexity, understanding critical points and the configuration  space of polygonal knots, understanding the connections between  parametrizations and topological properties of harmonic knots,  extending knot energy ideas to other structures such as graphs,  modeling gel electrophoresis of DNA loops, and using knot  energies to help understand physics phenomena such as  self-radiating tubes and knotted vortices.       Knotting and tangling happen at every scale studied by  science, from microscopic DNA loops to everyday rope to tangled  magnetic field loops in the solar corona.  The investigators and  their students will study problems that are fundamental and arise  in all the physical systems:  How are knots and tangles created?  What mathematical properties of the physical systems lead to  knots becoming simplified or completely untangled?  How do the  mathematical properties of different kinds of knots influence  their physical behavior?  One focus task is to gain a better  understanding of gel electrophoresis of DNA loops, hence of the  gel process itself; this is one of the most important  b iotechnology techniques, so a solid understanding is important.  The project requires powerful computing and visualization, so it  will train students, as well as stretch the technology, in these  areas.",
