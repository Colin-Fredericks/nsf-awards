 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sullivan  9727859    The investigator, with his collaborators, studies geometric optimization  problems like finding minimum-energy shapes for surfaces and knots  in space.  This project completes the classification of embedded  constant-mean-curvature surfaces with three ends and extends  these results to greater numbers of ends.  The elastic bending  energy of Willmore is used computationally to drive several different  sphere eversions, and to discover new minimal surfaces in euclidean  and spherical space.  The investigator also studies the singularities  found in minimizers like soap films in higher dimensions; the foams  likely to provide solutions to Kelvin's partioning problem; and  configurations for knots that minimize energy or ropelength.    Many real-world problems can be cast in the form of optimizing some  feature of a shape; mathematically, these become variational problems  for geometric energies.  For instance, the films between cells in a  foam minimize their area and thus are constant-mean curvature surfaces.  Understanding these geometries will lead to better knowledge of important  structural properties of foam materials.  Cell membranes are more  complicated bilayer surfaces, which seem to minimize an elastic bending  energy known mathematically as the Willmore energy.  Knotted curves  achieve an optimal shape when a rope is pulled tight, or if a charged  knotted wire repels itself electrostatically; understanding such  configurations helps explain the behavior of biological molecules like  DNA.  This project explores such phsically natural problems that  are still challenging from both theoretical and computational standpoints.",
