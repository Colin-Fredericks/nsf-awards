 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graves  9714985   The Material Handling Research Colloquium (MHRC) is a biannual event that   attracts the leading researchers in the field, focuses on the current state  of material handling research, and influences future directions for research.  The prime goal of the 1998 MHRC is to enhance its stature as a major international forum that strengthens and broadens communication   between U.S. researchers, both academic and industrial, and their counterparts in Europe and Asia.   A second goal is to increase the participation of the material handling user community of researchers and the site of Motorola Semiconductor and educational facilities in Tempe,   Arizona is expected to assist in this regard.  In addition to Motorola Corporation, the Material Handling Institute, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Louisville, and Penn State University are co-sponsors along with the National   Science Foundation.   Encouraging this MHRC model for research interaction and communication in   the international research community should help to link the U.S. focus on system operations to the European focus on equipment design and the Pacific run focus on controls and intelligent systems.  A successful 1998 MHRC should also see increased numbers of user industry researchers   participating with academies and material handling equipment producer representation.",
