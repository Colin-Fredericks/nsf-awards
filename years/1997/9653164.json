 "awd_abstract_narration": "Courses which satisfy the science requirements for non-science majors at Alfred University are typically unrelated and compartmentalized. Techniques in one science are not exploited and built upon in others. This confusing approach does not efficiently provide Alfred University's students with a general science education so necessary in our society. The current approach also makes science education less attractive as a career.  To address this problem, a new year-long, introductory, interdisciplinary course entitled SCI 123-124: \"How the World Works\", will be taught by the principal investigators. In this course, students will experience the fun and creative side of science, so often missing from traditional disciplinary courses. An overall theme for the course such as \"Living in Space\" or \"Survival on a Greenhouse Planet\" will be provided each year. Beyond this, the course will be designed by the students as they pose questions related to the theme. Their questions will lead to experiments that they will design, perform, and interpret themselves with guidance from their instructors. As they participate in these self- designed activities, students will rediscover the fun of science at the same time that they are learning to think and analyze critically, broadening their scientific and mathematical backgrounds, and appreciating the interrelationships that exist between mathematics and all of the scientific disciplines.                  One of the largest potential impacts of this proposal is its promise for improving teacher preparation.  All students at Alfred are required to take two semesters of science and to also demonstrate mathematics competency.  The PI's expect that this course sequence, Science 123-124 (How the World Works) will be used by most students not majoring in science to satisfy this requirement.  Ninety-five  undergraduates receive degrees in elementary or secondary education from Alfred University each year.  Approximately 30 graduate students are also annually enrolle d in its education programs.  These future teachers of math and science will be learning (hands-on) examples of teaching approaches, investigative experiences, cooperative learning, interdisciplinary perspective, and quantitative analysis, which can be applied to teaching at all grade levels.  These teachers will be scientifically and quantitatively literate, and able to pass that knowledge on to their students.             This course will have an impact on not only the non-science majors taking the course but also on upper level math and science students. Upper level undergraduates majoring in math, science, and/or education will be employed to act as peer mentors to facilitate classroom activities and, in the process, they will learn more about science and the joy of teaching science.",
