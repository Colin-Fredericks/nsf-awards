These investigations rely  on the ability to express, assemble and purify recombinant  phytochromes.  Previous biochemical and genetic studies have  delimited the phytochrome molecule into two major domains, a  highly conserved photosensory domain at the molecule's N  terminus and a C-terminal domain which plays a key role in  the regulatory function of phytochrome.  These two domains  are the focus of these studies.  Experiments outlined in  Part 1 seek to identify specific amino acid residues in the  photosensory domain of phytochrome that are important to  chromophore-protein interactions. These studies will exploit  the techniques of chemical cross-linking, site-directed and  random mutagenesis, and resonance Raman spectroscopy.  These  studies also represent a prelude (and adjunct) to x-ray  crystallographic analysis of phytochrome.  Experiments  outlined in Part II address the hypothesis that phytochrome  functions as a light-regulated enzyme.  The exciting  discovery of phytochrome-related genes in cyanobacteria,  which share structural motifs with higher plant phytochromes  and the transmitter protein kinase family of prokaryotes  within the regulatory domain region, has provided renewed  impetus for testing this controversial theory.  Experiments  seek to establish whether phyto*-chrome is a light-regulated  transmitter kinase and if so, to define the structural basis  for its enzymatic activity.  Parallel studies to test for  biochemical and functional `cross-talk' between eukaryotic  and prokaryotic phytochromes, also outlined in this section,  will provide insight into the evolution of phytochrome  structure and function.    The ability to adjust to changes in their external light  environment is essential to plant survival because, unlike  animals, plants must have sunlight for photosynthesis and  they lack the ability  to move to a more optimum light  environment.  Plants therefore possess light-sensing  molecules which enable them to adapt to suboptimal light  conditions in their environment, one of which is called  phytochrome.  Among the many phenomena mediated by  phytochrome include the induction of seed germination, rapid  stem elongation in response to the shade of neighboring  plants, regulation of the timing of flowering and growth  towards light.  Phytochrome is a protein that contains an  attached pigment which is responsible for its ability to  absorb visible light.  Upon light absorption, phytochrome is  converted to an active form which regulates the course of  plant growth and development.  This work seeks to dissect  the anatomy of the phytochrome molecule and to characterize  the structural features that enable it to convert a light  signal into a chemical signal.  A better understanding of  the mechanism of phytochrome action should lead to novel  approaches to improve plant growth and development.",
