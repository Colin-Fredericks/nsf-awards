 "awd_abstract_narration": "The teaching of scientific principles and practices in psychology is in transition. Although courses such as \"experimental design\" and \"research methods\" are common in undergraduate curricula at many colleges and universities, the wisdom of employing these courses as the only source of science education for psychology majors is open to question at a time when developing scientific competence is thought to be a critical dimension of the undergraduate experience.      One question has to do with how much \"hands-on\" research students actually do in such courses.  A second question pertains to the nature of the research that is done.  Often, the projects that students carry out are canned demonstrations that only tangentially relate to the research currently being done in psychology.      This proposal addresses these issues.  We propose to use microcomputers in a semester-long laboratory course in the cognitive psychology of reasoning and problem solving.  The course will cover the basic theories in this area of psychology.  The laboratory component of the course will run subjects in an effort to reproduce the findings that are expected, a priori, theoretically.  The laboratory component will also provide students with the opportunity to design and carry out their own research projects.      The use of this laboratory and the associated learning experiences will foster understanding and appreciation of the principles of scientific reasoning.  In addition to the knowledge of reasoning and problem solving that students will develop, the laboratory component has been designed to improve students' capability for \"pure\" scientific thinking.    *",
