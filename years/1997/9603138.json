The project involves participation of  two graduate students from Nebraska, who will visit China to  participate in the computation component of the research.    This project proposes to advance work funded under CTS  9413301 to develop a nucleation theory based on statistical  mechanics which would agree with the experimental facts  previously unexplained by other nucleation theories. The  nucleation theory to be developed in this project has  relevance to the formation of hazardous aerosols,  photochemical smog, acid rain and in other areas of  environmental science. The proposed collaboration involves  work on the theoretical aspects of the program at Nebraska,  and work on the computation component of the research in  Beijing. The project will be supported on the Chinese side  by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.",
