 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the School of Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, scientists conduct advanced research on how cells transduce physical stimuli into intracellular signals to alter genomic function, and learn how to control the process of cell proliferation and remodeling for purposes of engineering new tissue constructs.  Typically, the engineering, physical, and life sciences separately investigate cellular systems to understand how cells communicate, adapt to changing conditions, differentiate, and grow.  Critical breakthroughs in cellular engineering occur at the intersection between the life sciences, natural sciences, and engineering; these breakthroughs are facilitated by forming a  multidisciplinary laboratory environment.  Penn is in a unique position to focus the intellectual and infrastructure resource to successfully build a basic research program impacting engineering and the sciences.  With  assistance from the National Science Foundation, the  University will create  the Cellular Engineering Laboratories (CEL) designed to integrate these disciplines and cultivate the knowledge of cellular systems to positively impact national efforts in biotechnology and bioengineering.  The CEL will be created by renovating existing, contiguous research space in the basement of Hayden Hall, a structure that was built in 1896.  Most of the services are original, and are inadequate to support modern research.  Renovations include: the replacement of the electrical power distribution system, installation of a new HVAC system, improvement of temperature and humidity controls, and the provision for proper ductwork  and piping required for the installation of equipment used in tissue culture work.   Cellular Engineering research conducted and dispersed in other buildings will be relocated to the newly renovated area.  This consolidation will expedite interaction between faculty, and provide an interdisciplinary laboratory environment where students from different departments can collaborate.  There is strong support to promote activity in Bioengineering at Penn, and the institution has invested resources to enhance emerging programs with the Biomedical engineering enterprise.  The CEL project, coupled with research space within the Institution for Advanced Science and Technology, and the Institute of Medicine and Engineering, will accommodate faculty and students interested in this emerging field, thus creating a new blend of science and engineering.",
