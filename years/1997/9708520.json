 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708520  O'Melia  This is an award to provide Renewal Support for research  originated under NSF Award No. 91-12766 that dealt with the  theory, measurements and applications relating to the stability  of colloids in aquatic environments.  In the research being  conducted under this award, the investigator plans on refining  and extending the conceptual model developed in prior research to  more complex aquatic systems than were considered in prior  research based on interactions of single Brownian particles with  stationary surfaces.  In the renewal work, the PI will give  special consideration to reversible aggregation and deposition  processes, validate the model experimentally and apply the  theoretical and experimental results to considerations of  particle transport and fate in ground and surface waters.    Results of this research are expected to provide insight and  predictability to the processes by which small particles deposit  and become part of the sediment burden of surface waters and the  processes by which colloids move through groundwater aquifers.  This knowledge is likely to be applied in the engineering design  of processes for removal of particles from suspension in surface  waters and in designing systems for decontamination of  groundwater aquifers.  ***",
