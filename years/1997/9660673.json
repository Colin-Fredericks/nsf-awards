 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore a novel tertiary recycling process as an economical means for recycling scrap automotive plastics and composites.  The goals for the Next Generation Vehicles program require that significant vehicle weight reductions be attained.  Weight reductions will likely involve increased use of engineering plastics and composites that are difficult to recycle using conventional technologies. To address that problem, a more effective process for recycling scrap automotive plastics and composites is needed.  Early development work on a process for recycling scrap aerospace composites and scrap electronics shows that a variety of polymers and composites can be converted into low molecular weight hydrocarbons at temperatures below 200+C.  The hydrocarbons produced can then be reused as chemicals, fuels, or monomers.  Metal, glass, fillers, and fibers are separated from the hydrocarbons during the process and can be reclaimed or landfilled.  Initial laboratory feasibility studies have shown that the a catalytic conversion process is applicable to plastics and composites used in automotive parts.  This process does not require presorting of plastic wastes and allows fibers and fillers to be reclaimed for reuse. This research will study the application of this tertiary recycling technology for recycling of automotive waste plastics and composites with a bench-scale continuous process to identify design issues for the construction of a large-scale demonstration unit in Phase II.       If the research is successful, the recycling process will allow waste automotive plastics and composites currently being landfilled to be converted into valuable hydrocarbons for reuse as chemicals, fuels, or polymers.  Recycling machines based on this process may be scaled to use requirements of large and small cities, government installations, and industrial plastic scrap generators.",
