 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hyperbolic systems of conservation laws play fundamental roles in describing a  wide variety of physical phenomena, including compressible fluid flows,  magnetohydrodynamics, reacting flows, and multiphase flows, among others.  The study of shock wave theory is important because it not only provides a  better mathematical understanding of these complex phenomena, but also  helps to design more robust numerical schemes to solve the underlying  physical problems.    The major difficulty associated with shock wave theory is the discontinuous  feature of the solution due to the nonlinear convection.  For nonlinear systems  understanding the wave interactions are exceedingly hard. Although a great  deal of remarkable results on the existence, stability, uniqueness and  asymptotic behavior of the solution have been obtained, there are still many  challenging open questions for systems and multi-dimensional cases.    The goal of the meeting is to provide an opportunity for young researchers  to learn systematically the recent development in shock wave theory.  The  ultimate goal is to promote more research activities, especially among  colleagues in the southeast region, in this direction. The substantial  expository paper based on the lectures should have significant influence for  future development in this direction.",
