 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program is supporting Prof.   K. Ruedenberg at Iowa State University.  The research to be carried out   over the next two years will focus on the development of a new quantum   chemical theory that will result in corresponding new computational   chemistry codes.  The objective is the quantitative determination of   atoms in molecules within the framework of rigorous ab-initio theory, and   the quantitative expression of binding energies in terms of interactions   between such atoms.  The deformed atoms are determined through their   optimal wave functions in terms of orbitals restricted to the   full-valence-space MCSCF molecular orbital space. Oriented quasiatomic   orbitals,  maximally involved in specific bonds and with unambiguous   electron populations, are determined through a density matrix analysis.    The binding energy appears as the sum of contributions due to   intra-atomic promotion and inter-atomic non-bonded repulsion, electron   sharing and charge transfer.  The energy gain due to charge transfer is   identified by determining the optimal molecular MCSCF wave function   without charge transfer.  The covalent energy gain is derived from the   configurations representing electron migrations between atoms.  The   analysis applies to non-equilibrium as well as to equilibrium  geometries   and will be extended beyond the full valence space.    Although for two centuries chemical experimentation has been effectively   guided by the concept of molecules being built from atoms,  major   unsolved problems have persisted to this day regarding the theoretical   foundation of this well established empirical model and it has not yet   been quantified within the context of rigorous quantum mechanical   calculations.  This is because the atoms-in-molecules concept is, in   fact, not a fundamental one in basic theory. Recently, the Ruedenberg   research group has developed a new analysis that is able to identify   atomic sub-units in rigorous molecular calculations.  With the help of   this theoretical approach, atoms, as well as the interactions between   them, will be quantitatively determined in molecules. The method to be   developed is expected to make the results of theoretical computations   more useful for practical chemical work by relating them more directly to   the intuitive reasoning of experimentalists.",
