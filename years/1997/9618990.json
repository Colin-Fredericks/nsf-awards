 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618990  DiRanna    This project sponsored by WestEd - formerly the Far West Laboratory  will carry out a four-year project which will prepare Middle School  Teachers to implement exemplary science materials in the Middle  School classroom.  Altogether, 100 schools will participate in the  program and will select two teachers who will be prepared by the  project to become lead teachers.  In the first year, these lead  teachers will receive instruction to provide them with the content  knowledge and teaching skills so that they will be able to use  exemplary materials in their classrooms.  Their duties upon  returning to the classroom will be to use the new materials,  network with other participants, work with colleagues to implement  the materials school wide and to work with student parents and  school administrators to make them aware of the reform goals.  In  the second year the lead teachers continue with their summer  institute and in the school year through 50 hours of on-site  professional development, work with their colleagues to continue  the process of implementing the same two units.  In the two ensuing  years the same activities take place so that by the end of the  project, the 200 lead teachers will have had 800 hours of in-  service and have introduced eight new science modules into the  classroom.  In addition, 2-4 more teachers from each of the schools  will have had 308 hours of in-service and will eventually introduce  the same modules into their classrooms.  All other teachers in  these schools who teach science will have had 168 hours of in-  service to prepare them also to teach the modules.  The lead  teachers will disseminate the activities to other schools in the  state.  Activities for parents and administrators will take place  all four years.  Over the life of the project, 1276 teachers and  120 administrators will have been served by the program.",
