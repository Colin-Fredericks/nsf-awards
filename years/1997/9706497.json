 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706497    Gutierrez    The problems in this project concentrate on the study  of the behavior of solutions of degenerate  elliptic and parabolic equations in non-divergence  form with non-smooth coefficients. Such  coefficients may either vanish, be infinite, or both.  A primary goal is to study the validity of the Harnack  principle for nonnegative solutions and estimates of  the second derivatives of solutions. Though the theory for  divergence form equations with measurable coefficients  has been the focus of research during recent years,  the corresponding theory for non-divergence form  equations is much less developed. Non-divergence  equations are natural in Probability, Control Theory, and Finance.  The results known in this direction concern  either smooth coefficients or the strictly elliptic case,  but the methods developed for those cases do not  apply to the problems proposed.  In some cases the geometry needed to  study the linear equation is given by the Monge-Ampere equation,  a fully nonlinear partial differential equation.  This approach requires the study of the shape and invariance  properties of the level sets of solutions to the Monge-Ampere  equation, and further work will continue along these lines.  The basis and methodology that will be used to solve this  set of problems are via the maximum principle, localization,  and nonlinear variants of the Calderon-Zygmund decomposition.    This mathematical research is in the field of  partial differential equations, linear and nonlinear.  These equations are the principal classical tool  of the applications of mathematics to the physical world.  The project has a strong connection with Harmonic Analysis  in Euclidean space, a subject that has flourished during the  second half of the twentieth century and that has become  an indispensable tool to provide qualitative and quantitative  information about the solutions of partial differential equations.  Some equations considered in the project are used in  models of atmospheric a nd oceanic flows and in the description  of the diffusion of a gas in a porous medium.",
