Their research is concerned with developing  algorithms to investigate when, where, and how  multithreading and multithreaded architecture can reduce  communication time between parallel processors in high  performance computers.  To achieve their objectives, the  collaborators have a technical plan consisting of the  following five steps: (1) design single-threaded and  multithreaded algorithms for selected benchmark problems;  (2) develop data and workload distribution strategies with  varying thread granularity; (3) implement the algorithms to  compare the performance of three multiprocessors, the  multithreaded EM-X (designed and built by the  Electrotechnical Laboratory, Japan), and the single-thread  IBM SP-2, and Cray T3E; (4) analyze parameters that  characterize the performance of single-threaded and  multithreaded machines; and (5) formulate a model to predict  the performance achieved by single threading and  multithreading.    The principle result of this research will be a set of tools  and methodologies which enable the identification of the  performance of multithreading and multithreaded parallel  machines against single-threaded machines.  This set of  tools and methodologies will help algorithm designers to  convert single-threaded algorithms to a multithreaded  version.  The results also will help future supercomputer  architects develop multithreaded machines for reducing  communication time towards high performance computing.  The  Dr. Sohn and his Japanese collaborator are highly regarded  investigators in this field of research.  This project is  supported under the Science Fellowship Program between the  National Science Foundation and the Japan  Foundation Center  for Global Partnership.  ***",
