More specifically, we ask the questions of   how to efficiently locate users within massively  accessed internet (we refer to a network of networks   as an internet), based on the micro-networking   communication environment   and how to limit the multimedia connection admission   in such an environment, as to   guarantee quality of service to already accepted connections.     Our approach is based on the idea of   User Mobility Profile (UMP).   As a user roams within an internet,   the system continuously collects   information on the users' mobility and connection patterns.   This information is used to anticipate the future   location of the active users, thus, reduces the  search space and, consequently, the cost of locating the user.   This is achieved through the dynamic calculation of location   area. In our approach, the location area is defined per   mobile and is calculated, using the UMP,  ``on the fly,'' as the user roams between different   networks. Calculation of the location area is done   as to minimize the user's mobility management  cost. Furthermore, the statistical knowledge of users'   future positions embedded within the UMP allows   prediction of resource utilization and, thus,   reduces the probability of resource shortage.   The result is that multimedia connections can be supported with a   much stricter Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees.     To achieve the goal of guaranteed QoS, we employ a   new concept, called the Shadow Clique,   which is the representation of the probability   of user's future locations,   given its current position in the network.   The Shadow Clique is, in fact,   a digest of the UMP and allows easy and fast determination   of the future resource requirements in different network s.    In our research we will address the following issues using  both analytical and simulation tools:     1. The optimal strategy for UMP information reporting and collection    2. The use of the UMP for reducing the registration requirements and     the user location costs    3. Methods for grouping the networks into paging groups, as to      reduce the mobile paging costs, subject to delay constraints     4. The use of the UMP to create the Shadow Clique digest     5. The use of the Shadow Clique concept to predict the future network      resource utilization      6. The use of the Shadow Clique concept in the      Connection Admission algorithm    It is obvious that as the six topics  are highly related, a close collaborative   interaction and continuous exchange  of information and results is essential   for the success of this project.     To estimate the potential impact of our work,   one must envisage the future use of the   Internet services and the mobile applications.   These are responsible for much of the recent   research in the Mobile Multimedia   field. However, before a wide-spread use of the   mobile applications can be realized, the fundamental   questions of how to manage the mobility of such  large volume of users and how to manage the resources   for multimedia communication need to be addressed.   Our proposal is a significant step in this direction.",
