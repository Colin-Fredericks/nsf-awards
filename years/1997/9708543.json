 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wieder  97-08543      .BIOGEOMON, Third International Symposium on Ecosystem Behavior, co-sponsored by  Villanova University and the Czech Geological Survey, will be held on the campus or Villanova  University on June 21-25, 1997.  BIOGEOMON is the third in a series or meetings; the previous two  were held in Prague in 1987 and 1993. The 1993 conference attracted nearly 200 scientists from 27  countries on five continents. The rationale behind BIOGEOMON has been and continues to be that  there is a need for biogeochemists to occasionally meet in a setting that allows recent research  findings to be presented i9 an atmosphere that rosters formal and informal discussion.  BIOGEOMON's major focus is the biogeochemistry or terrestrial ecosystems (mostly, but not  exclusively, temperate forests), and the   997 conference will feature sessions on watersheds as units  for biogeochemical investigation (watershed monitoring, manipulation, and modeling), emerging tools  for and approaches to biogeochemical research (natural abundance stable isotopes, natural abundance  radioactive and cosmogenic isotopes, geographic information systems), and selected current topics  (acidification and its reversal; nitrogen cycling, limitation and saturation; carbon gas fluxes across the  land/atmosphere boundary; nutrient cycling as related to global climate change). In addition to six  keynote speakers and 36 invited speakers, pre-registration forms have been received from over 170  individuals in 32 countries, indicating a desire to present an oral or poster contribution at  BIOGEOMON in 1997. BIOGEOMON' s primary goals are to provide a forum for the dissemination  and discussion of recent research findings, to explore future directions for biogeochemical research,  and to foster interdisciplinary, collaboration between researchers or all ages at regional, national, and  international scales. The conference abstracts will be published in the Journal of Conference  Abstracts, and participants will have the option of sub mitting a manuscript four consideration for  publication in a special issue of Water, Air, and Soil Pollution.",
