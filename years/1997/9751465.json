 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three goals of this project are: (1) development of exportable models for distance learning in chemistry lectures with a focus on the first two years of instruction; (2) development of computer workstation based evaluation for chemical instruction that can be used either locally or in a distance learning mode; and (3) integration of computational chemistry into all levels of our undergraduate curriculum. The means for attaining these goals are the installation of the Open Chemical Computation Laboratory and currently scheduled program development. Chemistry lecture presentations for laboratory and lecture courses are available on the World Wide Web (web) as digitized audio and graphics. Evaluation of learning at a distance is based upon voice recognition technology for examination certification. The initial phase of these developments focuses on General and Organic Chemistry. Examinations using the Computation Laboratory will focus on student generated responses to questions. Typed input, digitized graphics, and drawing program input are utilized. This department has initiated comprehensive curricular revision involving introduction of computer use in lecture and laboratory courses at all levels of the curriculum, starting with courses designed for chemistry majors. Laboratory and course revisions covering the first two years of the curriculum have been implemented by the Fall 1997. Students' interest in the results of computations on unexplored systems promotes learning and acquisition of useful information. The three year implementation period features formative and summative evaluations of distance learning, computer based laboratory and lecture examinations, and curricular revisions. These changes in instruction enrich the learning of more than 5000 students each year, 21% of whom are minorities and 55% of whom are women.  *",
