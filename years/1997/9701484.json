Such investigations  form the basis for the exploitation of coherent spin transport in  future generations of magneto-electronic devices.  The  experiments focus on model nanostructures fabricated from II-VI  magnetic semiconductors (MS), allowing one to systematically  tailor spin interactions between confined electronic states and  low dimensional distributions of local moments.  The project is  comprised of highly interactive efforts that combine the  concurrent development of sophisticated MS nanostructures  (digital magnetic heterostructures, magnetic two-dimensional  electron gases (2DEGs), and quantum spin dots) with state-of-the-  art spin dynamical probes having high temporal (~100 fs) and  spatial  (~100 nm) resolution (femtosecond Faraday rotation and  time-resolved near-field scanning optical microscopy) and low-  temperature magnetotransport.  %%%  Recent decades have witnessed the development of sophisticated  solid state fabrication techniques that enable the construction  of artificial atomic architectures (\"nanostructures\") in which  one or more dimensions are at the nanoscale (a billionth the  diameter of a human hair). There has also been a concurrent  development of optical measurement techniques that allow one to  record physical phenomena at unprecedently high speeds (ultrafast  spectroscopy) and with very high spatial definition (near field  microscopy).  In this highly interactive project, we employ a  powerful combination of state-of-the-art fabrication and  measurement techniques to study the dynamic motion of electrons  in new classes of \"magnetic nanostructures,\" wherein magnetic  atoms are embedded within an engineered semiconductor.  These  fundamental investigations lay the groundwork for future  generations of magneto-electronic devices that would exploit the  quantum mechani cal interactions between electrons and magnetic  atoms for high-speed communication devices and ultra-high density  memories.  ***",
