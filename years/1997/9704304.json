 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry Program supports research in the laboratory of Professor Alan   S. Goldman of Rutgers University to develop catalysts that will   photochemically functionalize at C-H bonds.  This photochemical   carbonylation of hydrocarbons is based on a developing understanding of   the chemical mechanisms whereby it occurs.  Representative catalysts will   be studied as to their kinetics, thermodynamics, and molecular orbital   transformations.  Systems are based on soluble late transition-metal   complexes, which are promising because of their success in related   catalytic processes, particularly industrial hydroformylation processes,   and their unusual regioselectivity.  The reverse reaction, aldehyde   decarbonylation, will also be studied as it is the microscopic reverse of   carbonylation and also of significant potential value.           Efficiently turning the world's major carbon-containing resources,   such as coal, natural gas and petroleum, into commodity chemicals and low   pollution fuels is essential to a thriving economy.  The chemically   difficult and economically important process of adding organic   functionality by activating stable C-H bonds will be undertaken using new   photochemical catalysts developed in Dr. Goldman's laboratory.  The   development of these catalysts depends on furthering our understanding of   how the catalysts work at a molecular level.  The mechanism of   photochemical carbonylation  is to be probed in a systematic series of   kinetic and thermodynamic experiments coupled with theoretical   calculations.",
