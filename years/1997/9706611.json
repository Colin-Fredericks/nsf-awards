 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iwaniec    ABSTRACT      Iwaniec will pursue questions about quasiregular mappings which   arise as generalizations of geometric aspects of  analytic functions   of one complex variable. The mappings in question solve  important first order systems of PDEs analogous in many respects to  the Cauchy-Riemann equations. The solutions of these systems can be  viewed as \"absolute\" minimizers of certain energy functionals. It is  striking how tight the connection is between quasiregular mappings and  the recent development of the nonlinear elasticity theory whose  mathematical principles were already formulated by S.S. Antman   and J. Ball in 1976-77. Roughly speaking, the theory of elasticity   studies mappings, referred to as deformations of elastic bodies,   which minimize the so-called stored energy functionals. These   functionals are not always convex and the deformations need not be   quasiconformal but the governing PDEs are much the same. The   Jacobian determinant, in particular, has been subjected to a great   deal of investigation.  Ths project accounts for this study   together with some generalizations concerning wedge products of   closed differential forms.    Quasiconformal mappings generalize to higher dimensions the concept  of analytic functions that is so fruitful for science and engineering  in two space dimensions. Trying to extend this theory to three or  more space dimensions proved quite difficult and the mathematics of  such extension is being developed now. Iwaniec will work on how  to extend familiar concepts in the plane, like degree, to similar  concepts in space. The theory of non linear elasticity, among others,  will benefit from this developments.",
