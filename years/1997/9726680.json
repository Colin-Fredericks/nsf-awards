 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726680  Kerfoot    Research will be undertaken in response to an Announcement of Opportunity (NSF 97-  38)for Coastal Studies in the Great Lakes.  This is a collaborative research project   between investigators from ten academic and government research institutions.  The   research is being conducted under the auspices of the NSF Coastal Ocean Processes   (CoOP) program and the NOAA Coastal Ocean Program.    This collaborative, 5-year research program will focus on the importance of episodic   events on nearshore-offshore transport and subsequent ecological consequences. The   study seeks to 1) determine what processes control the cross-margin (inshore to offshore)   transport of biological, chemical, and geological materials in the coastal margins of the   Great Lakes, and to 2) develop and test scientific strategies for assessing, quantifying, and   predicting the impacts of multiple stresses both natural and anthropogenic, in the Great   Lakes or selected coastal sub-regions.    A tight coupling between contaminated sediments and overlying water exists in lakes and   coastal ecosystems through the process of sediment resuspension. Satellite observations in   Lake Michigan illustrate an annually recurrent episode of nearshore-offshore transport, a   10 km wide plume of resuspended material extending over 200 km along the southern   shores of the lake. Preliminary evidence indicates that this episodic event may be the major   mechanism for cross-margin sediment transport in Lake Michigan.  This type of event   impacts recycling of biogeochemically important materials (BIMS), ecosystem responses,   cross-isobath transport in the Great Lakes. The program results will be applicable to   similar events in many coastal areas.    This comprehensive, interdisciplinary study will implement an integrated observational   program and numerical modeling effort to identify, quantify, and develop prediction tools   for the winter-spring resuspension event and to assess the impact of this event on the   tra nsport and transformation of BIMS and on lake ecology.    This component of the study focuses on a retrospective study of the southern Lake   Michigan spring coastal plume using remotely sensed data. Advanced Very High   Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) visible and thermal infrared data will form the basis of   the retrospective study, whereas higher resolution imagery (e.g., Landsat MSS and   Landsat TM images, CZCS images, and available aircraft data) will monitor specific   events of short duration. The objectives are to assess the relationship of winter ice   formation, coastal plume development, and thermal bar movement to cross-margin   transport phenomena in southern Lake Michigan; to determine the timing, duration and   extent of river plumes on a seasonal and interannual basis; and to utilize historical surface   water quality data for empirical comparisons with the remotely sensed data.",
