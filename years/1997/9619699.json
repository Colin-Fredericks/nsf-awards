The individual or small group efforts that occur in a research setting are a vital complement to the more passive lecture-based instruction provided in most engineering courses.  The applications and innovations that can be demonstrated through research experiences can both motivate students to enter and persist in engineering and help prepare them for either graduate school or professional engineering.  According, the UC Davis Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering proposes will offer an environmental engineering REU program that includes recruiting, selecting, educating, retaining and mentoring a total of 40 undergraduate students over a five year period.    The program is aimed particularly at students from D-Q University (a two year community college and founding member of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium) and women and underrepresented minorities from UC Davis.  The overarching goals of the proposed project are to:  1) increase the visibility of environmental engineering as a viable career for Native Americans and 2) develop well rounded and independent students who can contribute professionally with thoughtful assessment and innovative solutions.    The project begins with a four week summer session introducing students to the principles of research and includes visits to campus facilities and research field and laboratory sites, attending seminars on preparing a research plan and scheduled time with faculty mentors.  The product of this four week session will be a student-faculty formal research contract for the upcoming academic year.  During the academic year, the students will participate in a structured research seminar series as well as research group meetings, conduct research according to their research contract, prepare presentations and progress reports and meet twice weekly with faculty mentors.  The major tangible product  of the academic year research will be preparation of an abstract and paper for spring submission the UC Davis Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) and the National Undergraduate Research Conference (NCAR).  In addition to the structured research experience, D-Q students will be provided guidance in course selection and transfer requirements to facilitate their preparation for transfer to a university with an approved engineering curriculum.  ***",
