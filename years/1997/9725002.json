 "awd_abstract_narration": "The starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the State University   of New York at Buffalo supports the research of Professor Steven T.   Diver.  The objective of the research is to identify new catalysts by an   in vivo screening method.  The enzyme system is transketolase with   thiamin pyrophosphate cofactor as its catalytic machinery.  Through   mutation of the transketolase gene in yeast, a system is developed in   which yeast grow only when catalytic function is recovered by   incorporation of a new cofactor.  Various thiamin analogs are designed,   synthesized, and tested for activity as new catalytic cofactors.  The   growth phenotype is used to discover a new cofactor catalyst as an in   vivo selection strategy.  The research explores a new method for novel catalyst discovery, using a   living cell to communicate a reaction's worthiness.  The work enhances   understanding of the relationship between structure and function in   enzyme systems.",
