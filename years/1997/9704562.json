 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with  issues related to the efficient  use of parallel I/O systems. These include problems of  data  placement, caching, and prefetching and their interaction in  determining system performance. The project involves the  development of robust parallel I/O models that incorporate  these requirements, and designing new  algorithms to obtain  desired performance levels. This includes  identifying the  appropriate policies for resource management in the context  of both single and multiple interacting computational and  I/O streams, and the development of suitable algorithmic  strategies. The focus is on on-line buffer management and  prefetching algorithms with bounded lookahead. The use of  randomization in data placement and replacement, and issues  arising in their implementation are under consideration.  Theoretical analysis of the algorithms is based on a  competitive framework to compare different on-line methods,  and identify promising candidates. Suitable candidates will  be implemented and their performance validated empirically.  The areas of impact include, though  are not restricted to,  data-intensive applications like modern database  and  multimedia systems.",
