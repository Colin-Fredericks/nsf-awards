 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative project between Dr. Roy Glauber,  Department of Physics, Harvard University, and Dr. Daniel  Walls, Department of Physics, University of Auckland, New  Zealand, of a number of theoretical problems that arise in  connection with the behavior of slowly moving atoms, and  atoms and ions that have been trapped into quantum states of  low excitation.  Observation of light scattering and of  light emission from such atoms offers a systematic way of  analyzing the structure, that is to say the position and  time correlations, present in atomic systems.  They also  offer the possibility of analyzing the quantum states of  trapped atoms and ions through novel interference effects.  Among the problems to be investigated are: the detection of  statistical correction effects both of the BoseEinstein and  the Fermi-Dirac forms in cooled but free atomic beams.  The  extension of the same techniques to the treatment of Bose  Einstein condensed gases will be undertaken as well as  analysis of the Bose condensation more generally for  imperfect and trapped gases.  A critical examination will be  carried out of the nature of the forces exerted on atoms by  the quantized radiation fields in order to find corrections  to the present semiclassical theory.  Present studies to be  continued include further attempts to project the design of  a device that would produce a beam of neutral bosonic atoms  in the form of a steady coherent wave, i.e., an `atom  maser`. Analysis of the single-atom laser or `microlaser`  developed by a group at Massachusetts Institute of  Technology will also continue.",
