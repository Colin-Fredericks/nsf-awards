 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614757  Anderson  This research involves the study of the January 17, 1995, HyogoKen Nambu earthquake (Mw=6.9), commonly referred to as the Kobe earthquake in the United States.  The earthquake was particularly destructive because the fault ruptured into a densely developed urban area.  This is to be an integrated study of the factors that controlled the nature of the ground motions and caused the disaster:  the earthquake source, wave propagation along the path, and near-surface modification of these motions at nearsurface sites.  The area affected by the earthquake was well instrumented for strong ground motion.  The earthquake focal mechanism was predominantly strike slip.  Thus, the ground motions may be analogous to what should be expected from earthquakes of this size on strike-slip faults such as the San Andreas in the United States.  The work will be done in collaboration with Japanese scientists at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute, Kyoto University, in Japan.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program. ***",
