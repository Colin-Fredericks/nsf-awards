The research is based  on  a  recently  developed ellipsometric microscope. This instrument, developed in  the PI's laboratory, will be used to determine size and shape  of  droplets under experimental conditions. The data will be compared  with appropriate theoretical models. This study will enhance  our  understanding  of  how uniform wetting layers  form  via  droplet  growth  and  coalescence, how ions in the solution influence  the  phenomena of wetting and adsorption, and will clarify whether  or  not  orientational order is important at the surfaces of critical  ionic mixtures.  %%%  The  composition at the surface of a solution frequently  differs  from  that  in  the bulk because surface interactions  create  an  adsorbed layer or a wetting layer at the interface. These surface  effects  are  important in many  processes such  as  lubrication,  catalysis,  and  fluid  flow, through  biological  membranes  and  porous  media.  The work will use an ellipsometric microscope  to  study  the dynamics of coalescence and growth as wetting droplets  combine  to  form  a uniform wetting film at  the  surface  of  a  critical  non-ionic binary liquid mixture. The dynamics  will  be  studied as the temperature is varied. The influence of ions  will  also be studied. This work will enhance our understanding of  the  complex  interplay  between bulk critical phenomena  and  surface  processes, in the presence and absence of ions in solution.  ***",
