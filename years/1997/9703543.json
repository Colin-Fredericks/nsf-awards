His contributions to exact solutions are widely known.  In a  two pronged attack, he is planning to study the  integrability conditions of a given problem   and also look  for insights into non-integrable problems.  In particular,  he is examining the  properties of time dependent  correlation functions of integrable spin   XXZ chains,  of  the energy spectra of conformal models in 2-d, i.e. the  features which are important in the study of fractional  statistics, theory of combinatorics and the mathematical  study of q-series and the Rogers-Ramanujan identities. In  non-integrable systems, the project includes a study of the  Ising model in a nonzero magnetic field and ZN symmetric  spin chains.  %%%  This grant to a senior, distinguished  mathematical  physicist is to support research in statistical mechanics.  More specifically, this PI is well known for his  contributions to several  exactly solvable problems.  He  will continue his search for exact solutions.  He will also  continue to look for some understanding of what makes a  problem exactly solvable (also called integrable).  Finally  he is planning to consider ways of applying the insights  gained from exact solutions to cases where exact solutions  are either not known and perhaps are not possible.  ***",
