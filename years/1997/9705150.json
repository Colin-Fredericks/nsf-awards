 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT-Paolucci  CTS-9705150        Unsteady, multi-dimensional combustion processes are modeled using a newly   developed wavelet technique combined with a technique to rationally reduce the   relevant differential equations to lower dimensions.  The focus is on problems   in which there is full coupling between fluid mechanics and chemical kinetics;   such problems are characterized by a multiplicity of phenomena evolving over   widely disparate length and time scales.  The first technique uses a multi-level   wavelet collocation approximation.  The multilevel structure of  the algorithm   facilitates the computational adaptation of the grid refinement according to the   temporal evolution of the solution.  The rational reduction phase of the compu-  tation applies intrinsic low-dimensional manifold (ILDM) theory; those   processes occurring on time scales faster than a physically motivated cutoff time   scale are allowed to relax to partial equilibrium while the remaining processes   are subject to time evolution.  In brief, the wavelet decomposition reduces the   total number of unknowns and the rational reduction then reduces the   dimension of the manifold on which the system of differential equations is   solved resulting in a more efficient numerical method.    This project considers both general algorithmic development and application to   specific combustion problems well characterized by experiment and/or   independent theory.  This work introduces wavelet techniques into combustion   modelling and also has applicability to other large-scale numerical simulations.",
