 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research addresses the current stagnation in N-  gram  language  modeling by developing a set  of  principled  techniques by which higher level structure can be applied to  the  problem of language modeling.  These techniques include  trans-finite-state    probabilistic    grammar    formalisms  (probabilistic feature grammars and tree-insertion grammars)  that  are  both  practical  and  lexically  sensitive,   and  similarity-based methods that address data sparsity  problem  for  large-N models directly.  A novel technique  of  multi-  pass parsing has potential utility in addressing some of the  practical  computational issues that  arise  in  using  such  models.   This  promising  combination  of  techniques   ---  lexicalized  grammar formalisms and the  multi-pass  parsing  method  to  make them practical, along with similarity-based  estimation to aid in solving data sparsity problems ---  has  the  potential  to  improve  language  modeling  beyond  the  asymptote   that  it  has  reached,  with  applications   in  improving  speech  recognition, information  retrieval,  and  many other language-processing applications.",
