 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Dynamics Program supports Professor Kurt Mislow at Princeton   University for his studies of theoretical stereochemistry.  Professor   Mislow addresses a number of basic questions in stereochemistry by use of   both non-numerical and computational methods, with special emphasis on   topological aspects.  An algorithm will be developed to implement a   measure of topological chirality which is based on the least number of   cut-and-paste operations that relate a chiral construct to the nearest   achiral one.  The Protein Data Bank will be explored, specifically to   correlate biological function with a sense of topological chirality of   non-heme iron-sulfur proteins, and, more generally, to search for the   presence of additional knots and links in protein structures.  The   existence of flype groups, related by operations which transform one knot   or link projection into another, will be assayed.  In conjunction with a   study of the rotatory power of knots as a function of conformation, the   relative stabilities of knotted hydrocarbon chains will be computed in   order to determine their dependence on chain size and number of   crossings.  Professor Kurt Mislow's studies in the Department of Chemistry at   Princeton University address the often-intriguing issues presented by   molecules displaying unusual three-dimensional structures resulting from   the way in which the component atoms making up the molecules are   interconnected.  Molecules displaying the property of chirality, whereby   mirror image forms of a molecule are not identical but rather are related   as a right hand is to a left, are analyzed, providing a quantitative   measure of chirality.  Still more unusual molecular topologies, including   molecules containing knotted or inter-linked chains, are also studied.    Far from esoteric, these studies bear direct relevance to biological   molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, structural analysis of   which has revealed the possibility of naturally-occurring knotted and   linked structures.  In addition to providing insights into these   biological systems, theoretical analyses of non-trivial molecular   topologies will prompt the preparative chemical community to prepare real   molecules displaying these unusual topologies.",
