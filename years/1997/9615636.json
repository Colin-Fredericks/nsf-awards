 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from UCLA.  The student will investigate how unequal access to coastal natural resources affects the household management of shrimp aquaculture in China.  The hypothesis is that resource-rich households will develop entrepreneurial management styles and practice intensive production, while resource-poor households will follow a risk-averse, diversified and diffused style of management and economic production.  Households practicing intensive shrimp aquaculture differ from those using more sustainable traditional methods in terms of labor allocation, decision making, financial management and household culture.  Methods include structured interviews, formal studies of decision making, time allocation studies as well as participant observation.     This research is important because the growth of shrimp aquaculture is part of economic development in many poorer nations of the world, and has been associated with harm to the local ecosystem.  The advance in our knowledge of how these economic systems work in micro-level detail of household decision making, will be helpful to planners trying to maintain the developmental benefits while ameliorating the ecological costs.",
