 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723288  Cohlberg   Research will be conducted on the pathway and mechanism of  assembly of mammalian neurofilaments (NFs) from their  constituent proteins and the role of phosphorylation in  regulating the assembly process and the properties of the  filaments.  The goals of the research are to identify and  quantitatively characterize the interactions which determine  the specificity of interaction of neurofilament proteins and  are responsible for filament stabilization, and to gain  information about the parameters which characterize the  dynamic properties of NFs.    In large caliber neurons of the central nervous system, NFs  are composed of three \"NF triplet\" proteins, termed NF-H  (high), NF-M (middle), and NF-L (low) according to their  molecular weights.  In certain neurons, other proteins,  including alpha-internexin, are present in NF.  Neurofilament (NF) proteins contain alpha-helical rod  domains flanked by nonhelical head and tail domains. They  aggregate to form coiled coil dimers, which then aggregate  further to form NF-L/NF-M and NF-L/NF-H heterotetramers,  which in turn serve as intermediates in the assembly of  filaments.  It is not certain whether the coiled coil dimers  are heterodimers or homodimers.  Disulfide cross-linking  will be used as a probe to detect the formation of  heterodimers from homodimers, and the kinetics of monomer  exchange and its dependence on solvent conditions will be  characterized.  The stabilities of various heterodimers  containing both full-length proteins and their rod domains  will be investigated by sedimentation and cross-linking  studies, and the roles of various proteins domains in the  association of dimers to tetramers will be characterized.  The roles of the various domains in the formation of  heterotetramer assembly intermediates will be investigated  by the use of nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis.  The principal question to be answered is  whether specific interactions among rod domains are fully  responsible for th e specificity of protein association at  this level (LM and MH complexes are formed, but not MH) or  whether the head and tail domains also play a role.  Furthermore, the roles of the various protein domains in  determining the specificity with which proteins associate to  form filaments will be examined by filament reconstitution  experiments and analyzed by filament pelleting experiments  and by examination of reconstituted filaments by electron  microscopy, including immunogold labeling studies.  Finally,  NF proteins will be modified by the covalent attachment of  fluorophores, and the assembly and disassembly of filaments  and the exchange of proteins between filaments will be  followed by fluorescence energy transfer measurements.  All  of these studies will include experiments on alpha-  internexin as well as the NF triplet proteins.    A key attribute of eukaryotic cells is the presence of  filamentous structures inside the cells, collectively termed  the cytoskeleton, which provide a structural framework for  the cytoplasm and its functions.  The three major types of  cytoskeletal \"elements\" in cells, distinguished by their  molecular composition and structural features, are the actin-  containing microfilaments, the 10-nm diameter intermediate  filaments, and microtubules.  Neurofilaments (NF) are those  members of the family of intermediate filaments (IFs) that  form part of the cytoskeleton in neurons (cells of the  nervous system).  They are found primarily running  longitudinally down the long cellular projections known as  axons, along with microtubules, and they are thought to be  responsible for promoting the radial growth (thickening) of  axons, establishing axonal diameter, and maintaining the  structural integrity of the axon and its resistance to  compressive forces.   In large caliber neurons of the  central nervous system, NFs are composed of three \"NF  triplet\" proteins, distinguished by their molecular weights  (heavy-, middle-, and low-weight).  In certain neurons,  add itional proteins, e.g.,  alpha-internexin, are present in  NFs.  The proteins are synthesized in the cell body and move  down the axon in a process known as slow axonal transport,  eventually leaving the moving phase and becoming  incorporated into the stationary filament network of the  axon.  A number of diseases of motor neurons involve  abnormal NFs, and overexpression of either the light or  heavy weight NF  in transgenic mice leads to pathology very  similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or \"Lou  Gherig's Disease\").  Very little is known about how these NF  proteins assemble to form functional filaments.  This  research will provide vital information on the chemical and  physical properties of NF protein components and their  interactions with each other, which will help us better  understand filament assembly and transport in living  neuronal cells.  ***",
