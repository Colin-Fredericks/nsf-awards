 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  objective of this research is the development of methods for  the   automatic  recognition  of  American  Sign  Language  (ASL)  utterances using as input the 3D shape and motion parameters of a  subject's  face, hands and arm.  These parameters  are  extracted  based  on the use of computer vision techniques on relevant image  sequences. The novel aspects of this research are: 1) use  of  3D  information  from  the vision-based analysis  of  the  data  that  consists  of the three-dimensional hand, arm and face  shape  and  motion,  2)  use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to recognize  the  ASL  structure  at multiple levels, and 3) coupling  of  computer  vision  and  HMMs to go beyond the limitations of  both  computer  vision  and HMMs. Novel computer vision methods will be developed  based on the use of deformable models, visual cues, and knowledge  of anthropometry to allow the accurate tracking of a human's face  and  upper  limbs. The 3D output from the vision system  will  be  used  as  input  to the HMM for ASL recognition. To  improve  the  robustness of the system, research on feedback mechanisms between  the  computer vision system and the HMMs will also be  conducted.  The final goal of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility  of  building  an  automated robust system with  high  recognition  accuracy (recovery of sign sequences at the sign level)  that  is  capable  of handling the inflectional and derivational properties  of ASL in a systematic way.",
