 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9661290  Zamansky     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project to be carried out by Energy and Environmental Research Corporation is a feasibility study of utilizing photocatalytic filters for effective volatile organic compound (VOC) removal from gas streams before discharging them to the atmosphere.  The US EPA list of 17 high-volume and high-release toxic industrial chemicals includes 6 chlorinated organics.  These compounds are more resistant to oxidation than most other organic species.  Advanced technologies should be developed for destruction of VOCs which include chlorinated organic compounds.  The proposed photocatalytic filters will use a specially prepared surface to oxidize toxic contaminants at ambient temperature and pressure and simultaneously will separate the solid particles present in the gas stream.  The objectives of the research are to: (1) synthesize and characterize the novel catalytic filter with exceptional properties for decontamination of air and industrial exhaust gases and (2) measure the photocatalytic oxidation activity of this filter in the mineralization of selected VOCs .  Phase I study will deliver the reaction rate expression that enables prediction of the oxidation rate of the contaminants as a function of humidity and contaminants concentrations.  Also, this project will obtain data to develop the most effective and economic size of the system for exhaust gas stream cleaning processes.   This project proffers a technology of utility to the industries of air pollution control and waste destruction.  The proposed photo-oxidation filers can remove toxic VOCs and particulate matter at ambient temperature and pressure.  The process is simple, inexpensive, and has the potential to be widely used in the industry for VOC removal from air and industrial gases.  The process combined with advanced air conditioning systems can also be used for indoor air cleaning.  The photocatalytic filer will oxidize chlorinated toxic compounds to form H20, CO2, as  well as HCl which can be easily removed by passing the exhaust gas through a water bubbler.  ***",
