The project  entails extensive fieldwork in Nepal, Tibet (China), and India; and  will involve eight collaborating institutions from Nepal, China,  India, France, and the U.S., with the Oregon State University and  University of Illinois as lead-institutions.  An initial proposal  of this project was submitted to the Continental Dynamics program  of the Earth Sciences Division at the NSF in June 1996.    Scientific aspects of the reviews were generally positive.   However, it became apparent that the international collaborative  aspects need to be further bolstered.  This award will support a  trip to each of the collaborating countries in order to clearly  define the responsibilities of each institution and to obtain  official documentation of cost-sharing from each country.  The  principal investigators expect the trip to result in a well-  orchestrated, multi-national collaboration, ultimately increasing  the effectiveness of the project while lowering the cost.    The Division of International Programs (India, Nepal and China) has  provided support for this project.  ***",
