 "awd_abstract_narration": "ARTIN, 97-00925        The most important results of the classical theory of algebraic  surfaces, which date back to the turn of the last century,  characterize the surfaces which contain families of lines: the  rational and ruled surfaces.  Recently, some interesting  \"quantizations\" or deformations of these surfaces have been found.  In  these quantizations, the functions on a surface are replaced by  operators which do not commute.  It is conjectured that the  noncommutative surfaces which are not finite over their centers are  precisely the analogues of the rational and ruled surfaces.  The  program of research is aimed at carrying the clasqical theory over to  the noncommutative case and proving these conjectures.      This is research in the field of algebraic geometry and noncommutative algebra. Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but  one which has had a  revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it  treated figures that could be defined  in the plane by the simplest  equations, namely polynomials. Noncommutative algebra, which has roots in  in matrix theory and in physics, combined with classical algebraic geometry  may have applications to modern physical theory.",
