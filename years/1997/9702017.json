 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702017  Miller  The   overall   objective  of  this  project  in   materials  processing / mechanics of materials is to establish tangible  links  between  the  processing of a material  and  its  in-  service  performance.  In general, the method which will  be  employed in both the educational and research components  of  the  project  is  to  use experiments to understand  various  aspects  of material behavior and microstructural evolution.  Guided   by   these  observations,  models  for   in-service  performance  which incorporate processing  effects  will  be  developed and implemented.    The research component of this project, An Investigation  of  the  Effects of Metal Forming Practice on In-Service  Cyclic  Performance,  is  motivated  by  the  need  for  a  unifying  constitutive   model  framework  for  small  strain   cyclic  plasticity   which  explicitly  incorporates  large   strain  processing-induced  effects.  It is  well  known  that  flat  rolling produces strong internal structure gradients through  the  thickness  of rolled plate material.  In this  project,  the  dependence of small strain inelastic cyclic deformation  on  processing  induced initial structure (in  the  form  of  crystallographic   texture  and  large  strain   dislocation  structures)  will  be  investigated by taking  uniaxial  and  planar  biaxial test specimens at various locations  through  the thickness of rolled aluminum plate.  Both the mechanical  response  as well as the microstructural evolution  will  be  monitored in these experiments and a determination  made  as  to  which of the large strain effects have the most profound  influence  on  the subsequent small strain cyclic  behavior.  This  information  will then be incorporated  into  unifying  small  strain  cyclic  models which explicitly  account  for  prior  large  strain  metal forming  episodes.   While  both  involve  inelastic strains, the large deformations  incurred  during a metal forming episode differ sharply from the small   strain cyclic history which a component may encounter during  its service life.  These differences produce a discontinuity  with  respect to model structure.  Large strain models place  more  of  an  emphasis  on  the characterization  of  slowly  evolving  material  behavior  due  to  processes   such   as  crystallographic texture evolution while models  for  cyclic  plasticity must capture quickly evolving phenomena  such  as  that  related to the nucleation and evolution of dislocation  cells  and  lattice  structures.  Even though  the  internal  structure  produced  during forming is distinct  from  small  strain  cyclic  structure,  the evolution  of  structure  is  continuous across the forming/service interface.  It is this  continuity  of  state  evolution  which  offers   hope   for  developing  a  unifying model framework.  The initial  model  will   build  on  a  currently-existing  crystal  plasticity  framework  while the final modeling effort proposes  an  new  micromechanical formulation.    The  educational  plan, Designing with processed  materials,  shares  the  overall goal of bridging the processing  /  in-  service   design   interface  and   focuses   primarily   on  undergraduate and graduate curriculum development as well as  laboratory  development  and  implementation.   A   stronger  emphasis  on  the effects of processing on  design  will  be  interjected into existing materials processing courses.   On  the   undergraduate   level,   students   will   investigate  experimentally  what effects forming and thermal  processing  practice  have  on the properties of the processed  material  and  how the microstructure evolves during processing On the  graduate  level,  a  new experimental  course  in  materials  processing  is being developed taking the general  theme  of  incorporating processing effects into design  to  a  greater  depth by investigating issues such as effects of deformation-  induced   anisotropy,   rate  and  temperature   dependence,  instabiliti es,  and  superplasticity.   Development  of  the  instructional   laboratory  which   serves   the   materials  processing  curriculum in Mechanical Engineering at  Cornell  consistent  with  the proposed curriculum  changes  is  also  proposed.",
