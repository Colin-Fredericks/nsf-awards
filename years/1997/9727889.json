 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL) proposes to host an event for the Washington DC community focusing on \"Shaping the Future....\"  This Report, which presents an agenda for action to strengthen the undergraduate SME&T community, makes significant recommendations for academic institutions to address in their work of reform.  Recognizing that 'shaping the future' of undergraduate SME&T requires the commitment and informed support of a wide range of educational, scientific, and national associations, the Report also makes significant recommendations for consideration by the wider community.  At this event, PKAL intends to assemble representatives of major associations (based in DC and from around the country) that have the opportunity and responsibility to address and implement the recommendations in the Report.  Our plan is to i) ask participants to provide detailed information about current and proposed activities in respond to 'shaping' recommendations' ii) organize plenary and small group discussions during the event during which participating associations determine next steps (individually and collectively) in response to the Report recommendations; and iii) prepare proceedings that detail the next steps and that can be shared during 1998 by those participating in the event with the members of the associations they represent.  The goal is to link the actions of national associations to the work of individual campuses, so that the work of transforming undergraduate SME&T can proceed most productively.",
