 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615731  Jabbari  This project will address critical implementation issues  associated with active control for urban seismic hazard  mitigation, particularly excitations due to near-field  earthquakes.  These issues include hardware malfunction and  actuator saturation, which arise in the performance-based design  of control systems.  The recent near-field earthquakes of  Northridge and Kobe have raised great concerns regarding the  applications of both passive base isolation systems (such as  rubber-bearing isolators) and active/hybrid protective systems.   The characteristics of near field earthquakes, including  unexpected large peak ground acceleration and shock-type time  histories, may render both passive isolation systems and  active/hybrid protective systems ineffective or even detrimental.    In the implementation of active control systems possible  malfunction of hardware, such as actuators or sensors, may occur  due to the infrequent use or due to shock-type excitations, such  as that of near-field earthquakes.  Due to the limited capacity  of any actuator, as well as the random nature of earthquake  excitations, the actuator may become saturated, particularly  under the near-field earthquakes.  Further the robust controller  design for the reduction of peak structural response needs to be  carefully addressed.  This project will attempt to establish  control design methods that guarantee high performance in the  presence of potential hardware malfunction and actuator  saturation.  The performance obtained depends explicitly on the  reliability (or malfunction) characteristics of hardware,  actuator capabilities and the design earthquake.  Consequently,  the evaluation of costs and benefits for implementing an active  control system becomes possible.  Finally, a comprehensive  experimental test program will be conducted suing the state-of-  the-art shaking table at the University of California-Irvine to  verify and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed  techniques.    A di stinguished feature of our technical approach is that all the  issues to be addressed, including the malfunction of hardware  systems, actuator saturation, peak response reduction and system  robustness, can be formulated in a unified and comprehensive  framework.  The main thrust of the project can thus be summarized  as developing a comprehensive control design methodology that  will provide reliability with respect to actuator/sensor  malfunction, high performance with actuator saturation,  robustness and peak response reduction, and experimental  verification and evaluation.  ***",
