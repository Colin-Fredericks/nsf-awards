 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eight of the universities that prepare over 80% of all K- 12 science and mathematics teachers in Puerto Rico have formed an alliance with the Puerto Rico Department of Education, through the Resource Center for Science and Engineering to carry out a strategic planning process for the reform of science and mathematics teacher preparation programs as part of the ongoing K-16 systemic educational reform. Building on the Puerto Rico Statewide Systemic Initiative and the Puerto Rico Alliance for Minority Participation, a Blueprint for Achieving Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teacher Preparation in Puerto Rico will be developed through the collaborative efforts of these eight institutions and K-12 teachers participating in the standards-based reform. Three island wide conferences will be implemented during a six month period to facilitate and strengthen the inter-institutional strategic planning process. The main topics of the three conferences will be: I) defining and building consensus on the central issues and specific changes needed to align Teacher Preparation Programs (TPP) with Content and Professional Standards for science and mathematics; 2) facilitating a strategic planning process at the institutional level to reform TPP, that will ensure a highly participative process that harnesses the creative capabilities of faculty; and 3) the elaboration of a Blueprint for Achieving Excellence in Science and Mathematics TP in Puerto Rico, which will integrate the diverse institutional strategic plans. Broad participation in these conferences will be promoted to ensure the involvement of stakeholders at all levels and from all institutions, including faculty, students and administrators, staff from the Department of Education and K-12 teachers participating in the reform, and representatives from the local chapters of the National Council of Mathematics Teachers (NCTM) and the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA). Up to 200 participants are expected to be directly involved in this endeav or, who will impact others within their institutions. PR-SSI/PR-AMP staff will be in charge of the implementation of the project and will support the institutional planning process at each institution and promote inter-institutional collaboration and articulation through periodic meetings between conferences. The Blueprint produced through this project will serve as the basis for the reform of science and mathematics teacher preparation in Puerto Rico, fostering their alignment with standards of excellence, and ensuring high quality in the preparation of the future instructional workforce needed to sustain the reform.",
