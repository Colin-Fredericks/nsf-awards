Since 1976, ANSMET has  recovered more than 7800 meteorite specimens from locations along  the Transantarctic Mountains.  Over the next three years,  systematic searches will be conducted in regions known to contain  meteorites and reconnaissance work will be conducted to discover  new concentrations.  During the 1997-98 field season work will be  done in the Pecora Escarpment-LaPaz Icefields region, where  several small ice fields remain unsearched and earlier  reconnaissance located significant concentrations.  During the  1998-99 field season the southern Walcott N?v? region will be  visited, where more than 1500 meteorites have already been  recovered and many more remain.  During the 1999-00 field season  several ice fields in the Dominion Range- Grosvenor Mountains-  Scott Glacier region will be visited, where previous  reconnaissance and incomplete systematic searching promise  significant meteorite recoveries.    Antarctica is the world's premier meteorite hunting-ground for  two reasons.  Although meteorites fall in a random fashion all  over the globe, the likelihood of finding a meteorite is enhanced  if the background material is plain and the accumulation rate of  terrestrial sediment is low.  Consequently the East Antarctic Ice  Sheet, provides an ideal background for meteorite recovery.  This  allows the recovery of meteorites without bias toward types that  look most different from earth rocks (a problem on the other  continents) and without bias toward larger sizes.  But another  factor may be equally important.  As the East Antarctic Ice Sheet  flows toward the margins of the continent, it's progress is  occasionally blocked by mountains or obstructions below the  surface of the ice.  In these areas, old deep ice is pushed to  the surface and can become stagnant, with very little outf low and  consistent, slow inflow.  When such places are exposed to strong  katabatic winds, massive deflation results, removing large  volumes of ice and preventing accumulation of snow while leaving  a lag deposit of meteorites on the surface.  These areas exhibit  a balance between inflow, outflow and deflation, all of which are  intimately tied to environmental change during recent Antarctic  history.  Over significant stretches of time large concentrations  of meteorites can develop, as high as 1 per square meter.  Terrestrial exposure ages of meteorites suggest that some of  these ice surfaces are very old.  Antarctica is by far the best  place on Earth to search for meteorites, and the ANSMET program  has proven to be reliable and cost effective.    Continued recovery of Antarctic meteorites is important for  several reasons.  These samples have been the only reliable  source of new, non-microscopic extraterrestrial material since  the Apollo project, and will continue to be until future  planetary  sample-return missions develop (none are currently  scheduled for launch).  These samples provide essential \"ground-  truth\" about the composition of asteroids, planets and other  bodies of our solar system.  Studies of these materials have  fundamentally changed our understanding of the solar system,  greatly extending our knowledge of the materials and conditions  present in the nebula from which our solar system was born 4.556  billion years ago.  ANSMET meteorites provide samples of  asteroids ranging from primitive bodies unchanged since the  formation of the solar system to complex,  miniature planets,  where both traditional and exotic geological activity has taken  place. Other ANSMET samples proved, against the conventional  wisdom, that some meteorites actually represent planetary  materials, delivered to us from the Moon and Mars. ANSMET  meteorites have even promoted the discovery that meteorites can  be used to do astronomy, through the study of isotopically  anomalous grains that  could only have evolved in a different  stellar environment.",
