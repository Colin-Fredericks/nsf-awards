The equipment will be used for several research projects in computer science and engineering, including: Parallel Applications and Programming Environments for Computational  Astrophysics.  2. Parallel Applications and Programming Environments for Protein  Structure Determination.3. Parallel Workloads for System Evaluation, and Their Implications for Software and Hardware Systems. The first interdisciplinary project is focused on developing parallel algorithms and implementations for computational cosmology on this new, important class of architectures, and on developing integrated programming environments-with real user feedback-to facilitate their use.  The environments include programming language extensions, run-time systems, and performance feedback tools.  The second project, a collaboration with Professors Altman and Levitt at the Stanford University School of Medicine, has a similar focus in a different application domain.  The last project includes broadening the SPLASH benchmark suites, the most widely used suite for such systems, into emerging application areas and server workloads.    The method of work will be to develop applications and environments locally on this machine, and perform production simulations and scalibility studies on larger machines at NSF supercomputer centers. Local, dedicated access to the equipment is clearly critical to all aspects of the research.",
