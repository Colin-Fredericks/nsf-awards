JACEE has flown balloon borne payloads for long periods, up to 2 weeks, from McMurdo on paths which circumnavigate the pole.  The experiments consist of stacks of photgraphic style emulsions which record the paths and interactions of energetic cosmic rays.  The emulsions are developed once they are recovered from the ground, and by measuring the tracks, the isotopic mass of the elements which made them are determined.  JACEE is one of the few experiments which is providing data on the elemental constituents of cosmic rays with energies near 10^15 eV, which will provide important information on the origin of cosmic rays.  JACEE is a collaboration of NASA/MSFC, the Universities of Washington and Alabama, Louisiana State University and several institutions in Japan and Poland.  The balloons, launch services and tracking were provided by NASA while the logistics, housing and payload recovery were provided by NSF's Office of Polar Programs.  ***",
