The workshop is a follow up to a similar activity held  in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in May of 1997. The workshop will  further the establishment of collaborative research projects  between computer scientists in Brazil and their counterparts in  the United States. It will be composed of plenary sessions in two  broad areas: theory of programming language design and analysis  and formal tools for software verification, validation, and  refinement. In addition, there will be smaller sessions for the  presentation of detailed research interests, as well as interest-  group planning sessions for laying out common research goals.  There will be approximately twenty participants from each of  Brazil and the US, selected by a Program Committee of three  individuals from each country on the basis of position papers  stating their research interests and aims for collaboration.  One  outcome of the workshop will be a report to NSF giving the  results of an open discussion planned during the workshop  focusing on promising areas of potential collaboration and future  research, as well as ideas for promoting such collaborations in  the future. The workshop is jointly sponsored by CCR and CDA at  NSF and by the Brazilian counterpart agency, CNPq.  ***",
