 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703751    Hagedorn      This project concentrates on several mathematical problems in quantum mechanics  that are of interest in chemistry and physics.  The main goal is to study  \"surface hopping models\" in an effort to develop useful improved  approximations for the computation of non-adiabatic phenomena in chemical  dynamics.  A second goal is to study the effect of oscillating electromagnetic  fields on molecules.  A third goal is to analyze the utility of high order  time-independent Born-Oppenheimer approximations and to improve those  approximations to obtain accurate results for molecular states with large  vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.  A final goal is to study the  impact parameter approximation for many body scattering and to examine the  high energy behavior of \"charge transfer\" scattering amplitudes.      The principal goal of this interdisciplinary project is to derive new, more  accurate approximations that can be used in practical situations by chemists  and physicists.  The equations that describe the motions of molecules in  chemical reactions cannot be solved exactly, so chemists and physicists must  rely on approximate solutions.  Improved approximations could conceivably lead  to applications in areas as diverse as the synthesis of new chemical  compounds, the design of new catalysts, or the theoretical underpinnings of  rational drug design.",
