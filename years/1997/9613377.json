 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Raupp - 9613377    This research is motivated by the need for enhanced thin film materials' performance in microelectronics devices and cost-effective environmentally benign processes for producing these materials in microelectronics manufacturing.  The global objective is to investigate critical fundamental processing and materials science barriers related to implementation of vapor deposited polymers, a promising dielectric option which addresses these performance, cost and environmental technology drivers.    The research targets low dielectric constant thin film parylenes and polyimides for intermetal dielectric applications in multilevel interconnection.  The PI's will simultaneously investigate chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of polymer thin films and associated CVD chamber cleaning and polymer etching.  In collaboration with industrial professionals at Motorola, Inc. and Olin chemicals, the practical process integration issues and the environmental, safety and health impact of this alternative technology will be assessed in each step of this study.  This integrated approach will provide a comprehensive technology transfer package to facilitate implementation in industrial practice.    The expected principal environmental benefits of the technology are as follows: (1) vapor deposition avoids solvent-based spin-on processes and their associated air emissions and liquid waste; (ii) vapor deposition employing recovery and recycle of monomer has a high potential for near zero emission operation; (iii) the need for CVD chamber cleans should be reduced through appropriate reactor design and process control; and (iv) chamber cleaning and post-deposition etching of polymer films can be performed with oxygen-based plasmas, eliminating the need for perfluorocompounds (PFCs)  commonly employed to etch inorganic dielectric films.",
