 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is one wave of a longitudinal study of inner-city Baltimore youth. It extends an on-going research project, known as the Beginning School Study (BSS), into the post-high school period. Since 1982, the BSS has been tracking the life progress of a representative random sample of Baltimore school children (N = 790) from when they began first grade. The majority of the BSS youth are African-American and/or from poverty-level or near poverty-level households, and so fit the \"at-risk\" profile.          The BSS over the years has been monitoring the study group's personal, social and academic development, gathering data from them, their parents, teachers and schools at closely spaced intervals. This phase of the work extends the BSS cohort into the years after high school by conducting a final survey of the group in the spring/summer of 1998,  four years after high school for those who graduated on schedule.          The 1998 survey will secure the information needed to trace out the \"natural history\" of the group's transition from adolescence to early adulthood in terms of family formation, further schooling, and work experiences, while information already in the BSS archive could be used to link post-high school experiences in these domains to the details of these youths' personal development, academic development and vocational development over virtually the entire history of their schooling. Being able to trace developmental paths from early childhood to young adulthood is an uncommon opportunity, and especially so for minority and economically disadvantaged urban youth, who are not often the subjects in  long-term developmental research. Of particular interest is how the course of development differs according to background attributes that limit (or expand) life opportunities, comparing African-Americans with whites, males with females, youth from higher socio-economic status families with those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, and youth reared in different family structures such as so lo-parent households versus other configurations.      The completed data set will also permit researchers to distinguish groups of youngsters whose starting positions are similar in terms of \"risk factors\" (e.g., African-American youth reared in low income, solo-parent households) but whose trajectories in the post-high school period span the extremes of favorable and unfavorable transition outcomes. With these distinctions drawn, the archived data then could be used to examine circumstances of children's upbringing, their school and home experiences, and personal resources that appear to have helped the one group avoid and the other not avoid the cycle of disadvantage.     This project will provide data necessary for researchers to understand in detail how inner city youth negotiate the transition to adulthood.  The result will contribute to scientific progress in the sociology of stratification, the social psychology of child development, and other related fields.  At the same time, it will provide information that will contribute to intelligent policy formation concerning young people in disadvantaged families and communities.",
