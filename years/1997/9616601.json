 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaisons with Industry (GOALI)   initiative, the Organic Synthesis Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and   Physical Sciences support the studies of Professor William Jones of the   Department of Chemistry at the University of Rochester.  Professor Jones,   in collaboration with Eastman Kodak Company, develops environmentally   more benign synthesis and processing chemistry for photographic chemicals   production through the replacement of phosgene as an acyl source in the   synthesis of thiocarbamate, urea, and isocyanate intermediates and   through the replacement of acyl chlorides in amide syntheses.    Replacement of phosgene with carbon monoxide is permitted by   newly-discovered transition-metal based catalysts which activate carbon   monoxide toward the sequential addition of nucleophiles, allowing the   formation of thiocarbamates and related functional groups from simple and   comparatively safe precursors.  Mechanistic studies of the catalytic   systems offer insights into improved catalyst design and will lead to the   extension of the scope of the catalysis to permit the coupling of other   hetero- and carbon-based nucleophiles.  Phosgene is an essential reagent in the synthetic chemicals industry, but   the hazards of this highly toxic gas to both human life and to the   environment are significant.  With support under the Grant Opportunities   for Academic Liaisons with Industry (GOALI) initiative, Professor Jones   explores the use of carbon monoxide as a comparatively safe substitute   for phosgene.  Although rather unreactive by itself, carbon monoxide may   be enticed through the use of metal-containing catalysts to form the same   products as are otherwise prepared from phosgene.  These studies may lead   to significant reductions in the use of phosgene in the large-scale   production of photographic chemicals at Eastman Kodak Company, a   coparticipant in this collaborative GOALI research program, and the   long-range implications of the studies go well beyond the photographic   chemicals arena.  Students and postdoctoral scholars involved in the   project will spend significant periods of time learning about and working   on process development chemistry in Kodak's laboratories, thereby   bringing this breadth of experience, not ordinarily encountered in the   academic environment, back to the University of Rochester.",
