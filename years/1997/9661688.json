 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate the feasibility of pulsed-waterjet soil densification to mitigate against earthquake liquefaction.  Present methods to prevent liquefaction include various types of ground modification techniques that are generally high in cost.  The objective of the proposed work is to determine operating parameters required for deep compaction using pulsed waterjets and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this approach in comparison with existing methods.  A model of pulsed-waterjet soil densification will be developed based on the test results and a theoretical examination of densification mechanisms.  The model will be used to estimate the time and equipment required for ground compaction as a function of soil type and depth.  A comparison of the costs of the proposed technique with conventional ground compaction will be prepared as the basis for a full-scale demonstration.       Thousands of square miles of prime industrial zoned land in the United States lie unused because of poor soil foundations while the construction of industrial facilities on reclaimed coastal land is becoming more common as port and waterfront areas become more congested.  With billions of dollars in liquefaction-related damage during recent earthquakes in California and Japan, developers and others are looking for new ways to improve the performance of soils and structures under seismic conditions.  If proven feasible and cost effective, the proposed technique will have immediate application for new construction on loose soils and dredged fill worldwide.",
