 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619062  Wagreich    The Chicago Secondary Mathematics Improvement Project is designed  to help Chicago Schools:    * implement Chicago's new graduation requirement of three years of  high school level mathematics;  * provide a quality mathematics education for all students; and  * align curriculum and teaching practices with city, state and  national goals and assessment practices.    The vehicle for attaining these goals is the Interactive  Mathematics Program (IMP) - the first of five NSF supported high  school comprehensive mathematics curriculum projects to be  completed.  The proposed project will provide a broad professional  development program for teachers who work in schools that have  elected to implement the IMP curriculum.  The project will work  with 200 teachers in approximately 15 Chicago public high schools  over three years to assist schools with IMP implementation.  Spring  and summer workshops and in-school support during the academic year  are essential components of the project.  The development of  teacher leadership and a plan for providing long-term support  beyond the funding period of the grant are also included.    The project is grounded in the experience and practice of three  years of successful, NSF-supported pilot IMP implementation in  Chicago and builds upon on work that began in 1990 as part of the  College Preparatory Mathematics Program, a project that with  partial NSF support, led to increases in student achievement and  persistence in mathematics for African American and Hispanic  students in Chicago.",
