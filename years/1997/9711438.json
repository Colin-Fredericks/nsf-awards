 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will implement irregular applications on  parallel computers by embedding ideas of nested data  parallelism into an object-oriented programming language  (Java), thus providing an architecture-independent  programming system for sparse and irregular applications.  It will investigate the following fundamental issues:  linguistic mechanisms to express concurrency, compilation  techniques to enable parallel execution, and the enrichment  of the nested data-parallel model. Data parallelism  expresses concurrency through operations over the elements  of a collection; nested data parallelism allows the elements  of a collection to themselves be collections, and extends  the model to irregular domains such as graphs and trees.  Objects provide data abstraction, encapsulation of state,  inheritance, and communication. This project will integrate  nested data parallelism with Java using a combination of  class libraries, source-to-source preprocessing, and the  concurrency mechanisms of Java. This project will carry out  the following activities. The claim of expressiveness will  be demonstrated by writing several irregular applications  (chosen from irregular mesh solvers, tree-structured  n-body methods, particle-in-cell codes, and direct and  iterative sparse matrix computations) in Java augmented with  a \"for each\" construct. Compilation techniques will be  developed for nested data parallelism embedded in Java.  This will explore the tradeoffs between two techniques:  the synchronous technique of flattening, and anasynchronous  approach involving preprocessing the nested parallelism into  standard Java, exploiting the built-in support for  concurrency in the language.  The nested data-parallel model  will be enhanced in ways such as adding new collection types  (e.g., graphs and trees) and providing compiled  communication operations (e.g., match and move).",
