 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for NSF proposal:  IBN - 9723871        A significant problem for biomedical research of nerve  tissue is the local stimulation of dendrites with bioactive  substances such as neurotransmitters.  The methods for  electrical stimulation that are commonly used  can only  reach electrically excitable membranes and cannot directly  activate the receptors of neurotransmitters. There exist  chemically inactivated and photolabile substances that allow  for adequate chemical stimulation. These so called caged  compounds can be activated by disruption of their molecular  cage with a flash of ultra-violet light. However, current  photolysis systems used for this purpose lack speed and/or  spatial accuracy.  Multisite photolysis with high spatio  temporal resolution of caged compounds would permit  experiments in isolated nerve tissue that closely resemble  the situation in the intact nervous system. This capability  would add a new dimension to neuroscience and related  biomedical fields.  It is proposed to develop an optical  stimulation system to locally release caged bioactive  compounds by means of a pulsed, scanning UV laser beam. This  novel system will make use of a scanning principle that  allows for ultrafast, accurate, and computer-controlled  random-positioning of laser beams. The proposed solution  will exceed the capability of previous photolysis systems in  its flexibility and spatio-temporal resolution by using  acousto-optical effects to control position and intensity of  the laser beam. With such devices, positioning and  modulation times are in the microsecond range, permitting  simultaneous multi-site release of caged compounds and thus  multi-site stimulation.",
