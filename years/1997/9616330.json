During the first three years  of the project, CBOLDcreated a unified database for comparative  research in Bantu based on lexical materials, including over two  dozen complete dictionaries, scores of smaller wordlists, and  other lexical databases.  Of the 500+ daughter languages in the  Bantu family, CBOLD now has representative data for over 120.   CBOLD has become a major international collaboration and now  distributes (electronically and soon by other means) these  lexicographic materials to linguists, historians, other social  scientists and even epidemiologists throughout the world. In this  second three-year period, activities at CBOLD will center around  three essential activities: 1) Development of the etymological  (comparative) component of the database; 2) Continued analysis of  linguistic phenomena as exemplified in the Bantu lexicon  (semantic, morphological, phonological); and 3) Completing the  inventory lexical material from throughout the Bantu zone. In  parallel with the CBOLD database development effort, resident and  visiting researchers at Berkeley, as well as scholars accessing  materials through our WEB site  (http://bantu.berkeley.edu/cbold.html) will continue to utilize  CBOLD to produce scholarly works in their respective fields.",
