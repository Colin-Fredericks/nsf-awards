A group of ten students will be invited to participate in ongoing research at BEN each summer for five years.  Research will involve an engineering analysis of function and structure in living systems, and in particular two main areas: sensory processing and skeletomuscular biomechanics.  The program will be housed in the Institute for Sensory Research (ISR), a world class research institute devoted to studies of the sensory systems of vision, hearing and touch.  Work in sensory processing will be carried out in the research laboratories of ISR, while that in biomechanics will occur at the nearby Laboratory for Undergraduate Biomechanics at Syracuse University, and the Orthopedics Laboratory of the SUNY Health Science Center.  Particular projects will involve both animal and human systems and such areas as 1. The electrical anatomy of the neural plexus in the horseshoe crab eye; 2. Information processing in the vertebrate retina; 3. Fundamentals of human stereoscopic vision; 4. Dynamic responses of auditory nerve fibers; 5. Acquisition and analysis of physiological responses of the human auditory periphery; 6. Mechanical properties of cervical spine tissues; 7. Replacement for the interosseous membrane of the human forearm; 8. Calcium flux changes in bone exposed to low frequency electromagnetic fields; and 9. The design and development of a swallow monitor.  Students will compare analytical approaches and instrumentation needs in the various areas and seek commonalities and differences in the variety of methods of engineering analysis of living systems.  They will also participate in an ethics symposium covering such areas as use of animals and humans in scientific experiments, the ethics of science, and the challenge of diversity in the  engineering community.  In this way, it is hoped to help in the development of bioengineers skilled in both technical areas and the ability to build a better world  ***.",
