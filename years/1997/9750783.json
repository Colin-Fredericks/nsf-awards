 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Oregon's Institute of Marine Biology has a well recognized program for undergraduates.  Courses are attended by students from both the University of Oregon and from institutions throughout the nation.  We offer students intense field oriented courses with closely correlated laboratories that cover a variety of marine science disciplines.    The problem addressed in this proposal relates primarily to our course, adaptations to the marine environment.  This course should provide students with opportunities to pose researchable questions using modern technology and equipment.  We do not have the appropriate equipment  for students to use molecular approaches to contemporary biological questions, and our physiology equipment is techniques in research by the PI, along with her background in invertebrate zoology, biochemistry and physiology, have allowed her to plan laboratory exercises giving students the opportunity to integrate cellular biology and organismal biology.    With this proposal we seek funding for equipment to implement these laboratory exercises .  Students will compare developmental changes in respiratory protein expression, ion regulation and metabolism in marine organisms they collect from nearby estuarine and coastal habitats.  They will process their experimental data and obtain a better understanding \"from molecules to mudflats\" of how organisms work.",
