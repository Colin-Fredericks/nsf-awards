 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award to Vicki L. Colvin at Rice University is supported by   the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division. The main focus   of the research will be the behavior and properties of nanomaterials from   two different aspects. The first project will address the nature of the   interface between nanoparticles such as zinc selenide, titania and   zirconia and polymers such as polyacrylates and polymethacrylates. By   exploiting the recent advances in the size and and surface control of   inorganic nanoparticles, model interfaces will be chemically created. The   effect of the interfaces on the bulk polymer structure will be explored   by NMR and thermomechanical analysis. Atomic force microscopy will be   used as a nanomechanical probe of the interfacial region.  The second project will exploit the ability to create clusters of   different sizes to probe the origins of disorder in glass.  The stability   of disordered silica clusters will be measured by monitoring the   temperature and/or pressure at which the systems undergo structural   changes.  The size dependence of cluster stability over the 1 to 100 nm   range will provide an important test for models of glass formation. Size   transformations will be probed by vibrational spectroscopy.  These projects will help bridge the gap between the laboratory synthesis   of nanoscale solids  and their ultimate use in real world technologies.  The teaching  aspect of this CAREER award will focus on the synergy   between basic and applied science in the area of materials. A graduate   level course will be developed that provides students with an   appreciation of technological issues. The curriculum will focus on the   technical assessment of three to four emerging technologies which rely on   complex materials such as read-writeable CD disks or electroluminescent   flat panel displays. Students will combine technical data from the   literature and analysis of potential markets to evaluate the potential   for these new applications. This approach will also benefit undergraduate   level courses, especially physical chemistry. Examples suggested by the   graduate course, such as the photophysics of a laser printer will be used   in lectures to illustrate the wide-ranging applications of physical   chemical principles.",
