 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Robert T. Kennedy of the Department of Chemistry at the  University of Florida is one of sixty young, independent  researchers to receive the first annual Presidential Early Career  Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE).  There are twenty  PECASE Awardees from the National Science Foundation this year.   This highly prestigious award is being given for the first time in  recognition of excellence and promise for future success in  scientific and engineering research, and the potential for eventual  leadership of the awardees in their respective fields.  Kennedy has  worked on the development and validation of electrodes that can  measure insulin and melanocyte stimulating hormone secretion from  single cells at the level of single exocytosis events, studies of  the fundamentals of exocytosis, the development of rapid  immunoassays using capillary electrophoresis, and in coupling  capillary electrophoresis with microdialysis sampling for  neurotransmitter and metabolite monitoring in vivo.  He is also  known for his genuine enthusiasm for and outstanding performance as  a classroom and as a laboratory teacher.",
