 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704269  Alford    This award provides partial support by The Division of  Materials Research, The Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities, and the Arizona State University for an X-Ray  Diffractometer (XRD) configured with a High Temperature  Sample Stage Assembly for materials research.  This  diffractometer will serve as a remote analytical tool that  can be accessed by students and researchers in the class  room and at other locations.    Students and faculty at Arizona State University (ASU) will  use the diffractometer to create new fundamental knowledge  in the science and engineering of interconnect materials  systems and processes for future (< 0.18 m) integrated  circuit technologies. Silver metallization is the technology  driver for future microelectronics interconnect systems.  This investigation concentrates on the in-situ study of  metal conductor materials (silver and its alloys) during  thermal processing in controlled ambients. This effort will  extend upon preliminary advances in both i) Ag and Cu  metallization materials science and processing and ii) x-ray  diffraction (XRD) analysis of thin film SiGeC alloys.  %%%  In collaboration with the ASU Office of Youth Preparation,  ASU undergraduates and graduate students from the Materials  Research Society (MRS) and the National Society of Black  Engineers (NSBE) will be organized and sponsored to present  science exhibitions to Elementary and High Schools in  Phoenix. Students from MRS and NSBE will conduct XRD  demonstrations at the local schools and will be able to  control the tool remotely via a Internet connection.    A x-ray characterization course is being planned and will be  offered at ASU in collaboration with Maricopa Community  College District.  This course is on modern XRD analysis  techniques for specimen analysis and it will be delivered to  ASU students, Community College students, and local  industry.    This unique analysis tool will complement characterization  facilities provided by the ASU Center for Solid  State  Science as well as the High Resolution X-ray Facility.  This  organizational structure leverages facilities and integrates  a number of research and education programs at ASU,  including the Alliance for Minority Programs at ASU, the NSF-  funded curriculum development grant in the Synthesis and  Processing of Materials, and the NSF/University/State Center  for Low Power Electronics.  ***",
