A key problem in MMICs, the performance of the ferrite devices within such circuits as the circuits become smaller in size, and as they are required to operate at higher frequencies, will be investigated.  It is known but not understood that the performance of the ferrite circulator within the MMIC depends very strongly on the ferrite thickness.  The Principal Investigator will calculate analytically and numerically the magnetostatic modes in the microwave spectra of planar ferrite with inhomogeneous magnetization distribution.  The validity of the theoretical work will be also checked by measuring the thickness dependence of the Ferromagnetic Resonance Spectra of a series of thick single crystal ferrite films.  The results will be disseminated through journal publications, conference participation and the development of an undergraduate research program and revised laboratory course which includes microwave magnetism.",
