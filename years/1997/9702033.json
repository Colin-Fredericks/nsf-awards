 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sinervo  9702033           Adaptive phenotypic plasticity is fundamentally a  developmental phenomenon; expression of developmental pathways is  modified in response to environmental cues, generating continuous  trait variation or discrete, alternative morphologies.  Understanding the proximate developmental basis of such plasticity  can reveal much about the general role of development in  evolution.         Experimental manipulation of four species of spadefoot toad  tadpoles will be used to investigate the proximate developmental  basis underlying the production of a derived, inducible larval  morphology. When typical, omnivorous larvae of some species in  this clade consume prey high in thyroid hormone (TH), they may  undergo transition to an adaptive, carnivorous tadpole.  Manipulating TH levels in larvae from these species tests  hypotheses addressing the role of TH in inducing the alternative  morph. Similar manipulations of larvae from species that do not  naturally become carnivorous tests hypotheses addressing how  environmental factors (diet high in TH) may have perturbed  development in the common ancestor, initiating evolution of the  fully adapted plastic response seen today in the more derived  species.         Such an integrative approach may elucidate how proximate  developmental mechanisms influence the route by which novel traits  are produced, predisposing the production of certain phenotypes  and influencing the path of evolutionary change.",
