 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Art Rodriguez of   East Carolina University and Ned H. Martin of The University of North   Carolina at Wilmington in their ongoing measurements of spin-lattice   relaxation rates as a function of temperature and field strength, in   various organic solvents.  Their goals are (i) to determine the magnitude   of the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) and spin rotation (SR)   contributions to the spin-lattice relaxation rate of   buckminsterfullerene(C60) in various solvents; (ii) to determine the   relative importance of solute-solvent interactions and solvent free   volume on the magnitude of the CSA and SR contributions; (iii) to model   C60 in the various solvents; and (iv) to extend these studies to C70.    Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation measurements are one of the   most powerful techniques for investigating a variety of condensed phase   phenomena.  The discovery of buckminsterfullerene and other related   fullerenes has generated a great deal of interest into the study of its   chemical as well as its physical properties.  While a number of   researchers have focused on investigating the solid state NMR properties   of this molecule, very few details are known concerning the condensed   phase carbon-13 spin-lattice relaxation rate and factors affecting this   mode of relaxation.",
