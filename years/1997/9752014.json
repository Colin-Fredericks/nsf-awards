In this study, government agencies, businesses and industries are contacted to determine to identify the common core of skills needed by visualization technicians and to determine future national trends in the skill levels needed. Two year colleges are contacted to determine what level of education is being offered and to share curricula.  Information is also gathered at various conferences on visualization and related topics. A web page carries the information.  The information is used to establish skill standards and curricula for community colleges educating technicians for these industries.",
