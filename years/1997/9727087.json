The co-investigators are Sadik  Kakac of the University of Miami and P.K. Sarma of Andhra University  in Visakhaputnam.  The investigations on two-phase flow instabilities and  heat transfer in horizontal in-tube boiling and condensing systems are   experimental and theoretical.  The main objectives of the research are to  study the fundamental mechanisms of various boiling and condensing two-  phase flow instabilities, the parametric effects on these instabilities, the  interaction between heat transfer and these instabilities, and to model these  complicated phenomena mathematically.  By combining their expertise, the  investigators expect to be able to reveal the similar fundamental physical  mechanism of both boiling and condensing flows dynamics and heat  transfer, and to further clarify the differences between the two physical  phenomena.       Scope:  This joint project resulted from an NSF supported workshop held  at Andhra University in 1995.  The research is complementary and  mutually beneficial.  The US PI has extensive research experience in the  study of boiling flow instabilities and oscillations; while the Indian PI has  extensive experience in the study of condensing heat transfer and  dynamics.  Accordingly, experiments in boiling two-phase flow  instabilities will be conducted at Miami, while the two-phase flow  condensation instabilities and heat transfer experiments will be done at  Andhra.  Research teams at both universities will participate in each  other's experimental investigations, and in the theoretical model  development.  As a new collaboration and for its involvement of students  in the research, this project supports INT objectives.      ***",
