 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603976  Truman    To be adaptive, an animal's behavior must change depending  on the organism's physiological and developmental state.  The behavior is typically organized in stereotyped sequences  that progress through discrete behavioral phases each  characterized by its suite of motor acts.  Neuropeptides,  small protein-like substances that are released into the  blood or locally within the nervous system, are thought to  play important roles in inducing and maintaining such  behavioral phases.  Using a relatively simple invertebrate  system, Dr. Truman is examining how specific behaviors are  controlled by these peptide modulators.  He has proposed a  model in which each behavioral phase is controlled by a  different neuromodulator.  Employing a variety of  electrophysiological, neurochemical, and molecular and  genetic techniques with a combination of in vitro and in  vivo analyses, Dr. Truman will examine whether a hierarchy  of neuroendocrine interactions is then responsible for the  progression through a specific behavioral sequence.  He will  determine whether the basic organization of this cascade is  that the hormone modulator directing the behavior for one  phase also acts on the neuroendocrine cells that contain the  neuromodulator for the next phase.   The results from this  comprehensive series of studies will provide new knowledge  on the role of neuropeptides in the functioning of the  nervous system and the mechanisms used by peptides to alter  behavior.  This fundamental research may also serve as the  foundation for the development and application of practical  procedures in controlling agricultural and medical insect  pests.",
