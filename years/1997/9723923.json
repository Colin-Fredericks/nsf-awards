 "awd_abstract_narration": "Guo, P.  MCB 9723923  Technical  A virus-encoded RNA (pRNA) is required for the packaging of phage phi29 dsDNA into a preformed procapsid during maturation. Packing of DNA also requires the DNA packaging protein gp16, ATP and Mg++.  A highly sensitive in vitro assembly system has been established to study phi29 DNA package.  With the aid of pRNA and cloned gene products, DNA can be packaged in vitro with up to 90% efficiency and up to 108 plaque forming units per ml of infectious virions can be assembled without background.  In the presence of MG++, 6 pRNAs bind to the protal vertex of procapsids (the site of DNA entry) and are released after DNA packaging is completed.  It is known that the pRNA has two functional domains, one for procapsid binding and one for an unknown but essential role. The requirement of the pRNA for ATPase activity of the DNA packing protein suggests a role for the pRNA in the energetics of package.  The hypothesis being tested is that the pRNA, acting as part of a DNA packing ATPase, undergoes a series of conformational changes during DNA packaging.  The conformation of the pRNA in the presence of ATP is investigated by chemical and nuclease probing and crosslinking.    Non technical  The study of pRNA conformational changes as it relates to phage phi29 DNA packaging is to provide basic information regarding viral assembly, RNA structure, bioenergetics, and molecular motion.  As the involvement of the phi29 pRNA in DNA translocation is unique among known RNA functions, investigation of the structure and function of this molecule has broad significance to the mechanisms of RNA/ATP, RNA/Mg++, RNA/protein, RNA/DNA, and RNA/RBNA interactions.  Additionally, the study of the phi29 DNA translocation process may have relevance to other DNA translocation enzymes, such as helicase, as both processes can utilize ring-shaped structures with six-fold symmetry.",
