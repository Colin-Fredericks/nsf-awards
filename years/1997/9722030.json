 "awd_abstract_narration": "P I:  Fred E. Lytle    The objective of this project is to create standard reference  materials for a freshman-level chemistry course that will be  accessible to blind and visually impaired students.  The  reference packet\" will consist of braille, tactile diagrams,  audiotactile diagrams, and a tactile model kit.  Standard  procedures for producing tactile and audiotactile diagrams will  be created, refined, and disseminated to educators of visually  impaired students.  The project will use the latest advances in  adaptive technology for blind and visually impaired people.  Several different tactile media will be used, including high-  grade vacuum-molded plastics, the flexible tactile imaging paper  produced by Repro-Tronics, and various textured media as part of  the model kit.  Hardware such as the NOMAD (TM) touch tablet and  the Edmark Touch Window (TM) will be used to display the  information contained in audiotactile graphics.  The software to  be used will consist of AudioCAD (R), AudioPiCS (R), AutoCAD (R),  and some custom software developed as part of the project.  The  project should provide significant assistance to blind students  in several areas.  First, blind students at many institutions  will have access to standard reference materials that can be used  as a supplement to almost any General Chemistry course.  Second,  standards for tactile and audiotactile diagrams will be  developed.  Third, a document detailing the process by which  these diagrams can be made will be developed and disseminated.",
