 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Valerie Walters of   Lafayette College in her research studies on the triplet states of   halogenated porphyrins using phosphorescence, triplet-triplet absorption   and transient resonance Raman spectroscopies.  The overall goal of these   studies is to investigate the effect of various halogen substituents in   the beta-pyrrole and phenyl ring positions on triplet state geometry,   electronic structure and lifetime.   Semiempirical calculations will also   be carried out to aid in the spectral analysis.       Porphyrins have long been used as catalysts in oxidation and   photooxidation reactions.  Recent work has found that halogen (chlorine,   bromine, fluorine, iodine) substituents substantially increase the   stability of porphyrin catalysts.  Thus, much experimental and   computational work has been performed to investigate the effect of   halogens on the properties of the porphyrin electron ground state.    However, very little work has been carried out on the excited (triplet)   state properties, despite the fact that porphyrins are widely used   triplet state photosensitizers for singlet oxygen.   These studies will   make a significant contribution to our understanding of the energetics of   this increasingly important class of molecules.",
