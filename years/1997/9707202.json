 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9707202  PULAY  The Theoretical and Computational chemistry program is supporting Prof.   Pulay of the University of Arkansas for work to improve the efficiency of   SCF and density functional methods: the multi-Fock technique, and novel   basis sets.  In another project, further development of the local   correlation method is proposed: gradients and a simplified treatment of   distant pairs.  The latter constitute the majority of electron pairs in   large molecules.  Density functional theory (DFT), in spite of its   convincing success for ground states, is still not applicable to excited   states.  A project uill explore the use of empirical correlation terms,   borrowed from DFT, together with exact exchange, to describe excited   states and diradicals.  Pulay proposes to build a powerful parallel   computer system for quantum chemical calculations, using commodity PC   parts.  The price of the proposed system is estimated to be about a tenth   of a comparable system using workstations.  Several applications are   proposed: (1) geometries, force fields and vibrational spectra of   porphyrins, (2) systematic calculation and parameterization of NMR shifts   in peptides as functions of the backbone torsional angles, (3)   parameterization of the vibrational force fields of 200 organic   molecules, generated under the preceding grant, (4) search for novel   stable molecules, such as the cyclic polymers of phosgene and related   molecules.    The effort during this award is aimed at increasing the efficiency and   accuracy of quantum mechanical simulation of molecular systems.  Such   simulations are likely to lead to fundamental innovations in chemistry,   biochemistry and materials science in the future, by allowing the rapid   computational determination of the properties of chemical systems and   materials.  Accurate solutions of the quantum mechanical equations for   larger molecules requires very much computer power, and has become   possible only recently due to the development of new  algorithms and   inexpensive fast computers.  The proposal lists several projects that, if   successful, will increase the efficiency of molecular quantum   calculations, or extend the applicability of present methods, for   example. to excited electronic states.  The work includes the   construction of a parallel computer, based on commodity personal computer   parts.       ***",
