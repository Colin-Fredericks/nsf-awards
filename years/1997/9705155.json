 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705155    Oseroff    We will perform a systematic research on 2D and 3D    perovskites.  The first part is a study of La2NiO4 and    La2CuO4 doped with Sr and Li, which will be carried out    mainly by Electron Spin Resonance, ESR.  Li+ brings a hole    into the plane and this hole appears to be localized.  This    work offers the possibility of comparing systems with in-    plane holes to those with mobile ones introduced by out-of-    plane substitutions.    The second part is connected with the huge magnetoresistive  response found in the perovskite manganate R1-xBxMnO3 with (R=La,  Pr, etc. and B = Ca, Sr, etc.).  We will perform:  a) An ESR  study between Tc and high T.  b) Research on small grain size  particles of Lal-xCaxMnO3+ from 20 nm to 100 nm. c) Measurements  on diluted systems, such as LaScO3+: Mn.  This research should  provide new insight into the underlying physics of these systems  and hopefully lead to better theoretical models.  %%%  Non-Technical abstract  In 1986 Bednorz and Muller discovered that doped La2CuO4 becomes  a High Temperature Superconductor, HTS.  Since then an enormous  effort has been made by a large number of experimentalists and  theoreticians to understand the origin of high-temperature  superconductivity.  In spite of the tremendous efforts made, no  consensus has been reached.  We are going to carry out a  systematic analysis of the data already reported.  This, in  conjuction with a few well selected experiments, should help us  understand the underlying physics of these fascinating and  possibly useful materials.  We will follow this by carrying out  measurements on members of a similar family, doped LaMnO3. These  systems share important features with the HTS materials, and they  have a great potential for boosting storage density by becoming  the magnetic sensors of the future.  ***",
