There is much evidence to argue that  the mechanical response of  the host olivine influences kinetics and fabric development  during transformation.  These mechanical effects should be most  profound in low temperature environments within subducting  lithospheric slabs where olivine is relatively strong.  Phase  transformation and the resulting  metamorphic fabrics it produces can have a strong influence on  the behavior of a subducting slab because transformation in the  slab determines its relative buoyancy as well as its strength.  The PIs will develop numerical models of the mechanical  interactions between parent and  daughter phases during transformation, guided by observations of  experimentally produced transformation microstructures collected  over a wide range of pressure, temperature and stress conditions.  ***",
