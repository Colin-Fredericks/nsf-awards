Lin   Penn State University    PROJECT SUMMARY      A major objective of the National Science Foundation is to improve the   nation's capacity for intellectual and economic growth.  It does this by supporting the discovery of new knowledge and the   enhancement of a skilled workforce.  American industry is becoming increasingly aware of the benefits   of running statistically designed experiments.  In complex experimental work, the number of potential factors is   large, but often only a few active factors are expected.  A problem frequently encountered is how to   identify the factors that matter, and consequently  improve the quality and productivity of the products.  The basic results we hope to obtain here will be extremely   useful to practitioners, since new designs will be furnished   that will save considerable cost when real world issues are involved.    When the number of potential factors is large and   only a few active factors are expected,  we do not need unbiased estimates to detect those active factors.  In this project, we propose the use of supersaturated   designs  --  allowing for a slight bias in estimation but   significantly reducing the design size in experimental work.  Some initial results were actually utilized in electronic   and chemical industries (specifically, IBM and Lonza).  The proposed methodology helps extract useful information that   may not be provided by \"traditional wisdom.\"  From these practical experiences, it is anticipated that a much   wider application is possible.  On the other hand, this research has broad theoretical implications.   Some theoretical results have been obtained, and  it is shown that those results can be applied  to other statistical areas, such as linear models,   information theory and optimal design.  Another statistical area that has received a great deal of   attention in industry involves reliability problems.  The estimation of system (or component) reliability    is a common problem for many industries.  When a system consists of several components, and when the   cause of failure is unspecified, the estimation problem is   unresolved. This project proposes the use of a Bayesian approach.  Some initial results applied to IBM PS/2 personal computer data   have been obtained.  More general fundamental research will be   further studied.  Problems given here are very specific to be  realistically solved during the funding period.  However, it has a much wider research impact for both industrial   applications or academia type research.",
