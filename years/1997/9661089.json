 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  96-61089  Kalkhoran    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate large area cold cathode arrays for field emission displays based on gallium nitride/aluminum nitride (GaN-AlN) alloys grown in a low-temperature plasma-assisted, chemical vapor deposition and surface texturing facility.  With a bandgap of 6.2 electron volts, AIN may exhibit negative electron affinity, and thus electrons emanating from the high conductivity GaN contact will readily pass through the graded AI/Ga nitride region and be emitted into vacuum at low applied voltages.  GaN stripes deposited on glass or another substrate will form row electrodes, while indium tin oxide (ITO) stripes above the phosphor on the faceplate will serve as column electrodes.  Due to the expected negative electron affinity of AIN, no grid may be required.  This new cathode material can alleviate the present high voltage problems associated with high work-function metal \"microtip\" cathodes, as well as the lack of n-type conductivity in thin film diamond cathodes.  Coupled with on-going development of cathodoluminescent phosphors, the GaN/AlN cold cathode research will enable manufacture of flat panel displays under controlled conditions with cathode and phosphor components.  In Phase II, the GaN/AlN alloy cold cathodes would be optimized and used for lighting pixels on faceplates coated with cathodoluminescent phosphors, demonstrating an operating flat panel display.  Efficient cold cathode field emitters will find extensive commercial use in flat panel displays.  They can also be used in new sub-miniature vacuum tubes for ultra-high frequency applications, such as in communications systems.  ***",
