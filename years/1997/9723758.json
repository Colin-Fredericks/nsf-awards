 "awd_abstract_narration": "Garland  9723758              The proposed research will test hypotheses concerning the  morphological and physiological determinants of interspecific  variation in locomotor performance of lizards. This will  constitute one of the first integrative, multilevel studies of  locomotor abilities in any group of animals. It will provide  unique information concerning the mechanisms underlying the  origin of biological diversity in performance abilities. It may  also provide important clues as to how adaptation can overcome  potential morphological and physiological constraints. Because  the lizards to be studied are fairly generalized in their  locomotor modes, the results will also provide an important  baseline for future investigations of other tetrapod groups.       Members of the North American family Phrynosomatidae will be  emphasized because this group is readily accessible and exhibits  a remarkable diversity of ecology, behavior, locomotor abilities,  and morphology. Endurance running capacity will be measured on a  motorized treadmill. Maximal sprint running speed will be  measured both on a photocell-timed racetrack, an established  method, and on a high speed treadmill. A range of traits that  probably affect speed, endurance, or both will be studied for  approximately 19 species of Phrynosomatidae and 11 outgroup  species, including body size, fimb and tail proportions, body  temperature, and muscle fiber type composition.",
