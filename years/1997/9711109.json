 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT      Proposal Number:   CTS-9711109  Principal Investigator:  Bechtel,  Ohio State      This is a grant to characterize materials in the manufacturing and agricultural processes of fiber spinning and spraying.  This is an extension of previous research in which analysis and computer codes were created and utilized in  experimental measurements of the material properties necessary to characterize behavior in fiber spinning and spraying.  Accurate characterization of these properties, specifically dynamic surface tension, elongational viscosity, relaxation times, and others, is critical to the understanding and modeling of these processes.  To measure the flow properties relevant to fiber spinning and spraying processes, the rheometer must measure the properties of the fluid in the appropriate state, under the same flow conditions and history, and in the same short time scales.    The principal investigators now propose to bring this research to bear on applications developed with an industrial partner (Hoechst Celanese Corporation) and a government agency (US Department of Agriculture), defined by their needs and concerns, and with clear engineering emphasis and payoff.  A new rheometer, developed by a colleague, Dr. Kurt Koelling will be used to: (1) undertake a systematic elongational characterization of polymer solutions, employing the technique demonstrated in  1  both to produce the best characterization of a fluid within a given constitutive assumption, and to sift through a battery of proposed constitutive models to select the best model, (2) extend the characterization technique to allow for multiple relaxation times, (3) remove the requirement of a force measurement in the technique, (4) adapt the apparatus for the dynamic measurement of surface tension of newly formed surfaces (on the order of a millisecond), and, on a longer time frame, (5) extend the method to unsteady and non-isothermal behavior, and (6) characterize the coupling of the development of orientation in t he filament to flow.  The collaboration with Prof. Koelling will continue.",
