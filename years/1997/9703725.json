 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a systematic approach to integrating optimization algorithms, seismic reliability engineering and scio-economics for determination of target reliabilities and formulation of cost-effectiveness design and upgrading of earthquake-resistant reinforced concrete structures.  Cooperative research will be carried out at the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) and the University of California, Irvine (UCI).  The following tasks will be conducted at UCI. (1)  Approach for determination of optimal target reliability to revise and extend a platform for the systematic integration of the technical and scio-economic aspects of earthquake engineering: (2) Appraisal of current seismic criteria to examine the cost-effectiveness of specific existing criteria for earthquake-resistant design from the standpoint of minimum expected life-cycle cost; and (3) Critical examination and development of cost models to review and examine the available scio-economic models and information, including calibration and validation with recent earthquake damage data, and develop new or revised models for the proposal of reliability-based optimum design and upgrading of seismic resistant structures.  At UMR the following five tasks will be considered.  (1) Development of multi-objective optimization with fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm for target reliability constraints; (2) Development of computer program with building code requirements such as UBC 1994 for optimum design and upgrading of reinforced concrete structures;  (3) Numerical studies of typical low-rise and high-rise office and apartment buildings for various seismic zones and target reliabilities; (4) Damage control of optimal-designed structures through nonlinear analysis; and (5) Assessment of design building code requirements and recommendations.  Through collaboration and integration the joint effort is expected to establish a systematic procedure for determining optimal target reliability or acceptable risk for the design or upgrading of a specific structure or class of structures; (2) advance optimization technique with multi-objective function, robust and global convergence, target reliability as well as minimum expected life-cycle costs; and (3) make recommendation of optimal building code requirements to the professional community and building code writers.",
