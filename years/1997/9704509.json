 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coleman  9704509       The investigator and his colleagues focus on the efficient  numerical computation of global solutions of problems of  nonlinear elastostatics in a high-performance computational  environment.  Particular attention is paid to the global  post-critical behavior of symmetric imperfection-free elastic  shell structures --- the analysis of which has great significance  in understanding the large deformation response and ultimate  collapse scenario of realistic engineering structures.  A major  theme of the work is to exploit the natural parallelism, via  group theoretic techniques, in an important class of engineering  problems characterized by underlying symmetries.  They also  investigate the use of automatic differentiation software in the  context of those problems.  Finally, they study the effectiveness  of symmetry-motivated preconditioners, within the context of  Krylov iterative subspace methods, for a class of  ``almost-symmetric'' problems in structural mechanics.       Due to their high strength-to-weight ratios, thin shell  structures have been used extensively in aerospace, civil,  mechanical and nuclear engineering applications, e.g., dome  roofs, aerospace vehicles, pressure vessels, containment vessels,  etc.   Yet the ability of engineers to predict the ultimate  failure of such systems has heretofore been more of an art than a  science (relying heavily upon costly experimental verification --  see \"Computerized Buckling Analysis of Shells\", by D. Bushnell,  Martinus Nijhoff 1985).  The investigators combine new  mathematical ideas of symmeytry and nonlinear analysis with  high-performance computing methodology to analyze such systems  efficiently and systematically.  A long-term goal is to provide  engineers with useful tools for the sytematic analysis (and  ultimately better design) for this important class of structures.  Funding for the project is provided by the Computational  Mathematics program and the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities in MPS and b y the New Technologies program in CISE.",
