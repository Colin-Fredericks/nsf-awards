The symposium will bring together 250 representatives from all segments of the mathematics community to consider issues surrounding the content and teaching of school algebra.  Goals of the symposium are:  to promote an informed dialogue on issues concerning the K-14 algebra curriculum;  to provide examples of students' algebraic thinking,  synthesize research, and examine impact the reality of algebra in the school curriculum;  to provide a forum for elementary, middle, high school and post-secondary curriculum projects to share their interpretations of algebra;  and to prepare participants to replicate similar symposia on a smaller scale in their local regions.  The Algebra Symposium is funded by NSF at $77,965 with cost-sharing of at least $20,000.",
