 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710105  Holmgren  In a comprehensive two-year planning process begun in the early 1990s, The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) developed a Master Plan for the years 1993 through 1999 intended to clarify and document the institution's priorities and commitments for the future. The construction and endowment of a Plant Studies Center to allow expansion of the currently crowded herbarium and library collections, to store the collections under state-of-the-an environmental conditions, to provide space for their growth through at least 2020, and to provide nine study rooms for scholars visiting the Herbarium merged as the centerpiece of the Master Plan and is the largest single investment NYBG is making in its future. A campaign was conducted to fund the needs outlined in the Master Plan, including $33,000,000 for the construction and endowment of and the equipment for the Plant Studies Center. Funds needed for both the construction and endowment of the Plant Studies Center and the compact storage equipment for the Library and 65% ($1,621,178) of the cost of compact storage equipment for the Herbarium were raised in the campaign. Funds to cover the remaining 37% ($952,121) of the cost of the compact storage equipment for the Herbarium are provided by this award.",
