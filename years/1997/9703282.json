 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - McKay    A large amount of recent theoretical and experimental work has  shown that gravitational lensing effects afford our best  opportunity to directly measure the abundance and distribution of  total mass in the universe. Recent work has extended the  measurement of mass distributions from the strong lensing regime  of multiple quasar images and giant arcs to the weaker lensing  effects seen in the periphery of massive clusters of galaxies.  With the unique wide field imaging system of the Sloan Digital  Sky Survey (SDSS), it will be possible to extend such lensing  studies to very wide fields, and study density variations in the  universe independent of the bias between luminous and dark  matter. The weak lensing technique is the only way to directly  probe large scale structures in the mass density of the universe,  and the SDSS offers the only opportunity to do this over a large  fraction of the sky. These methods will be used to measure the  surface density of matter over one fourth  of the sky, to probe  the evolution of this density field using photometric and  spectroscopic redshifts, to measure directly the bias between the  observed local distribution of luminous matter and the underlying  mass distribution, and to measure the lensing mass of nearby  clusters like the Coma cluster. This is a difficult program,  requiring careful control of systematic errors, but the SDSS is  exceedingly well designed to meet these challenges. A  complementary program would search for quasar lenses within the  SDSS data for use in related studies.    Data generated by the SDSS will be used both for traditional  graduate and undergraduate research, and also as a tool for  bringing current research into the introductory classroom.  Advanced undergraduate students will be involved in  designing a  set of tools, using the SDSS data, to illustrate important  scientific principles. These tools will be used in a \"hands-on\"  cosmology class for entering non-science majors, in large  standard intro ductory physics classes, and will be distributed  through existing teacher outreach programs.  There will  be  continued efforts to improve the quality of standard  undergraduate teaching at the University of Michigan, and to  continue SDSS public information programs and a successful public  lecture series.    This project is a five year program that will enable a faculty  member at the University of Michigan to  develop further as an  astrophysics researcher and an educator. The grant will  support  the faculty member, a graduate student, and a number of  undergraduates in their analysis of gravitational lensing effects  in data to be obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. There is  also support to use the SDSS data in the development of new  educational materials for use in a variety of classroom  situations.",
