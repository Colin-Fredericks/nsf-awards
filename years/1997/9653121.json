 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the problem that students with disabilities in grade 7 through university do not have equal access to biological laboratories leading to under representation in life sciences. The goal is to develop resources that can be used nationally to assist biological educators in designing appropriate laboratory exercises for students with disabilities. The objectives are: (i) to develop a Source Book to assist educators in creating effective learning by students with disabilities in any latural/physical science laboratory (ii) to develop adaptive laboratory manuals in Biological Sciences (iii) to train biological educators (college and grades 7-12) in the use of the Source Book and adaptive laboratory manuals. The proposed methods are: (a) Resources will be developed by project coordinators, educators, students and external consultants. Resources will be tested by educators in the field, and refined before dissemination. (b) Biological educators will be trained in the use of the resources by attending a 2 week summer workshop and participating in a Field Test year at their home institution. Selected educators will develop leadership skills to enable them to train other educators. The special audience targeted by the project are educators of students with disabilities from 7th grade onward. The significance/impact of the proposed project is that students with disabilities will be better prepared in laboratory biology starting in 7th grade which will increase their representation in life science. Disseminable products of this grant will be the Source Book (applicable to any experimental science), subject specific adaptive laboratory manuals for Biological Sciences, and trained human resources. The project will be evaluated internally, externally and within the academic community.",
