The researchers will be undertaking studies relating  to nuclei with double strangeness.  Our understanding of the  structure of the nucleon and the interactions between  nucleons is based on quark-gluon inspired models which, at  this time, include a mix of phenomenological inputs.  These  models will be tested and refined by extending them into  systems which contain strange-quarks in addition to the up-  and down- quarks found in the neutron and proton.    Systems with two strange-quarks are particularly  interesting.  They can be created using  beams of K- mesons  and identifying reactions which result in an outgoing K+  meson.  At present, two suitable beamlines exist in the  world; one at Brookhaven National Labs and one in Japan at  the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics.  The  operational parameters of the two lines differ considerably.  Researchers from both countries will cooperate to maximize  the utilization of these two beam lines by targeting  appropriate experiments and sharing resources, knowledge,  and manpower.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology,  this project will broaden our base of  basic knowledge and  promote international understanding and cooperation.  ***",
