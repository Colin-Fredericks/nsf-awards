To accomplish these objectives we   consider finite element methods based on application of least-squares   variational principles. Such principles offer significant computational   and theoretical advantages that are not present in other discretization   schemes, e.g., mixed Galerkin methods. Most notably, corresponding   least-squares methods are not subject to stability constraints, such as   the inf-sup condition, and lead to symmetric and positive definite   algebraic problems. The principal objective of the research will be to   develop, analyze and implement finite element methods that can fully  exploit the inherent advantages of the least-squares formalism,   especially in the context of realistic applications. Our efforts here   will be guided by the impact of both the mathematical structure of model   problems and the computational features of least-squares principles   upon the algorithmic design of the methods. The research will be carried   in the context of systems of partial differential equations that are   compact perturbations of linear elliptic operators. Least-squares   principles for these systems are obtained through minimization of    problem-dependent, norm-equivalent functionals. As a result,   discretization   of the associated Euler-Lagrange equations leads to systems of nonlinear   algebraic equations having symmetric and positive definite Jacobians.  These equations are solved using Newton linearization combined with   robust continuation techniques. To address large-scale computations, at   each Newton step the linearized systems are solved using robust   preconditioned iterative methods implemented without assembly of the   discretization matrix. Design of efficient preconditioners for these   iterative solvers will exploit novel ideas, including the use of negative    norms in the least-squares functionals.    With the advent of new and more powerful digital computers numerical   simulation is emerging as a viable and cost-effective alternative to   expensive field experiments and tests. However, despite the increased   computational power there is still a real and existing need to develop   fast and robust computer algorithms for a wide range of industrial   applications. This is especially true for applications involving numerical   solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. The tremendous practical   importance of these equations stems from their fundamental role    in the modeling of fluid flows arising in such diverse applications as   atmospheric motions, flow of air around aircraft, and lubrication of ball   bearings. At the same time numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes   equations in realistic settings remains difficult and computationally   challenging. Indeed, large-scale solution of these equations in three   dimensions required in applications such as weather forecast, hurricane  tracking, and modeling of air pollution, continues to be an outstanding   problem which motivates this research project. Our principal goal is to   develop new, reliable and accurate numerical algorithms for the Navier-Stokes   equations that can be used for computations carried in realistic settings. To   accomplish this we explore alternative ways to discretize the model problem,   i.e., to replace this model by a set of equations that can be solved on a   computer. The research will focus on the development of novel discretization   techniques leading to equations that require less computational resources and   that are easier to solve than the equations obtained by standard methods. This   allows us to develop more robust, faster and easier to use codes. In addition   to fluid flow problems the research will also target numerical solution of  mathematical models arising in elasticity, electromagnetics and   reaction-diffusion applications, among others.",
