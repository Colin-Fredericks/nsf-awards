 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project focuses on two  important areas in tolerating  resource dynamicism: architecture-  independent checkpointing (AIC) and  primitives for high availability.  Architecture-independent  checkpointing is the ability  to save the execution state of a  program in a machine independent  manner so that it may be restored on  a different processing platform.  This could be on a different  machine, or for a parallel program,  a different parallel processing  environment.  The PI is attacking  AIC from different angles. These are  applicationspecific AIC in  ScaLAPACK, semi-transparent to  transparent AIC for C and Fortran  programs, AIC of Java applications,  and AIC of HighPerformance Fortran  applications.  The result will be a  collection of methods for and  implementations of AIC for a variety  of widely used computing tools.  The  second portion of this research  project is to design and implement  primitives for high availability in  three currently popular tools for  distributed computing: ScaLAPACK,  MPI, and Java.  Currently, each is  limited in its support.  Occurrences  such as failures, processor  revocation and subsequent  availability, network partitions,  and planned shutdowns are not  accommodated.  The PI plans to  address these deficiencies. The  result will be more robust tools for  distributed computing, plus  methodologies that may be  incorporated into the design of  future tools.",
