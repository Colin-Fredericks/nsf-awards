Workshop topics, developed from a survey distributed to two-year faculty in four states, include: biopsychology, research methodology and statistics, implementation of technology in psychology courses and its effect on student performance, and the integration of multiculturalism into the curriculum. Follow-up activities include the development of teaching modules based on workshop topics and a one-day return workshop at PGCC during spring 1998.    Some of the speakers who have agreed to address these topics and work with the faculty in developing their teaching modules include: Thomas V. McGovem, Arizona State West; Douglas A. Bemstein, University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign; Virginia Andreoli Mathie, James Madison University; Kent Norman, University of Maryland at College Park, Jill (Alice) Nagy Reich, American Psychological Association; F. Scott Hall, University of Maryland at College Park and the National Institutes of Health; Colleen McHale Mansbach, University of Maryland at College Park; Bertha G. Holliday, American Psychological Association; and Robin Hailstorks, Prince George's Community College.",
