 "awd_abstract_narration": "Study   of   failure  mechanisms  in   bimaterial   and  multiphase  material systems is motivated by the  industrial  importance  of  multiphase  components  made  from   metals,  ceramics  and polymer composite materials.  An understanding  of   failure   modes  in  these  systems  is   relevant   in  applications   ranging  from  advanced  composite   aircraft  structures  to packaging of electronic devices.  Failure  in  such  systems can be due to a variety of mechanisms:  macro-  and  microcracking  of  a  brittle  matrix,  cracking  along  interfaces  between dissimilar materials, delaminations  and  so on depending on the specifics of the material system.       Under  a  prior research grant from the NSF,  the  PI's  research  group has developed a compact Polariscope/Shearing  Interferometer  (PSI)  that  can  be  used   as   either   a  polariscope  or  a  shearing  interferometer.   This  single  device  allows  one to obtain stress states  from  optically  anisotropic materials (such as Homolite and epoxy)  as  well  as  essentially optically isotropic materials (such as  PMMA  and  glass).  The range of material mismatch parameters that  can   be  provided  by  combining  optically  isotropic  and  anisotropic model materials essentially spans the range that  is   typically   obtained   in   technologically   important  bimaterial  systems,  consequently results  from  the  model  material   combinations  have  wide  ranging  applicability.  Direct   optical   data  regarding  crack  initiation   from  statically-loaded bimaterial systems have been obtained.       In   this   work,  full-field  optical  interferometric  information  will be obtained about the stress state  around  quasi-statically propagating interfacial and sub-interfacial  cracks.   The  optical interferometers previously  developed  for  monitoring crack initiation will be used in this  study  in  conjunction with a relatively high-speed video  recorder  (6000   frames/see)  to  monitor  quasi-static  propagation.  Simultaneous  with the video recording of the optical  data,  load  and load-point displacement data will also be recorded  using  a  load  cell  and  a  linearly-varying  displacement  transducer mounted on the loading device, and these will  be  used   in  numerical  modeling  that  can  be  of   use   in  interpreting the experimental data.  A series of experiments  on  bimaterial  and  multilayer sandwich specimens  will  be  conducted.  Phenomena of particular interest are:  *  the  interfacial crack propagation regime where the crack     propagates   entirely  on  the  interface   between   two     dissimilar materials;  *  the  crack kinking regime where the crack starts from the     interface   but  kinks  into  the  material  with   lower     toughness;  *  the  sub-interfacial crack propagation regime  after  the     crack  kinks  from  the interface and  continues  in  the     material with lower toughness;  *  the crack tunneling mechanisms in sandwiched layers.  The  data  gathered,  and  the  analysis  performed,  should  provide  us  with additional information to  gain  a  better  understanding   of   crack  kinking  and   crack   tunneling  phenomena,  in addition to substantiating the current  state  of  knowledge of issues of interfacial crack initiation  and  crack paralleling.",
