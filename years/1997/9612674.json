Among these are  What are the critical  factors that  actually trigger  convection and tornadoes?          This is a three-year project whose objective is to understand  better the ways  in which severe convective storms form and behave. A combination of  analyses of  data from the Verification of Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes  Experiment  (VORTEX) conducted in the Southern Plains of the U. S. in 1994 and  1995,  conventional data sets, and advanced mesoscale numerical weather  models will be  used to achieve the objectives of this research.  Areas of focus  include the effects of  small-scale variations in surface characteristics and clouds on  storms initiated near  the dryline, tornadogenesis, and the relationship between the  environment and the  mode of initial storm formation on the subsequent evolution of  severe convective  storms. The results of this research will improve our ability to  forecast severe  weather in the Plains region of the U. S.              ***",
