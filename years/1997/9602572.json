 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602572  Dodds    Dr. Walter Dodds, Division of Biology, Kansas State  University, and Dr. Barry Biggs, National Institute of Water  and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), Christchurch, New Zealand  will conduct collaborative research in New Zealand on the  metabolism of stream algae.  Mixed assemblages of  microorganisms (biofilms or periphyton) coat surfaces in  streams and rivers.  These assemblages are generally the  main energy source for higher trophic levels in unshaded  temperate region streams.  In stable-flowing, enriched  streams periphyton can proliferate causing water management  problems.  Dr. Barry Biggs and his co-workers have  characterized extensively the periphyton communities and  associated land use practices in a large number of the  highly diverse streams and rivers in New Zealand and have  established the best empirical model of factors controlling  periphyton biomass and composition from any area in the  world.  New Zealand provides an outstanding natural  laboratory because heterogeneity of geological, climatic and  human use is extreme and occurs over very small spatial  scales (a few 100 km) relative to typical continental areas.  Dr. Dodds will link the unique data of his counterpart to  small scale metabolic measurements made with flow, light and  O2 microprobes and use this information to create a  predictive mechanistic model of stream biofilm metabolism  for the different community types.  This model will provide  a basis for more general models of stream ecosystem  function.  Such models are needed to assess responses of  stream water quality and ecosystem function to human  disturbance.",
