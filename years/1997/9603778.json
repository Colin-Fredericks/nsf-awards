 "awd_abstract_narration": "Florman  96-03778      Intracellular pH (pHi) is an important regulator of cellular activity, including the response to growth factors, hormones, and other external signals. An understanding of the mechanisms of pHi regulation has been advanced by the molecular and biochemical characterization of several transport proteins. However, the Na+-dependent Cl-/HC03- exchange is a major and widely distributed pHi regulator that has not been identified. The key experimental difficulties in purifying the protein components of this transport system include: (i) the lack of specific antagonists that differentiate this pathway from other anion transport mechanisms; and (ii) the inability to identify sources that are enriched in this transport activity.  Dr. Florman's laboratory has focused on the activation of mammalian sperm ion transport pathways by contact with the egg's extracellular matrix, or zona pellucida, during fertilization. The Na+dependent Cl-/HC03- exchange pathway is the major pHi regulator that is stimulated during sperm capacitation and zona pellucida contact. This transport activity is readily detectable in sperm membrane vesicles and can be distinguished from other anion transport mechanisms.  The objective of this study is to purify the Na+-dependent Cl-/HC03- exchange protein from mouse sperm. This transport activity will be isolated from detergent extracts of sperm membrane proteins by affinity chromatography and by conventional gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. Purification will be monitored in functional assays by reconstituting sperm protein into liposomes and by determining the specific activity of anion transport activity.  The identification of a sperm pH regulatory protein that mediates an essential step of gamete interaction will advance our knowledge of the fertilization process in mammals. In addition, these studies form an essential first step in the identification and characterization of related proteins in somatic tissues.",
