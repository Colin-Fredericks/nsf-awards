 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614701  Khanbilvardi    Soil erosion is a major scientific and environmental problem, especially when radionuclides are involved.  The transport process of radioactive pollutants in soils is complex and not yet completely understood.  These pollutants are being transported with soil particles down and out of the slopes, but at the same time they influence upon the erodibility of soils through various geo- and biochemical processes involving soil minerals, soil microbiota, soil moisture and traditional pollutants.  A unique chance to improve our understanding of these processes and to develop a model predicting erosion-controlled transport of radioactive pollutants, based on both theoretical and field studies, has been presented by the Chermobyl disaster which occurred in Ukraine in 1986.  It is the goal of this project to test two hypotheses and develop a simulation model.  The study is designed to find answers to (1) fate and transport of radionuclides in soils subjected to erosion, (2) the influence of microoganisms upon the transport of radioactivity in soils, and (3) to develop a computerized model that can be used to simulate radionuclide migration in agricultural watersheds subjected to erosion.  With a unique data set which is being obtained in Ukraine, the model can be validated in areas where validation was not formerly possible.  The project team which includes scientists and experts from Ukraine and from CUNY, USDA/Purdue and Benedictine University is already using this opportunity to the fullest extent possible.  In the vicinity of Chermobyl there are facilities staffed and equipped to study the process in situ, using artificial rainfall, so that any model developed for its prediction could be verified.  This would result in a much cheaper research as compared with a similar one conducted in the USA where, moreover, no such radioactivity contaminated places can be found.  Data obtained from this study will be used as an important tool for development of process formulation of vertic al migration and horizontal transport of radionuclides in soils.  This international endeavor would benefit the science and scientists in both countries and the world in protecting environment.",
