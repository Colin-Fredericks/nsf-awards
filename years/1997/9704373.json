 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704373  Sutherland  Following the recent discovery of several exact solutions of  important low dimensional models, for example models with  long range interactions in a lattice, calculations of ground  state correlations including time-dependent behavior and the  use of conformal symmetry to calculate the correlations, the  PI is planning to  study the application of these ideas to  real systems and develop formalism for the calculation of  experimental observables and compare them to the  experiments.  The specific experiments to be considered in  light of specific theoretical models are: (1) the optical  properties of conducting polymers and the sinh-cosh model  (2) The Hubbard-Peierls model of dimerized chains and  hyperbolic exchange models and finally (3) the Coulomb gap,  its effect on the transport properties of electrons and its  possible origins in the calculation of ground state  correlations.  %%%  The PI is well known for several exact solutions to model  problems in low dimensional systems.  Here he is planning to  apply the insight he has gained form these exact solutions  by calculating experimental observables in some charge  transfer compounds and conducting polymers.  He is planning  to do this by a careful reconsideration of the missing  details in the models which he has already solved.  He is  hoping for a close collaboration with several  experimentalists and also theorists to indicate the possible  opportunities and areas of improvement.  ***",
