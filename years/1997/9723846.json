 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:  IBN - 9723846    Complex Predictive Pursuit by the Eye Compared to a  Cerebellar Model of  Pursuit - R. E. Kettner.   One of the most remarkable characteristics of all animal  life is the fluidity and coordination of movement that  reaches high levels in skilled athletes and dancers, but is  also present in everyday action. This ability is  particularly remarkable given the slowness of individual  neurons in the brain. The brain increases its effective  processing speed by performing many computations in  parallel, but this does not appear to remove long delays in  processing visual information. The problem is particularly  acute when one attempts to explain how the eye is able to  track a target moving rapidly along a complex trajectory  with essentially zero lag. If eye motion were controlled  solely by changes in the current location of the target, one  would expect the eye to lag the target by the 100 ms delay  required to process visual input. Rather, it appears that  the system is able to compensate for delays by predictive  control. That is, it predicts how the eye should move based  on highly delayed information. This project will conduct  experiments in monkeys to determine the limits of eye  movement prediction under a variety of conditions: (1)  motion along circular and complex trajectories when target  velocity is either constant or variable, (2) motion along a  circular trajectory interrupted by a right-angle change in  target direction at either predictable times and locations  compared with identical target deviations at unpredictable  times and locations, and (3) motion along circular and  complex trajectories when the target is briefly turned off.  The project will also continue the development of a  biologically-realistic neural-network model of predictive  eye control based on regions of the brain's cerebellum known  to be involved in pursuit eye movements. This model uses a  much larger number of internal units than other pursuit  models (440 input mossy fibers, 6 000 internal granule cells,  2 Purkinje cell outputs) to generate complex predictive  pursuit. The model learns new trajectories in a biologically-  reasonable fashion by modifying granule-to-Purkinje cell  synapses using visual error signals (from climbing fiber  inputs). The behavioral data, neural response properties,  and anatomical connections are all based on experiment. Data  obtained in the above experiments will be used to test, and  if necessary, modify the model. In addition, model  performance will be compared with results from studies in  other laboratories. Random target motions will be tested  that can only be performed using visual input. New  simulations will also test how well the model performs when  the frequency of a learned trajectory is changed, and  whether the model can learn more than one trajectory at the  same time. All of this work should provide important  information about the role of prediction in motor control,  as well as increase our understanding of how brain systems  accomplish predictive control.",
