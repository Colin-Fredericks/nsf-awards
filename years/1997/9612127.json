 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, an innovative design of a mega-sub structural configuration for a tall building is proposed and its effectiveness in suppression of building vibration resulting from wind and/or seismic loads is investigated.  A building using the mega-sub configuration consists of two major component structures:  the mega structure which not only supports the sub structure but also resists external loads, and the sub structure which provides the usable space for either commercial or residential purposes.  From the physics point of view, the kinetic energy of the mega-structure generated by the external loads flows into the sub structure resulting in a  vibration suppression of the mega structure.  In the meantime, the energy transferred to the sub structure can be dissipated by properly designed damping of the sub structure, so that the acceleration of sub structure can also be reduced, thus minimizing the acceleration-related risk for the contents of the sub-structures as well as human discomfort.  Preliminary study has demonstrated the significant effectiveness and efficiency of the mega-sub control system in reducing the vibration of tall buildings under turbulent wind loads.  The following tasks will be conducted: (a) establishment of a realistic model for mega-sub structures, (b) development of design-consistent wind and seismic load models, (c) optimization study of dynamic parameters for design, (d) design of mega-sub building to achieve desired dynamic parameters, (e) design of semi-active/active/hybrid systems and (f) practical design of mega-sub structure.  This research is expected to contribute to a new generation of tall buildings which are designed with seismic and wind safety.",
