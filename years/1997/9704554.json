It was discovered recently that the junctions   occur naturally in certain crystals where superconducting layers interlace   with insulating layers. It is  proposed to derive and to study a mathematical   model of such crystals and to develop theory of traveling waves in discrete   media.  In the second part of the project it is proposed to produce the   qualitative analysis of systems of relaxation oscillators of a recently   discovered type. The third part of the project deals with various applications   of the investigator's recent observation on the role of curvature in high-  frequency averaging. These applications include the study of the motion of   rigid bodies (such as particles embedded in fluid) or coupled systems of   particles, such as molecules subjected to rapidly varying force fields.   Another application includes the behavior of a resonant medium subjected   to an electromagnetic pulse.  Finally, the last part of the  project deals with   establishing a connection between two classes of systems:   the geodesic   motion on a surface on the one hand and the billiard motion inside that   surface on the  other.     The first of the four parts of the project deals with the study of Josephson   junctions -- superconducting devices whose properties offer great potential   for applications. The advantages of Josephson junctions lie in their small   size and in low energy consumption, which allow for a great reduction of   the circuit size, but the disadvantage is the low power output. To overcome   that disadvantage, the junctions can be put in arrays. Remarkably, such   arrays occur naturally: some crystals were discovered to consist of stacked   Josephson junction layers. This recent discovery offers potential new   applications, notably   for use in interfaces between ultrafast optical   communication lines and electric circuits as well as for generation of high    frequency oscillations for use in communications and radio-astronomical   observations. Understanding the behavior of such arrays takes on a crucial   importance.  The project proposed here aims at such understanding.   The   second part of the project addresses relaxation oscillators - these occur in   biological and electronic systems whose oscillations consist of slow drifts   punctuated by fast jumps.  A large class of such oscillators exhibiting   chaotic behavior was discovered recently, and an isolated oscillator   analyzed. Understanding  systems of coupled oscillators (the goal of this   project) offers great challenges and is of importance in some biological and   electric systems.  In the third part of this effort, the dynamical effects of   high-frequency oscillations will be explored. Such effects underlie the   operation of the Paul trap (the inventor was awarded a Nobel prize) and the   more recent \"laser tweezers\" which allow to move objects inside the cell   without damaging it. This research will extend mathematical analysis of   these phenomena with the aim of possible applications which include   vibrational control as well as environmental applications such as separation   processes (removing particles from the air, etc.)   In the fourth part of the   project it is proposed to establish a connection between two century-old   geometry problems which were developed in parallel but without a direct   connection, by showing that one is a limiting case of another.  Both of these   problems played a central role in the development of the theory of   dynamical systems, and thus indirectly but crucially in  the development of   particle accelerators, in astronomy and in optics.",
