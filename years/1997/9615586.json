 "awd_abstract_narration": "Philip Coppens of the State University of New York at Buffalo has support   from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his studies   of the electronic structure of solids using X-ray crystallography.  His   research focuses on the following objectives:  a) to determine the charge   density distribution in solids; b) to exploit the tunability of   synchrotron sources for resonant scattering, which will allow   differentiation between atoms of the same element in different oxidation   states; c) to study excited states of molecules in crystals; and d) to   analyze multi-sublattice composite solids.  Very low-temperature single   crystal techniques will be exploited for data collection.    These experiments will help provide the tools necessary to study the   structures of short-lived excited states in a number of photochemically   active systems.  The charge-separated systems are important because they   are directly related to energy conversion and storage.  Regarding other   aspects of these studies, good comparisons of charge densities obtained   from crystallography and from theory are needed if we are ever going to   figure out why solids pack the way they do, and mixed valence compounds   are very important in many catalytic systems, technologically important   materials and biological systems.",
