 "awd_abstract_narration": "Portnoy  9703758:    Traditional Statistical Linear Modeling seeks to explain a response variable (e.g., wages) in terms of  predictor variables (e.g., education, job training, social characteristics, etc.).  The classical approach uses  \"lease squares\" to estimate the mean of the responses conditional on the predictors.  It is often found,  however, that those with higher responses depend very differently on the predictors than those with  middle or lower responses.  This variability is completely lost by the classical approach.  Thus, modern  regression quantile methods have become increasingly popular.  These methods seek to estimate the conditional quantiles (percentiles) of the response in terms of the predictors.  For example, it has been  found that high wages depend much more strongly on education than lower wages.  That is, not only are  high wages associated with more education, but the rate of return on education is significantly higher for  high wage earners than for lower wage earners.  Similarly, high electricity consumers during the summer  show a much greater difference between daytime peak use and nighttime use than lower users (presumably  because of air conditioners), and the length of long hospital stays depends more strongly on the severity of  the disease than does the length of shorter stays.  This ability to distinguish models on the basis of the size  of the response is finding extensive application in economics, social sciences, biostatistics, and other  areas.    Inevitably, successful continued diffusion of these methods is linked closely to the availability of  convenient and efficient software.  For modestly large problems, existing algorithms require  computational effort comparable to least squares.  However, as problem size grows, the computational  burden of the previous methods becomes heavy.  For large problems common in empirical labor  economics, large biomedical surveys, and other areas, new and more efficient computational techniques  would be highly des irable.  Thus, recent research proposes a two-pronged attack that has been shown to  yield dramatic improvements in computational efficiency.  One prong is the use of recently developed  interior point methods for linear programming.  The second is a form of stochastic preprocessing which  can drastically reduce the effective size of most statistical regression quantile problems.  Together, these   ideas appear capable of bringing the computational effort down to the level of least squares for problems  with sample sizes up to several million observations.  In even larger problems, theoretical evidence  indicates that regression quantile methods are even faster than least squares.  Practical realization of this  theoretical improvement would have significant consequences in the area of high performance  computation for large and massive data sets.",
