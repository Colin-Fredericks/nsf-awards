 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is creating and delivering appropriately designed curriculum to enable students of diverse educational background to enter either the workforce or a Community College program in manufacturing information systems engineering.  The program is refining curriculum, delivering faculty enhancement workshops, providing student industry experiences, and establishing itself as a model for replication.    The manufacturing information systems program emphasizes system integration.  The curricula being developed leads first to a Certificate in Information Technology (CIT) at the high school level, and then to an Associate of Science degree in Manufacturing Information Systems Technology (MIST) at the community college level.  Both curricula can proceed seamlessly to an existing BS-Engineering degree in Manufacturing Information Systems Engineering (MISE).  The project also includes the development of a certificate of Technical Preparation in Information Technology (TPIT) for working technicians.  These curricula are being designed and delivered by an alliance of high schools, community colleges, a four-year university and several high-tech companies in the Silicon Valley.  The program tracks are designed to provide seamless transitions among curricula.    This ATE project has four components:     1.  curriculum and instructional materials development,   2.  student transition and articulation   3.  faculty development, and   4.  industry internship program for students.    Participating companies play an active role in defining customer requirements, curriculum design, development of case studies, faculty internships, students apprenticeship/training, state of the art laboratory equipment, industry-based team projects and commitment of matching funds.  The project aims to serve NSF's ATE program through contribution of products (curricula, laboratory manuals, instructional materials, experience with cooperative learning workshops for faculty) that are being disseminated nationally through pu blications, annual workshops, and Internet for use by other institutions.",
