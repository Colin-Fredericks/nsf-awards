 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advanced Neuroscience Learning Laboratory is providing students with a broad and integrative education in neural and brain studies.  The laboratory also provides students with background in the four foundation areas of neuroscience: behavior, neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, and neurophysiology.      This laboratory will serve a broad group of students, including majors, K-12 teachers seeking re-certification, and students preparing to be teachers who will earn subject endorsements in psychology, chemistry, and biology.  It will provide a significant enhancement to their research and laboratory experiences.  This equipment can serve 250 majors as part of a comprehensive education in neuroscience, physiology of behavior, development, cognition, learning, and psychopathology.  This facility can also be used by health science, biology, and chemistry majors.    The laboratory is an integral part of the department's curriculum, providing experiences in the classroom and opportunities for independent undergraduate research.  The laboratory uses off-the-shelf technology and techniques that are easily mastered by undergraduate students.  Behavior is studied by examining exploratory behavior, learning and conditioning, and neuromotor development.  Neuroanatomy is studied using prepared neuroanatomic slides and examples of human pathology.  Neurochemistry is studied with neurohistochemical techniques, as well as gel electrophoresis and thin layer chromatography, to reveal neurotransmitter function and distribution.  Neurophysiology is studied with a student-oriented computer interface, which permits studies of EEG, EMG, GSR, and several other physiologic and behavioral systems.    *",
