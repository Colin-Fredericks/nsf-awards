 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722728  Cheng    This award supports a three-year program in geometric  modeling for engineering design. A cooperative project  between the University of Kentucky and Tsinghua University,  the program seeks to advance the state of the art in  geometric modeling, give U.S. students experience in China  through participation in the research project, and improve  methods for collaboration remotely via the world wide web.    The proposal adds an international dimension to DDM 9400823.    Geometric design and modeling is a major research and  development area in computer aided design.  The automobile,  aerospace, and shipbuilding industries rely heavily on  applications of many techniques developed in this area.  Geometric modeling for engineering design, however, is a  difficult field and many unanswered question remain that  inhibit use of computers in engineering design.     Research on new computational and visualization techniques  seeks to facilitate further modeling and design.  This  project proposes to develop and deliver CAD/CAM software  systems which support such methodologies.  This requires  development of network CAD/CAM interfaces and collaborative  design paradigms for a number of components of an object-  oriented geometric modeling tool kit. These will be  implemented as platform-independent applications which can  be accessed from anywhere over the Web.    Project personnel will include faculty level scientists from  Tsinghua University's Computer Aided Design Center which is  one of the largest geometric modeling research teams in the  world.  US participants include faculty of the University of  California, Berkeley, and the University of Kentucky.  Two  undergraduate students from the University of Kentucky will  participate each year, and will be chosen from groups  underrepresented in computer science and engineering fields.  The students will participate in the research fully,  including in research visits to Tsinghua University,  Beijing, China.    Support on the Chinese  side is provided by the National  Natural Science Foundation.  This project is supported under  the US-China Protocol on Cooperation in Basic Sciences.",
