 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707494  Michael Shelley    These projects concern dynamics and pattern formation in complex  fluids, and singularity formation and topological transitions in  Newtonian fluids.  The first project considers the hydrodynamics of  slender elastic filaments, such as arise in liquid crystal flows, the  dynamics of phospho-lipid bilayer tubes, and in the dynamics of  biological polymers.  Building tractable computational models, that  account for hydrodynamic interactions of the filament with itself,  relies on discriminating exploitation of slenderness.  This still  gives a computationally intensive problem with high-order time-step  constraints from elasticity, interaction integrals with singular  kernels, and integral equations to be solved at every time-step.  The  second project continues towards an understanding of topological  transitions of fluid/fluid interfaces between immiscible liquids.  The  fundamental questions are: How does surface tension provoke or mediate  transitions?  What characterizes the singularity?  What physics needs  to be added to follow the transition?  And what is left of the  singularity in its aftermath?  Building upon previous work on such  singularities in the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability between immiscible  fluids, it is proposed to study, computationally and analytically,  singularities and transitions in jets that separate immiscible fluids,  both by using sharp interface models, and fluid models that have  viscosity and allow some miscibility.  The third project studies the  effect of shear-thinning, a property shared with many non-Newtonian  fluids and liquid crystal flows, on the development of the  Saffman-Taylor instability.  Some of the modelling work has already  been done, yielding a natural non-Newtonian version of Darcy's law,  relating the fluid velocity to the solution of a nonlinear elliptic  problem.  It is proposed to now simulate the full nonlinear dynamics  of such a bubble expanding into a shear-thinning liquid.  This is a  very challenging comp utational problem as it involves the solution of  nonlinear elliptic problems on an evolving domain.    Much of the fundamental dynamics of fluids and materials --  singularity and pattern formation are two central examples -- will be  understood by a progression from mathematical modelling, to developing  computational methods and relevant mathematical understanding, and  thence to large-scale simulation and data analysis through  high-performance computing.  The three projects to be pursued here all  lie at the intersection of fluid dynamics and materials science, and  all illustrate the above statement.  In the first project, it is  proposed to understand and simulate the dynamics of filamentary  structures, as arise in phase transitions of liquid crystalline  fluids, the dynamics of phospho-lipid bilayer tubes, and in the  dynamics of biological polymers.  In first example, such filaments are  of potential technological importance in the manufacture of  high-strength filaments.  The second project continues towards a  theoretical understanding of what drives the break-up into droplets of  a jet of fluid into a second, different fluid (say, oil and water).  While easy and common to observe, such behavior is strongly associated  with surface tension, an effect that is still ill-understood, and yet  lies at the heart of much basic fluid phenomena.  This will be studied  by a combination of modelling, analysis, and large-scale computation.  The final project concerns the dynamics of shear-thinning liquids  flowing in thin gaps.  Such flows are important to display device  design, and to injection molding.  Of particular interest is the  instability and pattern formation associated with a gas/liquid  interface which is driven but mediated by surface tension.  This is an  extremely challenging computational problem, requiring the development  of new simulational methods.",
