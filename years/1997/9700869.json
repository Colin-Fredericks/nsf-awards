 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700869  Rao  Description:  This award is for a US-Indo research collaboration in the  field of electrochemical sensors based on new cyanometalate modified  electrodes.  The co-investigators are Andrew Bocarsly of Princeton  University and Prabhakara Rao of the Central Electrochemical  Research Institute (CERI) in Tamil Nadu.  Their studies will focus  on the structure and reactivity of platinum(II) and palladium(II)  complexes with cyanometallates that form polymeric structures.   These materials form hydrogel-like structures with unusual  photochemical and electrochemical properties.  Bocarsly's interest  is the solid-state properties of these materials, while Dr. Rao will  pursue the potential sensor applications of these systems.  Both  groups are strongly grounded in electrochemistry and the use of  electrochemical methods.  The expertise and facilities available at  these two laboratories are complementary and should be enhanced  by the collaboration.    Scope: This research will add an international component to  domestic research that is currently funded by the NSF Division of  Chemistry.        The discussions leading to this collaboration have been thoughtful,  deliberate and point to the potential that solid scientific work of  mutual benefit will result.  CERI is a research facility of the central  government that is managed by the Council of Scientific and  Industrial Research (CSIR). The mission of CSIR laboratories is to  conduct research consistent with national priorities and India's  development as an industrial nation.    ***",
