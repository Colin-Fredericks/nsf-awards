 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kenneth Eisenthal of Columbia University is supported by the Experimental   Physical Chemistry Program to continue his studies on chemical reaction   dynamics and chemical equilibria at liquid interfaces.  He will further   develop and refine methods that will extend the ways in which interfaces   can be investigated.  The major focus of his research will be the use of   second harmonic generation (SHG) and infrared plus visible (or   ultraviolet) sum frequency generation (SFG) to investigate acid-base   reactions/dynamics at air/water, oil/water, and solid/water interfaces.    This research includes studies of ground electronic state acid-base   equilibria and the photochemistry and photophysics of intermolecular   proton transfer and excited electronic state acid-base equilibria.    The significance of the proposed research derives from the inhomogeneous   nature of the physical and biological world and thus the prevalence of   interfaces separating the various phases and structures of matter.  For   this reason it is important to develop an understanding of interfaces at   the microscopic level.  There is also a significance that extends beyond   fundamental science because of the major role interfaces play in   technology (etching of computer chips, liquid phase catalysis and   transfer), in the environment (air/water, soil/water, air/atmospheric   aerosols, and air/stratospheric acidic ice surfaces), and in medicine   (drug delivery in pharmacology, anesthesia and general membrane chemistry   and photochemistry).",
