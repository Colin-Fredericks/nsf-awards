 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will develop a World Wide Web site and  database that will allow users to view and analyze metabolic  pathways.  It will be developed from their existing stand  alone system which allows pathway selection, display, and  assignment of reactions to different biological species.  Their prototype Web site (http://pathways.stjohns.edu)  allows viewing and editing biochemical reactions. Beyond  incorporating all features from the stand-alone system into  the new Web site, proposed extensions will provide new  database and pathway analysis tools. The investigators will  implement several new features such as variable hierarchies,  a resolution of the polymer problem, and generalized  compound classifications. Moreover, they will establish  mathematical analysis modules for constructed metabolic  pathways; these modules will allow the Web site users to  employ Metabolic Control Analysis as well as standard enzyme  kinetics calculations. In research concerning uncertain  pathways, the Metabolic Control Analysis module will analyze  for the possibility of branching, for channeling, and for  moietyconserved cycles (e.g., NAD/NADH).  This work will serve three communities:  1  the experimenter  who may not be expert in the analysis itself, or who may be  interested in a different pathway than the one that is  usually under consideration;  2  the theoretician who wishes  to verify hypotheses rapidly beyond pencil and paper  calculations and to study much larger pathways, thereby  leading to more critical thinking about metabolic  regulation; and  3  the student who would not be able to use  such analyses in the absence of an established and easily  accessed system. User interaction will include construction  of the pathway, updating the database, and a forum for  discussion with other users. It will be possible to conduct  many separate analyses on the pathways, using either  existing data that may be found within the system, or data  provided by the user.  The graphical presentation of the  pathways as well as the  results of the mathematical analysis will greatly benefit  both theoreticians and experimental scientists, expanding  their scientific intuition as unforeseen possibilities are  rigorously examined within the framework of metabolic  pathways. The graphical display of chemical structures of  metabolites (e.g., substrates, cofactors, and inhibitors)  will allow atom-by-atom isotopic tracing.       The applications of the proposed database and WWW site  to biochemical education are manifold. Within a formal  classroom structure, students of many biological disciplines  may generate or access important known metabolic pathways.  Students may also extend their knowledge of metabolism  through independent study on the Web site, whether by  verifying laboratory data for known pathways or by  investigating hypothetical pathways. It is conceivable that  textbooks in Metabolic Control Analysis may be written,  utilizing this Web site as an instructional module.",
