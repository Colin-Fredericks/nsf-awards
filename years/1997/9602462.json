Dr. Capone's student, Ms. Margaret Mulholland  will work with Dr. Kaori Ohki, Professor in the School of  Marine Science and Technology, on a research project  entitled, \"Regulation of N2 fixation in Trichodesmium\".    Trichodesmium spp. are N2 fixing, marine cyanobacteria that  occur throughout the tropical and subtropical oceans in  areas otherwise noted for their paucity of plant life.  As  for many terrestrial systems, limitation of oceanic plant  production is attributed primarily to a shortage of  utilizable nitrogen compounds.  Trichodesmium spp., utilize  dinitrogen gas,  the most abundant form of nitrogen, thereby  alleviating nitrogen limitation and providing new nitrogen  input into these systems. Trichodesmium spp. can sustain  high rates of N2 fixation in nature; however, little is  known about the biochemical and physiological conditions  that support N2 fixation in these species since they have  been difficult to maintain in controlled culture systems.  Professor Ohki and her collaborators have been successful in  their attempts to grow Trichodesmium in cultures,but  transfer of this culture to other laboratories has proven  unsuccessful.  This project will examine the cellular  regulation of N metabolism and N2 fixation in Trichodesmium  NIBB1067 grown under controlled conditions with and without  fixed nitrogen compounds.  Results from these studies will  be compared with results from the field in order to better  understand the natural populations of Trichodesmium.  ***",
