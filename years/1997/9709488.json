 "awd_abstract_narration": "9709488  Grill  Neural prostheses are a developing technology that use small  electrical currents to activate the nervous system and restore  lost function to individuals with neurological impairment.  Electrical activation of intact nerve cells, in the form of a  neural prosthesis, is presently the only method available to  restore function to individuals with spinal cord injury.  The  long-term goal of the principal investigator's research program  is to develop advanced neural prostheses based on electrical  stimulation of the spinal cord.  The novel approach being pursued  is to activate electrically the intact neural control circuits of  the spinal cord to generate distributed commands to groups of  last-order neurons.  There is abundant evidence in animals, and  increasing evidence in humans, that the neuronal control  circuitry of the isolated spinal cord is capable of generating  complex movements with coordinated muscle activity including  reaching, locomotion, scratching, and micturition.  Exploiting  these intact neuronal control circuits would significantly  improve the function of and simplify the implementation of neural  prostheses.  One fundamental requirement to implement a neural  prosthesis using microstimulation of the spinal cord is the  ability to generate selective and controlled electrical  activation of specific groups of neurons.  The outcome of the  proposed research will be new techniques to effect selective  excitation of targeted neurons.  Two fundamental questions will  be answered using a combination of experimental measurements,  computer-based modeling, and engineering optimization.  First,  what neural elements are activated by stimulation of the spinal  cord with penetrating microelectrodes?  Second, how can targeted  populations of neurons be selectively stimulated?  The techniques  and knowledge which result from this research will find  application in fundamental studies in neurophysiology and in  design of advanced neural prostheses utilizing microstimulat ion  for restoration of function in individuals with neurological  impairment.  ***",
