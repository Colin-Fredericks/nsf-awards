Cindy  University of Washington    University of California, Los Angeles   The central objectives of this research project are to examine the processes and outcomes of internal migration in the transitional Chinese economy.  Specifically the work focuses upon the role of socio-economic segmentation resulting from the socio-political control mechanisms employed by the state-notably the household registration (hukou) system.  A comparison of hukou and non-hukou migrations and migrants' socio-economic characteristics is undertaken based on a large data sample drawn from the 1990 Census and 1995 Population Survey, as well as, small scale in-depth field interviews to be conducted in Guangdong and Hubei provinces.  Statistical and quantitative analyses will be utilized to draw out relationships and findings.  The research promises to break new ground by exploring the dynamic interaction between state institutions and the structural transformation of the economy.  The problem will also be evaluated in terms of existing historical-cultural, neo-classical, and segmented labor market theories.  The project will theorize the relationship between the state, industrialization and internal migration in contemporary China.  The research will be carried out by two U.S. scientists as well as two Chinese researchers.  The research has important theoretical and policy implications in regards to the processes defining migration in currently common situations of structural adjustment",
