 "awd_abstract_narration": "Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous in the living organisms, synchronizing life functions at the biochemical, physiological, and behavioral levels. The rhythms generating mechanisms. collectively known as circadian clocks, are not fully understood in any organism. Research in the fruit fly Drosophila has led to major insights into the molecular bases of the circadian mechanism. Two clock genes, period and timeless, have been shown to play central roles in the function of the brain-centered clock, which controls behavioral rhythms of adult flies. Using those genes as markers, the PI has identified a new circadian clock in the fly excretory organ, the Malpighian tubules and established that this clock can function in the absence of the brain. The PI plans to study the relationships between the peripheral clock in the excretory organ and pacemakers in the central nervous system. Experiments will involve organ transplants and in vitro cultures, using novel strains of transgenic flies carrying luciferase reporter, which allows real time continuing measurement of mRNA levels of clock genes. The PI wishes to establish the degree of autonomy of the peripheral clock in the Malpighian tubules and to test how other tissues affect its function. The PI will also probe the nature of the photoreceptor that mediate the resetting of the clock by light and investigate the functional role of the clock in the excretory organ.  In this pursuit, the PI seek to answer a fundamental question of whether the circadian system in Drosophila is a centralized one, comprised of a single dominant clock that would control all rhythmic functions, or is a decentralized system with several independent clocks located in different tissues and controlling subsets of physiological functions.    Malpighian tubules are uniquely accessible to both physiological and molecular genetic investigations. The broad scope of this proposal will allow thorough characterization of the circadian clock in this tissue. providing impetus for future resear ch aimed at understanding how already identified clock genes receive environmental input on one hand, and produce rhythmic outputs on the other.",
