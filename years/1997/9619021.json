 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619021  Hammrich   The proposed multi-faceted initiative is designed to increase science/math literacy of fourth and fifth grade girls, contribute to the professional growth of current and future teachers, and increase the involvement of volunteers and families in the education of Philadelphia's children.  Building linkages among schools, parents, community members, and SEM-related organizations is an underlying strategy that ultimately will impact on the long term sustainability of this project.  By enhancing the capacity of current and future teachers, families, and volunteers, to promote science and math literacy among girls, the project will supplement other systemic initiatives recently begun by Temple University and the Philadelphia School District.  \"Sisters in Science\" builds upon a successful multi-generational model project funded by National Science Foundation.  The overall goal of the proposed project is to increase interest and literacy in science and mathematics among grade school African American, Asian, and Hispanic girls in six Philadelphia urban schools.  Specific objectives include increasing girls' interest in science and mathematics and enhancing their attitudes toward science and mathematics.   The project involves the girls, their families, and their teachers in the targeted schools, and undergraduate elementary education students.  Retirees and minority women currently employed in SEM fields will serve as volunteers.   Boys will be involved in the classroom component of the project.  The project is to provide a two-year intervention at a crucial juncture in the formation of girls' attitudes toward and achievement in science and mathematics.  In Year 1, the program involves students, parents, and teachers in two 4th grade classes in each of the six elementary schools.  In Year 2, these students (now 5th graders) continue to engage in program activities, while a new group of 4th graders enters the program.  The same process occurs in Year 3.  It is anticipated that this th ird 4th grade group will continue the program after the grant period has ended.  The project has five components:  (1) Teacher training.  Teachers will participate in a one-week intensive professional development program and monthly curriculum planning meetings that familiarize them with gender equity issues and teaching strategies that facilitate girls' learning of science and math.  (2) The classroom activities take place once a week for one hour in each of the designated classrooms.  The PI, undergraduate elementary education students, and volunteers will work with classroom teachers to implement activities that are gender-sensitive and focused on the urban environment.  (3) The after-school program for the fourth grade girls is weekly at each of the schools and involves girls in environmental service learning projects.  The after-school program for the fifth grade girls meets twice monthly on Saturdays at each school.  (4) A two-week summer program focuses on \"city rivers.\"  (5) Family education.  Special family events will be held on a quarterly basis and parents will be sent \"Tip Sheets\" and home activity ideas on a regular basis.",
