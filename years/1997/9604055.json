 "awd_abstract_narration": "Champness  9604055  Streptomycetes, filamentous soil bacteria, possess two characteristics that make them attractive prokaryotes for study:  they develop into complex, multicellular, differentiated colonies and they produce a vast array of secondary metabolites, many of which are useful as antibiotics.  Antibiotic production is usually coupled to morphological differentiation, beginning at the transition between vegetative growth and production of pre-spore differentiated hyphae.  The long term goal of this research is to discover the genes that regulate antibiotic synthesis, to understand how they function, and to determine their functional relationships in the regulatory network controlling antibiotic gene expression.   The immediate objectives of this proposal focus on three genetic elements discovered in previous NSF funding periods:  absA, absB and mia.  Research will proceed along the following lines:  1.  The mechanism by which the absA-encoded signal transduction system exerts global        negative control over antibiotic gene expression will be determined.  Genetic,         molecular  genetic and biochemical experiments will:  a) characterize functionally         important regions and interactions of the AbsA1/A2 \"sensor-kinase\" and response         regulator proteins; b) establish the role of protein phosphorylation in AbsA-mediated                       regulation; and c) explore the genetic pathway through which absA regulates         expression of the antibiotic \"pathway-specific regulators.\"  2.  The absB gene and its probable gene product, an RNaseIII, will be characterized        through determination of the RNaseIII (absB) null phenotype, functional studies on        the S. coelicolor RNaseIII, and identification of candidate RNaseIII targets.  3.  The 190 nt mia sequence, which exerts multi-copy inhibition of antibiotic gene        expression, will be characterized to determine the functional regions of the sequence.  The results of the proposed work promise to elucidate aspec ts of the regulatory programs controlling streptomycete gene expression, and to expand our understanding of microbial multicellular differentiation.",
