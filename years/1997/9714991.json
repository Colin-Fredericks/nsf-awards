 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714991 Storm  A Gordon Research Conference will be held July 6-11, 1997 on 'Electronic Materials: Chemistry, Excitations, and Processing' with focus on chemical issues in the growth, processing, and performance of three materials systems--Group III Nitride Semiconductors, Organic Thin films, and Quantum Confinement Structures. Emphasis will be given to the role of molecular and collective excited states in the emission of light and in synthesis and processing via excited states and non-thermal pathways. New applications and new techniques will be explored in three special sessions; a)requirements for quantum materials for computing and communicating in the 21st century, b)newer synthetic methods, expected to have impact on electronic materials in the next decade, c)new and powerful optical techniques for in situ monitoring during growth and processing. Objectives of the Conference are: a)to stimulate communications among the materials communities working in these areas, b)to delineate the crucial role of chemistry in moving these materials systems to technological success,  and c)to stimulate the academic chemistry, materials science and engineering, and condensed matter physics communities toward multidisciplinary, collaborative research and education in electronic materials. NSF funds will be used to support participation by graduate students and young faculty.  There will be an opportunity to assess the field, future directions, and to establish ties between universities, research institutions, and industry.  It is expected that top scientists in the field will attend, and that the symposium will provide an effective forum to discuss and delineate critical scientific issues. %%%  An evaluation of chemical issues in the growth, processing, and performance of the materials systems--Group III Nitride Semiconductors, Organic Thin films, and Quantum Confinement Structures, especially critical materials and device related research areas, and the relationship of materials research to device fabric ation along with current assessments of the most important developments in this field will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of materials in computing, data processing, and communications.    ***",
