 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Xumu Zhang,   of the Department of Chemistry at the Pennsylvania State University,   explores the use of chiral heterobicyclo(2.2.1) heptanes as catalysts and   auxiliaries for enantioselective organic transformations.    Phosphine-catalyzed (3+2) cycloaddition reactions afford chiral   cyclopentenes with a high degree of regio- and enantioselectivity when   mediated by chiral phosphabicyclo(2.2.1)heptanes.  Related asymmetric   catalysts are explored for their applicability in nucleophilic gamma   addition reactions with alkynes bearing electron withdrawing groups, the   Baylis-Hillman reaction, and thioether-mediated epoxidation and   aziridination of aldehydes.  Chiral azabicyclo(2.2.1)heptanes are   employed as chiral auxiliaries for asymmetric deprotonation, enamine   alkylation, and cycloaddition reactions.  It has become increasingly important to develop synthetic methods which   allow precise control over the three-dimensional form of organic   molecules, since even the seemingly minor difference in structure   displayed by two molecules related to one another as mirror images not   infrequently leads to a dramatic difference in chemical properties.    Professor Xumu Zhang, of the Department of Chemistry at the Pennsylvania   State University, with the support of the Organic Synthesis Program,   explores methods to effect such highly controlled syntheses of organic   molecules.  By exploring and developing reactions which are mediated by   specifically designed and tailored phosphorus- or nitrogen-containing   molecules, Professor Zhang is able to impart specific three-dimensional   forms to the products of these reactions.  In addition to developing   practical synthetic methods, Professor Zhang explores the mechanisms by   which these molecular transformations take place and targets important   drugs and pharmaceutical intermediates to demonstrate their synthetic   utility.",
