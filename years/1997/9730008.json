These activities include those of ICSU's Advisory Committee  on the  Environment (ACE); ICSU's Environmental Sciences Officer who  provides staff support for ACE; and scientific planning  activities  of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), the  International  Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP), and the International  Dimensions (of Global Environmental Change Program (IHDP).  ACE  will promote coordination regarding global change research  among  ICSU's various international scientific unions (e.g., the  International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG);  International  Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS); International Union of  Biological Sciences (IUBS); and International Union of Pure  and  Applied Chemistry (IUPAP)); between relevant ICSU bodies and  external partners, especially the intergovernmental  organizations  co-sponsors of global change research (e.g., the World  Meteorological Organization (WMO); the Intergovernmental  Oceanographic Commission (IOC); and the UN Environment  Programme  (UNEP)); and other international organizations representing  the  interests of the social and engineering sciences and  industry in  global change research.  ACE will review and provide  scientific  guidance to the WCRP, IGBP, IHDP and their component  projects; to  the international global change observing systems (for  climate  (GCOS), for the oceans (GOOS), and for the terrestrial  system  (GTOS); to all other ICSU activities related to global  change and  environment research (such as those of the Scientific  Committee on  Problems of the Environment (SCOPE); and to  intergovernmental  bodies concerned with global change issues such as climate  change,  biodiversity and desertification.  ***",
