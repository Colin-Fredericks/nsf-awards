 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of a two-week summer workshop and a two-day follow-through session during the following the spring semester in each of two years. Participants will design and implement interactive, multimedia laboratory modules for  computer science courses. Topics include (1) designing and constructing an  interactive multimedia module for a laboratory exercise that includes audio, still images, full motion video and/or algorithm animation,  (2) using hardware to capture audio, still images, and full motion video,  (3) requirements for implementation and delivery of multimedia-based laboratory exercises in a  laboratory setting, (4) presentations and discussions centered on the impact of  multimedia and laboratories on learning,  (5) developing portable multimedia-based laboratory exercises for the World Wide Web, and (6) software for developing multimedia-based laboratory exercises. Tools to be  used include an authoring tool and Java templates (a tool midway between a programming language and an authoring tool) for developing modules for the World Wide Web. Templates will allow participants to construct modules for the Web with only a small introduction to HTML, JAVA and CGIs needed. An expert  in graphics design and one who researched and developed the concept of templates will interact with the participants during the workshop. Each participant is expected to design and develop a working version of a  laboratory module during the workshop. The participants will enhance the modules during the follow-through session. The modules will be refined and tested with students during the academic year following the workshop.",
