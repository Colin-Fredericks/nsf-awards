These undergraduates will work on designing, modeling, and experimental measurement of propagation delays in the Gallium Arsenide-based very high-speed integrated circuits - the state of the art technology for the fastest computers.  The project goals are to:    1.  Enhance student experience, competence, and self-esteem by working on a state-of-the-art research project;  2.  Encourage students to pursue graduate studies and a research career in electronics; and  3.  Improve students oral and written skills through seminar presentations and written reports.    The expected impact of the project is in an increased number of talented students choosing research careers in this field which is vital to the nation's technological advances.  ***",
