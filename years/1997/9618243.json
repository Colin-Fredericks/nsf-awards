 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative technology development project will be   undertaken by investigators at the Universities of Hawaii,   Washington, and Illinois-Chicago.  Specialized seafloor   instrumentation will be developed to test for the presence   of a sub-seafloor biosphere hundreds of meters below the   water-rock interface, by detecting specific metabolic   products which accompany the hydrothermal fluids as they   vent from the crust into the overlying seawater. To test the   sub-surface biosphere hypothesis, an instrumented \"bio-  blanket\" will be built and deployed that isolates a small   area of surface rock from seawater, and focuses up-welling   fluid through scavenging columns that serve as traps for   metabolic (organic carbon) products which are associated   with these sub-surface microbial communities. These   diagnostic organic compounds should accompany the   hydrothermal fluid that is known to circulate within the   upper crustal rocks and eventually discharges into the   overlying seawater at diffuse vent sites in exposed rock   outcrops. The proposed instrumented blanket would also   measure up-welling temperatures and velocities as the fluid   vents into seawater. The development of the bio-blanket will   be in several graduated stages, with the initial deployments   being carried out at a ridge axis, where the fluid flux   levels are substantial, and the dissolved carbon metabolic   concentrations are relatively high. The direct detection of   a wide-spread biological community, living within the   sub-surface ocean floor would dramatically alter estimates   of biological productivity and the global carbon budgets,   and have a profound impact on our philosophical view of the   earth.",
