 "awd_abstract_narration": "The world of networked computers has resulted in an explosion of  digital information.  This causes a problem in both transmission  and storage of this information.  Since \"a picture is worth a  thousand words\", much of this information is in the form of image  data.  However, pictures require much more data to store than  words.  Thus, it is necessary to reduce this storage requirement  somehow.    Many different ways of \"compressing\" this information have been  discovered, among them one that involves the use of fractals.   Fractals provide a convenient way of describing natural  phenomena, thus they have found many uses in various technical  fields.  Fractals have proven to provide an efficient scheme to  compress images, comparing favorably with other popular methods.    This project will take the next step -- using fractals as both a  compression tool as well as an analysis tool.  Given image data  comresses using the method of fractals, it is natural to try to  use the fractal description to analyze the image.  One would like  to extract parts of the image for processing -- say to recognize  a face in a picture. Another example would be to use the fractal  description of an image of a rock face to recognize the rock type  or to predict physical properties of the rock.    This research project will develop methods to use the data  from a fractal compressed image to extract further meaningful  information about the image. Use fractals to compress as well as  analyze information.    This GOALI project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of   Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
