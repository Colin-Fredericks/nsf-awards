 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to purchase a positional measurement system dedicated to support of research in manufacturing engineering and ergonomics.  The positional measurement system is a video based data acquisition tool which captures the location of key components for manufacturing workstations through optical sensors and analyzes them using state-of-the-art software.  The equipment will be used in several projects, including: (1) the effects of force production and fatigue on movement accuracy; and (2) a predictive model of assembly process times to improve design for assembly and operational scheduling.  These research projects constitute the core investigation of an innovative methodology to enhance the effectiveness of manufacturing systems.     The positional measurement system enables the increase of speed and accuracy in which time and position data can be collected, thus reducing the time required to collect the data.  It substantially enhances the research capability and academic infrastructure of the institution in manufacturing engineering.",
