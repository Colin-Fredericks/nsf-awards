 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704565  Rezakhanlou   An outstanding and long studied problem in statistical mechanics is to establish the   connection between the microscopic structure of a fluid (or a gas) and its macroscopic   behavior. Perhaps the most celebrated problem in this context is the derivation of the   hydrodynamic and kinetic equations from small scale dynamics governed by the Newton's   second law. This problem is still wide open but some variants have been recently treated.   The investigator's research concerns the analysis of particle systems modeling fluids and   gas. Recently the investigator in collaboration with James Tarver has derived a Boltzmann   type equation for the macroscopic particle densities of a class stochastic particle systems   modeling dilute gases. Roughly speaking one shows that after a suitable scaling the   microscopic particle density converges to a solution of a Boltzmann type equation. The   investigator also shows that the convergence is exponentially fast and derives an explicit   expression for the exponential rate of convergence. This result allows us to go beyond the   macroscopic description given by the Boltzmann equation and obtain some valuable   insight about the microscopic structure of the particle system under study.   Our world appears differently at different scales. For example a fluid or a gas is a   collection of an enormous number of molecules that collide incessantly and move   erratically without any particular aim. How do these molecules then manage to organize   themselves in such a way as to form a flow pattern on a large scale? Roughly the reason is   that the local conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy impose constraints not   immediately visible on the microscopic scale. The investigator's research concerns the   relationship between the microscopic structure and the macroscopic behavior of fluids and   gases. The analysis of the mathematical models consisting of a large number of interacting   particles has proved to be useful in understanding  the intricate behavior of fluids and   gases. Moreover, interacting particle systems turn out to be the most efficient way of   simulating the flow patterns of dilute gases.",
