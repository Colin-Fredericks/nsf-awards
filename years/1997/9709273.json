This   equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the study   of the kinetics of growth of self assembled monolayers, the evaluation of   forces at protein surfaces, the study of the enhanced deposition of   materials controlled on the nanoscale by precisely applied stress,   studies of molecular electronic materials, and determination of the   orientation of deposited molecular films.    The scanning probe microscope (SPM) enables researchers to image atoms   directly. The technique uses the piezoelectric effect which involves   bringing an extremely sharp metal needle within a few angstroms of the   sample surface. The distance is small enough for electrons to leak or   tunnel across the gap and generate a minute current. As the gap between   the tip and the sample increases, the current decreases. As then probe   crosses the sample, moving back and forth across its surface, it traces   out a contour map of the sample's surface atoms. The SPM is used in the   control of material used to fabricate semiconductor circuits.         ***",
