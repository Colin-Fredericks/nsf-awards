 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this RUI project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry   Program of the Chemistry Division, Dwyer of SUNY Brockport and Doetschman   of SUNY Binghamton will use pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)   techniques to examine electron- and proton-transfer reactions in   zeolites.  Differences between reaction in the solvent and in the zeolite   microreactor will be explained in terms of reagent-environment   interactions.  In this project molecular interactions with solid-state   cage cations and Lewis acid sites will be examined to determine their   effect on the nature and temperature dependence of molecular motion.    Experimental work will be performed using the regional pulsed EPR and   photochemistry facility at SUNY Binghamton.  Zeolites are inorganic materials with unique internal structures which   can act as reaction solvent cages, or microreactors for short.  These   materials have industrial as well as academic application as hosts for   novel light-induced reactions.  In this project undergraduate students   from Brockport will be able to study these sorts of reactions using   state-of-the-art equipment in Binghamton that is not normally available   at undergraduate institutions.",
