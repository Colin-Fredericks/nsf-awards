 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of several physical and mathematical issues  concerning the structure of Einstein's General Theory of  Relativity, (GR) will be undertaken.  GR can be understood  by its analogy with the more familiar ideas of electricity  and magnetism.  Most often it has been useful to study  gravitational phenomena as just another classical field and  use the analogies with electro-magnetic theory for the  understanding of different physical phenomena or as a guide  to the problems of a quantum theory of gravity.  Recently, there has been developed a new point of view  towards general relativity, where the analogy with electro-  magnetic fields completely breaks down.  The primary  variables are no longer conventional fields but are instead  non-local structures; in particular, they are three  dimensional surfaces in space-time with the special property  that light can travel along these surfaces, i.e., the  surfaces are null or characteristic surfaces.  It has been  possible (though it was not at all obvious how to do so) to  give a formulation of GR where the basic equations are for  the determination of these surfaces.  In turn, when these  surfaces are determined the geometry of the space-time turns  out to be identical with the conventional view derived from  Einstein's general relativity.  In other words, general  relativity has been reformulated as a theory of three  dimensional surfaces.  The major portion of this project involves the study of the  properties of these surface equations.  We have been  interested in both their classical aspects - (their  geometric meaning, their consequences and methods of  integration and approximation) and what relationship they  might have with the difficulties associated with the  construction of a quantum theory of gravity.",
