 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614567  Humphreys    This collaborative project proposes installation of a GPS  network in the Pacific Northwest to measure strain  accumulation and earthquake hazard in the region that is  associated with subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate.  Geodetic monitoring, combined with geologic studies and  geophysical modeling, should discriminate the relative  importance of the many factors contributing to the  deformation of this area.  The PIs will employ a matrix of  permanent and roving GPS receivers in a project that  includes 1) site installation,  2) data acquisition,  reduction and archiving, and 3) modeling of the kinematic  results.  This work will be done in collaboration with other  agencies and governments (Canadian) operating under the  auspices of the Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array (PANGA), of  which the PIs are members.  A data analysis facility  developed at CWU will reduce and distribute on-line and CD  ROM geodetic data products to the geophysical community.  Finite-element modeling of the new constraints on Pacific  Northwest deformation will allow the development of both  kinematically consistent, two-dimensional estimates of the  surface deformation, and three-dimensional models of the  forces that drive that deformation.  The integrated approach  of field observations and modeling should provide an  advancement of understanding of the kinematics and dynamics  of the Pacific Northwest, and will provide important seismic  monitoring of this seismically active region.  ***",
