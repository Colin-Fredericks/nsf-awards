 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703281  Giannuzzi    The goal of this CAREER research grant is to determine the  effects of impurity grain boundary segregation on grain  boundary diffusion.  Attention is given to the effects of  segregating atoms on heterodiffusion along low angle, high  angle, and special copper twist grain boundaries, comparing  heterodiffusion along unsegregated and segregated twist  boundaries.  Grain boundary diffusion of a solute is  assessed in the presence of impurity segregants at the same  temperatures used for the segregation experiments.  Systematic evaluation of segregation composition, grain  boundary diffusion lengths, and grain boundary structure is  performed as a function of the annealing conditions.  Experimental and theoretical approaches are employed to  model enhancement or reduction of grain boundary diffusion  due to the segregating impurity atoms.  A primary goal of  the CAREER education component of the program is to develop  innovative teaching methods, while incorporating recent  research findings into the classroom in the Materials  Science and Engineering discipline.  Multimedia and computer  usage is planned for videotaped and live interactive  classroom demonstrations.  Computer software demonstrations  and digital image computer analyses are employed.  The  effort includes mentoring undergraduates and exposing them  to research projects, curriculum development, and community  outreach.  %%%  This research is significant because identification of the  mechanisms of impurity segregation effects on grain boundary  diffusion will assist in the processing of materials with  specific grain boundary properties.  Ultimately, grain  boundary engineering could be performed to either enhance or  minimize a particular solid-state reaction.  ***",
