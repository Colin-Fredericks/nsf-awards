 "awd_abstract_narration": "SBR-9617695    This award supports the provision of small travel grants to graduate students from U.S. institutions to assist their attendance and participation in the 1997 Annual Assembly of the University Consortium for Geographic Information Science.  Students to be so supported will be selected on the basis of a panel review of their 2000-word abstracts of the presentations they plan to make at the assembly.  Grants will not be made to students based within 250 miles of the assembly (to be held in Maine).  The assembly has two components:  the exchange of research findings and progress among researchers and students (their presentations are to be integrated within sessions), and the identification of priorities for education (primarily college and graduate) in the interdisciplinary field of geographic information science.      This small award fulfills two major goals of NSF:  the development and dissemination of improved tools for scientific analysis, and the integration of research and education.",
