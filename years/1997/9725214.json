 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725214  Laffey    This project will study a teacher education program that has undergone substantial restructuring, is committed to a vision of developing technology-using educators, and has made a substantial investment in an innovative technology in a teacher education program, building knowledge about 1) how technology supports professional development, 2) how and learning, and 3) how a teacher education program supported by advanced technology influences the development and socialization of beginning teachers.  This study is focused on two core questions: a) what social and cultural patterns emerge when advanced technology is utilized in teacher education, and how do these affect the process and outcomes of professional socialization? and b) how does the technology infrastructure contribute to the development of technology-using teachers>  Data collected will include a longitudinal qualitative study of professional socialization: a portfolio review of technology -related products from the teacher education program; and pre- and p0ost- instrumentation to assess changes in attitudes, expectations, and practices for key learner outcomes of inquiry orientation, reflective practice, learner-centered instruction, and technology use.  Project outcomes include contributing to the formative development of this teacher education program, creating a database and methodological framework for the study of technology in teaching and teacher development, and articulating a model of technology-based teacher preparation from which other programs can learn.",
