 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is cooperative between the University of Michigan (Papaefthymiou)  and the University of Rochester (Friedman). It is exploring electronic design  automation methods for optimizing high performance, high complexity VLSI/ULSI  circuits. The focus is on retiming and clock scheduling, two complementary  circuit optimization strategies that have attracted significant attention.  Retiming is an architectural-level transformation method that speeds up a  synchronous digital design. Clock scheduling is a circuit-level optimization that  increases the operating speed of a digital design. The approach is to merge these  two methods into a single powerful optimization process that will handle  comprehensive delay models. Problems being investigated are: (1) Finding enhanced  circuit models that consider physical and electrical issues related to  submicrometer technologies; (2)Developing a theoretical yet practical framework  for simultaneous retiming and clock scheduling based on these physical &  electrical models; (3) Designing and evaluating polynomial-time approximation  algorithms for integrated retiming and clock scheduling. Software developed  during the project is being widely distributed.",
