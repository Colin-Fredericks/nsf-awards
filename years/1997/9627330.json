 "awd_abstract_narration": "Leimkuhler  9627330       The investigator and collaborators form a multidisciplinary  team from biochemistry, chemistry and mathematics that seeks new,  more efficient numerical integrators for problems of molecular  simulation.  They develop timestepping schemes that are based on  detailed study of the structure and force laws of these molecular  systems, and that respect invariants and symmetries such as the  symplectic structure and time-reversibility associated to the  flow map.  The project extends the range of dynamical phenomena  accessible to simulation studies by increasing the allowable  timestep and improving stability of numerical integrators.  Moreover, by automating the selection of timestep in molecular  dynamics simulations, this work seeks to remove an outstanding  inefficiency and push forward the state-of-the-art in molecular  dynamics software.  The specific problems considered include (1)  the development of combined coordinate and time-transformations  as a tool for stabilizing the local dynamics of close particle  pairs, (2) exploration of the relationship between timestep and  numerical behavior for molecular dynamics and the design of  time-reversible stepsize variation mechanisms, and (3) the study  of timestepping schemes appropriate to spin dynamics, constrained  systems, and related problems and their application in chemical  and physical dynamics problems.  The new techniques are used to  simulate biological macromolecules and for problems concerning  the structure and dynamics of solid-liquid interfaces as well as  studies of transitions in glasses and spin-glasses.       Important challenges to our understanding of physical,  chemical and biochemical processes are being tackled through the  use of computer simulations, but many difficult problems remain  well beyond the reach of today's hardware and software  technology.  Even improvements in computer power of several  orders of magnitude will not enable the direct simulation of  complex proteins or DNA chains on  the longest relevant timescales  unless substantial improvements are also obtained in computer  algorithms and software.  A key component of simulation software  for many large-scale problems in biochemistry, chemistry,  physics, and materials science is the fundamental molecular  dynamics integration scheme, which approximates the changing  positions and velocities of the constituent atoms of a substance  from one moment in time to the next.  In this project an  interdisciplinary team from biochemistry, chemistry and  mathematics develops new molecular dynamics integrators in order  to improve the efficiency and accuracy of simulations.  Funding  for the project is provided by programs of Computational  Mathematics, Theoretical and Computational Chemistry, and the  Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS and by the  Computational Biology program in BIO.",
