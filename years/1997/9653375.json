 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four one-week long short courses on Microelectronic Packaging will be offered over a two year period, in June and July, during Years I and II.  Microelectronic packaging, which is the technology of encapsulating semiconductor devices, is an interdisciplinary field which requires knowledge from several traditional engineering and science disciplines. The subject matter of the short course will be of interest to faculty in electrical, mechanical, materials and industrial engineering.      Hands-on laboratory exercises will be a major component of the course, which will emphasize multi-disciplinary package design, long term reliability and manufacturing operations.  A field trip to a local Silicon Valley industry will enhance the learning process.  Examples of how the short course material can be integrated into existing curricula will be provided.  Follow through support will be provided for participants to assist them in introducing these concepts at their home institutions.  This will be monitored on an on-going basis, via questionnaires and direct email contact.  Problems faced, solutions developed - especially innovative ones - new laboratory exercises developed, and other pertinent information will be compiled and distributed to all participants in the form of a periodic newsletter.  SJSU's College of Engineering will serve as a depository for this material.  A manual on \"Laboratory Exercises in Microelectronic Packaging\" will be prepared and provided to participants.  This will also be made available to other interested university faculty.  An independent evaluator will conduct, compile and distribute course evaluations by participants.",
