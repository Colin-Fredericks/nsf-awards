 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is improving the learning, retention, understanding, application and appreciation of physics concepts and principles by students enrolled in all introductory physics courses.  It is also providing a model of recent technology and curriculum materials for 2-year colleges.  This goal is being accomplished by acquiring faster and more powerful computer technology that can update, expand, extend, and broaden the current use of microcomputer and digital video technology in physics.  This technology provides quick graphical feedback that makes possible a larger number and variety of experiences, which can motivate and challenge students.    Software and hardware is being acquired for a new laboratory of networked microcomputer workstations equipped with high speed digital video capture and laboratory interfaces with appropriate sensors and probes.  The workstations also include shared laser printers and a local physics network server.    This project is encouraging students to support science by improving their experiences in physics, as well as increasing science literacy.  It is helping to prepare students in physics courses for the next century and to stimulate other community colleges to consider adapting these approaches.  *",
