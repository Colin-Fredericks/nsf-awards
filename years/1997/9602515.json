 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602515  Hillery     This is a collaborative project between Professor Mark   Hillery of the Department of Physics, Hunter College, and   Professor Peter Drummond of the Department of Physics,   The University of Queensland, Australia.  Over a three-   year period, Professor Hillery will make several trips to   Brisbane to work with Dr. Drummond on the study of the   propagation of the quantized electromagnetic field in   nonlinear dielectric media.  This is important from a   fundamental point of view because it provides an example   of an experimentally accessible quantum field theory.   From a practical point of view, the quantum noise in   these fields must be understood if they are to be used   for long distance communication in optical fibers as has   been proposed.  The models which have been used to treat   these phenomena are either phenomenological or based on   the quantization of the macroscopic Maxwell equations.  A   microscopic approach to the description of quantized   fields in a medium of two-level atoms has recently been   developed at Hunter College.  Dispersion, which can be a   problem in a macroscopic approach to quantized fields in   dielectric media, is naturally incorporated into this   theory.  This description will be extended to a medium of   3-level atoms.  This will allow the theory to encompass   nonlinear processes, such as parametric down conversion,   which were not described by the 2-level atom medium.  The   counterpart investigators will concentrate primarily on   the description of how a field propagates from free space   through a medium and emerges again into free space.  The   study of finite media should allow the collaborators to   examine the input-output theories which are used in   quantum optics at a more fundamental level and to address   some of the problems which arise in them. The analytical   and numerical techniques which the Australian counterpart   has developed on the macroscopic level will complement   what the principal investigator and  his colleagues have   developed at Hunter College on the microscopic model.",
