 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9702034  Howell    Through committed leadership and an innovative use of resources, The South Carolina Alliance  for Minority Participation (SCAMP) has been effective in increasing the participation of  underrepresented students in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) fields.   An underrepresented level of collaboration among Alliance partners has fostered the development  of new outcomes that have increased student success as demonstrated by the gains in enrollments  and degrees awarded since the project's inception.  Support from the business sector, State  Government and other strategic partnerships have made SMET education a reality for all  students.  Building on foundation of the first phase of NSF funding, SCAMP will achieve greater  success through expansion of its programs and activities to include greater numbers of  participants.    An increased emphasis on two-year transfers and transition to graduate school will be featured  in Phase II.  The curriculum reform efforts will be extended to a new target disciplines such as  chemistry, physics, and computer science.  Linkages with business and industry will be  expanded to sustain success beyond the Phase II funding period.  The high level of cost-sharing  in Phase II represents the strong commitment by institutional leaders.  New legislation and  policies that call for increased accountability for student success and performance will foster  greater institutionalization of SCAMP programs and activities and will create new opportunities  for involvement from all sectors.",
