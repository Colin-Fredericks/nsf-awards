 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish the National Bryophyte Information  Service (NBIS), a distributed, Internet-based information service  and testbed facility for the botanical research community. The  mission of the NBIS is: (1) to provide immediate support for  bryophyte collections data access that is urgently needed by  several biodiversity projects and (2) to create a long-term,  sustainable testbed for continuing research on biodiversity  database and information system interoperability and scalability.    This initiative is a multi-disciplinary and inter-institutional  collaboration. Missouri Botanical Garden (www.mobot.org), the New  York Botanical Garden (www.nybg.org) and the Bishop Museum  (www.bishop.hawaii.org) will partner on research focussed on  hybridizing Web and database technologies to improve access,  interoperability, and scalability of biodiversity information  systems.  In order to provide simultaneous, integrated access to  bryology research data in multiple systems we will design and  implement a multidatabase federation. In addition, we will  develop policies and mechanisms to support community curation of  the databases and will deploy an individualized Web interface  configuration service for researchers.  The project will also  participate in the Biological Collections Schema Library Project  (www.bishop.hawaii.org/asc-cnc) and will, in part, utilize the  Object Protocol Model database software from Lawrence Berkeley  National Laboratory.    These activities address an identified need to improve the  social, access, and content scalability of biological databases.  It also addresses one of the most important \"Grand Challenge\"  problems facing bioinformatics, the problem of information-  resource interoperability. We propose straightforward and  effective solutions that can yield short-term benefits to the  bryology community and, in the long term, complement and extend  related theoretical and empirical bioinformatics research.      This project is being jointly supported  by the National Science  Foundation and the US Geological Survey Biological Resources  Division as part of the development of the National Biological  Information Infrastructure (www.nbs.gov/nbii).",
