 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618327  Li       For global climate models to accurately predict future  climate a detailed knowledge of carbon cycling through  through the oceans must be achieved.  This study will  investigate the causes for the elevated supersaturation of  the surface oceans with respect to carbonate minerals and  carbonate dissolution at shallow to mid-depths as a sink for  anthropogenic CO2.       The composition of a film which forms on calcite  samples in the surface oceans will be investigated.  This  film is believed to be responsible for the supersaturated  state of the surface ocean, however, its composition is  still a matter of controversy.  In laboratory experiments,  carbonate surfaces will be scanned while submerged in  synthetic and natural seawater solutions of varying  composition, via atomic force microscopy (AFM), the  formation of films can be observed in quasi-real time.  The  acquired surface morphology of these samples can then be  compared to the acquired surface morphologies of samples  deployed in the upper ocean.  In order to determine acquired  surface composition, samples generated at sea and in the  laboratory will be subjected to X-ray Florescence  Spectroscopy (XFS) and include low grazing angles.       In the early stage of this project, abiotic aragonite,  Mg-calcite and calcite samples will be deployed in a depth  profile at station ALOHA in conjunction with the JGOFS  Hawaii Ocean Time-series project.  Also, natural assemblages  of coccolith tests, foram shells and pteropod shells will be  deployed in a depth profile at station ALOHA in conjunction  with the JGOFS Bermuda Biological Research station in the  North Atlantic.  Relevant parameters of the CO2  system are  measured as part of HOT and BAT with a great deal of  precision and accuracy.  This data will allow for the  evaluation of experimental measurements along side  thermodynamic predictions. Future projects will then take on  a global prospective with the aid of other JGOFS research  groups around the world.  A fter obtaining measurements in  all of the oceans an assessment of shallow carbonate  dissolution as a sink for atmospheric CO2 can be attempted.  ***",
