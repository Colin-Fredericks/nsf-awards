 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708153  Azam  Bacterial production, via 3H-thymidine incorporation, is a  \"core\" parameter in biological oceanography and marine  biogeochemistry.  No non-radio-isotopic method is currently  available but one would be highly desirable for a variety of  logistical, safety and scientific reasons.  This project  will develop a non-radioisotopic method based on the use of  the thymidine analog, 5-bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU), for  measuring the rate of bacterial DNA synthesis in seawater  samples.  BrdU behaves as a thymidine analog and becomes  incorporated into newly synthesized DNA in place of  thymidine.  Its incorporation into DNA is quantified by an  immunochemical method.  After BrdU incorporation, the cells  are permeabilized and treated with an antibody which binds  to BrdU in the DNA.  A second antibody, conjugated with a  fluorochrome or a dye, is then used to quantify BrdU  incorporation.  Many different procedures for quantifying  BrdU incorporation into DNA have been employed.  Current  protocols will be tested and modified as necessary to  provide the simplest reliable method for aquatic microbial  assemblages.  An additional benefit of this approach is the  possibility to estimate growth rates of individual bacteria  in a sample in situ hybridization.  The fluorescent signal  of individual bacteria could be determined by  epifluorescence microscopy or by flow cytometry.  In  principle, the BrdU-labeling could even be combined with  rRNA gene probing and, using flow cytometry, growth rates  could then be estimated for any specific group of bacteria  in a complex assemblage.  Such a capacity would  revolutionize the study of microbial ecology, providing  information on growth rates in microbial populations at a  level of detail not possible with the current radiolabeling  procedures.",
