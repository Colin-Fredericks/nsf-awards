 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702329  Mead  In spite of the rapid developments in semiconductor laser performance and the expanding role that these devices now play in the optoelectronics industry, well defined models describing long term reliability and degradation processes continue to lag behind in their developments.  As an example, several reports on the reliability of 980nm semiconductor lasers given over the past two years cite gradual degradation rates as observed from characteristic power-current (PI) curves obtained from long term continuous wave (CW) testing.  Most often, the tests are performed at high temperature to accelerate the degradation process.  This methodology treats the environmental temperature as a global parameter which initiates degradation, and it is assumed that an exponential relationship defines the rate at which degradation actually occurs.    This research plan describes a rigorous experimental approach to development of reliability models for degradation of laser diode devices using Raman studies on devices which have been aged in a variety of environmental seetings.  The approach is in agreement with a three step reliability model criteria designed to produce physics based models of device degradation.    The academic plan includes a multifaceted approach that is designed to encourage participation of women and underrepresented students.  The author has demonstrated a commitment to outreach programming and engineering curriculum transformation.  These activities are enhanced through implementation of this research.  ***",
