Current manufacturing processes are labor intensive. Magnetic core and wire diameters are very small (2.5 mm and 0.075 mm) making machine assembly impractical. The proposed approach uses automated techniques similar to semiconductor manufacturing to deposit, etch, and coat patterned layers of magnetic, conductive and insulating materials. This automation will significantly reduce labor content, further reduce device size, and enable economic production in the United States rather than offshore. Research objectives include completion of electrical and mechanical transformer design and fabrication of prototypes. Fundamental phenomena underlying device operation and electrical performance will be evaluated.   Commercial applications include high frequency transformers and inductors for data and video transmissions, hybrid circuits, and related circuitry.  Beyond existing markets, this new approach will enable development of miniature products in data and personal communications.  ***",
