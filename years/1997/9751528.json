 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interdisciplinary project serving undergraduates in geography and aquatic biology is focusing heavily on the quantification of spatial data.  Recent technological advances have transformed spatial data acquisition and analysis processes.  In particular, approaches integrating geographical information systems (GIS), global positioning systems (GPS), and hydroacoustic technologies are rapidly becoming standard methods in geographical and limnological research. The equipment necessary to develop an integrated system for site analysis and acquisition of spatial data from aquatic environments is being purchased.    The project is preparing undergraduates for resource management careers, field research, or graduate school.  The project is also enhancing student understanding of scientific processes, especially among those students who enroll in the courses as electives.  In addition, demonstration projects with high school biology teachers on local reservations is serving to encourage a greater interest in science among Native American students.    The main point of the project is an innovative plan combining teams of two or three students from the Geography's Field Methods course with two or three students from the Aquatic Biology program's core Limnology course.  Members of each of these teams interact to produce detailed digital maps of aquatic environments.  This project allows students from the two disciplines to interact as complementary \"content experts\" in applying new technologies to real-world problems.  The new GIS/GPS/hydroacoustics system is also being used for field instruction in several undergraduate geography and aquatic biology courses. Equipment is also available for student use in directed research projects, which are required in both majors.  *",
