Although linear diode arrays and small area, monochromatic and full-color COD matrices have been developed (and used in devices such as scanners and video cameras), there are special opportunities for using large area, flexible image sensors. One possible application might be a flexible or foldable, thin image sensor of book size that could directly and rapidly read images into memory (without scanning) from either paper, computer monitors, or TV screens. The stored image could then be copied over to another piece of paper or even sent by fax to a remote site. Polymer diode photodetector devices provide a novel and attractive approach to such large area, high sensitivity image sensing. The proposed Phase I research will continue UNIAX's ongoing development of photonic and electronic devices based on semiconducting organic polymers and will focus both on identifying materials appropriate for the spectral ranges of interest (such as full-color capability), and on optimizing device parameters. Device operating life and environmental stability are other parameters to be characterized during the Phase I effort.   Polymer diode photodetectors would address a strategic need for large area linear diode arrays and image sensors for military applications such as strategic threat warning and target identification and tracking in aerial reconnaissance vehicles.  These military applications would be balanced by a number of commercial applications in the office automation and consumer electronics industries, as well as in astrophysics/space technology and in medical technology. ***",
