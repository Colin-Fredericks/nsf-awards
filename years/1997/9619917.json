Agarwal (U. of Wyoming)    Partial travel support will be provided to a group of  ten U.S. academic researchers to attend and present papers at the conference \"Frontiers in Industrial Process Tomography\" to be held April 9-12 in Delft (NL).  Process tomography is an emerging field of research because of the new experimental and computational techniques made available in recent years, and its potential use for on-line process control and in non-invasive laboratory experiments.  The topic has received a special attention in the European Community funding, and as a result there are outstanding advances in the field at several European universities including the Delft University.  The conference will address modeling, measurements and applications of multiphase and particulate flows.  The topic is highly interdisciplinary, and efforts have been made to bring the best qualified scientists and engineers at the meeting, including academic and industry researchers from Europe, North America and Asia.  The focus of the conference is on critical future developments needed to apply tomography technology to process engineering.  The meeting is held in conjunction with the \"Control of Particulate Processes\" conference at the same location.",
