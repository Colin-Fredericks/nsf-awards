 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714604  Chandrasekar  Technology implementation in the discrete manufacturing  sector is more difficult than in the continuous process  (e.g. chemical, flat glass) and semiconductor industries,  where the availability of scaling laws, unit process models,  and integrated system models has allowed for the rapid  implementation of new technology.  In this study, a new  approach is developed for modeling a manufacturing system by  starting with detailed physical models of the unit  processes, such as machining and polishing, and integrating  them into a unified system model. This development  illustrates an avenue for the discrete manufacturing  industry to achieve many of the capabilities of the  continuous process and semiconductor industries. Models are  first developed for an example unit process, viz. abrasive  polishing, which is widely used to produce smooth surfaces  of precision mechanical and electronic components.  This is  accomplished through a combined experimental and theoretical  study of the mechanics of polishing.  The models have the  capability of predicting various outputs of the polishing  process such as surface finish, residual stresses and depth  of plastically deformed layers on polished surfaces; and  rate of material removal.  The problem of integrating a  collection of unit process models into a unified model for  the entire manufacturing system is next studied.  This  requires, for example, that unit operation models be  developed to a stage where they can provide information  about process variances and the sources of these variances.  The results of this research enable the development of a  unique seminar course and short monograph that will help  advanced undergraduate and graduate students to compare and  contrast process and system modeling issues in the  continuous process, discrete manufacturing and semiconductor  industries.  ***",
