 "awd_abstract_narration": "George Stell is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the   statistical mechanics of liquids.  The research is directed at trying to   understand complex fluid properties in terms of the long and short range   interactions between idealized particles.  Variations of the   Ornstein-Zernike integral equation method are used which are validated by   Monte Carlo simulations.  Special emphasis is placed on understanding   ionic and dipolar fluids as well as fluids that are chemically   associating.  The role of ionic association due to strong electrostatic   interactions is being studied with special focus on the effect that   ion/ion pair and ion-pair/ion-pair interactions have on the   thermodynamics of phase separation and on fluid structure near the   critical point.    This research provides an important molecular level understanding of the   detailed interaction of molecular species in condensed phases.  This   level of understanding is important in the field of chemistry since the   large majority of chemical reactions take place either in aqueous   solution or in the liquid phase.  A more thorough understanding of the   thermodynamic and transport properties of condensed phase systems,   particularly ionic and polar fluids, will aid in the design and   engineering of efficient chemical engineering processes.",
