 "awd_abstract_narration": "9709905  Jordan    This proposal is to continue a collaborative project between  seismologists and mineral physicists.  The project's goal is to  increase the understanding of the Earth's upper mantle and  transition zone  through an integrated, quantitative analysis of seismological and  mineralogical data.  During the first year of this project, the  PIs have completed two collaborative investigations of the fine  structure of the 410-km and 660-km phase transitions.  These  studies demonstrate that some of the details of these transitions  predicted by the laboratory data (e.g., finite width) can be  resolved by seismic data on frequency-dependent reflection  coefficients and triplicated waveforms.  Moreover, it appears that the seismic data can constrain model  parameters that are only poorly determined in the laboratory.  In  the next phase of research, they will use a combination of  mineralogical and seismological constraints to derive a new  generation of regional upper-mantle models that should eliminate  some inconsistencies evident in their published models.  They  will also conduct new seismic experiments to resolve the fine  structure of the 410-km, 520-km, and 660-km transitions and use  these data to test hypotheses based on refined mineralogical  models.  ***",
