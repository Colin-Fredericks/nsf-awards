Four experiments are planned.  In the first  experiment the doctoral student will administer a questionnaire developed by his advisor and a co-author.  The goal is to study similarities and differences between American and PRC students in their decision making concerning societal equity and  public health and safety risks.  In the second study interviews will be conducted using government officials and business executives to examine their decision processes in situations involving fairness and the distribution of safety risks.   In the third study students will be surveyed to assess their attitudes regarding fair prices in economic transactions.  In the fourth study ordinary Chinese citizens and students will be interviewed regarding fairness issues in their changing society.  A goal of this group of studies is to propose a framework to model cultural influences on decision making.                                                      \u00a2\u00c1 \u00a2\u00a5\u2510\u2524\u2563\u00c1\u00a2   /\u2524\u2524\u255d\u00c1\u00a2\u00a2 \u2593?\u00a5\u00a9 \u00c2\u2510>\u2524/_\u00c1>\u00a5/% \u2563\u00a2\u00a2\u2510\u00c1\u00a2 \u255d\u00c1\u00c0/\u255d\u2524\u2563>\u00c0 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2502\u00a9\u00c1_\u2563\u00a2\u00a5\u255d` ?\u00c2 \u2502/\u255d\u2593\u00c1>\u00c1\u00a2 />\u2524   \u2551\u255d/\u2502\u00a5\u2563\u2502/% \u2563\u00a2\u00a2\u2510\u00c1\u00a2 \u255d\u00c1\u00c0/\u255d\u2524\u2563>\u00c0 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2510\u00a2\u00c1 ? \u00c2 \u2502/\u255d\u2593\u00c1>\u00c1\u00a2 \u2563> \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2502?>\u00a5\u255d?%%\u00c1\u2524   \u00a2`>\u00a5\u00a9\u00c1\u00a2\u2563\u00a2 ?\u00c2 \u2563_\u2551?\u255d\u00a5/>\u00a5 ?\u255d\u00c0/>\u2563\u2502 \u2502?_\u2551?\u2510>\u2524\u00a2",
