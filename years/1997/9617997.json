 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on design and fabrication for a novel class of mechanical  system known as compliant mechanisms.  Compliant devices replace elements  traditionally assembled using joints and springs with compliant flexible members  that use elastic deformations to transmit motions and forces.  This allows the  research to concentrate more on representation, translation, and interface issues  of design and fabrication, and less on issues such as assemble and  manufacturability.  The domain of compliant mechanisms allows design and  optimization to be performed on devices at both the macro and micro level (e.g.,  SFF and MEMS-type fabrication processes, respectively), and so will afford a  unique opportunity to study the clean separation of design and fabrication  analogous to the VLSI paradigm.    This research targets three primary areas of compliant mechanism design and  fabrication.  Fundamental to this study is the optimal synthesis of compliant  devices, both macro and micro.  This includes the design and analysis of 3-D  structures and the nonlinearities associated with large deformations.  The  ability to form more complex objects based on a library of standardized  parametric components will also be explored.  As the processes are generally not  the same, the issue of designing and refining translation tools to move between  representations is a critical component in this research.  The choice of  intermediate representations will be critically examined, and the appropriate  translation tools will be developed.  The goal here will be to push towards  intermediate formats that are suitable to multiple fabrication processes, at both  the micro and macro scales.  Finally, the ability to test and refine designs for  micro structures by the use of macro prototypes fabricated from the same initial  model will be developed, and its utility in the design of MEMS devices will be  carefully examined.",
