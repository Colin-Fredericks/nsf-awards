In each project, the design and analysis  of various mechanisms are carried out for different classes of matching problems.  In the first project two notions of manipulation are formulated for centralized two-  sided matching markets (Gale & Shapley (1962)). Matching activities both before and after  thee centralized market are often observed in these markets.  Notions of manipulation via  withholding positions and manipulation via pre-arranged matches are introduced and  unraveling behavior is justified from an incentives point of view. Environments yielding manipulation opportunities are analyzed and two prominent mechanisms are evaluated based on their vulnerability to manipulation.  In the second project a mechanism es proposed for the allocation of housing.  Various properties of this mechanism are studied (including its efficiency and fairness properties) and its axiomatic characterizations are obtained.  A wider class of problems which captures some real life complications in the allocation of  housing is introduced, and our proposed mechanism are extended to this wider  c lass.  In the third project a new class of matching problems that models centralized college  admissions via standardized tests is introduced and a mechanism that is used in some  real life applications is studied. An alternative mechanism based on the Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm is proposed and is shown to be the only `reasonable` mechanism based on its efficiency and fairness properties.",
