 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706273    Craig             The proposed research is on a class of partial differential   equations which are unified by their character as wave equations   and by the fact that they can each be written in the form of a   Hamiltonian system. Important examples of this class are the   linear and nonlinear Schroedinger equations, the nonlinear wave   and Klein-Gordon equations, the Korteweg deVries equation, and the   Euler equations governing free surface problems in fluid dynamics.  The first project of the investigator is to consider issues of   existence and regularity of the initial value problem for these   equations, and it will continue a study of KAM tori and other   constructions of the principal features of the infinite dimensional   phase space in which these equations are posed. The second project   is an analysis of dispersive linear equations, principally the   Schroedinger equation, addressing details of the local and   microlocal regularity of the fundamental solution and its   relationship to the global behavior of bicharacteristics of the   principal symbol. The third research project includes a special   focus on the mathematical analysis of free surface problems of   fluid dynamics.         The nonlinear differential equations studied in this project  occur in mathematical physics and engineering in a remarkable  variety of settings, from cosmology to fluid dynamics of the  ocean to nonlinear optics. Work in this field addresses some   of the basic characteristics of solutions of these equations,   which is a contribution to our knowledge of the physical world,   and which can contribute in nontrivial ways to developments   in advanced technology. This project also specifically pursues   the purely mathematical goal of developing the beautiful analogy   between the theory of classical mechanics of last century and   the modern theory of partial differential equations.",
