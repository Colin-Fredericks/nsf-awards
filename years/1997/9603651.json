 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603651  Dulka    There are striking sex differences in the central nervous  system, and in the physiology and behavior of most  vertebrates.  Steroid hormones derived from the gonads of  males and females are primarily responsible for generating  and maintaining these differences.  Androgens and estrogens  have been shown to both organize sex-specific neural  pathways during critical periods of development, and cause  structural remodeling of existing neural pathways later in  adulthood.  This steroid-induced neural plasticity in  adulthood not only involves changes in synaptic connections  and neuronal morphology, but also changes in the expression  of pathway-specific neuropeptides.   This is very important  since neuropeptides play an important role in modulating  neurotransmitter activity.  Moreover, there is surprisingly  little information on neuropeptide systems which either  originate in, or innervate sexually dimorphic brain regions.  Dr. Dulka is using a neuroethological model system to  examine this issues.  He will explore how steroid-induced  neural plasticity of neuropeptides mediate behaviors in  vertebrates.  Dr. Dulka has found that the neuropeptide  substance P located in several important forebrain regions  is sexually dimorphic in that males, not females, have an  intense network of substance P activity.  He  will use a  multidisciplinary approach that includes neuroanatomical,  neurophysiological, biochemical, and behavioral techniques  to determine how androgens modulate the substance P system  in the brain to influence a complex communicatory behavior.  These results are crucial to understanding the basic  mechanisms underlying neural plasticity.  Furthermore, they  will generate important new knowledge of  steroid and  peptide hormone interactions in the brain of vertebrates,  and how such interactions play a role in establishing sex  differences in neural organization, circuitry, and behavior.",
