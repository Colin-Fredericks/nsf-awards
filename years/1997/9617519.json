The first will break a robotic control system into groups of behavior producing agents and provide arbitration mechanisms to control the resources used by agents.  The second will implement a new algorithm for (robot) visual control of robot arm motion. The third project will port a software system for research in mathematical morphology (a branch of non-linear image processing) from Unix to NT and  incorporate new hue-based morphological image operators recently developed by one of the investigators. The fourth will develop and rigorously evaluate algorithms to detect subtle changes in the morphology of brain structures through the computer analysis of 3D imagery.  The fifth project will assist, through computed imagery, neurosurgeons performing tumor resection.    All five of the projects are computationally intensive and will make heavy use of computer graphics and image processing (both 2D and 3D). Two of six computers and an embedded Pentium system will be dedicated the first project. One computer each will be used by the other four. Projects 1 and 5 will use graphics accelerators and 3D glasses. Project 2 will use a frame grabber.  Projects 4 and 5 will use the CD-ROM recorder.  Projects 1 and 2 will use MSN developer's licenses.  All 5 will need C++ and will be serviced by the remaining hardware and software.",
