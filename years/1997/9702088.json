 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702088  Margulies  The primary objective of this integrated research and  educational plan is to develop research and educational  programs that span the interdisciplinary chasm between the  level of the cell and the organ, with an emphasis on the  effects of applied physical forces on function and  structure.    The research plan is a first step towards the long-term  goals of understanding the deformations of the epithelial  lining of the lung in vivo, and determining the effects of  these deformations on the lung's adverse effects.  Barotrauma, or the presence of extra-alveolar air after  rupture of over-distended alveoli, is the consequence of a  sustained mechanical ventilation with large tidal volumes.  The overall hypothesis is that the alveolar epithelial  lining of the lung is vulnerable to injury from large static  and dynamic deformations during mechanical ventilation.  The  research plan relates mechanical deformation to disruption  of the epithelial surfactant-producing and barrier  properties of the lung using in vitro cell culture studies,  mathematical models, and in vivo experimental studies.    The long-term goal of the educational component of the  career development plan is to create Bioengineering graduate  courses that integrate fundamental engineering theories with  biomedical applications.  Three courses will be developed:  1) a course in integrated cardiothoracic physiology that  brings together basic knowledge and recent research findings  from the molecular, cellular and organ levels to correlate  cellular and molecular mechanisms with macroscopic  functional responses; 2) a course in viscoelastic tissue  behavior and large strain measurement techniques and  analysis; and 3) experimental design and analysis, and  scientific responsibility.    The dual mission of the integrated research and educational  career development plan is to meet the growing need for  research and educational opportunities that cut across  disciplines to answer fundamental scientific questions.   ***",
