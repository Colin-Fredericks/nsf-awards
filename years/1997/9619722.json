 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619722  Dubin    The interaction of polyelectrolytes with colloidal particles  and surfaces is central to a many industrial processes and  biological phenomena, such as dispersion stabilization and  flocculation, and the binding of. proteins to DNA. Since  these interactions are predominantly coulombic,the PI will  study systems in which key electrostatic quantities --  colloid surface charge density, polymer linear charge  density, and ionic strength,--can be systematically varied.  The polyelectrolytes will be both cationic, such as  poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride), and anionic, such as  poly(acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonate) and copolymers  thereof. The colloidal particles studied will be micelles,  vesicles, proteins and dendrimers. Some of these systems  have individual significance, e.g. polyelectrolyte-protein  complexes for protein separations, polyelectrolyte-micelle  complexes for removal of trace organics, and polyelectrolyte  vesicle complexes for drug delivery.  One of the goals will  be to evaluate two very distinct theoretical treatments. The  first predicts second-order phase transitions for  polyelectrolyte adsorption on oppositely charged surfaces  (large particles.  The second describes the binding of  charged ligands (small particles) to polyions within the  context of counterion condensation theory. In addition, a  number of questlons related to specific experimental systems  will be addressed: (a) Do mlcelies restructure upon binding  to polyions? (b) Can the \"spacer effect\" of nonionic co-  surfactants be quantitatively explained? (c) What is the  state of proteins in complexes and coacervates, in terms of  tertiary structure, rotational freedom, and enzyme activity?  (d) What is the microstructure of protein-polyelectrolyte  and micelle-polyelectrolyte coacervates? and (e) How does  polyelectrolyte adsorption affect liposome permeability?  %%%%  This project is in the area of colloidal particles, surfaces,  and polyelectrolytes, whose interactions have importan t  implications to a number of biological and industrial processes  ***",
