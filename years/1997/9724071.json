Since the enzyme is a metalloprotein with 2 moles of Zn per subunit of T4-phage enzyme and 1 mole of Zn per subunit of human enzyme, studies are planned to define the role of Zn for each enzyme and in particular the second Zn in the T4-phage enzyme. Mutational studies are planned to confirm the location of the second zinc and its role will be examined by Zn replacement and deletion. The effect of these mutations on transcription by their role in maintaining the hexameric structure of the enzyme, and their interaction with T4-phage TS will be examined.  Most dCMP deaminase holoenzymes are hexamers, but the yeast enzyme appears to differ.  Different constructs of this enzyme, one that is full length and others that are truncated will be studied.  Questions to be answered are the nature of the enzyme's subunit composition, its regulation by dCTP and dTTP and whether the enzyme is located in the yeast membrane fraction.  In order to establish the role of the deaminase in eukaryotic cells, attempts to delete the intact active dCMP deaminase gene from mice by homologous recombination are being pursued The researchers will investigate whether dCMP deaminase interacts with its mRNA and thereby autoregulates its own synthesis in an in vitro translation system.  Preliminary studies indicate this to be the case.  X-ray crystallography studies on both the T4-phage and human deaminases will be pursued. As with many proteins the crystal structures could yield answers related to substrate binding, allosteric ligand binding, and Zn binding, in addition to the nature of subunit interaction in an attempt to explain how this enzyme is regulated by dCTP and dTTP.    Non Technical  The concentrations of DNA precursors, nucleotides, are maintained very carefully in t he cell by the levels of the enzymes that comprise the nucleotide biosynthetic pathways and by the presence of various factors that can affect the activities of those enzymes.  There is ample data available to demonstrate that when the cell's nucleotide pool is perturbed, an increase in DNA mutation occurs.  The investigator's studies on the enzyme, deoxycytidylate deaminase, are key to a juncture in the nucleotide pathway leading to DNA.  Any mutations in that enzyme or restrictions of its activity can lead to a disturbances in cell growth and function.",
