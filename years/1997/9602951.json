 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for the purchase of an embryo microinjection  apparatus and associated equipment to be used in the production of  transgenic mice. This apparatus is to be used primarily for production  of transgenic mice using two technologies: pronuclear injection of DNA  and blastocyst/morula injection of embryonic stem cells. These are now  well-established methods with which all of the primary users are quite  familiar. The apparatus will also be used for transplantation  experiments (e.g. mitochondrial transplantation). This apparatus is to  be housed in a new transgenic facility, the construction of which is to  be completed by July 1, 1996. This facility will serve faculty members  of the MCD Biology and other departments on the University of Colorado  Boulder campus including Biochemistry and the Institute for Behavioral  Genetics.       As a reflection of the diverse research interests of these faculty  in multiple areas of biology, the animals to be created will address a  wide range of scientific issues. Areas under investigation include the  functions of neurotrophic factors in the development and maintenance of  the nervous system, the function of Wnt-family genes in the  morphogenesis of the limb and nervous system, the molecular basis of  muscle formation and contractility, the function of homologues of the  Drosophila mago nashi gene in mouse germ-cell development, and the  localization of quantitative trait loci.       This apparatus will be a core piece of equipment and is essential  in the production of transgenic mice. The analysis of transgenic mice  makes feasible the investigation of gene function in a mammal through  creation of animals having a defined genetic perturbation. Creation of  transgenic mice by pronuclear injection is the only widely used method  of integration of cloned DNA into random sites in the mouse genome.  Production of transgenic mice using embryonic stem cells modified by  gene targeting through blastocyst injection is presently favored (ove r  morula aggregation) by most practitioners. Thus, a microinjection  apparatus is an essential feature of any facility for the production of  transgenic mice.",
