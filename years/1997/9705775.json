 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT DMS-9705775       Kolountzakis     Kolountzakis will study properties of translational tilings of   Euclidean Space using Harmonic Analysis. A function f(x) is said to   \"tile\" the Euclidean space with the discrete \"tile set\" A if, when   translated at the locations of A, it adds up to a constant w (the   \"weight\" of the tiling), almost everywhere. One obtains an equivalent   condition for this to happen: the Fourier transform of the   distribution with one point mass at each point of A must be supported   at the zeros of the FT of the function f, plus the point 0.   Among the problems Kolountzakis  proposes to  study are:  (a) the structure of tilings of the line with tiles of non-compact   support, (b) the periodic tiling conjecture in higher dimension,  (c) results related to the uniqueness of the Poisson Summation formula,   (d) further estimates on the Steinhaus problem, (e) the problem of   simultaneous fundamental domains in general abelian groups and   (f) non-translational tilings of space via methods of non-abelian   harmonic analysis.    The study of tilings of space using a certain building block called  the \"tile\" has significant connections with crystallography. Interest  in this has been renewed after the, relatively recent, discovery  that non-periodic tilings (i.e., pavings of space which are  not \"determined\" by how they look in an arbitrarily large but finite  part of the space) do exist in nature. The question of which are  the possible ways that space can be tiled is the paramount one in this  field.  The proposed research will help  to understand the situation   in higher dimensions. Another domain of application of the proposed   methods concern the theory of Wavelets",
