 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chloride channels represent the most extensively characterized class of anion channels in living organisms. These channels participate in a wide variety of tasks, ranging from highly specialized ones, such as transepithelial movement of salts and water, to general housekeeping functions, such as regulation of cell volume. The elucidation of channel behavior and regulation has been aided largely by the application of patch clamp recording techniques. In several instances, molecular biological tools have led to primary structural data, permitting the determination of the structures underlying functional characteristics.    A defining property of such channels is their ability to conduct chloride ions. However, a significant number of chloride channels have been demonstrated to conduct iodide better than chloride. In most systems, this selectivity presents no problems, since chloride is present in tremendous excess compared to iodide. A notable exception is the thyroid gland, which vectorially transports iodide from the blood and into the follicular lumen. Here, an iodide selective channel would contribute substantially to normal physiology. Thus, the thyroid follicular cell could represent an ideal model system for eventually cloning an iodide selective anion channel, thereby facilitating elucidation of structural features that determine halide selectivity.    In order to obtain preliminary data that will be important in determining the feasibility of such long term goals, this study proposes to use patch recording techniques:  1) to determine if an iodide conducting channel resides in the apical membrane of the follicular thyrocyte and 2) to study biophysical properties, especially the halide selectivity, of such a channel.    Whereas comprehensive studies of cation channel selective permeability have been facilitated by the availability of both highly selective drugs as well as primary structural information, that of anion channels has suffered from the lack of specific pharmacological probes. M oreover, compared to that of cation channels, the application of molecular techniques in cloning and structure-function studies of anion channels is in its infancy. The latter has provided, however, information suggesting that the gating of these channels does not necessarily result from mechanisms analogous to those of cation channels. Thus, information gained from achieving the goals of this proposal may represent the first insights into novel mechanisms governing ionic selectivity of anion channels.",
