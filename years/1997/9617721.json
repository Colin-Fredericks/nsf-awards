 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617721  Millero       In recent years, chemical and biological oceanographers have  come  to  realize that primary production in vast  areas  of  the  ocean  far  from  land,  once  thought  to  be  limited  by   the  availability of inorganic nitrogen coming into surface waters, is  in  fact  limited  by  iron.  Now that further  ,  more  detailed  studies of this exciting discovery are underway, there is a  need  for  in-depth  understanding of the molecular-level  behavior  of  dissolved iron in seawater.        This  proposal is directed toward meeting this  need.   The  principal investigator, a leading world authority on the physical  chemistry  of  seawater, will carry out a  series  of  laboratory  studies to determine the fundamental chemical properties of  iron  in  seawater.  These investigations will include studies of  iron  solubility  under   various conditions and  of  the  complexation  behavior  of  iron - i.e., the ability of inorganic  and  organic  substances  in  seawater  to  bind  iron  and  thus  affect   its  solubility  and  biological availability.  Both the  kinetic  and  thermodynamic   (equilibrium)  aspects  of  iron   solution   and  complexation  will  be  studied in the context  of  more  general  theoretical models of seawater chemistry.  ***",
