 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program continues support for research on synthesis of complex metal   oxides by Dr. Jon Zubieta of the Chemistry Department, Syracuse   University.  Organic components will be introduced using hydrothermal   methods to form unusual solids of four general types: microporous solids   with zeolite scale cavities; layered mixed-valence transition metal   oxides containing organo-ammonium cations; vanadium and molybdenum   oxophosphates containing covalently-bonded organic ligands; and vanadium   oxides containing  coordination complexes.  These open-framework and   layered structures will be prepared by low-temperature methods based on   the model of biomineralization. While systematic synthesis of such   materials has been elusive, the long-term goal of this research is to   enable `design` of two classes of metal oxides: layered and zeolitic   oxovanadium and oxomolybdenum phosphates and organophosphonates, and   layered and three-dimensional vanadium oxides and molybdenum oxides.  Metal oxide based solid phase compounds are important in catalysis,   sorption, molecular electronics, energy storage, optical materials, and   ceramics.  Variations in chemical composition and structure effect a wide   range of properties.  New synthetic approaches to introducing organic   groups are expected to result in compounds with an expanded range of   properties by compensating charge, directing structural growth, or   connecting functional groups.",
