 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702589  Fuierer    The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development project is  to advance the state-of-the-art and understanding of sol-gel  chemistry routes to functional ceramic thin films by  investigating the effects of the molecular structure of  oligimers, derived from metalorganic precursors, on the ultimate  crystallographic structure (orientation) of ceramic films upon  heat treatment.  Bismuth titanate will be used as the model  ceramic material, due to its intrinsic structural anisotropy and  its useful ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties.  The  experimental techniques employed will test the prediction that  the homocondensation of Ti-O-Ti-O type molecular species and  their subsequent deposition by spin coating on the surface of the  substrate can lead to strongly-axis oriented films due to the  similarity in atomic bonding in the a-b plane of crystalline  bismuth titanate.  These experiments will attempt to go beyond  recent studies that illustrate the effect of oligomer molecular  structure on other sintered microstructural features such as  porosity and grain size.  This will be accomplished primarily by  two main ideas: (1) by taking a somewhat unorthodox approach of  promoting homocondensation in mixed systems and allowing  solutions to age for long periods of time, and (2) utilizing a  new experimental technique of oxygen isotope nuclear magnetic  resonance to determine the composition of the oligimer backbone  by analyzing the chemical environment of the oxygen.  The  principal investigator intends to incorporate an increasing  amount of chemical principles into classroom instruction of both  undergraduate- and graduate-level materials courses.  The  principal investigator's long term career goals are to become an  expert in the area of solution processing of anisotropic ceramic  films, and to continuously strive toward effective teaching of  the multidisciplinary field of materials science and engineering.  %%%  Proof of this phenomenon in sol-gel processing wi ll have  significant implications by providing a means of obtaining  textured films of other technologically important anisotropic  materials without relying on special substrates for epitaxial  growth.  In addition, the research will yield important  information about the kinetics of hydrolysis and condensation  reactions in solution and crystallization processes in chemical  thin films.  Thus, the project is expected to contribute to the  advance of improved materials for useful electronic, optical, and  magnetic devices.  The project is also aimed at helping to bridge  the gap between chemistry and materials science and engineering  by emphasizing the multidisciplinary aspects of these disciplines  in the classroom.  ***",
