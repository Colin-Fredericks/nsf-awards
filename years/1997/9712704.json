 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry program funds research in the laboratory of Professor Brice   Bosnich at the University of Chicago to study how dinuclear metal sites   can release their individual electrons to effect a two-electron reduction   of molecular oxygen to peroxide.  Such reductions are essential in   biology to activate oxygen to oxidize organic substrates.  This work will   contribute to a fundamental understanding of how the second metal ion can   more easily release an electron to molecular oxygen following withdrawal   of the first electron from the first metal ion to which the oxygen   coordinates.  Several binucleating ligands will be synthesized and   dinuclear metal complexes prepared as systems for studying the sequential   electron transfer process.  Reactions with oxygen atom transfer reagents   will also be studied.  Complexes that are likely to undergo oxidative   addition reactions in which the two electrons would derive from each   member of the metal ion pair will also be prepared and investigated.       Dinuclear transition metal ion complexes will be prepared in order   to study electron-pair transfer to oxygen and other substrates.  Some   types of biological activation of oxygen proceed by this route to   activate molecular oxygen to oxidize organic molecules.  This research   should lead to a better understanding of how electrons are derived from   metal ion pairs and this understanding could assist in inventing new   methods of activating oxygen to oxidize hydrocarbons in industrial   feedstock processes.",
