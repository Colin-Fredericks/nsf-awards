 "awd_abstract_narration": "9610389  Rosenthal    This project addresses a number of issues in systems theory and coding   theory. The main objectives of the proposal are: 1. A unified algebraic   theory for general matrix extension problems which, in special situations,   covers results of the pole placement and interpolation literature on one side   and results on matrix extensions on the other side. 2. An extension of the   Hermann-Martin correspondence well known for one dimensional systems   to the situation of multidimensional systems. 3. An optimal control theory   for linear systems over finite fields which will result in methods for   constructing convolutional codes with large free distance, low complexity   and simple decoding schemes.    Convolutional codes are used in the data transmission over phone lines, in   the area of wireless communication and in the transmission of pictures from   deep space. Feedback controllers are implemented in many different devices   such as aircraft, robots and chemical processes to mention a few. From a   mathematical point of view linear feedback controllers and convolutional   encoders are governed by similar set of equations. It is the goal of the   proposed research to develop a mathematical theory which will lead to   improved design techniques for feedback controllers of various type as well   as more efficient convolutional encoders and decoders.",
