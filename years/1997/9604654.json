 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604654  Randic    The perception of pain requires excitatory synaptic transmission from  primary afferent sensory fibers to secondary projection neurons in the  dorsal horn (DH) region of the spinal cord.  It is now well established  that the primary afferent fibers use glutamate, or  related amino acid, to  mediate this initial excitatory step in the pain pathway.  Glutamate  produces its effects through two broad categories of receptors called  ionotropic and metabotropic.  The activation of ionotropic glutamate  receptors is essential for fast excitatory transmission in the brain and  spinal cord.  Multiple metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are  expressed in neurons of the spinal cord dorsal horn (DH), the site of  processing of sensory signals, but their roles in synaptic function, and  contribution to the spinal somatosensory transmission, including  nociception, have yet to be elucidated.  Until recently, progress in  identifying the physiological and pathophysiological roles of mGluRs has  been hindered by the lack of selective agonists and antagonists.  The  recent development of ligands that bind specifically to these receptors has  provided a means of characterizing the important roles they may play in  tuning of fast synaptic transmission, including the induction of long-term  changes in synaptic efficacy.    Three major objectives of the proposed study are:  1. To pharmacologically  identify mGluR subtype(s) involved in modulation of primary afferent  neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the spinal cord dorsal horn  (laminae I-II).  2. To examine whether activation of the Group I mGluRs  (mGluR1 and/or mGluR5) mobilizes Ca2+ from internal stores in LI-II  neurons.  3. To study characteristics of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release  mechanism in the generation of Ca2+ signals in LI-II neurons.  A  combination of fura-2 imaging, extracellular, intracellular (sharp  microelectrodes) and whole-cell and perforated-patch recordings, and  pharmacological techniques, will be employed  to study the effects of  selective mGluR agonists and antagonists on excitatory synaptic responses  and mobilization of Ca2+ from internal stores in the in vitro preparations  of acutely isolated DH neurons (LI-II), and also in the LI-II neurons  within rat spinal cord slices.  LI-II cells in the spinal slices will be  visualized using infra-red videomicroscopy and intracellular labeling with  biocytin and rhodamine.    Delineating the physiological roles of individual subtypes of the mGluR in  the spinal DH, and cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying their  actions, is an important step toward understanding of implications of  glutamate-mediated transmission in the spinal cord DH synaptic function,  but in particular for synaptic plasticity.  Finally, this study may  contribute to our understanding of pathophysiological processes in the  spinal cord, especially pain, and thereby may lead to the development of  rational therapies.",
