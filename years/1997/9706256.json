 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706256    Howland         Howland will study (1.)  stability and chaos in discrete quantum  systems driven by time-dependent perturbations; (2.) the asymptotics of  resonance widths in multiscale perturbation problems; and (3.) the  occurrence of twisted bundles in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation for  molecular Hamiltonians.        Chaos Theory, one of the most important new fields of mathematics to  arise in the last few decades, is concerned with systems which can  exhibit a very erratic motion. The most common example is the turbulent  flow of water from a pipe when a faucet is turned on hard. A famous  early example concerned computer models of the weather, where the  occurrence of chaotic behavior makes it impossible to predict the  weather more than a few days in advance. Perhaps the most important  discovery has been simply the realization that, far from being rare,  chaotic behavior is not only very common, but in some sense, is actually  the most common type of behavior. The systems usually studied in Chaos  Theory are described by Classical Mechanics, the theory initiated by  Isaac Newton which describes ordinary objects like those we experience.  Microscopic systems like atoms, molecules, and electrons are not at all  like the objects of ordinary experience, and are described by a strange  theory known as Quantum Mechanics, which was developed in the first  quarter of this century. The main thrust of the present project is to  study Chaos Theory in the context of atomic and molecular systems. This  is quite difficult because, since Classical Mechanics and Quantum  Mechanics are so very different, there is no agreement on exactly what  it is that one wants to study. This is still a field where most experts  feel that some sort of new ideas and approaches will be needed before  the problem is understood. An example of the type of system that is of  interest is a Hydrogen atom in a laser field. As simple as this seems  physically, it is quite a difficult mathematical problem. In the  present  project, simple models of such a system will be studied in order to try  to come to some understanding of how they work.",
