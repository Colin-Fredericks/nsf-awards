 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant portion of recent scientific progress has taken place at the interface of the traditional science disciplines.  It is imperative that the training of undergraduate chemistry students reflects the current interdisciplinary nature of chemical research.  With this goal in mind, the Department of Chemistry has established a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry with a biochemistry emphasis.  This degree better prepares students for graduate work in biochemistry and medicine and for exciting career opportunities in the rapidly expanding biotechnology industry.    The new degree features an advanced laboratory in biochemistry, which integrates the concepts covered in the two biochemistry lecture courses.  The laboratory is using the theme of evolution and providing the students with a collaborative research experience.  This new approach satisfies several pedagogical objectives, including teaching a wide variety of biochemical techniques, reinforcing an appreciation of the chemical basis of biology, illustrating both the unity and diversity of life, providing a research experience, and supporting the development of a team-oriented approach to investigating a problem.    Three centrifuges, an electrophoresis setup, protein purification equipment, and a spectrophotometer are among the new equipment providing hands-on experiences with biochemical techniques actually used in research laboratories.  The program is greatly reducing the gap between undergraduates' education and actual research done in academic and industrial laboratories.  *",
