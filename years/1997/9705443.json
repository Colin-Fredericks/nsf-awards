The main goals  of this  research  are:   (1)   To measure the spin transport  of  exciton  magnetic  polarons     using     spatially-     and     temporally-resolved  photoluminescence  spectroscopy.    (2)    Use  time-resolved   near-field   optical  microscopy to  measure  local fluctuations and clusters of Mn-impurities  within  the ZnMnSe  alloy.   (3)   Measure  the  dynamics of  spin-polarized  exciton  populations  and  the  effect of phonons, magnetic ion exchange, electron-hole  exchange  and  band mixing on the thermalization times.  This research will  probe  directly  the  physics  of  spin interactions  using  all-optical  techniques  which  are  particularly suitable for use in semiconductors.  The  information  gained on spin dynamics in these systems will have application to  other  spin systems as well, particularly in metallic systems.  %%%  This  is  a  renewal project  targeted towards understanding  the  fundamental  physics  of  magnetic interactions in novel semiconductors  which  have been  doped with magnetic impurities.  Study of these interactions  has  direct  applicability to the technologically important area of magnetic  technologies  such as magnetic memories (eg. Hard disks),  super-  sensitive  magnetic  detectors, and magneto-optical modulators. These  novel  magnetic  semiconductors can be probed with ultrafast optical methods using  femtosecond  lasers.  This allows one to probe  the  dynamics  of  these  magnetic interactions on a time scale which is impossible  to  do  in the  metallic systems.  Such information is crucial to the improvement  of  existing and the development of new magnetic technologies.  ***",
