 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612306  Collins    Point defects in intermetallic compounds are investigated  using perturbed angular correlations of gamma rays (PAC), a  spectroscopy technique providing excellent resolution of  different local environments of probe atoms in solids.  Lattice vacancies and antisite defects belonging to higher-  order equilibrium defects are detected in atomic shells  close to indium probe atoms.  The equilibrium defect of  greatest interest is the high-temperature one that makes  diffusion possible, such as the Schottky vacancy-pair in a  binary alloy.  There are three objectives to the grant:  (1)  Properties of equilibrium defects are determined through  measurements on quenched samples and samples at high  temperature.  Binary alloys selected have the B2 (CsC1)  structure, including high-temperature structural aluminides,  such as NiAl and model systems such as PdIn and AuCd in  which disturbances from PAC probes are minimal.  For the  first time vacancy migration enthalpies are determined from  nuclear relaxation of PAC signals caused by vacancy motion  at high temperature.  (2)  A study is made of ordering among  Au and Ag atoms in the ternary compound AuAgCd2.   Because  the order parameter is determined locally, there is a much  greater sensitivity to order-parameter fluctuations than  found when using conventional diffraction methods.  If the  transition is found to be second-order, the measurements  give insight into the range of interactions leading to the  ordering.  (3)  The fraction of stored energy associated  with lattice vacancies in mechanically-milled PdIn is  examined using PAC to determine vacancy concentrations and  calorimetry to determine the stored energy.  To date there  is inadequate knowledge of how excess energy is stored in  materials during milling, and the goal of this study is to  determine the amount of energy stored in vacancies.  %%%  The material defects under study here affect phase stability  and diffusion in advanced materials used in a variety of  applic ations.  ***",
