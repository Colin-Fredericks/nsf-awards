 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9661259  McAlindon     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I is proposing a new approach to typing for typists with CTS. A new alphanumeric input device is proposed to address the ergonomic and efficiency needs of the physically disabled user. The device uses a pair of devices, each comprised of an inverted bowl upon which the hands comfortably rest. Its typing methodology entails creating a keystroke via a combination of positions of the two bowls. This combination of positions is called chording. Phase I evaluation will investigate the ergonomic, biomechanical, and typing performances of the new device. Such an evaluation will establish how effective the device may be in providing an alternative means of typing to those with physical disability of the upper extremity. Primary elements of evaluation include: character layout, motor skill requirements, physical and workload evaluation and memory requirements.   The device's potential for commercial success is enormous. The device's greatest commercial application lies in its ability to respond to any user's needs.  Outside of the disability realm, the device can be reduced in size without losing any of its functionality.  Portable computers could be made smaller, for example.  Another useful application of the device, because of its self containment, is in hostile environments.  The device can be completely sealed and still be fully functional; it can even be used under water.    ***",
