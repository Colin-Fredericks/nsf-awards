 "awd_abstract_narration": "9610297  Dempsey  The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at  Clarkson University will purchase an Advanced Servohydraulic  Test Instrument For In-Situ Ice Testing which will be  dedicated to support research in engineering.  The research  will be used for several research projects, including in  particular the constitutive behavior and fracture of single-  cum-multiple ice crystals, scaling laws for the fracture and  constitutive behavior of sea ice and structural composites,  and the time dependent creep and fracture of freshwater ice.  This advanced test instrument will have to be constructed by  the assembly and fabrication of specific components; it is  not possible to purchase an \"off-the-shelf\" in-situ ice  testing instrument with the capabilities required.  The  purpose is to test ice as it exists in nature -- with the  resident temperature, grain size, and density profiles, as  well as the varied grain orientations that occurs with the  growth of an ice sheet-at the warm (just a few degrees below  freezing) temperatures that are of practical interest in ice  engineering.  It is very difficult to test sea ice above -15  C, or freshwater ice above -8 C, in the conventional  laboratory setup because the ice is changing as a material.  Impurities on the grain boundaries are melting, brine  pockets are changing shape and migrating downward.  In  addition, from the viewpoint of an adequate specimen size,  the test specimen sizes that can be tested in the laboratory  have been shown to be sub-size. For this reason, there  exists an urgent, need for an advanced in-situ ice test  instrument at Clarkson University to augment the research  currently being carried out for several funded projects.  The test instrument will be used to test ice grown in a  specially designed 3 x 3 x l.2 m test basin.",
