This project  undertakes a study of the elucidation of a coupling  mechanism of electron and proton transfers at the quinone-B  site of photosynthetic reaction centers by using resonance  Raman spectroscopy.  The major goals of this project are:  1) investigate the structure and function of photosynthetic  reaction centers;  2) determine the role of quinone-B in  electron and proton transfer; and  3) apply resonance Raman  studies to quinones in bacterial reaction centers.    The project brings together the efforts of two laboratories  that have constituted different parts of the process: the  Americans have expertise in the preparation and  characterization of reaction centers and the Japanese  laboratory has the facilities for extensive experience in  biological application of resonance Raman spectroscopy.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project  will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote  international understanding and cooperation.  ***",
