 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this effort research and education at the  boundary of parallel systems and applications  will be performed. It is motivated by the need  for application insights to make fundamental  advances in parallel systems, and the recent  convergence in multiprocessor architectures to  general purpose nodes connected by a  communication architecture. On the research  side, challenging, irregular, dynamic  applications will be parallelized on real  systems in close collaboration with domain  researchers, particularly in probabilistic  protein structure determination and adaptive  unstructured meshing, and their implications  for parallel architecture and software  understood. General techniques for partitioning  such complex applications will be developed,  particularly for the emerging class of cache-  coherent distributed-memory multiprocessors.  The applications will be distributed as  benchmarks to the parallel computing community.  Architectural implications, particularly  communication demands, scaling and resource  distribution, will be examined, and scaling  methodologies developed. Funds permitting, a  range of commercial systems will be evaluated  using applications, to understand the impact of  their communication architectures and  tradeoffs, and insights  into programming and performance debugging  environments studied. On the education side, a  new undergraduate course in parallel  architecture will be developed, and a textbook  on parallel architecture is being written to  articulate the convergence and develop parallel  architecture as an engineering rather than  exotic discipline.",
