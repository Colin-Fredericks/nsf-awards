 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Zheng - 9713599    Plantwide control refers to control of an entire (continuous chemical) plant consisting of many interconnected unit operations.  Before the 1950's, it was commonly assumed that the objectives of plantwide control were the same as those of servomechanisms (i.e. good control means fast control).  This strategy of forcing variables to their steady-state values as fast as possible may fail in plantwide control because of the interaction among various loops.  An alternative strategy, \"setpoint environment control\" was developed, whose underlying philosophy was that if flows, temperatures, pressures, etc., in the plant were held constant, the product quality would also be constant.  These requirements can be inconsistent, for example, it is impossible to hold reflux flow constant and at the same time manipulate it to compensate for a disturbance.     The concept of \"dynamic process control,\" resolves these inconsistencies by distinguishing between material balance controllers and product quality controllers.  Material balance controllers act as low-pass filters (i.e. regulation) and product quality controllers act as high-pass filters (i.e. servo systems).  Surge capacities can be chosen such that the break frequency of the material balance control system is an order of magnitude lower than that of the quality control system to avoid significant interaction between the two control systems.  Thus, poor quality control can be overcome by installing sufficiently large surge capacities in the process.  For traditional processes with large surge capacities and over-designed unit operations, this approach is adequate for designing an effective plantwide control system.    Global economic competition has forced the process industries to improve their capital productivity and raw material utilization.  The overall goal of this research is to develop a systematic method for synthesizing optimal plantwide control systems for integrated continuous chemical processes.  A controllabil ity index, which quantifies the cost associated with dynamic controllability, is defined.  The Optimal Load Distribution Principle (and the Minimal Dynamic Cost Principle), which allow optimal handling of disturbance propagation and uncertainty propagation throughout the entire process, are introduced.  These two concepts permit a systematic design of a plantwide control system which minimizes the total cost.  The theory can also be used to quantitatively compare alternate flowsheets based on both steady-state economics and dynamic controllability.  Case studies will include several industrial processes, e.g. a hydrodealkylation of toluene to produce benzene, styrene, and cumene, and butane alkylation.  The results will be incorporated into the undergraduate process control course so that students can design a plantwide control system for the process that is designed in the process design course.",
