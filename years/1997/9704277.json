The major  thrust  of   the   study  will  focus  on  the  design,  synthesis,   and  characterization  of  a novel class of chemical  complexes.   The  researchers plan to conduct detailed excited state studies, which  will  include  energy gap law correlations and molecular  orbital  calculations   on  acceptor  ligands.  The  role   of   rigidity,  delocalization, and redox characteristics will be investigated to  determine  the  excited  state behavior  of  a  series  of  these  complexes.   The results of this study are expected  to  have  an  important  bearing  upon  the rational design  of  compounds  for  application in advanced materials.    The  research  will benefit from the combined  expertise  of  the  collaborators.     The   distinct   synthesis    expertise    and  computational abilities of the Chilean research group complements  the  US  group's  strength in molecular design and  photophysical  characterization.  ***",
