The main question to be answered is for  which fundamental groups the higher dimensional techniques of surgery  and s-cobordism theorems work.  The existing techniques include  sophisticated constructions of Casson-handles that answer the question  in the affirmative for a large class of groups.  In addition, there is  a proposed nilpotent group theory method for locating obstructions for  free fundamental groups.  Both methods will also be applied to the  link homotopy classification of disjoint 2-spheres in 4-space as well  as to questions concerning concordance classes of knots and links in  3-space.       One of the most exciting mathematical discoveries in the last  decade is the fact that Euclidean n-space behaves very differently  depending on whether the dimension n equals or doesn't equal 4 (which  is the dimension we live in, allowing time as the fourth dimension).  More precisely, we have all learned calculus in one real variable, and  some of us went on to learn calculus in n variables, i.e., the theory  of smooth functions on Euclidean n-space.  But very few of us were  told that for n=4 there are (uncountably!) many such theories, whereas  for all other dimensions there is a unique one, namely the one we were  taught.  In mathematical terms, I am talking about the \"exotic\"  structures on Euclidean 4-space, discovered by Donaldson, Freedman and  others around 1983.  This project deals with similar questions on more  complicated 4-dimensional manifolds (technically, those which have  nontrivial fundamental group).  One concrete difference from Euclidean  4-space is that in a general 4-manifold, not every vector-field  corresponds to a potential energy function.  ***",
