 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708165  Casper   The ultimate goals of this project are to measure the lateral spread of plant roots and to determine how rooting area changes with certain soil conditions and the presence of neighboring plants.  The one year project funded here will primarily test whether recently devised techniques in plant science can be applied to this problem.  We will test to what extent isotopes of cesium, lithium, rubidium, and strontium can be used as tracers to determine whether plants take up nutrients from a particular point in soil space.  These  elements serve as nutrient analogs which means that plants should take them up in place of common nutrients.  Because they are rare within most soils, we can place solutions containing these elements at defined locations in the soil and by detecting their presence in newly produced plant tissue, be certain that the plant's root system intersects the pocket of tracer.  By knowing how many of the plants in the population   have taken up a particular tracer, we can determine exactly how many root systems overlap in the area marked by tracer.  The use of all four tracers within a single population will enable us to measure root extension in four different directions and facilitate estimates of lateral rooting area.  A second technique will be applied to the question of whether fungal-root associations mycorrhizae) enlarge the soil area over which a plant takes up nutrients.  GORE-TEXR fabric will be used to separate tracer from plant roots.  Roots and nutrients do not pass through the small pores in the fabric but mycorrhizal hyphae do.  By physically isolating roots from tracers in this way, we can determine whether the mycorrhizae extend the distance over which a plant takes up nutrients.  Another experiment will determine whether the tracer moves laterally in the soil even in the absence of plant roots.   These experiments are important to understanding how below ground competition for soil resources takes place among plants.  We can measure how the presenc e of below ground competition affects plant growth, but we have little knowledge of which individuals are engaged in the competition.  We do not know whether interactions primarily occur between nearest   neighbors or whether root systems extend beyond nearest neighbors to include many other plants.  It is impossible to determine this information from excavating root systems because the fine roots that are most active in nutrient uptake cannot be recovered from the soil.  This information is essential to determining how the number and proximity of neighboring plants affect plant growth, whether it be in agricultural or natural systems.",
