The aim of the project is to provide research experience opportunities for eight undergraduate psychology majors during an 8-week summer training program.  Students will be recruited from Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Texas.  Students will engage in coursework as well as learn about the research process by conducting literature searches, conceptualizing research ideas, developing research methodology, conducting research, analyzing data, writing research reports, and presenting research papers at local, state, and regional conferences.  The program will enhance the professional growth and development of program participants.  This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.                                                          w",
