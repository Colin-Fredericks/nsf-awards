 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sociolinguistic Variation in American Sign Language, Phase II  The project is a continuation of NSF Grant #93110116.  Sociolinguistic variation in American Sign Language (ASL) will be  analyzed based on videotapes of conversational ASL produced by  deaf ASL signers from seven sites in the U.S. (Staunton, Va.,  Frederick,MD., Boston, New Orleans, Kansas City,Mo., Fremont,  Ca., and Bellingham, Wash.), in three different age groups, and  of middle-class and working-class socio-economic status. African  American and Caucasian signers are represented equally.  Sociolinguistic variation is variation that shows a correlation  between linguistic items (sounds, handshapes, words, grammatical  constructions) and social factors such as age, ethnicity, gender,  region, and socioeconomic class. Studies of sociolinguistic  variation are important because they inform our understanding of  the fundamental nature of language and of how languages change.  This project will focus on variation in a signed language and  hence will allow us to begin to see what kinds of variation  characterize all kinds of human languages and what kinds of  variation are modality-specific, i.e. characteristic exclusively  of spoken languages or signed languages. The focus will be on  target variables including 1-handshape signs, signs produced on  the side of the forehead, and variable pronouns. All of these  variables occur in large enough numbers to allow for the same  kind of statistical analyses that have been used for spoken  language variation. Lexical variation in the data will also be  analyzed. The result will be a comprehensive description of  sociolinguistic variation in ASL, along with a quantitative  analysis of specific variables. A corollary goal of the project  is the preparation of a videotape and manual about  sociolinguistic variation for use by the deaf community at large:  for children, teachers, parents, and community members.",
