 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern University of Indiana is the recipient of funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program to remodel research and research training space for the Departments of Biology and Chemistry.  This space is located in the USI Science Center, a facility that was constructed in 1969.  In the absence of an organized space utilization plan, laboratories were carved out of non-research space that resulted in the haphazard dispersal of research space throughout the building.  The present arrangement impairs research efficiency and inhibits productive communication between faculty and student research groups.  Usage of several laboratories for both teaching and investigative activities, severely limits the time research can be conducted and compromises security of experiments and equipment.   As an outdated facility, the Science Center suffers from gross inadequacies in heating ventilation, air conditioning, electricity, plumbing, and poor design.  These deficiencies impede on the types of experimental work that can be accomplished by research personnel.    Award funds will be used to upgrade the HVAC system, improve plumbing and electrical systems, and  reconfigure space to improve efficiency.  Fixed equipment consisting of fume hoods and casework will be installed. The overall project effect will strengthen biological and chemical research in the following areas:  behavioral ecology and environmental studies, microbiology, molecular biology, physiology, organic and inorganic chemistry, physical, and analytical chemistry.  Renovated facilities will significantly enhance the University's ability to prepare women for advanced degrees and careers in biology and chemistry since both departments have a high proportion of women students. Modernized laboratories will alleviate the need for students to conduct research at other sites during the summer,  and provide additional opportunities for students to participate in the research enterprise.",
