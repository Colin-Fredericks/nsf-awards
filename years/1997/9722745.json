 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT-9722745  Edwards    This Joint U.S.-Polish Workshop on \"Hot Topics in Quantum Optics\" will take place in Jaszowiec, Poland, from 17-24 June 1997 under the leadership of Dr. Mark Edwards of Georgia Southern University and Professor Kazimierz Rzazewski of the Institute for Theoretical Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences.  The workshop will consist of two days of informal discussions surrounding two days of formal presentations.  The conference atmosphere will be one in which both junior and senior American and Polish researchers will participate in lively discussions.  A new feature of this workshop will be a major focus on Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) of trapped, cold atoms, currently a \"hot\" topic in quantum optics.  BEC discussion topics might include: thermodynamic properties of BEC's; cold-atom scattering; the atom laser; finite temperature excitation and damping in BEC's; and recent experimental results in BEC.  Other topics (and possible sub-topics) include: interaction of atoms with strong fields (atomic ionization and stabilization; high order harmonics; half-cycle pulses); quantum chaos (microwave ionization; modes of microwave resonators; level statistics);  Rydberg atoms in time-dependent fields (far-infrared multiphoton ionization; electron capture by elliptic Rydberg atoms; state-sensitive detection of Rydberg atoms); and quantum control (wavepacket control; scattering from Stark wavepackets; bound-state interferometry).      This workshop should result in many new collaborative research efforts in quantum optics between U.S. and Polish researchers.  It fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.    ***  ??",
