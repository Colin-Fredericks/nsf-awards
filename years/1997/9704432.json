 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bayesian Time Series and Dynamic Models  Mike West    Abstract    This research involves development of new statistical models,   methods and computational algorithms for analysis and forecasting  of time series. The investigations will include various aspects  of Bayesian state-space modelling for time series, introducing  new models for non-stationary time series models, methodology for  structured latent process analysis and time series decompositions,  new models and computational methods for multiple time series  analysis including dynamic latent factor models, dynamic Bayesian  hierarchical models, and non-Gaussian and non-linear models.   Part of the research involves investigation of strategies for   dealing with high-dimensional time series data sets and issues of  time series data reduction and summary. Stochastic simulation   and computer algorithms are ingredients, and will lead to new   computational tools for simulation-based Bayesian analyses in  various problems of dynamic modelling and time series analysis.  Related areas of the research will include time series model  uncertainty, assessment and prior specifications, problems of  contamination structures and data cleaning, and models   involving statistical mixture structure.     These projects represent advances in time series modelling and  analysis, and contributions to other areas of statistical science,  that will be of broad interest and practical relevance to   scientists and researchers in various disciplines as well as   to statisticians.  The new statistical methods resulting from  this project extend the scope of applicability of current time   series analysis tools to more complex, non-linear and multivariate  problems. A significant component of the research involves  computationally intensive methods to fit and explore models to  data in applications. The research is motivated, in part, by  existing problems of statistical modelling and inference in  current application areas in several fields, specifically  inclu ding projects in the neurosciences, in geology driven by  issues of global environmental change, in financial modelling  and forecasting, and in biomedical engineering and signal  processing.",
