 "awd_abstract_narration": "The microbiology curriculum in the biology department needs to be updated to provide students with the background to assimilate into an increasingly scientific and technological society.  The two areas of microbiology that need the most improvement are microbial physiology and biotechnology.  A high-speed centrifuge, high-pressure liquid chromatography system and fermentation system are provided by this project to implement a course in microbial biotechnology and improve an existing course in bacterial metabolism.  The equipment is also used in existing biology core courses, microbiology and cell biology.  The goals of this project are to strengthen the microbiology laboratory curriculum, improve the students' learning experiences in this area, aid in the recruitment of undergraduates to these underrepresented areas in microbiology through more attractive courses, and promote undergraduate interest in these areas by presenting a more realistic laboratory environment.  The main learning objectives that can be accomplished through the purchase of this equipment are that students learn extensively about growth of bacteria from a basic as well as applied research approach and that students be exposed to and learn to operate some computer-based analytical equipment.",
