 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences   Directorate, Professor Tom Livinghouse, of the Department of Chemistry   and Biochemistry of Montana State University, is studying new ligands and   reaction pathways for metal-templated synthesis.  Professor Livinghouse   explores the photopromoted Pauson-Khand reaction, with particular   emphasis given to the elucidation of those factors which contribute to   ligand control of the relative and absolute stereochemical outcome of   ring formation.  He is also developing catalytic uses of cobalt complexes   for the stereocontrolled synthesis of methano PGI1 and megellaneone.    Synthesis of new C-chiral diphosphines containing conformational   restriction elements as well as an array of structurally differentiated   P-chiral diphosphines is followed by evaluation of these prospective   controller ligands in asymmetric bond forming reactions.  The design and   synthesis of a new class of enantiomerically pure C2-symmetric   bis(cyclopentadiene) controller ligands for early d-block metals is also   under investigation.  Many of the organic molecules demonstrated or expected to display   important physiological activity have the unique property of having   different chemical properties from their mirror images.  Although   compounds of this sort can not infrequently be obtained by separation   techniques, many such processes are inefficient in terms of time and   their reliance on the use of additional quantities of chemical reagents   and solvents.  As a result, development of methods for the control of the   three-dimensional structure (stereochemistry) of organic molecules   remains an important goal.  Professor Tom Livinghouse, of the Department   of Chemistry and Biochemistry of Montana State University, is developing   such methods with the support of the Organic Synthesis Program and the   Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical   Sciences Directorate.  His investigations focus on the design and   synthesis of new groups which introduce stereochemical control elements   into reactions mediated by various metal-containing compounds.  These   studies help to elucidate certain factors critical to the design of   successful catalysts for `asymmetric` synthesis and additionally offer   access to specific target molecules, including a potent inhibitor of   platelet aggregation in plasma.",
