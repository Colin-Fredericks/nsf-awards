 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  objective  of this research is to develop and experimentally  test  new methodologies for task scheduling, action planning  and  control   of   robotic  and  manufacturing  systems.    The   new  methodologies  will be a combination of heuristic and  analytical  approaches  and based on a direct algorithmic connection  between  simple  on-line  perception of not fully  predictable  geometric,  dynamic  and time events, and the desired actions of  robotic  or  manufacturing systems.  They will provide a robust  and  reliable  method for handling local geometric and dynamic uncertainties  as  well  as  coping  with  unexpected  events,  so  that  the  local  disturbances do not become global ones causing the need  for  re-  planning the operation.  This development  will help to eliminate  or   lessen  some  of  the  down-time  of  automated  robotic  or  manufacturing systems caused by inflexible scheduling,  planning,  sensing  and control methods.  It will also help to substantially  reduce  the  fixturing  or  set-up  requirements  of  robotic  or  manufacturing systems.  As an integral part of the research,  the  education  activities include developing a Robotics Collaboratory  Environment  (RCE)   which will provide a new instruction  method  and  laboratory environment for teaching robotics,  manufacturing  automation  and intelligent systems. As a result,  more  students  from  groups  that  have been traditionally  underrepresented  in  science  and  engineering can be involved, and more opportunities  for  undergraduate  students to incorporate  research  activities  into their course work will be provided.",
