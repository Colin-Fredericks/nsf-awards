 "awd_abstract_narration": "OPP 9615259  Klinkhammer    In the austral summer of 1995 a research team from Oregon State  University conducted a survey of hydrothermal activity in the  Bransfield Strait (cruise NBP9507).  The approach was to search  the water column for the types of anomalies in temperature,  turbidity, and chemistry that are known to be indicative of  hydrothermal plumes in mid-ocean ridge settings.  This work  produced a detailed picture of the hydrography of this area in  addition to locating three active hydrothermal areas in the  Central Basin.  These are the first deep ocean hydrothermal sites  ever discovered in a polar region.  A plume being discharged to  the Strait through the entrance to the sunken caldera at  Deception Island was also discovered.    Follow-up research on these discoveries is important for several  reasons:  (1)  Bransfield is isolated from the system of mid-ocean ridges  and has a relatively short history of rifting (approximately 4  my).  So, while the Bransfield straddles the Atlantic and  Pacific, vent biota in the Strait may well have a distinct  genealogy.  It will not be possible to sample biota until the  water analyses and data interpretation are completed.  (2)  Bransfield is a backarc rift system.  It is likely that the  vent fluids and mineral deposits associated with venting in this  setting are unlike anything sampled so far.  The closest analogy  is probably the Okinawa Trough or Lau Basin where native gold is  part of the hydrothermal assemblage.  (3)  Bransfield is in a sensitive position as far as world  climate and regional productivity.  Preliminary evidence suggests  that Deception Island is a significant source of hydrothermally  affected water to the surface waters of the Strait.  Consequently, it as important to quantify this flux and access  the biogeochemical impact of this phenomenon.  (4)  Bransfield is a rift zone which has little spreading or, if  spreading is occurring, it began in the recent past.  On the  other hand there is a definite tectonic fa bric that separates the  Strait into three distinct basins.  This situation allows an  opportunity to study the impact of tectonic processes on the  emplacement of hydrothermal circulation cells.    The success of the NBP9507 cruise has led to an enormous amount  of information on the water column in the Bransfield, both in  terms of the amount of data collected by instrument packages and  in the number of water samples that were taken for analysis.  Over 100 water samples from the Bransfield are available for  analysis for total dissolvable manganese.  This award supports  research to complete this analytical program and to analyze the  results.  These data will provide information about the nature of  hydrothermal activity in the Strait which will be invaluable in  understanding the role of hydrothermal waters in regional  oceanography and for planning future work.",
