 "awd_abstract_narration": "9626736  Zahalak  Striated muscle, whether found in the limb musculature or  muscular organs like the diaphragm and the heart, is composed of  thin elongated living cells called muscle fibers.  It has been  assumed, almost invariably, that such muscle functions as a  uniaxial force generator, producing forces and experiences length  changes in the direction of the fibers.  With rare exceptions,  experimental investigations of muscle mechanics have focused on  contractions and forces in the fiber directions, and all current  theories assume that when embedded in a mass of contractile  tissue muscle fibers behave exactly as measured in uniaxial  experiments.  But at least one class of experiments--those  involving osmotically-induced expansion and compression  transverse to the fibers--suggest that non-axial deformations of  contractile tissue can greatly reduce muscle force.  At present  there exists no method for estimating quantitatively the effects  of non-axial deformations, which occur often in normal  physiological function, on the active stresses generated by  striated muscle.    The goal of this research is to develop a quantitative theory of  non-axial deformation effects in muscle.  The proposed theory is  a generalization of the well established mathematical theory of  muscle contraction at the molecular level, first formulated by  the English biophysicist, A.F. Huxley.  Successful completion of  this work will have important implications at both the levels of  applied biomechanics and fundamental biophysics.  At the applied  level, an ability to predict quantitatively the effects of non-  axial deformations on active muscle stress will clearly identify  the circumstances when these effects are important and when they  am not, and lead to improved descriptions of muscle function in  studies of locomotion, motor control, cardiac mechanics,  respiratory mechanics, and related problems.  At the level of  basic biophysics, such a quantitative theory may suggest some non-  traditional exper iments--for example, those involving axial  shear, transverse shear, or torsion--that will provide now  information about the fundamental molecular mechanisms of muscle  contraction.  ***",
