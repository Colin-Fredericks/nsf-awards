 "awd_abstract_narration": "CMS 9616429  Olson    The twin earthquakes of September 19 and 20, 1985 that  devastated central zones of Mexico City remain one of the  great urban catastrophes of the late 20th century.  One of  the most significant characteristics of the disaster was the  breath, depth and duration of popular response, especially  the emergent organizations that focused on a variety of post-  earthquake problems.  This project analyzes the life cycle  of two sets of such organizations.  These include groups and  organizations that transformed in the years after the  earthquake and survive to this day, and those that also  emerged out of the earthquake and were active during the  emergency phase but disappeared at various points during  recovery and reconstruction.  Aside from being an  interesting phenomenon for researchers to study, such groups  represent an important resource during the time of disaster.  Thus a practical  implication of  developing an improved  understanding of the origin, nature and changes such  organizations undergo is that it will give emergency  management  practitioners in the U.S. and elsewhere insight  on how to more effectively incorporate them into their  disaster planning and subsequent emergency activities.  The  multiple data sources for this study will include  interviews, archival materials, and direct observation.",
