 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705439  Jiang    This  experimental  research  project  focuses  on  the  2-D  electron gas in the quantum Hall effect regime, specifically  on  the  phase  diagram  and  a  localization-delocalization  transition  as  afffected by disorder .   Gated  GaAs/AlGaAs  devices  will  be  used  to gain control  of  the  effective  disorder  of  the experimental system.  High magnetic  field  transport  experiments  will be carried  out  to  study  the  magnetic-field-induced   delocalization  transition  and  to  determine  the phase diagram in the disorder-magnetic  field  plane.   Edge-state tunneling spectroscopy will be  used  to  probe  microscopic properties and low-energy  excitation  of  various electronic phases.  %%%  This  experimental  research project  is  devoted  to  basic  properties of a conducting electron system when confined  in  a  two-dimensional planar region.  Such a  confined  set  of  electrons at low temperatures and with high magnetic  fields  exhibits a very unusual set of characteritics, which are  of  interest to theorists who wish to test and extend the  basic  thoery  of  electrons  in crystalline solids.   An  improved  theory then can be applied with more confidence to the  wide  range  of  metals and semiconductors which are of importance  in microelectronics and other technologies.  The experiments  in   this   project  are  focusing  on  a  \"metal-insulator\"  transiton which ahs been observed and in particular  on  how  it appears in connection with disorder in the environment of  the electrons.  On the one hand the experiments will provide  new  basic  information about electrons  when  they  are  in  interaction in confined layers at low temperatures.  On  the  other  hand  the device structures which are used  in  these  experiments   are   similar  to  those  used   in   advanced  microelectronic   devices  in  the  Gas  technology.    This  research  will involve students who will be well trained  in  the  area  of  physics  and will also gain  familarity  w ith  semiconductor device technology, nd who will be  excellently  trained   for   employment  in  industry,   government,   or  education.  ***",
