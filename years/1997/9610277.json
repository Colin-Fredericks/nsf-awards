 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of direct metal-catalyzed   amination reactions.  Goals of the present work include probing the   mechanism and  synthetic scope of Fe-catalyzed amination and the   development of enantioselective reactions via the use of chiral iron   complexes.  The general reactivity of Fe-, Ru- and Al-azodioxide   complexes will be explored and selected metal-imido complexes, L2M(=NR)2   (M=Cr,Mo,W) will be evaluated as potential amination agents and   catalysts.  Investigation of novel metal-promoted allylic aminations   using nitroalkanes as aminating agents will also be carried out. With   this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of   Dr. Kenneth M. Nicholas of the Department of Chemistry at the University   of Oklahoma.  Professor Nicholas will focus his work on developing new   methods for the direct introduction of nitrogen-based functional groups   into unsaturated carbon containing compounds.   Nitrogen containing   compounds form the building blocks for the preparation of numerous   pharmaceuticals ,  cationic surfactants and even fabric softeners",
