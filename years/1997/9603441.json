 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this collaboration between the PI and Bernhard Steffan of the University of   Passau is to study issues related to modeling and verification of distributed systems.  Two   specific threads of research will be pursued.  The first involves the incorporation of   notions of action priority into the semantic foundations of concurrency and an exploration   of its practical impact on reasoning about system designs.  The second is devoted to the   design and implementation of an open tool architecture that will facilitate the development   of new and improved verification tools.  The results of this research will be new and useful   extensions to system design methods and a framework for improved tool support for   system designers.",
