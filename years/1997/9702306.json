 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research investigates optimization methods for constructing  higher-order learning machines to solve very large classification  problems  such  as  those  found in  data  mining  and  character  recognition.    In  higher-order  learning  machines,  the  input  vectors  are  mapped nonlinearly into a higher-dimensional  space  and  then  a  linear discriminant is constructed in  the  higher-  dimensional space. The resulting discriminant function may  be  a  polynomial, neural  network, radial basis function classifier, or  decision  tree.    Vapnik's Statistical Learning Theory  is  used  within  the  problem formulation to avoid over-fitting  or  over-  parameterizing  the   discriminant  function.    To   solve   the  resulting  minimization problem, innovative optimization  methods  are  developed.    This work will have both  an  educational  and  research  impact.   The optimization methods  for  classification  problems will also be used within computer-based course materials  for  teaching concepts of mathematical programming and as a basis  for  research  projects for undergraduates.  The research  impact  will   be   the   development  of   novel,  fast,  and   accurate  classification  methods  based on  statistical  learning  theory.  These   methods   will  be  applied  to   very  large   practical  applications  in a diverse set of fields, for example:  character  recognition  in  engineering,   cancer  diagnosis   in  medicine,  database  marketing  in  business,  and  prediction  of  mortgage  prepayment in finance.",
