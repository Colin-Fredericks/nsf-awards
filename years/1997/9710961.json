 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Maya Hieroglyphic Database Project:  The  Codices is to continue the task of putting the entire corpus  of Maya texts from Mexico and Central America into a  graphics database for the purpose of increasing access to  it.  The hieroglyphic texts on monumental sculpture from the  Classic Period (A.D. 250-900) were the first to be included.   Nearly every large site, and most of the smaller ones will  have been coded by June 1997.             During the proposed phase the hieroglyphic texts of the  four Maya codices dating from the Postclassic Period (A.D.  1100-1600) will be added to the database.  These books  constitute a major part of the hieroglyphic corpus, and were  the source of many early decipherments.  Line drawings will  be scanned and divided into individual glyph blocks and  larger segments of texts (usually four glyphs blocks with  accompanying figure).  They will be incorporated into the  existing format used for the monumental inscriptions in  order to allow for full integration with them.  Each record   will be coded for graphemic, lexical, grammatical,  syntactic, and temporal information.            Not only will this increase overall access, but it will  contribute to ongoing research into possible language or  dialect differences between various sections of the codices.   Yucatecan and Cholan languages, the modern language families  believed to be closest to the language(s) of the Classic  Maya are frequently put forward as the language of the  codices, but precise dialect differences have yet to be  defined.  Phonological, lexical, and syntactic variation  will be addressed in this research.            The hieroglyphic database including the low resolution  line drawings of glyph blocks and clauses will allow access  to these texts never before  realized.  It will also bring the most current  transcriptions and translations of the texts directly to the  non-epigrapher, who may then utilize the historical,  archaeological, and linguistic information they contai n.  It  will provide epigraphers with the ability to make truly  comprehensive searches and comparisons.  This database will  be available on a single CD-ROM (for both PC and Macintosh  systems).  By fall of 1998, we expect to have portions of  the database will be available on the World Wide Web.  The  site currently contains a summary of the project and will be  periodically updated:  http://cougar.ucdavis.edu/nas/MAYA/home.html",
