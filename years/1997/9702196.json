 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due primarily to the complex interaction of metal cutting which combines high strain rate deformations with friction, there still exists no adequate model of metal cutting.  In this Career proposal, an innovative finite element model will be introduced to investigate, under a diverse range of operating conditions, the following: (1) three-dimensional explicit dynamic effects, (2) velocity-temperature dependent friction, (3) cutting tool coating, and (4) cutting tool chip-groove geometry.  The results obtained from the finite element simulations will provide innovative knowledge in several areas which are vital for obtaining high quality and productivity in machining.  Experiments will be performed to validate the model.  The education strategy will incorporate moderate changes in teaching approach and introduce the following:  (1) the development of an engineering software course, (2) the incorporation of numerical solution techniques into several core mechanical engineering courses, and (3) the utilization of computer based solution techniques in a capstone team design project.   The success of metal cutting and other machining processes requires a complete knowledge of the tribological behavior involved.  Substantially new and usable information can be gained from this study about the influence of coating thickness and materials on machining performance.  Finite element results on grooved cutting tools will provide guidance for obtaining desired chip-breaker characteristics.  The education plan will better prepare engineers that are team oriented, with computer based problem solving skills which are adaptable over time.",
