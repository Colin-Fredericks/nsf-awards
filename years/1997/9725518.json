This school system has been the site of systemic change efforts over the entire period in which this information was collected.  Sources of data included interviews; classroom observations; teachers' responses to surveys on their beliefs, attitudes, and content and pedagogical knowledge; teachers' written reflections; and field notes on all professional development activities.  Both quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze this data will be developed.  The project will advance knowledge about the evolution of teachers' beliefs, knowledge, and practices while engaged in a process of systemic reform and will cast light on how various professional development activities influence that evolution.",
