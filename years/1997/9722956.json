 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722956  Jones     The goals of this project are to characterize the  cellular events that accompany programmed cell death (PCD)  in the barley aleurone cell. PCD in aleurone cells is  controlled by the hormones gibberellic acid (GA) and  abscisic acid (ABA). GA induces PCD in barley aleurone and  ABA prevents cell death. Experiments are proposed to  characterize DNA breakdown, to ask how DNA is degraded, and  to identify the enzymes that are involved in this process.  Apoptosis in animal cells is accompanied by intranucleosomal  cleavage of nuclear DNA resulting in the formation of  characteristic DNA ladders. Previously published work by  others has suggested that DNA laddering is a feature of PCD  in the barley aleurone cell.  Preliminary data from the  Principal Investigator's laboratory show that whereas PCD is  accompanied by DNA breakdown in GA-treated aleurone cells,  formation of DNA ladders does not occur.  A detailed study  is planned of DNA degradation from barley aleurone layers  and protoplasts treated with hormones that regulate PCD to  characterize the mechanism of DNA breakdown.  The nucleases  in aleurone cells will be characterized to determine whether  these enzymes only possess exonuclease activity, which would  account for the absence of DNA laddering in the aleurone  cell. Experiments will also be carried out to determine when  DNA breakdown occurs in aleurone cells. The Principal  Investigator has established that DNA breakdown occurs after  GA but not following ABA treatment.  Is DNA degraded in  living cells or does DNA degradation only occur after PCD?  Is the absence of DNA degradation in ABA treated cells a  result of the low levels of nuclease activity in these  cells, or is DNA modified to be less rapidly degraded in ABA  treated cells?  Fluorescent dyes that stain DNA in living  aleurone cells will be used to monitor DNA degradation and  to correlate changes in DNA with PCD.  If DNA breakdown  occurs after aleurone cells die, dead cells will be purified  from prot oplasts to monitor how the DNA is degraded.      In the barley seed, there is a starch-rich tissue called the  endosperm, which serves as a reservoir for nourishment of  the developing plant embryo inside the seed.  The aleurone  layer is a cellular tissue surrounding the endosperm, which  produces and secretes hydrolytic enzymes that digest the  starchy endosperm into monosaccharides that are can be used  directly as food by the developing embryo.  The aleurone can  thus be thought of as the digestive organ of the developing  embryo within the germinating seed.  When the aleurone has  finished producing the enzymes, it has no further purpose  and the cells of the tissue undergo a programmed cell death.  The developmentally regulated life and death of the cells of  the aleurone are under the control of two major plant  hormones, gibberellic acid and abscisic acid. The results of  this work will provide valuable insights into the process of  developmentally regulated PCD in plants and the roles that  hormones play in regulating this process.  ***",
