 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to enhance mechanical engineering education by incorporating experiments in photoelastic stress analysis within the existing curriculum.  Photoelasticity is a visual, full-field technique for determining stresses in parts and structures.  In addition to its traditional use in industry, there is a renewed interest in using photoelasticity to test objects made by stereolithography.    All mechanical (and to a lesser degree civil) engineering students can benefit from this project.  Six new experiments are introduced in four courses: Mechanics of Materials, Machine Design, Instrumentation and Experimental Methods, and the Finite Element Method.  Specific instructional objectives are to increase conceptual understanding of stress distribution through photoelastic visualization; gain experience with photoelasticity and its advantages/limitations; and appreciate the synergism between experimental and numerical methods of stress analysis.    For the planned experiments, one transmission polariscope set, one reflection polariscope set, accompanying accessories, and a video capture device are needed.  The equipment can also be used for in-class demonstrations, testing of senior design projects, and motivational presentations to K 12 students.  Institutional support exists but is insufficient for the acquisition of these precision optical instruments.    Overall, students experience that, in solving engineering problems, one has to choose the appropriate tool of analysis and recognize that quite often several tools must be utilized to validate the results, e.g., validation of numerical solutions by experimental means.",
