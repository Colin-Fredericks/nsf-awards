 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602978  Potter    This U.S.-Brazil Program award will support collaborative  research involving Dr. Joseph E. Potter of the University of  Texas at Austin, Dr. Charles H. Wood of the University of  Florida, and Dr. Alicia Bercovich, of the Instituto  Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE) in activities  designed to incorporate new methods and statistical  techniques, particularly the application of geographic  information systems (GIS) and econometric software, into the  study of demographic and environmental processes in Brazil.    This grant will allow these researchers to train in and  fully develop the GIS and econometric techniques to analyze  three aspects of Brazilian demography and population and  environment relations:  levels and trends in fertility and  their correlation with access to mass media and other social  and economic determinants of fertility; deforestation in the  Amazon basin and its relation to demographic change, and the  relation between land tenure security and resource use in  the Amazon basin.  By enhancing the ability to combine GIS  and spatial econometrics, this collaboration has the  potential to promote cutting-edge of socio-demographic  research in both the U.S. and Brazil.  It will also  facilitate the execution of the two institutions' agendas  and advance research on demographic and environmental  processes.      ***",
