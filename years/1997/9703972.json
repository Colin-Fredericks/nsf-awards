 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses two main challenges. The first is to produce a software development environment   for easily generating indexing techniques for new complex data, e.g., maps, images, sound, video,   sequences, documents, etc., with large database workloads. This is being done by (1) implementing a data   structure called a Generalized Search Tree (GiST) in the context of an Object-Relational database   management system, and (2) developing a graphical GiST visualization and debugging system. The   second challenge is to undertake a rigorous mathematical investigation of how and when one can develop   efficient indexes; this is referred to as a Theory of Indexability. Indexability theory is akin to complexity   theory, which has guided software developers in understanding how and when one can develop efficient   algorithms. The main distinction is that indexability focuses on space/time tradeoffs for indexes, and on   the fundamental secondary-storage challenges involved in database indexing. Execution of this research   agenda will produce a framework in which data domain experts (e.g., biologists, chemists, earth scientists,   computer multimedia researchers, etc.) can (1) identify whether their workloads are indexable, and (2) if   so, easily develop efficient indexes for their workloads, integrating these indexes with minimal effort into   Object-Relational database management systems. An additional effort is to integrate the development   environment into a curriculum for teaching both basic and advanced techniques in indexing and   indexability. This curriculum includes the software itself, along with assignments being tested in   undergraduate and graduate courses at Berkeley taught by the principal investigator.",
