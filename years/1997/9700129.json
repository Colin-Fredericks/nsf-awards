 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Physics-Based Geometric Modeling and Design System      This grant provides funding for the research and development of a novel interactive design environment that integrates traditional design principles with advanced physics-based design techniques. The objective of this research is to explore and develop flexible, efficient design tools in order for designers to improve the efficiency of interactive design during the entire computer-aided design and manufacturing process. This research takes the following three-fold approach to achieve its goal: (1) Address numerical and  algorithmic problems inherent to the physics-based modeling and design approach in a systematic way; (2) Devise a set of new force-based design toolkits and investigate the effective integration of physics-based design with existing geometric design techniques and approaches; and (3) Integrate all the theoretical advances gained during the first two stages of this project and further develop an experimental physics-based design environment with real-time interactive capability based on commercial modeling and design systems.      If successful, the results of this research will enable designers to either utilize standard geometric design techniques for conventional design or apply various physics-based force sculpting tools for direct manipulation of geometric primitives in an integrated design environment. Thus, these research advances could help to improve product quality, reduce product cost, and increase the effectiveness of design engineers. Furthermore, this project seeks to promote the rapid dissemination of physics-based design techniques and the accompanying experimental design system to the US design and manufacturing industry in order to realize the full potential of all the research results. Ultimately, this project could advance the state of the art of computer-integrated engineering and make significant contributions to geometric and solid modeling, graphics, visualization, robotics, computational vision, and virtual environments.",
