 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), in cooperation with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), will hold a two-day national conference to promote progress in understanding and implementing outcomes assessment for accreditation in engineering education.  The meeting, which will take place September 19-20, 1997, in Washington, D.C., will bring together representatives of higher education institutions, industry, government, professional associations and accrediting agencies to accomplish six things:  increase understanding of national trends in higher education assessment;                                                                                      examine progress in assessment in other disciplines such as dentistry and mathematics to understand what may be relevant to engineering;    review assessment practices in industry that may be relevant to educational assessment;    increase understanding of the goals of outcomes assessment in accreditation;    promote dissemination and sharing of best assessment practices; and     lay the groundwork for a continuing forum on outcomes assessment in engineering education.    ASEE requests $49,500.00 from the National Science Foundation to enable this review of progress in engineering education assessment that will also provide information on a variety of assessment strategies to a broad engineering education audience.  NSF funding for this conference will provide for set-up costs, travel costs of the speakers, dissemination of prepared papers and materials, and a summary report and proceedings.",
