 "awd_abstract_narration": "P. I.:  Merle Froschl    This project is building on and expanding Playtime is Science, EEC's early childhood, hands-on, parent/child science activity program, providing a major focus on the needs and capabilities of children with disabilities.  Playtime is Science has been piloted in schools and community-based settings at four national sites with funding from the NSF, the Toyota USA Foundation, and the Dewitt Wallace-Readers Digest Fund.  During this national pilot, Playtime is Science was found to be effective for children with disabilities.  The sample, however, was small and further development is needed to adapt the program successfully in a variety of settings, to test the activities with children with a wider range of disabilities, and to create disability awareness training to address attitudinal barriers.      The goals of Playtime is Science for Children with Disabilities are (1) to increase the ability of teachers, staff and parents to motivate and empower children with disabilities in grades Pre-K through the third grade to develop their science skills in a supportive environment; (2) to help children with disabilities build on their strengths and develop confidence and skill in science which will persist beyond school, and will inform later career options; and (3) to provide opportunities for parents of these students to become involved in their children's early science learning and to convey positive messages and expectations to their children about science.    Specific objectives are: (1) to pilot test and adapt the activities in inclusive and special education settings; (2) to build science skills based on the problem-solving abilities already developed by many children with disabilities; (3) to conduce training in program facilitation for teacher, staff and parents; (4) to develop, field test, and publish a Facilitator's Guide which will enable Playtime is Science for Children with Disabilities to be used in schools and after-school programs throughout the country; (5) to in stitutionalize the program in participating sites; (6) to disseminate project results and materials through training, conferences, networks, and publications; and (6) to conduct ongoing evaluation.    EEC will work with teachers, staff, parents and children in three different types of setting in New York City:  (1) four early elementary public school classrooms inclusive of children with and without disabilities; (2) three early childhood programs, including an inclusive Head Start center, a special education program serving children with a range of disabilities, and a child development center serving pre-school children with visual impairments; and (3) a large, inclusive after-school program.    By fostering positive science experiences, and by increasing parent and staff expertise in enthusiasm for and encouragement of science activities, this project will enable children with disabilities to gain confidence and skills which will help them succeed in science.  By acknowledging and building upon the individual strengths of children with disabilities, it will create an inclusive environment that says \"science is for everyone\".",
