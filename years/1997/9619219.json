 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619219  The goal of the project is to advance the state of the art in  static analysis of programs that perform destructive updating on  heap-allocated storage. The work will address problems that can  be looked at --- depending on one's point of view --- as pointer-  analysis problems, alias-analysis problems, sharing-analysis  problems, storage-analysis problems (also known as shape-analysis  problems), or type-checking problems. The information obtained is  useful for generating efficient sequential and parallel code.  It  is also useful in certain kinds of software-engineering tools.  The project aims to make contributions in the following areas:  (1) Develop further the theoretical foundations of shape  abstractions and their use in abstract interpretation. (2)  Develop a tool for creating a shape-analysis algorithm from a  specification of a shape abstraction. (3) Extend the range of  applications for shape-analysis techniques, for example, by (i)  generalizing them so that questions can be answered of the form  \"Can accesses through the structure that x points to at program  point p ever reach any of the elements of the structure that y  points to at program point q?\", and (ii) combining shape-analysis  with array-subscript analysis. (4) Create, experiment with, and  evaluate shape-analysis implementations.  ***",
