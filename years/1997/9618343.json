A set of hypotheses are posed which suggests the geographic impacts of sweeping policy reforms.  These acknowledge the disengagement of the nation-state from investment location decisions and regulations, and at the same time the greater independence of and competition between sub-national states.  A novel hypothesis will examine the internal restructuring of the metropolis to accommodate new growth impulses.  The hypotheses will be tested using spatially and sectorally disaggregated data on investment from the pre-reform and post-reform periods.  Three spatial scales will be used: interstate with nationwide coverage, intra-state for the seven leading urban-industrial states and intra-metropolis for the leading agglomerations.  The data will be analyzed using a variety of spatial techniques.  These include exploratory spatial data analysis, clustering techniques and the use of mixed regressive-spatial autoregressive models.  The research has important theoretical and policy implications in regards to the impact of liberalization efforts throughout the Third World.",
