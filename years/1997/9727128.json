 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727128  Homer Walker   Large-scale systems of linear and nonlinear equations occur almost   ubiquitously in the computational modeling of physical phenomena through   the discretization of partial differential equations, integral equations,   etc. Krylov subspace methods make up a large class of iterative linear   algebra methods that have been widely used for these large-scale linear   systems. These methods have been adapted to large-scale nonlinear systems   through Newton-Krylov implementations, in which they are used to solve   the linear systems that characterize Newton steps. This research is a   continuation of an ongoing program aimed at developing more robust and   efficient Newton-Krylov methods for nonlinear problems and, concomitantly,   more effective Krylov subspace methods for linear problems. The current   research focusses primarily on Newton-Krylov methods and related methods   for large-scale nonlinear problems. Specific objectives are to develop   more robust globalizations, to implement and test additional and more   effective Krylov solvers, to improve preconditioning strategies and options,   and to explore new techniques such as automatic differentiation. A major   extension of the previous program goals is to develop effective methods   for large-scale continuation problems. The approach is based on certain   ways of adapting Krylov subspace methods and Newton-Krylov methodology   to the continuation setting that allow the use of existing preconditioners   and other previously developed problem technology.   A particular aim of this work is to develop improved methods for large-scale   computational modeling of complex physical phenomena on high performance   computers. Particular target applications include full-physics modeling of   reactive flows (combustion and other chemically reacting flows) and related   problems in computational fluid dynamics. Success in these applications   will have great potential benefits in the design and operation of industrial   facilit ies such as furnaces for heat and power generation and chemical vapor   deposition reactors for semiconductor manufacturing. This work will build   on previously established collaborative activities with researchers at Sandia   National Laboratories, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and the   University of Utah Center for High Performance Computing, in which the   methods under development have been successfully applied to a number of   realistic flow problems involving heat and mass transport on massively   parallel computers. Likely future collaborations are with researchers at   the University of Utah on modeling accidental fires and explosions and at   Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on modeling contaminant transport in   aquifers, with applications to environmental management and bioremediation.",
