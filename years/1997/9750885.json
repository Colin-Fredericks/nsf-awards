 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of computer networks is very broad and is growing larger each day.  Typical undergraduate courses in the field only address basic principles and do not have the scope to cover internetworking, security, client server computing, and high speed networks. The first course gives little or no experience working with a real network and does not prepare students for jobs in networking, even though there is a growing demand for network administration.  This project is developing a second course in networking from the point of view of a system administrator, and addresses the deficiencies of the first course in preparing students both for careers and graduate work.  Students are working with the network equipment found in many corporations today and discussing in class the theory behind this equipment.  Students are performing some tasks done by system administrators today and working on experiments to help prepare them for the near future.  *",
