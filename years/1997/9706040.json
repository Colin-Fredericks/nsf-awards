 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706040  McRoberts    I propose a species-level analysis of Triassic bivalve mollusc faunas of western North America to document spatio-temporal changes in taxonomic and ecologic diversity and to test hypotheses regarding the structure and causal factors leading to the Early Mesozoic bivalve radiation.  Specifically, I aim to assemble a multidimensional database of bivalve mollusc species based on literature, museum, and field collections.  Each species occurrence will be assigned to various temporal, taphonomic, environmental, ecological, and geographical classes based on it's guild membership, facies occurrence, location, and age.  Construction of a literature-based database is underway, yet needs strengthening by assessing species variability in large samples available in museum collections coupled with additional material associated with paleoenvironmental and taphonomic data which can best be collected in the field.  I am proposing museum visits to important repositories of Triassic bivalve collections (US Geological Survey, Geological Survey of Canada, National Museum of Natural History, American Museum of Natural History, and the University of Montana) and field investigations at several key sites in the western United States and Canada (Nevada, Idaho, and northeastern British Columbia) where bivalves occur abundantly in nearly continuous sequences.    The proposed project will build upon a foundation of prior research on the Early Mesozoic bivalve expansion, and will specifically address the questions: (1) is there a latitudinal gradient in North American bivalve faunas through all or part of the interval, and if so, to what degree are originations, extinctions, and ecologic structure of the faunas controlled by latitude? (2) is there a onshore-offshore trend in extinctions and originations among all bivalve groups with different autecology or is the pattern restricted to just a few clades with similar living habits?  And (3) to what degree has differing bivalve ecology played a role in  origination and extinction metrics and is there evidence for selective speciation or selective survivorship?  Resolving these issues bear significant implications not only for the early Mesozoic faunal expansion, but in determining the processes of diversification and extinction that can be applied to other time periods.",
