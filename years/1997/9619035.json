University of Houston  Title: Patterns of Climate Change in the Central and Eastern  Sectors of the South Pacific    Isotopic and chemical tracers within coral aragonite can accurately  record seasonal and interannual changes in environmental parameters  such as sea surface temperature (SST), salinity, rainfall, nutrient  availability, and river input.  Corals provide the only means to  accurately reconstruct tropical ocean surface conditions at high  temporal resolution.  Analysis of satellite-derived monthly sea  surface temperatures show that large scale oceanographic events,  such as ENSO, register a significant signal in the central and  eastern South Pacific region and indicate that corals from the Cook  Islands and Easter Islands may be suitable for reconstructing  long-term climate records to: 1) relate interannual climate  variability over a large global scale, 2) identify the frequency  and magnitude of pre-historic ENSO events and, 3) evaluate  potential evidence of anthropogenic influence with respect to  observed recent warming of the troposphere.  This SGER award  supports a project to collect several multi-century long cores from  massive coral colonies at Cooks and Easter Islands.  Initial stable  isotope analyses will be conducted at subannual resolution on the  upper (recent) portion to of the core.  By comparing these results  with instrumental SST data we can accurately assess the potential  for developing long climatic time-series reconstructions from these  regions.",
