 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700852  Ellis   This research will focus on two broad areas: (1) a weak convergence approach to   the theory of large deviations and (2) large deviations for jump Markov processes and   applications to queueing networks. In area (1) the research is based in part on a new book   written jointly with Paul Dupuis. It consists of the following: (a) deriving representation   formulas for new classes of processes, including jump Markov processes; (b) proving the   Laplace principle for diffusions and other processes having discontinuous statistics with   various geometries; (c) proving the Laplace principle for a random walk model with state-  dependent noise; (d) proving the Laplace principle for empirical measures of Markov   chains and related processes, including measure-valued processes with state dependencies;   (e) generalizing a new formula on the Legendre-Fenchel transform of compositions of   convex functions.  Research in area (2) consists of the following: (a) using a new   representation formula for large deviation probabilities together with weak convergence   methods to obtain an explicit formula for the rate function for a number of queueing   models of interest; (b) extending a recent paper on the large deviation analysis of general   queueing systems to other queueing models, including state-dependent queues; (c)   evaluating the exact large deviation rates and determining the overflow paths   corresponding to certain overflow events in a number of queueing networks.   This research program in large deviations is motivated by applications to queueing   networks, which are of fundamental importance in communication and high performance   computing.  The work of the Principal Investigator over the past few years, which   culminated in a number of important papers and a research-level book, develops a set of   new and powerful techniques for studying the behavior of such networks. For example, a   critical problem in the design of high speed networking technologies is to size the buffe rs   at communications switches within these networks so that certain overflow probabilities   are suitably small. Another critical problem in the design of very large multiprocessor   systems is to estimate the probability that the system will fail in some time interval. This   research will be adapted to studying these and related problems.",
