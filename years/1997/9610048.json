 "awd_abstract_narration": "In NSF-funded work leading up to this project, separate theoretical models for subsystems of human memory have been integrated into a unified model for memory loss, distortion, and recovery.  The unified model assumes that memories for objects and events are stored as arrays of properties.  A further assumption is that following storage, a basic, automatic, and apparently immutable process leads to degradation of the property information, and therefore to decreased accessibility of the memories. This process produces spontaneous recovery of memories on some occasions, often in distorted form.  Research planned for the project is intended to yield new methods of measuring these changes in memory, and to identify procedures that can alleviate memory loss and reduce distortions of recall and recognition.   Some planned experiments will simulate situations involving eyewitness testimony, such as accidents or crimes.  The aim is to study how recall and recognition are influenced by factors such as witnesses' prior familiarity with objects or people present in the scene. Other experiments will seek an explanation for the well-documented ability of people to recognize hundreds of naturalistic scenes viewed within a very limited time period.   An offshoot of the main effort will focus on the role of memory in decision making. The general memory model yields predictions about how decisions depend on internal referents or standards derived from long-term memories. The predictions will be tested in situations contrived to simulate decision making of the kind that occurs in gambling, selection of insurance options or investments, and choices among alternative goals.",
