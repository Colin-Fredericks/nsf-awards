 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to adapt  embedding methods for modeling nonlinear time-series  developed by the academic community for their routine use in  engineering problems.  The specific methods to be employed  are based of those developed to model chaotic nonlinear  systems.  These methods will be adapted so that they can  handle nonlinear systems describing input/output data from  industrial devices under test.  Specifically, current  modeling methods developed for automonous systems will be  extended to handle systems driven by mixed signals.  Input/output systems are fundamental to engineering and  industrial applications.  Currently, the majority of  input/output modeling techniques are designed for linear  systems and provide the basis for a wide range of test  equipment (spectrum, signal, and network analyzers) and an  engineering methodology at the heart of our modern  technology based society.  However, industrial systems and  devices typically exhibit nonlinear behavior when stressed,  and industry has a continual need for methods that work when  devices are pushed beyond their original design envelope.  Therefore, the proposed research will address the generic  industrial needs for improved modeling and diagnostics of  nonlinear devices based on the latest research from  nonlinear dynamics, dynamical systems theory, and nonlinear  time-series analysis.",
