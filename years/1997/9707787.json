 "awd_abstract_narration": "McPeek  9707787    Almost all organisms must find enough food for themselves  while trying not to become food for another organism. These  are also often conflicting objectives; the properties that  make an organism better at finding food often makes it worse  at avoiding predators. Although this tradeoff in abilities  is commonly observed in many taxa, the underlying phenotypic  architecture that generates this fundamental trade-off is  poorly understood. In this proposal the PI will describe  research to explore the properties of organisms generating  such a trade-off between growth and predator avoidance in  larval damselflies (Insecta), and to reconstruct how these  properties have evolved as this taxon has shifted between  habitats with different predators and different resource  availabilities. The PI will conduct studies of four  different organismal properties to explore the underlying  causes of this trade-off, including differences in (1)  movement and activity, (2) burst swimming ability and  anaerobic physiological capacities, (3) digestive  efficiency, and (4) aerobic metabolic capacity. Analyses  will test hypotheses about the functional couplings among  characters and the evolution of these functional couplings.  Examining how these functional couplings have evolved  provides valuable insights into the constraints affecting  taxa as they adapt to natural and anthropogenically-induced  environmental change (e.g., natural habitat shifts, climate  change, habitat degradation).",
