 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618442  Dick  This award will support a marine geological and geophysical study  of exposed lower ocean crust in the southwest Indian Ocean. Exposed  crustal rocks on shallow uplifted seafloor were discovered in this  region during Ocean Drilling Program operations. ODP site 735B  sampled a 400 meter vertical section of gabbros in this area  providing a detailed record of crustal formation processes. To date  , however, it has been difficult to place these results into a  local context since no data are available on surrounding seafloor  geology. The present project will rectify this situation by  undertaking detailed near bottom observations and sampling.  Canadian scientists will provide the ROV ROPOS as primary survey  vehicle, and rock drill would be modified for deployment on ROPOS  to allow direct sampling of observed rocks.The primary objective is  to provide detailed near bottom examination and sampling of  seafloor to tie existing ODP data to local environment and to  provide detailed site survey for drilling to be proposed which  would sample at sites surrounding existing hole. Additional work  would include newly developed British rock drill to provide deeper  sampling than could be done from ROPOS vehicle. Samples and data  would be used to identify crustal formation process at this unique  exposure of lower crustal rocks.  ***",
