 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603043  Yuh    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Professor Junku Yuh of the University of  Hawaii in Manoa and Professor Tamaki Ura of the University  of Tokyo in Japan.  This project undertakes a study of a  virtual collaborative world simulator for underwater robots  using a multi-dimensional, synthetic environment.  The major  objective is to develop a virtual 3-dimensional, hybrid  environment platform with a high-level control and  information architecture.  The major goals of the project  are to  l) enable remote sharing of underwater robotic  resources;  2) enhance the remote monitoring and control of  the robots from globally remote locations; and  3) enhance  and stimulate the development of other areas such as  underwater communication, sonar and acoustic sensors and  underwater visualization.  Successful planning of the robot  operation requires integrated simulation of the actual robot  with environmental data and operating conditions.    The project brings together the efforts of two laboratories  working on different aspects of autonomous under water  vechicles:  the American's have experience in developing a  virtual reality platform and an underwater vehicle and the  Japanese have developed the graphic platform, underwater  vehicles and shallow water testing.  Research and  development of underwater robotic systems will be a low-cost  key to better understanding marine and other environmental  issues; to protect the earth's resources from pollution; and  to efficiently utilize the vehicles for human welfare.  The  data gathered from the research project will provide  information on the performance, effectiveness,  interactiveness, and safety of an underwater vehicle and its  environment.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology,  this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and  promote international understanding and cooperation.  ***",
