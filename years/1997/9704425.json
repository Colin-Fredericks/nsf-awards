David Higdon  Duke University              Abstract:  This research develops anisotropic spatial  models for fully Bayesian inference with applications   to data which are correlated over space and time.  Two   distinct directions are taken.  First, in continuation of   previous research, Markov random field priors for lattices   are considered for modeling processes with occasional large   shifts in level.  Second, using a constructive convolution   approach, continuous models are developed that allow   non-stationarity and correlation structure that can vary over   space (and/or time).  Using such models for inference requires   that one account for uncertainty about just how flexible or  varying such models are.  A key part of the research is  developing methods which incorporate this source of uncertainty  in the statistical analysis.    Statistical modeling of phenomena that evolve over space and  possibly time is critical in areas such as medical imaging,  environmental monitoring, and detecting changes over time in  global climate.  Most spatial models in statistics assume that  over a given area, the underlying properties of a spatial (and  possibly temporal as well) pattern remain unchanged over the  region.  Though this is a useful simplification over limited  regions, on a larger scale such an assumption often results   in an unsatisfactory model.  This research will develop  statistical models that account for abrupt changes in the  nature of the spatial phenomenon.  Also, models will be   developed that allow properties of the spatial process to  evolve over spatial location.  This research will lead to  more realistic models for large scale spatial and spatio-temporal   phenomena.  Fitting these models to large datasets will require a   substantial computing effort and will likely rely high performance   computing resources.  Applications in global ocean climate change,   agriculture,  genetics, and medical imaging will be considered.",
