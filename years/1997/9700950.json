 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rogawski  9700950    This award funds the research of Professor Rogawski, who is interested in developing the relative trace formula for a pair (G,H) consisting of a quasi-split reductive group G and subgroup H, the fixed-point set  of an involution.  The PI intends to investigate problems connected with the contribution of the continuous spectrum to the relative trace formula.  The first goal of this project is  the study of period integrals  of truncated Eisenstein series over  H . The PI intends to develop a  theory of such integrals, and in particular, explicit formulas  extending his current work with  Jacquet on  GL(n).  The second goal is to evaluate the contribution of the spectral kernel to the relative trace formula for G.  These integrals will be evaluated using truncation, the explicit formulas, and a suitable theory of  (G,M) -families.  These results will be applied as one ingredient  in the comparison of the relative trace formula with the Kuznetzov trace formula in certain cases.    This proposal is in the part of mathematics known as the Langlands program.  This program represents a fusion of Number Theory and Representation Theory , and it has been a stimulus to a great deal of recent research in both fields. Number Theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics and is concerned with the most basic of mathematical objects, the ordinary whole numbers.  However, it turns out that in order to express many of the patterns and relations discovered by mathematicians, it is necessary to use some of the most advanced and technical theories of twentieth century mathematics.  On the other hand, the problems of number theory have provided a powerful stimulus to research in other  diverse parts of the discipline.  The Langland's program provides a framework for investigating and vastly generalizing the so-called reciprocity laws of number theory using the tools of infinite-dimensional representation theory.  Although very technical and deep, this program  has found astonishing applica tions in areas like theoretical computer science (construction of expanding graphs) and coding theory (finding optimal Goppa codes).  It has also played an indispensable role in some of the recent spectacular developments in number theory itself, such as the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.",
