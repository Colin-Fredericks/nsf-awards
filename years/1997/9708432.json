 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Workshop on Physical Organic Chemistry, an annual conference for the   discussion of topics that span bioorganic chemistry to gas-phase   reactions, will be convened for the next three years.  Although the range   of topics is wide, all focus on the methodology used by physical organic   chemists.  Attendance will be limited to about twenty persons, all of   whom present informal talks on new, unpublished results.  Conferences   will be held at remote sites in order to minimize distractions and   encourage informal discussion.  Strong efforts will be made to include   minorities and females and, in keeping with past tradition, there will be   a large number of younger investigators along with some senior   investigators. This award from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing meeting of Workshops on Physical Organic Chemistry, which is   organized by Professor Robert R. Squires of the Department of Chemistry   at Purdue University.  The workshops will provide opportunities for the   generation of new ideas, facilitate collaborations and introduce young   investigators to their senior peers. The number of attendees and location   of the meetings are designed to facilitate these goals. The workshop   benefits the Organic Dynamics Program by identifying new and imaginative   research projects and young investigators that will strengthen the   Program as new awardees and reviewers.",
