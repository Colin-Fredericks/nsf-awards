 "awd_abstract_narration": "Otto  9629502   This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research project will develop a novel, low-cost process for manufacturing the robust superconducting wires required for commercially viable magnet components capable of operating at temperatures that are accessible by inexpensive refrigeration technologies.  Most of the potentially large-scale commercial applications of high temperature superconducting (HTS) wires in magnet components require high sustained current densities at temperatures above 50 K in magnetic fields up to 5 T.  The proposed process is an innovative combination of the metallic precursor process pioneered by the proposer for the economical production of robust HTS wires, and film processes that produce the highest demonstrated critical current densities above 50 K in fields above 5 T.  The inherent formability of metallic precursor alloys presents a unique opportunity for manufacturing complex, geometrically precise, chemically homogeneous precursors similar locally to those used in film processes.  A readily scaleable metallic precursor wire manufacturing process will be developed and demonstrated that will employ reaction texturing mechanisms akin to substrate catalyzed reaction texturing mechanisms utilized in thin film processes.  The transport property targets match the requirements for large scale HTS magnet applications operating above 50 K.  The key target is a whole wire current density of 10 kA/cm2 at or above 50 K that is sustained in a 5 T field oriented at any direction relative to the wire.   The main products enabled by this wire will be lighter and more efficient motor and generator coils, current limiter coils, SMES magnets, and efficient electronic circuit inductors all operating above 50 K where they can be cooled by inexpensive mechanical refrigeration.",
