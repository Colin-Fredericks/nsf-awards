 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  objectives  of  the  proposed  work  are to  (i)  study       frequency  selective,  fading  communications  channels  and       develop  appropriate  models to describe the channel's  time       variations,  (ii) derive  novel blind and decision  feedback       algorithms  which  explicitly  take  into  account  the time       varying   nature  of  the  channel  and  (iii)  develop  the       analytical  tools to assess the  applicability  of different       models under different conditions.         Each time-varying tap coefficient of a frequency  selective,       fading  channel is typically  modeled as a random  processes       with low-pass power spectra.  However, traditional  adaptive       techniques  typically do not exploit  this  information.  In       the proposed work, Kalman  filtering  methods are derived to       track the channel by employing a multichannel autoregressive       description of the time-varying taps in a  decision-feedback       equalization  framework.  Fitting a model to the  variations       of the channel's taps is a challenging  task because the tap       coefficients are not observed  directly.  A linear method is       proposed to estimate the channel's spectral  characteristics       from input/output data, and consistency is shown.         A different  emerging  framework will also be studied, where       each time-varying tap coefficient is described (with respect       to time) as a linear combination of a finite number of basis       functions.  Examples of such channels  include  periodically       varying  ones,  where each  multipath  component  exhibits a       different  Doppler  shift or channels  locally  modeled by a       truncated Taylor Series.  It is shown that the estimation of       the expansion  parameters is equivalent  to  estimating  the       parameters of an FIR Single-Input-Many-Output (SIMO) system.       By exploiting this  equivalence, a number of different blind       subspace methods are applicable,  which h ave been originally       developed  in the context of  time-invariant  SIMO  systems.       Identifiability and performance issues will be investigated,       as well as the effects of diversity combining, when multiple       receiving antennas are available.",
