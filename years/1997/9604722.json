A primary objective of this meeting is to bring together researchers who study transcription factors, chromatin structure, and higher-order nuclear organization.    The program and confirmed session chairpersons are as follows:     Session Topic       Chairperson    1. Nucleosomal Regulation of Transcription   Carl Wu  2. Chromatin Structure and Transcription Factors  Gary Felsenfeld  3. Transcriptional Regulation by Chromatin   Sharon Roth   and non-Histone Proteins  4. Developmental/Epigenetic Regulation   Mitzi Kuroda  5. Nuclear Organization      Jasper Rine  6. DNA Replication and Silencing    Barbara Wakimoto  7. Heritable Chromatin States     Sally Elgin  8. Heterochromatin and Position-Effect Variegation  Bruce Stillman  9. Chromatin Remodeling Factors    Jim Kadonaga    The prevalent theme of this meeting is the role of eukaryotic chromosome structure in the function of basic cellular processes. While the analysis of chromatin and transcription is the central topic of this meeting, the function of chromatin/nuclear structure extends beyond this domain.  For instance, chromatin assembly is a key step in the cell cycle, and for this reason, a session on DNA Replication and Silencing has been included.  There is also an important relation between nuclear structure/localization and gene expression, and these topics are represented by sessions on Developmental/Epigenetic Regulation, which includes locus control regions and boundary elements, as well as Heterochromatin and Position-Effect Variegation, and Nuclear Organization.  Moreover, questions of genomic stability and instability will be addressed in a session on Heritable Chromatin States.  The timing of the 1997 conference is ideal for the presentation and discussion of data in these rapidly evolving areas.  ***",
