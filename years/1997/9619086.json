 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619086  Carraher    For educational research to enlighten and lend inspiration to science and mathematics teaching, it must be accessible, comprehensible, and engaging. This has been difficult to achieve through printed journals and books. Teachers and researchers themselves commonly find research publications dry, unclear, and removed from their personal experience. Recent developments in computer and video technology promise to greatly facilitate dissemination of research among educators and researchers. Research  \"articles\" that take advantage of multimedia capabilities can be produced and read on widely available computers. Such articles can include, for example, video footage of students solving problems or discussing issues. The video sequences can be integrated with hyperlinked transcripts, analyses by experts, remarks by other viewers, including educators, and links to related topics.    The present project will produce a two research articles that exploit new presentation possibilities afforded by advances in multimedia. Once completed, they will be made available on a web site where they can be evaluated by mathematics and science educators in terms of its comprehensibility, richness, and potential uses. The project will undertake discussions with researchers, teachers, and commercial publishers in order to evaluate the viability of creating a multimedia-based journal in science and math education. In addition it will host at TERC a conference on the uses of video technology in science and mathematics educational research.  ***",
