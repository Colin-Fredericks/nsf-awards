 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614725  Leeman      This grant provides $48,871 as partial support of the costs of  upgrading the X-ray fluorescence spectrometer in the Geology and  Geophysics Department at William Marsh Rice University.  Specifically, the upgrade would include installation of a PC  control system and associated software to replace the DEC PDP-11  system currently installed on their Rigaku XRF and two months  salary for their current XRF technician who would train new users  of the upgraded XRF.  This upgrade would also include  installation of a multi-layered crystal for analysis of light  elements (i.e. B, F).  Upgrade of the computer system will ensure  the availability of a critical piece of analytical  instrumentation for the analysis of major and trace elements in  whole rock samples for studies in igneous and metamorphic  petrology for Rice University and a host of other researchers in  the Houston area.  The enhanced capabilities to conduct analyses  for light element concentrations (i.e Boron) within whole rock  samples will immediately be utilized for research on fluid  mobility during metamorphism.  Continued petrologic studies of  magmatic processes in a host of environments including volcanic  island arcs, hot spots, intracontinental extensional regimes and  metamorphic terranes will also take advantage of this upgrade.  ***",
