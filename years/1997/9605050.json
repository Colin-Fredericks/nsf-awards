Zhimin Zhang, Texas  Tech University, intends to pursue collaboration with Shi  Zhongci, Director of the National Laboratory for Scientific  and Engineering Computing, Chinese Academy of Sciences,  Beijing.  The U.S. PI plans to involve one U.S.  undergraduate and one U.S. graduate student in the project.  The students will join the P.I. in research visits to China  to develop their own research in computational mathematics.    The primary objective of this project is the study of  derivative superconvergence and its recovery in finite  element computations.  Such study is of fundamental  importance in computational mechanics in that engineers are  interested in more effective ways to estimate stress, strain  energy, etc.  At present, most commercial codes used in  engineering are required to have adaptive capabilities which  allow computations to be performed in the most efficient  way.  Knowledge of superconvergence is necessary for this  adaptivity design.  The results of this research will have  significant impact on large-scale scientific computing  problems arising in structural mechanics.    Support on the Chinese side will be provided by the National  Natural Science Foundation.",
