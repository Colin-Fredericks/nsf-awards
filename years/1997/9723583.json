The  trip will allow the U.S. P.I.s to develop a joint U.S.-China  research program in the Southern Ocean, taking advantage of  annual cruises by the Chinese to their Antarctic Research  Station.  The Chinese counterpart is Dong Zhaoqian, Director  of the Polar Research Institute, Shanghai.  During the  planning visit, the P.I.s will meet with Chinese scientists  and government officials to discuss and develop mutual  scientific interests and devise a joint research plan.  The  P.I.s will also visit the newly constructed polar research  vessel, Xue Long, to see first hand the research  instrumentation available and to discuss sampling and at-sea  analysis procedures with the ship's crew and technicians.    The Southern Ocean is comparatively unsampled; this lack of  data is an obstacle to improved understanding of global  climate.  Use of the regularly scheduled Chinese research  vessel trips to the Antarctic could provide an important  additional platform for data acquisition, but arranging such  joint programs requires face to face meetings and  development of detailed understandings.  This planning visit  is an important initial step in a potentially valuable  cooperation.",
