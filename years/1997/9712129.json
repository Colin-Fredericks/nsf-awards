 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712129  Silleck    Blue Mountain film Associates Inc., a production company formed by the producers of the large format film, Cosmic Voyage, is requesting a planning grant of $50,000, of a total budget of $130,000 to conduct preliminary work on Biodiversity:  Life in the Balance.  A 40-minute large-format film will be the centerpiece of this multi-component science education project.  The film will be based on what appears to be a critical paradox:  while we humans, like all living things, have always been dependent upon natural systems for our survival, our unique cultural development and technological prowess have convinced us that we are somehow \"above\" nature.      The following a among major tasks will be accomplished during the five month planning period:    * The project principals, a researcher, and advisors will create a comprehensive project plan to include a large format film; complementary print materials for informal and formal settings; a website; a CD-ROM; a video presentation for museums, schools, and home markets; and a related traveling exhibit.  * Work with advisors and other scholars to develop detailed project content.  * Write and review a treatment for the film.  * Develop the museum exhibit component  * Write a detailed script for the film.  * Develop draft of outreach plan for advisor review.  * Develop promotion plan.    The principals in the project will include:  Bayley Silleck who will be PI, Director, Co-Producer, and Writer; Jeffrey Marvin, Co-PI and Producer; and Thomas Eisner, who will be a Co-PI and will serve as primary content specialist and chair of the advisory committee.  The advisory committee includes:  Niles Eldredge, American Museum of Natural History; Jane Lubchenco, Oregon State University; Peter Raven, Missouri botanical Garden; and Edward O. Wilson, Harvard University.",
