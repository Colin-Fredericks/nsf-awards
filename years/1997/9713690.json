 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hartman  9713690   This grant provides funding for the development of an optimization tool to determine replacement decisions for a group of assets subject to a random operational environment.  Traditional models, which provide replacement decisions over discrete (annual) intervals, are based on expected operating, maintenance and salvage costs which are dependent on asset utilization levels determined by operational (daily) decisions. However, due to uncertainty associated with operations, such as fluctuating demand or budget levels, these expected utilization levels may not  be realized in practice, thus invalidating the replacement schedule.  The research will link strategic (replacement) and operational (utilization) decisions such that replacement schedules are functions of asset utilization.  This problem will be examined in the context of the  transportation industry, with sponsors including a railroad and a truck leasing firm.  A double-ended queueing model is researched to approximate the operations of the transportation system and determine utilization levels.  This model is built into a non-linear optimization model which determines minimum   cost purchase and sale decisions.  The research solution procedure for the large scale non-linear program is based on augmented Lagrangian techniques.     There are numerous potential applications of this research in industry and the military as these organizations generally rely on groups or fleets of assets which are subject to varying levels of utilization in an uncertain environment.  The analysis will merge two traditionally separate decisions, the static replacement problem and the dynamic operational problem, such that strategic   capital budgeting decisions are based on a measurement of actual operations.  As acquisition decisions are dependent on asset utilization, the model will improve the asset replacement decision   process which traditionally relies on static data.  This research will also contribute to improved solution techniques  for large scale non-linear optimization models and provide more investigation into double-ended queues which despite their numerous applications are not prominent in   research.",
