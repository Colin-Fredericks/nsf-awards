 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619024  Haase    This three-year project, sponsored by North Carolina State  University, will enhance 120 teachers of science and technology in  the rural part of the state.  Middle school teachers will be  recruited from economically disadvantaged school districts in  Eastern North Carolina and will attend a three week summer  intensive institute followed by academic year workshops and a one-  week \"refresher course\" in the next summer.  Participants will be  trained in the use of new computer based technologies to teach  physics and chemistry particularly the use of MBL and CBL in the  classroom.  In addition, equipment, which is sometimes cost  prohibitive for the schools, will be lent on an as-needed basis  from the University.  Also, teachers will be trained to take  advantage of, and submit proposals to the \"School Technology Fund\"  which is being made available by the state to encourage schools to  use computers and laboratory equipment in the schools.  Teachers  will be sensitized to the philosophy and practice of hands-on and  inquiry-based learning, learn to address the needs of a diverse  student population and enlist the aid of teacher mentors (trained  from a previous NSF project) who will help in the implementation of  the technology component of the program as well as the new content.   A web site will be developed to enable teachers to discuss with one  another and with project staff issues related to the implementation  of these new techniques in the classroom.  The award is being  matched by funds equivalent to 36% of the grant.",
