Fujimoto at the National Institute of Bioscience and Human  Technology, Tsukuba, Japan.  Dr. Fujimoto will work with Dr.  Masaru Takagi, Senior Researcher in the Plant Molecular  Biology Laboratory, on a research project entitled,  \"Dissecting the Molecular Mechanisms of the Signal  Transduction Pathway Leading to Ethylene Dependent  Transcription.\"    The goal of the proposed research is to identify molecular  components of the pathway leading from the perception of the  plant hormone ethylene to a physiological response.  How  this gas acts as an important growth regulator in plants is  not yet well understood.  Elucidation of this pathway would  not only offer fundamental insights for basic science but  would also provide a significant impact to plant  biotechnology.  Using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana,  factors that are involved in the transmission of signals  necessary to initiate transcription of genes responsive to  ethylene will be investigated.  Ethylene responsive genes  have already been isolated from Arabidopsis and a group of  proteins termed AERBs (Arabidopsis Ethylene-Responsive  Binding proteins) that interact with these genes have been  characterized.  In the proposed research, AERB gene  expression will be analyzed and compared  with expressions  in Arabidopsis mutants affected in their response to  ethylene.  In addition, the possibility of protein  modification and identification of factors interacting with  the AERBs in response to ethylene will be examined.  By  using ethylene responsive genes in conjunction with known  ethylene response mutants, one can dissect and possibly  order the genes comprising this important and complex  pathway.  ***",
