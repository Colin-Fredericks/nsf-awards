Deng and Shih-Chang Lee,  Academia Sinica in Taiwan, and sixteen other researchers  from the Taiwan National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan  University, Nanjing University (China), Institute of High  Energy Physics of Chinese Academy of Science.   Drs.George  C.C. Chang and Chung Yun Chang request funds for travel and  communication to carry out the pilot experiment on neutrino  oscillation using anti-neutrino particles generated by the  Taiwan nuclear power plants.   neutrino is one of the  elementary particles in particle and astro-physics. Neutrino  oscillation may provide the information for many fundamental  questions in physics, such as whether neutrinos have finite  masses or different masses for different neutrino flavor  transitions.    This study addresses a very important fundamental question  in physics.  The Taiwan National Science Council will  provide $200,000 for the first year of this experiment and  one million dollars per year for next four years if the  initial  experiment proves to be promising.    It is an  exploratory project with potential major scientific payoff.  The majority of the laboratory and research cost will be  provided by the Taiwan National Science Council and the  Taiwan Power Company.  If successful, experimental results  may lead to answers to questions on fundamental properties  of neutrinos and to cosmological puzzles such as the deficit  of solar neutrinos and the properties of dark matter.  The  project is jointly supported by the Taiwan National Science  Council and the NSF.  ***",
