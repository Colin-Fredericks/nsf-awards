 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619331  Anseth  The object of the proposed research is to develop a new  class of degradable polymers that is photopolymerizable and  exhibits the desired mechanical properties (particularly as  the sample degrades) necessary for musculoskeletal  applications.  This work is important in developing new  strategies to restore structural and mechanical function to  bone that has been fractured by traumatic injury, or  surgically removed because of disease or tumor formation.  There is a great need for polymeric materials that are safe,  degradable and strong for use in musculoskeletal  applications.  Development of a photopolymerizable system  may be beneficial for many reasons including fast curing  rates at room temperature, spatial control of the  polymerization, and complete ease of fashioning and  flexibility during implantation.  These benefits have led to  advanced in dentistry, opthamology, and adhesion prevention,  but currently no orthopedic systems have been designed.  Photoinitiation could greatly simplify the clinical  application of orthopedic polymer implants.  For example, in  pin applications a viscous, liquid monomer could be  introduced into a pin hole and the system photopolymerized  in situ to render a hardened polymer of the required  dimensions.  In situ polymerization eliminates the need for  shaping the implant with blades, buffs, and warming  instruments.  Additionally, the process provided a faster  and better mechanism for replicating complex shapes and  should improve adhesion of the polymer implant to the bone.  Bone fractures are a major health concern in this country.  Recent studies of musculoskeletal conditions in the United  States estimate over 2 million fractures annually which more  than 280,000 are hip fractures.  Numerous musculoskeletal  applications would benefit from the development of safe,  strong, easily fashioned, and degradable polymers.  ***",
