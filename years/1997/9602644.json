 "awd_abstract_narration": "La Salle University is the recipient of ARI funds to revitalize laboratories for research and research training programs in biology and chemistry.  Located in Philadelphia, PA, the University serves a large population of urban students of diverse ethnicity, and is committed to providing a quality education in all disciplines including the sciences.  At present, all science activity occurs in the Holroyd Science Center a facility constructed in the early sixties that has limited utility to support modern research.  The configuration, size, and obsolescence of the structure impairs experimental work conducted in the building.  Utility systems are inadequate, shared usage of rooms between research and instructional activities results in the duplication of efforts, and safety concerns create an environment that is not conducive for research.  To rectify the problems that impede the faculty's ability to perform  state of the art research and provide students with improved training opportunities,  La Salle University, as the part of a larger effort to ameliorate the physical infrastructure, will renovate Holroyd in its entirely.  By partnering with the National Science Foundation, the institution will reconfigure laboratories, install new fume hoods, create a tissue culture facility and equipment room, and make space accessible to those individuals who are physically challenged.  Upon completion, three modernized research laboratories will be established for neurobiology, molecular biology, biochemistry and organic chemistry.  Faculty will have controlled environments to conducted experiments requiring the use of delicate and precise instrumentation.  Most importantly, the renovation will increase research productivity, improve the quality of research, expand training opportunities and maximize access to a diverse group of students interested in pursuing science as a career.",
