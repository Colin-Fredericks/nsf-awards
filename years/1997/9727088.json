The research is: \"The Effect of Light Quantity  and Quality on the Developmental Ecology of  Indian Tropical Forest Trees.\"  The   researchers will study seedlings of 16 native  South Asian forest trees to determine how they  respond to changes in light quantity and  quality as they grow in spectrally neutral and  altered shade conditions.  Plants will be  examined for growth rate, morphology, leaf  anatomy, and physiological response over a 10-  15 month period.  Results will improve  understanding of the ecological responses of  the species in natural conditions, their  sylviculture, and their establishment in  nurseries.  The research will increase  fundamental knowledge about the effect of light  quality and quantity to the development of  trees in natural light conditions.   Scope:  This study will be conducted almost  entirely at the Madurai Kamaraj University by  Indian researchers in close collaboration with  US PI David Lee who will spend part of his  sabbatical there.  The approach is novel and  should lead to significant advances in  fundamental knowledge about tree regeneration  in tropical forests.  The research is basic and  applied.  It will greatly strengthen US science  by focusing on a region little studied by US  researchers.  As a new collaboration that will  involve young scientists, this project supports  INT objectives.  The project will strengthen  research links between the US and India.  The  interaction is mutually beneficial.    ***",
