 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will convene a small group of persons with diverse expertise in social science fields relevant to the new initiative for Capacity Building in Science, which has been launched by the International Council of Scientific Unions.  According to the ICSU initiative, capacity building in science is intended to enable less-developed nations and regions to make use of science and technology for the well-being of their citizens.  This is a central concern of scholarship in Science and Technology Studies, and poses a challenge that the field must rise to meet.  The workshop will bring together a small group of knowledgeable scholars to critically examine capacity-building proposals that have been developed, to make recommendations for further development of the initiative, and to propose ways to involve the larger STS community in the capacity-building initiative.",
