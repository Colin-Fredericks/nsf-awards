 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617869  Rossby  This project is to develop a profiling current meter that   can operate from the surface to depths as great as 5000   meters. Called the EM-POGO, it is a merger of two well-  established techniques, the expendable current profiler   (XCP) and the dropsonde, also known as the POGO.  The XCP   technique yields the vertical structure of ocean currents to   a relative accuracy of  1-2 cm/s, and the dropsonde   displacement measures the vertically averaged velocity also   to about 1-2 cm/s. The complete instrument will weigh about   15 kg enabling it to be deployed by hand and hence used from   boats of any size. The appeal of the instrument lies in its   high accuracy, ease and speed of use, and low cost. These   attributes should lead to considerable interest in it for a   number of research applications.  The necessary technology   is well-known; the proposed work consists of adapting these   two techniques into one operating system.  The resulting   technology will be made available for commercial   fabrication.",
