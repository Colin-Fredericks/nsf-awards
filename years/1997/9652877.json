 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding quantum mechanics (QM) is of growing importance to engineers, chemists, and biologists, as well as to physicists of all disciplines. Fields where this understanding is of particular importance include mesoscopic systems, photonics, molecular genetics, and medical diagnostics. However, QM is a difficult and abstract subject and there has been little success in teaching it at all levels.    In response to this situation, we are conducting systematic investigations into student understanding of QM and develop instructional materials based on this research for courses.  While most research is being conducted in a course for scientists and engineers meant to follow introductory caluclus-based physics, we are also interacting with projects at Kansas State (Zollman) and Boston University (Garik).  These collaborations allow us to investigate the understanding of fundamental quantum concepts by students in college courses on QM for non-scientists and in high school.  The keys to our instructional strategies are:    1. The iterative process of physics education research, curriculum development, and instruction will be employed. This model of curriculum reform is becoming increasingly valued. However, it has not been applied to QM and no detailed investigations of student understanding of the subject have been conducted.  Research is being conducted into student understanding of QM and into student understanding of prerequisite topics such as mechanical waves and physical optics.    2. Materials that enable students to work constructively in small groups will be developed. Numerous studies in physics education have pointed to the need for students to work with one another in a context where they can construct an understanding of important fundamental principles instead of listening passively.  Much work is needed in extending this mode of instruction to QM. We hope to continue with successes we have already had developing such materials.    3. Instructional strategies will employ advances in  educational technology. Modern technology has dramatically increased the resources we have in physics education. Simulations allow students to \"observe\" phenomena and probe the effect of different parameters in ways not otherwise possible.  Computer assisted data acquisition provides students with direct kinesthetic learning experiences. Inexpensive simple quantum devices such as solar cells and LED's are readily available. Although we will not develop any software ourselves, we are developing lessons for using the software developed at Kansas State and Boston University and will test its effectiveness for improving student understanding of the subject.    The products of this project will include insights into student difficulties learning QM and a series of 12 lessons (tutorials) on fundamental concepts.  We will also develop assessment tools for QM classes (interview protocols, open-ended questions, and a multiple-choice concept inventory) and evaluate relevant educational software.  Once they are vetted by research, our lessons and assessment tools will be distributed on the World Wide Web.    We expect that the impact of both the research and the curriculum development will be substantial from the introductory to the advanced level, for physicists, engineers, and other scientists. We also suspect that the student-centered nature of the work will aid in reaching a more diverse population than those that traditionally succeed in these fields.",
