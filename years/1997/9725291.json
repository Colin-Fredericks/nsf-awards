 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9725291  Cornell  Dr. Eric A. Cornell of the University of Colorado and a  Fellow of the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics  (JILA) and at the National Institute of Standards and  Technology, is the 22nd recipient of the Alan T. Waterman  award.  Dr. Cornell will receive $500,000 in research  support over the next three years as part of this award.  The Alan T. Waterman Award Committee overviewed the  recommendation process after receiving 84 nominations.  The  National Science Board unanimously agreed to present the  award to this atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO)  physicist.  The National Foundation presents this annual  award to this annual award to a promising scientist, no more  than 35 years of age or within five years of receiving  his/her Ph.D., who is judged to be in the forefront of  his/her field.  The committee recognized Dr. Cornell for his demonstration  of Bose-Einstein condensation in a gas.  He is an AMO  physicist who noted that Bose-Einstein condensate is a new  macroscopic state with unique and fascinating properties.  The applications have included the transformation of the  field of atom interferometry much as the laser  revolutionized optical interferometry.  This work has opened  up a rich and fascinating physical system with a host of  further questions to explore.  Dr. Cornell has emerged as a leader among his generation as  an AMO physicist.  His creativity, originality, and  leadership ability set him apart in this field and have  inspired progress in the AMO field.  The award is the most  prestigious honor of the National Science Foundation for  young researchers.  ***",
