WISCONSIN    This workshop will address the processes for sharing, disseminating, and standardizing ecological, archaeological, and paleoecological data obtained from the Aleutian Archipelago for human behavioral studies.  The goals are to establish a common research agenda that would address the relationship between humans and their environments in the southern Bering Sea and Aleutian region; to develop an overarching research design to investigate some of the \"big issues\" in northern social sciences; and to ensure outlets for integration and collaboration.  The organization of the workshop will include short research-based presentations by participants, task groups that will document key issues in Aleutian research, and colloquia which would outline a monograph of Aleutian ecology, archaeology, and paleoecology to establish a knowledge baseline for future research.  Participation is planned to included academic researchers and local people knowledgeable and interested in the Aleutian environment.",
