 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707585  Alexander    In this CAA project complex susceptibility and resistivity  measurements will be used to investigate electric and  magnetic properties of composites of quasi one- and two-  dimensional molecular metal crystals in conventional  polymers.  The effect of molecular dimensionality of the  conducting particles on the percolation threshold and  conductivity of the composites will be instigated.  Data  will also be related to bulk crystal shape and dimensions,  molecular metal composition and metal concentration in the  composites.  We will investigate the properties of the  composites when the conducting phase becomes magnetic and  look for evidence of proximity effect and tuneling when the  conductor becomes superconducting.  Dielectric relaxation measurements will be used to  investigate interfacial chemical and electromagnetic  interactions between the conducting and insulating phases of  the composites.  These materials have potential as coatings  or extruded plastics for electromagnetic shielding or  electrostatic dissipation applications.  %%%  Composite materials made by combining conventional polymers  with carbon or metal powders or fibers are currently used  for industrial applications, because of  their good  electrical conductivity and mechanical properties.  In this  CAA project, we plan to form, for the first time, composites  of conventional polymers with \"molecular metals\".  These are  metallorganic or purely organic substances that conduct  electricity.  Some are practically one-dimensional chains of  molecules weakly linked together.  Others are almost two-  dimensional \"sheets\" of molecules that are weakly linked  together.  This work will yield results of both fundamental  and practical importance.  We will gain understanding of the  effect of molecular dimensions on the electrical  conductivity of a composites and study the effect of  dispersing one- or two- dimensional superconducting or  magnetic crystals in an insulating, non-magnetic matrix.  These composi te magterials may exhibit good conductivity  and/or useful magnetic properties, making them important as  materials for electrostatic dissipation or electromagnetic  shielding.  In addition to journal publications, a patent  application is anticipated.  Detailed study of these  composites will take several years and will provide the base  for a long-term vigorous research program.  ***",
