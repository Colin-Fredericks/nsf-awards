In such  mesoscopic  structures, the Coulomb charging energy of  a  single  electron  exceeds  thermal energies below  1K,  allowing  one  to  control  the  number of electrons one-by-one on the island  in  a  single-electron   transistor   (SET).   If    the    island    is  superconducting,   the  PI's previous work  has  shown  that  the  pairing  energy  leads to even-odd electron number  effects.  One  ongoing  project will utilize this even-odd effect as  the  basis  for  developing  a  microwave detector  device  of  unprecedented  sensitivity,  in which each individual microwave photon  absorbed  in  enabling  the photon-assisted tunneling of a single  electron  will trigger a microsecond long current pulse containing hundreds  of   electrons.  The  SET  electrometers  coupled  to   wide-band  cryogenic amplifiers developed for this experiment will also make  possible new types of experiments monitoring the motion of single  electronic  charges  with  microsecond time  resolution.  If  the  mesoscopic island is as small as 5nm, the PI's previous work  has  shown  that individual electronic energy levels can be  resolved,  and  that  a  spectroscopic even-odd effect exists  even  in  the  normal  state  because  of  the two-fold  spin  degeneracy.  Such  measurements will be extended to new types of mesoscopic  systems  such  as  chemically prepared metallic nanospheres of  controlled  size  (which should allow more systematic probing of energy level  statistics  than  is possible with random sized  grains),  carbon  nanotubes,  and possibly even individual large organic molecules.  Another experiment in preparation seeks to observe the change  in  the spectrum of a superconducting nanograin when it is doped with   0,1,2  or  more magnetic impurities, to compare with  theoretical  predictions.  %%%  There  is  a  practical need to understand better the  new  basic  physics  which will govern attempts to devise ever  more  compact  computers  and  memories.  With  this  general  motivation,   the  research  which will be performed under this grant will focus  on  various forms of the single-electron transistor, or SET.  An  SET  device   consists  of  a  small  conducting  island  coupled   to  electrical  leads by ultramall tunnel junctions and  capacitively  coupled  to  a  gate  electrode  which  controls  the  number  of  electrons  on  the island. Such SET devices can easily  detect  a  single  excess electron charge, in principle making  possible  an  ultracompact memory element in which the binary \"zero\" and  \"one\"  are  represented  by the presence or absence of  a  single  extra  electron.  Development  of  a technology  from  this  concept  is  complicated  by  the  sensitivity of the  devices  to  background  charge  noise and the difficulty of reliable fabrication of  such  small  devices.  The proposed research may lead  to  progress  in  overcoming these difficulties. A possible approach which will  be  explored  involves joining the fabrication technology of physics,  for making connections, with the molecular engineering of organic  chemistry,  to make small charge storage elements. At such  small  length  scales,  classical physics must be  replaced  by  quantum  physics,  in  which  the  wave  properties  of  electrons  become  important  in  understanding  the electrical  properties  of  the  device.  The  research to be performed will  probe  the  relation  between  the  discrete set of quantum energy levels  in  a  small  conducing   grain  with  the  charging  energies   of   classical  electrostatics. Special attention will be paid to phenomena which  arise  from  the  pairing energy of electrons  if  the  grain  is  superconducting, and to the coupling of the electron  spins  with  d eliberately introduced magnetic impurity atoms.  ***",
