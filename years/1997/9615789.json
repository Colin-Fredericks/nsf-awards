 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615789  Lathrop    This grant provides $83,279 as partial support of the costs of  developing an experimental dynamo via testing of a prototype  apparatus which thermally forces convection of liquid Sodium in  an annulus in an attempt to generate a magnetic field.  In order  to achieve large enough fluid velocities in this apparatus, the  titanium rotor which has been designed to handle large stresses  will need to be rotated at 25,000 rpm.  Such high rotation rates  are necessary to overcome the scaling problems of an experimental  apparatus designed to model the Earth's geomagnetic field.  The  development of an experimental dynamo has been a fundamental  unsolved problem in geophysics and an unfulfilled dream of  international researchers for the last 40 years.  The technical  difficulties of creating a laboratory sized system capable of  generating a large enough magnetic Reynolds number to simulate  the Earth's geodynamo have been daunting.  This instrument, which  has already been built and used for preliminary tests will shed  light on the physics of fluid dynamos and has the potential to  produce a magnetic field for the first time in a laboratory  experiment.  ***",
