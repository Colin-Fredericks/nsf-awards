This funding will  be used to enhance a program currently funded by the NSF  Division of Undergraduate Education through the development  of software modules applicable to more advanced topics in  materials science and engineering.  The laboratory, which  will be associated with the Department of Materials Science  and Engineering, will be composed of virtual-reality  stations designed to take advantage of recent dramatic  reductions in the cost of force-feedback haptics and  breakthroughs in the performance of graphics workstations.  Each station will consist of a three-degreeof-freedom haptic  interface and IBM-compatible PCs.  %%%  This grant from the Division of Materials Research is one of  the first awarded in an attempt to find innovative methods  to integrate research and education.  It is to devise  teaching methods for materials concepts based on virtual  reality techniques including specifically, a tactile  (haptic) interface.  It is also cosponsored by the Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and  Physical Sciences Directorate.  It supports a program  currently funded by the NSF Division of Undergraduate  Education through the development of software modules  applicable to more advanced topics in materials science and  engineering.  ***",
