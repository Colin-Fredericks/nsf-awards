 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712883  Niebauer    Research will be undertaken in response to an Announcement of   Opportunity (NSF 97-38) for Coastal Studies in the Great Lakes.   The research is being conducted under the auspices of the NSF   Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) program and the NOAA Coastal Ocean   Program.  This collaborative, interdisciplinary research program   will entail an integrated program of field and laboratory studies   and mathematical modeling to quantify the role of coastal   currents and thermal fronts in mediating cross-margin transport   in Lake Superior and Lake Michigan.    The objective of this project is to numerically model and   understand the basic oceanographic processes that affect and   drive cross-margin and vertical transport in the Great Lakes.   This modeling study will consider physical, biological, and   chemical interactions with emphasis on episodic and seasonal   weather (wind and heat) forcing of vertical and horizontal lake   circulation, and effects on events such as primary production.   The ultimate goal is to gain understanding to the point of being   able to predict transport of momentum and mass, including natural   and anthropogenic material. The transport of natural and   anthropogenic material includes primary production in nutrient-  phytoplankton-zooplankton loops with emphasis on aggregation of   particles (both natural and anthropogenic) and associated   vertical flux and fate.    This modeling research will be applied to two contrasting Great   Lakes coastal margins for comparison and contrast: Lake Superior   as an example of an oligotrophic Lake that is seasonally impacted   by ice cover, and Lake Michigan as an example of a coastal region   that is more impacted by anthropogenic input. While this research   is aimed at the Great Lakes coastal zone, it is directly   applicable to the coastal ocean.  The work requires a   multidisciplinary, collaborative research approach and   cooperative interaction to fit the various biological, physical,   chemical and met eorological model components together and to   gather, apply and interpret data for initial and boundary   conditions as well as to verify the resulting model results. This   will be accomplished through interaction with investigators and   laboratories around the Great Lakes. The research will lead to a   better quantitative understanding of the processes that dominate   the transport, transformations, and fates of biologically,   chemically, and geologically important matter across the margins   of the Great Lakes.",
