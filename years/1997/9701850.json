 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701850  Lee  Our primary research objective is to investigate and develop  intelligent control strategies for underwater robotic  vehicles (URVs) with manipulator workpackages.  The motion  of the manipulator, which is attached to the vehicle's main  body, affects the motion of the vehicle, whose dynamics are  also subject to parameter uncertainties, changes in payload  and environment, and nonlinear behavior.  It is necessary to  develop an intelligent control system for such vehicles to  provide:       automatic compensation for the errors of the vehicle    motion, due to manipulator motion and underwater currents.       coordinated control of both vehicle and manipulator    using deliberate vehicle motion; such motion will help task    performance and add the degrees of freedom of the vehicle to    those of the manipulator workpackage;       learning and adaptation capabilities to parameter    uncertainties and changes in the environment; and       close coupling of control knowledge transfer between  the high-level and low-level subsystems of the overall URV  control system.    The study:       extends a theoretical modeling of the underwater    robotic vehicle and manipulator, including dynamic    interaction between links and vehicle main body, kinematic    redundancy, contact stability of the system in contact with    the environment, and fixtureless manipulation;       develops a theoretical framework for intelligent    control strategies based on fuzzy neural network (FNN)    control using fuzzy clustering techniques and on-line    reinforcement learning technique; and       includes experimental demonstration of the proposed    approach on the University of Hawaii's underwater robotic    vehicle, ODIN (Omni-Directional Intelligent Navigator).  ***",
