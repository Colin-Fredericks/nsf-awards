The plan of action includes: faculty development, laboratory expansions, developing advanced computing and research facilities, establishment of institutional linkage, outreach to local industry, course and curriculum development to incorporate technology advancements, and mentoring of minority students.    The main objective of this project is to plan and establish a Center for Research and Educational Excellence in Advanced Computing that caters to the needs of the local industry and provides excellent educational and research opportunities for the minority students in southern region.  The proposed   center will be of great potential in designing and developing state-of-the-art research and educational outreach in advanced fields of computing such as Image Analysis, Distributed Databases, Computer Security, High Performance Distributed Computing, and Visual Tools.  The project has the potential ultimately to attract and significantly increase the number and quality of  minority students in computer science.",
