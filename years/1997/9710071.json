 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a cultural anthropologist from the University of Arizona studying how Finnish society, which displays a marked egalitarian style of gender relations, deals with conflict and aggression.  The project hypothesizes that egalitarian male-female relations have less physical and verbal aggression and more discussion, negotiation, and problem-solving than more unequal relationships, while in male-dominant relationships, the women is hypothesized to engage in more indirect aggression towards to the man than in female-dominated or egalitarian relationships.  The project will use a combination of qualitative, ethnographic methods including participant-observation and informal, conversational interviews on conflict, semi-structured interviews or laypersons and experts about conflict resolution patterns and egalitarianism.  This study should provide practical information as well as advance our understanding of the role of gender inequality in conflict and aggression.",
