 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Thomas C. Flood, Department of Chemistry, University of Southern   California, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division with a contribution for   instrumentation from the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the   Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate for the study of the   activation and functionalization of hydrocarbons by soluble transition   metal complexes. Investigations will focus on alkene insertion and   carbon-hydrogen activation through metal mediated oxidative addition and   electrophilic alkane metathesis. Using triamine-ligated complexes of   rhodium, iridium, ruthenium, and osmium, the influence of metal,   oxidations state, steric bulk, electronic effects of the ancillary   ligands, alkyl group structure, charge, and chelate ring size on these   reactions will be assessed. Amine ligation will be exploited to prepare   high oxidation state and oxo species that will display an enhanced   ability to functionalize hydrocarbons. In all cases reaction mechanisms   will be analyzed.  Chemical transformations of hydrocarbons are the basis for much of our   utilization of energy and material natural resources, which are in turn   an integral part of our economy and an important source of our standard   of living. Many transformations of hydrocarbons are carried out through   their interactions with metals and metal compounds. It is a basic tenant   of chemistry that a better understanding of mechanisms of reactions will   lead to improved methods for converting raw materials into materials to   improve our lives. Expressed as broadly as possible, it is the purpose of   the proposed research to enhance and extend our understanding of how   metal complexes can be used to manipulate the structures of hydrocarbons,   which should ultimately lead to enhanced availability of energy   resources.",
