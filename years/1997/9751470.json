 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is equipping a basic paleomagnetics laboratory within the Department of Geology. The new laboratory is addressing the increasing needs of undergraduate students for exposure to analytical methods, scientific experimentation, and the interpretation of quantitative data. Inclusive of the paleomagnetic equipment into the first-year course, Processes and Concepts of Geology, is introducing a general student audience to laboratory procedure and data analysis. This laboratory is stressing the contribution of paleomagnetic results to the development of plate tectonic theory and enabling students to see the relationship between experimentation, hypothesis formation, and testing. Paleomagnetic laboratory modules are also being designed for the structural geology course and for two new courses in geophysics and geoarcheology. Together, these courses are affecting a wide selection of both majors and non-science-majors. The new laboratory is also being used to support student research as part of their independent study research, which is a requirement for all student. Students and faculty at neighboring institutions are being invited to use the paleomagnetics laboratory.  *",
