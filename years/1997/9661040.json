The cost of low-temperature fuel cell stacks can be greatly reduced if the bipolar graphite plates, which are used to connect the fuel cells in series, can be replaced by aluminum plates with conductive and corrosion resistant coatings. The conductive oxide coatings under investigation in Phase I will be deposited on aluminum alloy substrates, coated with Ni/Cu bilayers, by low-temperature organometallic chemical vapor deposition (OMCVD). The multilayer thin film deposition scheme has been designed to reduce thermal stresses in the films. The coatings will be characterized by X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The corrosion resistance of the conductive oxide protective coatings will be determined by acetic acid salt spray test. During Phase I, the conductive, perovskite-type oxide coatings will be synthesized at low temperatures (< 325 C) by OMCVD using organometallic precursors and N2O (an oxidizer).   The aluminum sheets and plates coated with conductive perovskite-type oxide thin films will be used in low-temperature (87-125 C) fuel cell stacks. The conductive oxide coatings are expected to provide long-term corrosion resistance. The fuel cell stacks with conductive oxide coated aluminum sheets and plates will have potential application in the next generation automobiles, buses, watercraft and submarines. The conductive oxide protective coatings can also be applied to aluminum parts for non-decorative applications. ***",
