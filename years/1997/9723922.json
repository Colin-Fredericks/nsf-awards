A key hypothesis for the functions of P28 is that it acts as a \"paramyosin coupling protein;\" that is, that P28 binds to and cross-links paramyosin stoichiometrically during thick filament assembly and in the final structure.  Paramyosin is the homologue of myosin heavy chain rod domains and is the major protein of the thick filament cores in C. elegans and many other invertebrates.  Myosin and paramyosin are members of the superfamily of coiled-coil proteins which includes cytoskeletal myosin II motors, intermediate filament proteins, and nuclear lamins.  Understanding the interactions among these proteins may serve as a model for functionally analogous interactions with structurally homologous myosin rods in vertebrate thick filament assembly and structure.  The following Specific Aims will be pursued in order to accomplish these objectives:  1, to establish the functional significance of P29 in vivo, deletions will be induced in the chromosomal locus encoding this protein and will be detected in genomic DNA from mutagenized nematode clones by PCR-based screening methods.  The new alleles will be characterized genetically, and the mutant phenotypes will be examined.  In order to establish possible broader significance, searches in vertebrates and other invertebrates for genomic DNA and cDNA sequences homologous to P28 will be performed in future experiments.  2, to localize P28 protein within the thick filaments of C. elegans body-wall muscles by immunofluorescence and immuno-electron microscopy in wild-type and specific mutant strains.  3, to analyze the interactions of recombinant P28 protein with purified paramyosin and myosin in vitro in terms of binding, dynamics of assembly, and structural properties of the in vitro assemblies.  The successful accomplishment of these goal s will advance our understanding of the structure and assembly of thick filaments.    The subcellular machinery of muscle cells that allows them to carry out their contractile function consists of two sets of complex filaments, termed thick and thin filaments, which are arranged in parallel arrays within a larger structure termed the myofibril.  In fully \"relaxed\" muscles, these parallel arrays only partially overlap each other  Contraction occurs when the thick and thin filaments slide over each other in a coordinated manner to increase the extent of overlap, thereby shortening the myofibrils (and thus shortening the cell), a process which requires hydrolysis of ATP.  The \"motor\" which transduces the energy of hydrolysis of ATP into movement is myosin, the major component of the thick filaments.  In order to fully understand how muscle cells function, it is necessary to understand the fine molecular structure of the myofibril.  Recently, a new protein, termed P28, has been discovered as a component of thick filaments in a model invertebrate, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.   This project will explore the role that this newly-discovered thick filament protein plays in the assembly and function of myofibrils, and will undoubtedly lead to new insights into those processes.   ***",
