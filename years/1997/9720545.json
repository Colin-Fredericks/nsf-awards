The research investigates the role of adaptation in computer systems, particularly as it applies to resource management in clusters of workstations and environments for mobile computing. Adaptation is an emerging theme in systems research. At all levels of system design, there are potential performance benefits to be realized by responding to dynamic variations in runtime behavior and resource availability by applying distinctly different policies or techniques.    The defined research plan experimentally addresses questions concerning what the best adaptation strategies are and what infrastructure mechanisms are useful for their implementation.  The methods to be employed include design, implementation, and measurement of software prototypes to evaluate various adaptation approaches.  This award is expected to have impact on the discovery of new adaptation techniques to improve mobile and cluster computing performance, encouragement of women students to enter and to complete advanced degree programs in Computer Science, and advancement the PI as a senior woman in research and education.",
