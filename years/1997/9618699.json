 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seawater circulates through the ocean crust and interacts with  minerals there and leaves chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F) behind.   This is known from minerals that have been recovered from the ocean  floor.  The amount of Cl and F that is taken up by minerals is  probably related to the conditions within the sea floor, yet the  relationship between these conditions, such as temperature and the  abundance of Cl and F in the fluid, and the amount of Cl and F  deposited in the minerals is not known.  The investigators plan to  use laboratory experiments to determine how temperature and other  conditions control Cl and F in minerals.  These data can then be  used to interpret the conditions of the formation of the ocean  crust.",
