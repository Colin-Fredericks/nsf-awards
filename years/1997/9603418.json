The project is a study  of the regulatory mechanisms of gibberellin biosynthesis and  response in Arabidopsis.  Gibberellins (GAs) are diterpenoid  compounds, some of which are plant growth regulators,  controlling such diverse processes as seed germination, stem  elongation, and flower development.  There are three major  goals of this project:  1) examine the effect of light on  the expression of the first gene (GA1) in the Arabidopsis GA  biosynthetic pathway to understand how light regulates GA  concentrations in responding tissues;  2) examine the  effects of overproduction of the first two enzymes (ent-  kaurene syntheses A and B) in the GA biosynthetic pathway on  plant growth; and  3) measure the GA content of new GA-response mutants that  have been isolated to determine whether these mutations  alter GA metabolism.    The project brings together the efforts of two laboratories  that have constituted different parts of the process: the  Americans will provide the new GA-response mutants and the  Japanese will perform the GA measurements.  The results of  this project will identify regulatory mechanisms of GA  biosynthesis and organ-specific GA responses that are now  unclear.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this  project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote  international understanding and cooperation.",
