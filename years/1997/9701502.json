 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701502  Frey  This research program features several major activities: (1) the  development of detailed engineering-economic models of clean  technologies for the purpose of understanding trade-offs among  process performance, emissions and cost; (2) the development of  new methods for quantitative analysis of uncertainty and  variability in environmental technologies; (3) the combination of  probabilistic analysis with optimization capabilities to yield  approaches for optimizing technologies in the face of  uncertainties; and (4) detailed case studies to illustrate the  use of systems models and the benefits of the probabilistic and  optimization methodologies.    The detailed case studies will focus on selected innovative  gasification technologies.  These technologies offer promise for  low environmental discharges, waste utilization, and efficient  use of fossil fuels.  For example, coal gasification technologies  represent a rich area of study regarding process optimization,  uncertainty analysis, and pollution prevention because of the  wide range of possible process configurations.  These  technologies are emerging as the preferred alternative for the  next generation of coal-based power generation, with nearly a  dozen demonstration plants underway in the U.S. and Europe.  By  failing to rigorously quantify the risks of new technology,  traditional approaches to estimating their performance,  emissions, and cost have been misleading, exposing decision  makers to unnecessary costs and risks.  The billions of dollars  now being spent on the development of coal gasification  technologies should be targeted to those systems that offer the  greatest potential for emissions reduction and favorable costs.  Therefore, there is a critical need for systems modeling of these  technologies.  Opportunities to extend the methodology to  evaluation of other types of technologies will be considered as  part of collaborative work.    The educational program will include the development of modular  inst ructional materials in air pollution control, air quality  engineering, systems engineering, and related topics.  These  modules will be adaptable for use in courses in transportation  engineering, chemical engineering, and textiles.  Modular  materials are amenable to systematic evaluation and targeted  refinement through pre- and post-testing.  Modular materials will  also facilitate distance-learning course offerings.  A key focus  in the development of instructional materials will be the  development of multi-media pedagogical computer models of major  emission sources that transfer the research results into the  classroom.  Such models will enable students to explore the  sensitivity of model predictions to different mechanistic  assumptions regarding mass and energy balances, chemical  equilibrium, chemical kinetics, and empirical approaches to  estimating pollutant formation and control, and to deal with  uncertainty in model structure and input parameters.  ***",
