Raber    The National Research Council (NRC) requests partial core support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the continuing activities of the Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology (BCST) of the Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Applications.    As defined in its mission statement, the Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology is the recognized and respected body within the National Research Council that provides independent, objective information and recommendations in chemical sciences and technologies to the government to assure a sound basis for policy decisions.  Accordingly, the Board serves as the focal point within the National Research Council for concerns and issues effecting chemistry in its broadest sense.  To function effectively, the BCST must undertake extensive planning for potential studies, carry out oversight of ongoing activities, engage in private-sector fund raising, and maintain a broad effort to communicate with the  chemical sciences community.  All of these are core activities, for which costs cannot be charged to specific projects and which therefore require core funding.  The capacity to develop new projects, while paying costs partially or fully from core funds, greatly enhances the freedom and capacity of the BCST to act responsively and responsibly to important issues in the chemical sciences and technology.",
