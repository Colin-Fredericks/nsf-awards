These movements are produced within  the central nervous system by circuits of cells called  central pattern generators (CPGs).  Neurobiologists have  studied CPGs for several decades and have learned a great  deal about how these relatively limited circuits program  movements.  Recent research has shown that even simple  circuits are very flexible and can program a wide array of  related movements.  On a cellular level, this flexibility is  produced by neuromodulators, endogenous compounds that alter  the activity of individual CPG cells, and consequently alter  the output of the circuit.  This project describes the  distribution of neuromodulatory inputs (including serotonin,  dopamine, and two peptides)  and  investigates how these  compounds alter the motor program produced by the two CPGs.  Seven species (four from a single genus and three from  different genera) will be studied to determine how modulator  type, location, or function might change as species and  general evolve.  This systematic comparison of motor pattern  modulation in a set of closely related species is designed  to contribute to knowledge of neuromotor system evolution  and to the understanding of the coordination of simple  rhythmic movements.  Simple systems like the ones  investigated here are studied in the hope that the  underlying mechanisms discovered can be applied to more  complicated systems, such as those used in vertebrate  locomotor control, including the control of walking in  humans.",
