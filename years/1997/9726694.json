 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will investigate how modern  organizations, comprising interlocked   ensembles of people and information technologies, can be understood as `intelligent   organizations.`  As modern organizations redefine how they develop, process, and   assimilate information and manage knowledge, they are increasingly being conceived as   large-scale, distributed `cognitive' systems, with properties and processes such as   organizational memory, organizational learning, and organizational intelligence.  This   project aims to build an empirically-grounded framework and associated metrics for   understanding the phenomenon of organizational intelligence. The research will explore   ways to conceptualize and measure organizational intelligence, and will develop a sound   conceptual framework comprising variables that are related to organizational intelligence   and interrelationships among them. These variables will capture elements of organizational   structure, information technology and systems, culture, knowledge assets, stakeholder   relationships, and strategic processes. Both review and empirical methods including   interviewing will be used.  The resulting framework will form a basis for operationalizing   the concept of organizational intelligence, and for studying it widely with empirical   approaches. It  will provide and disseminate insights and conceptual tools upon which   other researchers can build.",
