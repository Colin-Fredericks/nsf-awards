 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Dynamics Program is supporting Jacob W. Petrich, Mark S.   Gordon, and George A. Kraus of the Department of Chemistry of Iowa State   University in their collaborative studies of excited-state proton   transfer in biomolecules.  Through a combination of ultrafast   spectroscopy, ab initio quantum chemical calculations, and synthetic   organic chemistry, they will develop an understanding of excited-state   proton transfer reactions.  Two model systems, 7-azaindole and hypericin,   form the focus of these studies.  Although excited-state proton transfer   plays a key role in each of these systems, they represent two very   different cases, in that the proton transfer is strongly mediated by   solvent in 7-azaindole, but only negligibly influenced by solvent in   hypericin.  The interplay between theory and ultrafast spectroscopy will   lead to revelation of the relative contributions of intra- and   intermolecular interactions in these proton transfer reactions.  Movement of positively-charged hydrogen ions (protons) from one atom to   another represents one of the simplest chemical reactions, yet such   reactions lie at the heart of an astounding variety of chemical and   biological processes.  In some cases, proton transfer may be initiated   through the action of light, which adds energy to (`excites`) the   molecule giving up the proton.  Despite their conceptual simplicity,   proton transfer reactions may in fact occur through rather complex   molecular-level processes.  These collaborators will examine two classes   of compounds displaying very different types of excited-state proton   transfer reactions.  One group of compounds, frequently used as probes of   enzyme structure and reaction chemistry, is influenced strongly by the   nature of the solvent in which the molecule is dissolved, while the   other, typified by hypericin, an intriguing compound which displays   anti-viral action when activated by light, is barely affected by the   solvent.  These studies will help to develop a molecular-level   understanding of these critical proton transfer processes.",
