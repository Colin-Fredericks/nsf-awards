The general theme of the meeting concerns the various aspects of interaction between function theory and scientific computation. The US delegation will consist of senior researchers as well as junior investigators, chosen so as to achieve a balance between these two areas.    This conference is the third in a series, following CMFT '89 held in Valparaiso, Chile and CMFT '94 held in Penana, Malaysia. Another common theme of these meetings is to foster the creation and maintenance of contacts between scientists from diverse cultures. This is also reflected in the location of the meeting. Cyprus is an ideal place, traditionally serving as a bridge between East and West.    The US delegation will include 5 new Ph.D.'s who hold great promise of becoming future leaders in these fields of mathematics.",
