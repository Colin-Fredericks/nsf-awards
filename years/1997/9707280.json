 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707280  Barpy    This is a Career Advancement Award for Women Scientists and Engineers.  Dr. Barry has been studying the structure and function of the photosynthetic water oxidizing complex (photosystem II).  She has used a variety of techniques to achieve her research goals, including EPR and infrared spectroscopies.  She has developed procedures to purify photosystem II from plants and cyanobacteria.  In addition, she has been studying site directed mutants, generated in photosystem II from a cyanobacterium that can be grown photoheterotrophically.  Dr. Barry will take a sabbatical leave in order to master the techniques of molecular biology and genetics, and will subsequently implement these techniques in her own laboratory.    Photosystem II is present in plants, green algae, and prokaryotic cyanobacteria.  The complex oxidizes water to oxygen.  An understanding of the mechanism by which this occurs requires a combination of techniques, providing information about the structures of the redox active tyrosines in photosystem II, as well as information about the structural changes that occur at the manganese containing active site.  Site directed mutagenesis can be used to assign spectral features to a particular residue in the enzyme.  Ultimately, this combination of techniques provides new insight into the structure and function of photosystem II.  ***",
