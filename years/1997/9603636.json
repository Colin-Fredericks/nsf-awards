 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603636  Grodzicker    The mollusc Aplysia, and a number of other  invertebrates, have proven extremely useful in  studies of basic cellular neurobiology and the  cellular basis of behavior and learning.  This  utility is due, at least in part, to the  extraordinarily large size of its nervous  system cells (some of which are almost a  millimeter in diameter) and the ability to  recognize these cells as unique individuals.  This tremendous experimental advantage has  allowed the investigation of individual cells,  their patterns of interconnections, modulation  of the strength of connections between cells,  and the relationship between these cellular  phenomena and behavior, learning and  development.  In 1988, Cold Spring Harbor  sponsored the first meeting devoted to work on  Aplysia.  Because of the success of this  meeting, we decided to convene at two to three-  year intervals at the Cold Spring Harbor  Laboratory and alternate there with the highly  successful Meeting on the Drosophila.  The  fifth meeting in April, 1995, drew over ninety  participants, and again was highly successful.  The proposed 1997 meeting will continue to  provide a format for discussing new methods and  findings that have emerged in the cell and  molecular biology of Aplysia.  The Meeting will  be concerned with different levels of analysis:  synaptic transmission; ion channels and channel  modulation; peptides and small molecule  transmitters; cell imaging; circadian rhythms;  neuronal circuitry and behavior, and learning.  A trend that was begun in the last meeting was  to include a variety of other model  invertebrate systems, which can provide  information complementary to that obtained with  Aplysia.  This very wellreceived change will be  implemented further in the next meeting, by the  inclusion, in each session of a number of  speakers who work with model systems such as  crayfish, leech, squid, Drosophila, Manduca and  C. elegans.  In addition, particular attention  will be given to the inclusion of junior   scientists and women scientists.  About 150  participants from approximately 60 laboratories  throughout the world are expected to attend.",
