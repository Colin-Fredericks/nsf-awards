The model builds on the SSI structure by starting with parents who are active in PALMS  District Leadership Teams for   Systemic Change (approximately 2900 parents).  These parents will have opportunities for additional training with materials such as Project PRISM, EQUALS, AAAS, etc.  These support the new State frameworks and assessments developed through he SSI, and are also in support of the high quality  curriculum materials recommended for implementation in schools.  Parents will then develop local plans for engaging other parents in their communities.  Materials will be developed, including a manual on How to Build Coalitions to Engage Community Members in Mathematics, Science, and Technology Reform.  In addition, materials will be developed and outreach activities will be conducted to include activities for parents and children (estimated to reach an additional 21,000 parents) held in nontraditional environments such as subways, laundromats, health clinics, and malls.    Products will include a manual on building coalitions to engage communities in supporting mathematics and science reform, and a collection of field-tested prototype outreach activities.   Findings will be disseminated through the Eisenhower Consortia, National PTA, Urban League, and National Council of  La Raza.",
