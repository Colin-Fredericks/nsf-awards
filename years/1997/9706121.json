 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kumar    The objective of the proposed research is to develop principles of large scale hydrologic response in different hydroclimatological regimes by coupling hydroclimatology and river basin dynamics.  This objective will be accomplished via three tasks:      Through joint analysis of the atmospheric-hydrologic cycle and streamflow develop parameterizations to link hydroclimatology  and basin response characteristics.  In this task we will: (I) Classify the entire US into homogeneous hydroclimatic regimes using a combination of atmospheric dynamics, and analysis of atmospheric moisture, wind velocity and temperature fields, and stramflow observations.  This also involves identifying parameters that describe the similarities and differences between these regimes.  (ii) Develop relationships between parameters characterizing the climatology and the basin response in each homogeneous regime.    Develop a non-dimensional formulation of large-scale basin response which explicitly incorporates the hydrolimatological influence and self-similarity of the three dimensional river networks.                                          In  this task we will (I) Incorporate hydroclimatological influence and the self-similarity of three dimensional river networks into the notion of hydrologic similarity and develop formulation of basin response in non-dimensional framework.  (ii) Identify the important parameters that control the similarities and differences in responses of two basins within and across hydroclimatogically homogeneous regimes, respectively, and examine the scales of their applicability Using high resolution digital elevation and streamflow data, perform validation studies in different hydrolimatic regimes.In this task we will: (i) Compare the basin response generated from the above formulations with the observed streamflows in the different regimes .  (ii) Study the scales of applicability of the non-dimensional formulations by using basins of various sizes (iii) Analyze the effectiveness of  the identified parameters that characterize the similarities between responses within homogeneous regimes and differences across them.    Model development and testing will be limited to basins in two to three homogeneous regimes for the duration of the proposal.",
