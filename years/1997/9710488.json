 "awd_abstract_narration": "Barbara McClintock was awarded the Nobel prize for her path breaking research that showed how genetic material moves easily from one chromosome to another, even from one organism to another of a very different kind.  Such insights are at the foundation of modern genetics research and technology, and with new bioengineering techniques exchanges of genetic material may be greatly accelerated.  This biography will demonstrate how McClintock's work on genetic exchange grew out of her studies of corn genetics, undertaken while she was a graduate student at Cornell University.  Through careful examination of course outlines, departmental records, evaluations, notebooks and other material, the book will trace the influence of advisors, colleagues, institutions, and cultural context on the development of McClintock's science.  The book that will result from this project will make McClintock's work, reputed to be very hard to understand, available to the thoughtful reader with a minimum of background in the biological sciences.  Readers of the book will include not only professional historians, philosophers, and sociologists of science, but also undergraduate students, graduate students, and members of the general public interested in understanding more about McClintock and her influence on the biological sciences.                                                      \u2563> &?\u2563>\u00a5 \u00ba?\u2551\u00c1 _\u00c1\u00c1\u00a5 \u2534\u2563\u00a5\u00a9 \u00a2\u00a5/>\u2524/\u255d\u2524 \u2551\u255d/\u2502\u00a5\u2563\u2502\u00c1\u00a2 ?\u00c2 \u00a2\u2502\u2563\u00c1>\u00a5\u2563\u00c2\u2563\u2502 \u2563>\u2557\u2510\u2563\u255d`  />\u2524    \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u255d\u00a9\u00c1\u00a5?\u255d\u2563\u2502/% \u00a2\u00a5\u255d/\u00a5\u00c1\u00c0\u2563\u00c1\u00a2 \u00a2\u2502\u2563\u00c1>\u00a5\u2563\u00a2\u00a5\u00a2 \u2510\u00a2\u00c1\u2524 \u2563> \u2502%/\u2563_\u00a2 _/,\u2563>\u00c0\u00a2 /\u2593?\u2510\u00a5 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2502?>\u00a5/_\u2563>/\u00a5\u2563?> \u2563> &?\u2563>\u00a5 \u00ba?\u2551\u00c1",
