 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619910  Reactive systems such as telecommunications systems, and  aircraft navigation systems interact continuously with their  environment and are usually safety critical. This has  created a demand for a rigorous framework for reasoning  about their correctness. Traditional formal methods for  ensuring system reliability perform a static analysis where  a high-level design is verified using techniques such as  theorem proving and model checking. Since actual systems are  much more complex than the verified abstraction, static  analysis is supplemented by testing and monitoring of the  implementation. This project will introduce rigorous  paradigms for the monitoring of reactive systems and use  them along with static analysis techniques to obtain  mathematical guarantees on the correctness of system  behaviors. It aims to extend two paradigms --- program  checking, which seeks to follow up each computation of a  program by a check that proves that the result is correct,  and conformance testing, which seeks to determine if an  implementation is correct by observing its input-output  behavior --- to the context of reactive systems. The project  will also explore distributed monitoring of distributed  reactive systems.  ***",
