 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618149  Vickers    Science that Counts in The Workplace is a physical science course embedded in workplace contexts that addresses the learning goals of the science standards and the goals of the school-to-career movement. The modular materials, emphasizing Industrial and Engineering Technologies, are particularly appropriate for career academies and high schools organized by career clusters.  The target audience is eleventh and twelfth grade students who have not tended to take a third year of science because they do not thrive on abstract science teaching.  The six modules can be used as a course or as drop-in units.  The contexts are taken from the design, manufacturing and maintenance of buildings, transportation systems and consumer goods.  The emphasis is on teaching science in the context of work rather than on delivering occupationally-specific  training.  Each group of lessons within a module begins with a workplace issue and maps backwards to develop an understanding of the underlying science and mathematics.  All students participate in common workplace experiences that take the form of field trips to job sites that give students experiences exploring and/or applying the science concepts and skills learned in the classroom.  The materials provide a hands-on, inquiry-rich pedagogy, providing a meaningful context for science learning that helps students understand that science learning is key to a variety of careers.  The materials support employees in industry to contribute more confidently and effectively to the education of students, serve as a model for developing academic curriculum embedded in workplace contexts and support high school reorganization.",
