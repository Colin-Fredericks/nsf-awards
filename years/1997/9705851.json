The primary tool is a relatively easily understood operator  which resembles a Hankel operator on a Hilbert space. It has been recently  demonstrated by the investigator and by other authors that these  Hankel-type operators often possess a wealth of information on the Banach  space structure of the function spaces they operate on. It seems likely  that these methods could yield solutions of some open problems concerning  bounded analytic functions on the unit ball in several complex variables  and extend the solutions to strictly pseudoconvex domains. Spaces of  uniformly convergent Fourier series on the unit circle and polydisk will  also be studied.    The goal of this project is to further understand the relatively new  techniques being used to solve difficult problems in a variety of areas of  the branch of pure mathematics known as analysis. These new techniques  involve the replacement of complex computational tools with methods that  are more abstract and theoretical in nature and are currently becoming more  and more popular due to the powerful results that can be achieved with  relatively little effort. The type of results we seek to obtain are less of  an exact, numerical nature, but deal more those problems that in all  likelihood could not be solved by computation. At the center of the  research is a tool, called a Hankel-type operator, developed by the  investigator in his thesis which has found an increasing number of  applications since his doctoral work. One target of these ideas would be  problems in harmonic analysis, or Fourier series. Fourier series are the  building blocks for the theory of wavelets, a fast growing area having  applications to numerous types problems such as data compression, voice  recognition, and so on. Another important component of the project will be  problems of analytic func tions in one and several complex variables.  Otherwise known as complex analysis, this area of mathematics is intimately  connected to harmonic analysis, mentioned above. The key feature of the  results being sought after in this project is the generality in which they  work and also, once the tedious theoretical foundations have been laid, the  ease in which they can be applied.",
