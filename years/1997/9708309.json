 "awd_abstract_narration": "In an urban cellular environment, the data pulses employed in digital  communications typically travel through multiple paths from transmitter to  receiver due to reflections from buildings and other structures.  This multipath  propagation causes each pulse to be corrupted by pulses transmitted before and  after it; the deleterious effects of this \"intersymbol interference\" (ISI)  necessitate signal processing in the form of an \"equalizer\".  As a further  complications, the projected explosion in the number of cellular users will  almost certainly require two users in the same of adjacent cells to occupy the  same frequency band.  This leads to \"co-channel interference\" that manifests  itself as cross-talk amongst users.  The use of antenna arrays, which enables  discrimination amongst signals arriving from different directions, offers a means  of suppressing co-channel interference.    This research focuses on the development of spatiotemporal signal processing  schemes to effect both equalization and interference cancellation for mobile  narrowband digital communications in an urban cellular environment.  The  equalizer design problem is reformulated as a convex optimization problem based  on linear matrix inequalities and solved numerically.  Equalization is effected  with sample-spaced taps at each antenna, encompassing a time duration roughly  equal to the multipath time delay spread.  This facilitates better tracking of  time-varying multipath channels as compared to conventional equalization schemes  employing symbol-spaced taps.  Interference cancellation is effected by forming  beams with directions of maximum gain steered towards the desired user's  multipath, and nulls steered towards strong co-channel interferers.  This is  achieved by processing a short training signal via a novel extended correlator  that highly localizes in time the contribution of the desired user's signal,  thereby allowing one to estimate the spatial correlation matrix of the  interferers.  The equalization an d interference cancellation schemes developed  in this research hold the greatest promise in terms of the trade-off amongst  convergence rate, computational complexity, robustness to model mismatch, and  symbol error performance for Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems where  the multipath time delay spread is less than the null-to-null mainlobe of the  pulse symbol waveform, as is the case with cellular systems based on the IS-136  TDMA standard.",
