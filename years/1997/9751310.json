 "awd_abstract_narration": "The new program in astronomy and astrophysics includes new courses, faculty, an observatory dome, and an astronomy laboratory in the newly renovated science buildings.  For the first time, an advanced course on astrophysics and an introductory astronomy laboratory are being offered.  In these courses, students are gaining experience in astronomical techniques, ranging from simple exercises to advanced experiments.  The success of the new astronomy program strongly depends on the quality of the projects that can be offered, which subsequently depend on the quality of instrumentation available.  The combination of a DFM 16'' f/8 Cassegrain telescope, SBIG ST-8 CCD imaging camera, high-resolution spectrograph, modern computer controls and operating systems, and data analysis software are making it possible for students to gain experience previously available only to students in large astronomy departments.  The DFM telescope has been specifically chosen for the observatory because it gives flexibility for instrumentation choices.  It is designed and installed for immediate maximum performance in pointing, guiding, and focusing, guaranteed for workmanship, and comes with remote observing equipment and a simple, user-friendly operating system.  Furthermore, the 16\" telescope is ideal for an urban location, since it has good light gathering capabilities for observing both bright and faint objects.  Sky brightness can also be subtracted in CCD exposures.  With a good CCD camera and high-resolution spectrograph, the department can provide a very wide range of introductory exercises and advanced experiments in astronomy, as well as independent research projects for the advanced students.  These observatory facilities also support projects and exercises in planetary geology, physical chemistry, electronics, and optics.",
