 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project seeks to develop organic light emitting diode (OLED) technology for low-power, low-cost displays.  A proprietary OLED technology, based on vacuum-deposited, small-molecule organic thin films, is widely recognized for excellent brightness and contrast, fast response time, high power efficiency at low operating voltage, and excellent reliability.  The proposer recently demonstrated a novel stacked OLED pixel architecture (SOLED) that achieves high-resolution, full color performance, where the red (R), green (G) and blue (B) sub-pixels are vertically positioned to emit any mixture of color and brightness.  To realize full commercial potential, however, significant research remains to be done to achieve saturated full-color.  The proposers intend to perform certain materials research and device structure optimization to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving saturated R-G-B spectral emission characteristics.  If successful, this research will provide the basis for high resolution, full-color displays in Phase II using photolithographic patterning techniques.         This technology has the potential to serve transportation, industrial, communications, computing and consumer electronics markets, including applications for personal digital assistants, projection displays, viewfinders in camcorders, video phones, hand-held computers, computer monitors, and, ultimately, the TV monitor on the wall.",
