 "awd_abstract_narration": "9720570  Robinson  Misfolding or misassembly of proteins is a major problem in  the biotechnology industry, in biochemical research, and in  human disease.  Folding problems limit production of  commercially important proteins, and existing methods of  recovering native protein from aggregates are often  inefficient and time-consuming.  Aggregation has also been  identified as the cause of a number of human diseases,  including cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, and prion  spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob  disease.  In order to address the aggregation problems in  production and to understand the molecular determinants that  drive aggregation in vivo and in vitro, the research plan is  to investigate the inhibition and reversal of protein  aggregation of P22 tailspike by application of hydrostatic  pressure.  The results obtained will serve as a foundation  for studying other important protein systems, of both  industrial and medical relevance.  ***",
