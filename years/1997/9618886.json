 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618886  Fernandez    Imperfect capital markets have long been acknowledged to be an obstacle to human capital accumulation.  This project seeks to examine some of the consequences of different allocation mechanisms and various education finance systems given these constraints.  The first part examines how tournaments (which can be thought of as examinations) and markets compare as allocation mechanisms in the presence of borrowing constraints.  This is a novel line of research.  While there has been work that examines how credit constraints may affect capital accumulation, the literature has mainly focused on how efficiency improvements maybe obtained via interventions that remain within a market system such as credit subsidies.  The choice of an allocative mechanisms, however, is also an important dimension of policy intervention and work by the investigator under her previous NSF grant shows that in education markets can be dominated by other mechanisms.    More specifically, the project investigates the efficiency properties of educational tournaments (examinations) relative to markets and the dependence of these properties on the initial income distribution and on the signaling power of the tournament.  The political economy of the different allocation mechanisms are also explored.  Endogenizing the supply side of the problem, establishing the micro-foundations for the credit constraints (and hence the interest rate), and studying the dynamic evolution of the system are all important directions in which this will be extended.  The project examines the mechanism design problem to see if there is some combination (perhaps income taxes and tournaments) that dominates both tournaments and markets.  The project also studies the effects on aggregate spending on public education and its distribution across districts of different financing systems.  Among the financing systems that will be examined are a foundation system, a power-equalizing system, a pure local system, and an equal-spending stat e financed system.  Each of these systems gives different incentives to redistribute income across communities and has different implications for total spending.  The model will be calibrated to some statistics generated by the experience of a state like California which went from a foundation system to an almost equal spending state financed system.",
