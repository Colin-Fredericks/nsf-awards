Specific applications will target shallow  water environments related to wetlands and shallow water  fisheries monitoring, coastal studies, monitoring of  environmental pollution due to industrial wastes, offshore  oilfield platform and pipeline inspection and maintenance.  An oil spill in wetlands is quite different from an ocean or  beach oil spill.  The swamps around river banks and bayous  are not easily accessible to any containment and remediation  process.  Further, the sinking oil in water, among weeds,  and in sediment materials make it more difficult to detect,  identify and confine.  In addition to the already mentioned  difficulties, it is not advisable to use humans for such  functions due to the hazardous nature of the tasks.  Thus, a  relatively inexpensive AUV equipped with the proper sensors  and controls may provide a viable alternative solution to  the problem.    The anticipated outcome of the meeting will be:              a clear understanding of the problem area (shallow         water environments),       derivation of operational and mission constraints, and       requirements and a suggested AUV architecture to build  such a vehicle.    Proceedings will be produced and distributed.  ***",
