 "awd_abstract_narration": "9753074  Hering  The \"provision of safe, palatable, and ample public water  supplies\", a core mandate of the environmental engineering  profession, has always been particularly challenging in the  arid southwestern United States.  In contrast to the past  focus on delivery of water, which has been manifested in the  western U.S. in massive hydraulics works, the present  regulatory climate emphasizes water quality.  Increasingly  stringent drinking water standards place an increased burden  on municipalities and water suppliers; this problem can be  particularly severe for groundwater systems, which have  traditionally required minimal treatment of source waters.  A specific example of this problem is provided by the City  of Hanford, CA population ca. 39,000), which relies on  groundwater for its municipal water supply.  Elevated  concentrations of arsenic occur naturally in the groundwater  at Hanford.  Arsenic concentrations in local wells  frequently exceed the current drinking water standard (50  g/L); compliance with the standard is achieved, in the  average, by dilution within the distribution system.    The proposed project will focus on the Hanford groundwater  supply system as a case study of the issues that are likely  to become increasingly prevalent in the future of water  supply in the U.S.  Specifically, the project will emphasize  the issues of risk estimation and compliance options within  the framework of both the regulatory drivers and the  physical constraints of the local hydrogeology and the  existing distribution system.  ***",
