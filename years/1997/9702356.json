This investigator's research  involves experimental studies to assist in development of  mathematical models that can be used to predict the behavior of  particles derived from weathering processes in colloidal aqueous  suspension and particles formed during water and wastewater  treatment processes.  The proposal leading to this award was  submitted in response to NSF 96-115, \"Faculty Early Career  Development (CAREER) Program.\"  As such, this award also provides  support for the continuation of this investigator's early  development as an educator.  Her education plan involves  developing new courses that emphasize mathematical modeling of  environmental systems, incorporation of research results into  courses, short courses for industrial researchers and  practitioners and student participation in experimental work at a  National Laboratory.    Results of this project are expected to provide insights into  sources and behavior of particles in natural waters.  The  mathematical models that result from this research may find use  in engineering design of processes to remove particles from  suspension in water, treatment of wastewater prior to discharge  to the environment and in processes for deliberate manufacture of  particles.  ***",
