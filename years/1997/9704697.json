 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is a two-year effort to develop and apply techniques based on formal methods to the writing of reliable programs for solving scientific problems on high-performance parallel computers.  Previous work has demonstrated the practical value of an approach to parallel application development based on (1) a formally-specified programming model and a development methodology based on semantics-preserving transformations, and (2) abstractions (\"archetypes\") that capture the commonality of classes of programs with similar structure and encapsulate the details of the parallel code.  An important aspect of this work is that, while it provides a sound theoretical framework for developing and reasoning about parallel programs, it need not require application developers to develop formal proofs; once a transformation rule is stated and proved, its application during program development can be carried out informally.  Previous work by the PI has provided a simple and flexible theoretical framework for addressing questions of modularity and program composition in parallel programs.  Building on these two areas of work, a theoretical framework is proposed for reasoning about modularity and composition in parallel programs.  The PI will use this framework to develop techniques that will assist application developers in writing reliable parallel programs, and will validate the usefulness of these techniques by applying them to selected real-world applications in computational science and engineering.",
