 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop fast mapping tools and architectures for  logic emulations that can greatly reduce the mapping time, and thus improve the  usefulness of logic emulation, and the speed of logic simulation.  Being  developed are: 1) technology mapping tools that integrate decomposition and  covering, and 2) placement tools that use partitioning methods to do higher-  quality global placement.  These are designed to improve both the mapping times  and resulting quality for FPGA-based implementations.  Routing complexity  estimators are also being developed to guide algorithm choice.  These exploit the  mapping time-quality tradeoffs in many techniques.  Also being investigated are  new FPGA architectures for logic emulators, and systems that can support much  faster mapping times, yet still achieve high quality results.  These steps are  being integrated into a complete mapping-time oriented tool suite for logic  emulation which exploits the mapping time/quality tradeoff in these systems.",
