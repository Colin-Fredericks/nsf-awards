In spin-Peierls systems,  the  experiments  will  provide a detailed picture of the magnetic field induced soliton  lattice phase  as well as the critical behavior near the commensurate-  incommensurate   transition. In the manganites, a recently  discovered  insulator-metal  transition that can be induced by a magnetic field as  well  as  exposure  to x-rays will be investigated, and its  potential  for  applications in x-ray lithography will be evaluated. In addition,  possible  magnetostructural   transitions  will  be  explored  in  new  materials, including charge density wave, spin density wave and  spin-  ladder systems.  %%%  This is a renewal project to  study  novel phases of solids induced by  magnetic fields in a unique facility designed for x-ray diffraction in  intense magnetic fields. These experiments are of fundamental as  well  as  long-term technological interest. From a fundamental  perspective,  our  understanding of magnetic interactions in metals and  insulators,  especially the roles of dimensionality and disorder, will be  advanced  by focusing on the coupling between the magnetic order and the crystal  structure in various materials. An improved understanding of  magnetic  field  induced transitions may also lead to a variety of applications,  for instance in high-density  magnetic storage; of particular interest  are  recently  discovered   insulator-metal transitions  in  manganese  oxides that can be induced  by magnetic fields as well as exposure  to  x-rays.  ***",
