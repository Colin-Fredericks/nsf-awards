 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer-aided design tools and rapid prototyping methodologies are no longer considered exotic in nature but, rather, fundamental concepts of the engineerilg profession.  These tools enhance, rather than supplant, a sound theoretical background.  Students in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department receive this sound theoretical background but had not received the practical background necessary to bridge the gap between education and industrial practice.  This bridge is particularly necessary at the university, where more than 40 percent of the ECE undergraduate students are part-time students who have full-time industrial jobs.  In these jobs, students are already contributing to the field in their roles as technicians, engineering assistants, and cooperative education students.    An informal survey of high technology companies in the area shows an apparent consensus for an increased emphasis on teaching computer-aided design techniques at universities.  At the same time the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) is calling for the inculcation of design content throughout the undergraduate engineering curriculum.      The rapid prototyping facility that this project provides meets the needs of the industrial and accreditation requirements.  The capability is used in multiple undergraduate courses, including the computer engineering senior capstone sequence, and in undergraduate research.  *",
