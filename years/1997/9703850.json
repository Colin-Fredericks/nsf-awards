 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703850  Ablowitz    Research involving a class of physically significant nonlinear systems   arising in the study of nonlinear wave motion is proposed.  Included in the   studies are a new class of localized multidimensional solutions which can   be related to a topological number; i.e. an index or winding number.    Associated with the self dual Yang-Mills equations is a novel class of   nonlinear ordinary differential equations, referred to as Darboux-Halphen   (DH) type systems. These equations can be integrated by associating them   with, and analyzing, certain linear monodromy problems. The linear   problems have monodromy data which are evolving.  The solutions of DH   systems can be extremely complicated, exhibiting natural boundaries and   dense branching in the complex plane.  In special cases the solutions are   expressed in terms of automorphic functions.  Frequently researchers use   numerical simulation to obtain approximations to solutions of nonlinear   wave equations. Research by the PI and collaborators has demonstrated that   computational chaos can be induced from truncation and roundoff errors.   Use of integrable systems is extremely important since analytical results can   be compared with numerical simulation.    The study of nonlinear wave equations has wide ranging applications in   physics and engineering. Intimately related to the studies in this proposal is   a class of equations, called integrable systems.  The mathematics of   integrable systems and their solutions have been shown to play an important   and fundamental role in our understanding of a variety of real world   phenomena.  Integrable systems usually admit a special class of extremely   stable, localized wave solutions, referred to as solitons, which arise   frequently in physical contexts. For example, in the study of fluid dynamics,   huge soliton internal ocean waves, sometimes a mile in length, and   hundreds of feet in amplitude, have been located in many parts of the ocean;   e.g. near the coast of  Oregon. Such waves can be devastating to anything   caught in their path, hence knowledge of where such internal solitons are   located in the ocean is of interest. Another application of solitons is in the   study and designing of efficient long distance communication systems.   Solitons eliminate the need for electronic signal regenerators which can   seriously inhibit data rates. Researchers have used solitons successfully in   the laboratory and currently they are being used in prototype   communication systems. It may well be that future high data rate   communications systems will be designed to propagate multiple soliton   waves.",
