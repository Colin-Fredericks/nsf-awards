 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701135  Hillis  One of the more puzzling genetic questions is how clonal species maintain themselves through time.  Gynogenetic species are clonal animals that face an obstacle to long-term persistence because reproduction is dependent on males of another species.  A gynogenetic species cannot persist in isolation; it must coexist with another species whose males it is capable of parasitizing behaviorally.  However, simple population models of such interactions predict that gynogenetic species should rapidly become extinct.  The existence of gynogenetic species indicates that these models are an insufficient description of reality.  One factor that would allow the persistence of the gynogenetic species is frequency-dependent behavior.      This investigation will examine frequency-dependent behaviors and their role in the maintenance of gynogenetic species.  A mathematical model will be constructed that incorporates frequency-dependent mate selection, and then the model will be tested using two species of poeciliid fish: the gynogenetic specie and the species upon which it depends.    The model will establish the levels of frequency-dependent mating that theoretically can result in a stable equilibrium of a gynogenetic species and the species upon which it depends.  The experiments will determine if mate selection is frequency-dependent and if frequency-dependence is great enough to explain the coexistence of gynogenetic species and the species they parasitize.",
