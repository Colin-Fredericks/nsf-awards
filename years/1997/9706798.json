 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706798  Harper    The incorporation of ophiolotic rock assemblages  that are believed to have formed on the ocean floor is a tenacious problem that continues to defy solution.  However, some of them can be used to reconstruct the oceanic environment in which they formed. In such cases they can contribute greatly to understanding the tectonic processes that lead to their incorporation  into upper crustal sedimentary assemblages. Harper's study using geochemistry, geochronology, sedimentary provenance and field structure  is a well defined one that will address these questions  in the Coast Range ophiolites in southwestern Oregon. His analytical methods  are varied, and the results will bear on the origin of this ophiolite sequence and on its relationship to other ophiolites in several structural belts in California.",
