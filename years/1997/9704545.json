 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds for modest travel awards to graduate students in logic in support of their participation in the Annual Meeting and the European Summer Meeting (Logic Colloquium) of the Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL).  The NSF funds supplement ASL funds which are already being used in this way.  Any student who is at an advanced stage of a PhD program in logic will be eligible for support; efforts will be made to encourage participation by women and minorities.  These awards are aimed at two goals: (a) to ensure that graduate students in logic have good opportunities to participate actively in the profession at an early moment, in order to enrich their educational experience; (b) to strengthen the two main annual meetings of the Association for Symbolic Logic, which are key professional meetings in the field, by increasing the number of graduate students who are able to attend.",
