 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    DMR-9627161           Miller    The role of valence electron concentration (vec = electron/atom ratio) to influence structure  is well documented for Zintl phases (valence compounds of electropositive metals with  post-transition elements: covalent networks and cages involving two-center two-electron  bonds) and Hume-Rothery phases (intermetallic compounds of late and post-transition  elements: dense packings involving \"metallic\" bonds). Zintl phases occur for vec > 4 (based  upon the network of post-transition elements) and Hume-Rothery phases are observed for vec  ~ 2. To date, there is no systematic investigation of the broad region in vec between these two  extremes. Since the two established compound classes show dramatic differences in structural  principles and electronic properties, studies involving compounds with vec in the intermediate  regime will provide a means of examining the transformation from one class to the other.  This research involves the synthesis and detailed characterization of ternary compounds in-  volving (i) an electropositive alkaline earth or rare earth metal; (ii) either a late transition  metal, i.e. groups 8-12 elements or one of either Li or Mg; and (iii) a group 13 element (Al,  Ga, In), called \"trielides,\" in order to probe materials with vec between two and four by  tuning the electron count. Synthetic strategies will include high temperature methods  (arc-melting) and using metallic fluxes. Products will be examined for their crystal structure,  composition, and physical properties. In particular, X-ray and neutron diffraction, electron  microscopy, thermal analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrical resistivity, and  magnetic susceptibility measurements will be utilized. Later stages of this investigation will  involve the incorporation of boron, carbon, and nitrogen into these intermetallics. In addition  to these experimental approaches, theoretical methods will be applied to investigate the  valence electron distribution in thes e systems as the vec changes. Specifically, relationships  between these solids and molecular analogues, e.g., ranging from metallocarborane  deltahedra to Zintl-type anionic cages, will be explored. Semiempirical electronic structure  calculations will be used to examine the ternary systems under study, with the aspirations of  adapting the LMTO calculations to these complex systems.   %%%  This investigation represents the first concerted effort of experiment and theory to perform a  systematic examination of compounds linking complex intermetallics with complex valence  compounds. The ternary compounds in this investigation may show high electrical conductivities  coupled with regions of strong covalent bonding. Therefore, these materials may offer potential  applications as high temperature metals, or may provide a means of studying either strengthening  or embrittlement mechanisms in intermetallics.",
