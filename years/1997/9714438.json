 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of   Notre Dame supports the research of Professor Marya Lieberman.  The   research focuses on crosslinking reactions applied to the synthesis and   analysis of layered materials.  Initial studies are carried out with   layered metal organophosphonates and organophosphates, which consist of   layers of metal phosphonate connected by layers of organic spacer   molecules.  Each organic spacer is synthetically modified to include a   photochemically- or electrochemically-activated crosslinker, whose   function is to connect a known number of adjacent molecules in a specific   manner.  The modified spacers are mixed with appropriate metal salts to   form layered materials.  Activation of the crosslinker forms molecular   adducts trapped within the layered material.  The study of crosslinking   chemistry leads to information on defects, structural rearrangements, and   possible metastable materials.  This research advances fundamental understanding of the synthesis and   structure of layered materials by developing crosslinking reactions as an   analytical and a synthetic tool that can be applied to molecular   monolayers on surfaces and inside layered materials.",
