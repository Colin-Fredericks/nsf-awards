 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops a novel database system architecture that efficiently supports queries over rich data   types like multi-media, time-series, matrices, and documents. Complex data types are modeled as   Enhanced Abstract Data Types (E-ADTs), which are software modules with a common interface. While   the uniform interface leads to extensibility, it also exposes semantic information that can be used for query   optimization. The E-ADT architecture is demonstrated through the development of the PREDATOR   database system. The project studies optimizations that are essential to efficiently support each data type,   and extensions of these techniques across multiple data types. While initial results demonstrate major   performance improvements compared to existing database systems, several issues are being explored   further. What should be the contents of a toolkit for data type development? Can the mechanism for   extensible types be extended to implement a heterogeneous database system? How does one build an   extensible database system in a Web environment? The project is developing solutions to all these issues   and demonstrating them in PREDATOR. The educational goal of the project is to provide a freely   available, full-function, modern database system for the database community to use for educational and   research purposes. To this end, the code base of PREDATOR is being released, and the functionality of   the system is being augmented with many standard database features. This project has the potential to   change the fundamental architecture of the next generation of object-relational systems, with applications   ranging from geographic information systems to multimedia databases.",
