The McIDAS program has initiated much interest in weather phenomena, especially of the Caribbean region, amongst the students and faculty.  In the fall of 1997 the present UNIDATA facilities will be moved to a new larger location.  While UNIDATA software currently runs on a loaned computer, students and facilty need their own UNIX workstations.  The University of Puerto Rico has committed matching funds to supply the necessary number of PCs which will be networked to the workstation and provide students with a unique experience to study meteorological phenomena.  A large number of students are expected to take this landmark course in meteorology which should build the necessary human resources to lead Puerto Rico in atmospheric research and teaching.",
