 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program with a contribution for instrumentation from the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities supports research on transition metal   aryloxides by Dr. Ian P. Rothwell, Department of Chemistry, Purdue   University.   Titanium aryloxides are catalysts for regio- and   stereoselective coupling of unsaturated organic molecules.  Cyclodienes   and various olefins and alkynes have been shown to undergo this type of   reaction.  Here the synthetic usefulness of the reaction will be   exploited and the mechanism that controls product geometry will be   determined.  In addition, low valent tungsten aryloxides will be tested   as 4-electron reducing agents.  A newly developed ligand,   2,6-diphenol-3,5-di-tert-butylphenol, will be used to synthesize high   valent early transition metal organometallic compounds and highly   electrophilic, low coordination transition metal compounds.  In contrast   to analogous ligands used in the past, this ligand does not undergo   metalation.  Chelation via ortho-phenyl substitutents within these   ligands opens the door for investigation of new types of metal-arene   bonding and reactivity, including CH-bond activation and stereospecific   coupling.  Sterically bulky groups bound to transition metals are often effective in   preventing reactants of certain size and shape from accessing the metal   center.  As a consequence, the reactions that do occur produce products   with a preferred geometry.  In this study, bulky alkoxide groups will be   used to effect stereospecific reactivity to some titanium- and   tungsten-promoted reactions of utility in the synthesis of organic   compounds.",
