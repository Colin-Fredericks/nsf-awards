 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704852  Parter    These investigations will focus on three specific projects:  (1) First Order   Systems Least Square (FOSLS) methods with a special emphasis on   problems in elasticity, (2) the general over-lapping grid problem, and (3)   preconditioning strategies for Spectral Collocation Methods. At this time   computational methods for problems in elasticity are primarily based on   mixed methods which lead to indefinite problems which have proven   difficult to solve.  The FOSLS approach leads to large systems which are   generally much easier to solve.  However, despite the efforts of several   independent groups, a useful FOSLS  formulation of the elasticity problems   for general boundary conditions is still a major problem.  The overlapping   grid method has proven itself an effective tool for problems set in regions   with complicated geometry.  Further, the analysis of these methods has been   lacking until a recent breakthrough for difference equations of positive type.   Since there are limitations on the order of accuracy of such difference   methods there is a need for further analysis. Spectral Collocation methods   are extremely accurate and very badly conditioned.  Hence preconditioning   strategies are essential. There are over twenty-five years of experience and   study of preconditioning methods. And, still, there is a need for better   approaches.  Moreover, the mathematical justification for some of these   methods is incomplete.    The basic theme of this research can be stated simply \"Find effective   numerical methods to solve the important boundary-value problems of   mechanics and material science, and provide mathematical proofs of their   validity.\"  In the problems of elasticity most of the methods now in use are   expensive to implement.  Hence, a new formulation is sought which will   provide accurate approximations which can be computed at a reasonable   cost. In the other two cases one is dealing with established methods which   are either difficult to impleme nt or whose mathematical basis is incomplete.   This research is aimed at a more complete mathematical understanding   which will both clarify the existing methods and provide a basis for the   development of new, more effective methods.",
