The focus is on the processes and techniques of successful materials-centered instructional development and effective dissemination and implementation.  The book is suitable for professional development seminars for instructional materials developers and associated professionals as well as school, university, and private sector groups and governmental and private agencies that provide financial support for materials development.  Highly successful instructional materials development projects can be found in settings as diverse as small colleges, independent research and development organizations, professional societies, and school systems and are led by scientists, engineers, and others with widely different educational backgrounds.  The investigation looks at examples of all such efforts and isolates the important characteristics of successful projects.",
