 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to conduct a pair of linked conferences on the topic of modelling in science,  focussing on modelling in the biological, physical, statistical and cognitive sciences.  The  general orientation used is an `inside-out` approach, whereupon speakers who are established  modellers in their fields will present their perspectives on what is central to modelling in their  fields.  The first conference will emphasize general methodological aspects of modelling, while  the second will look more closely at specific applications.    To promote dialog, the conference organizers will circulate brief summaries of  contemporary views prior to the conferences.  A Web site and a discussion board will be  maintained on which synopses of papers will be posted and comment will be encouraged.  The  central, long-term goals are to foster a research community in the U.S. on methods of modelling  and to promote links with European philosophers of science actively working on related topics.  One conference will be held in Charlottesville, Virginia, in October 1997, and another  will be held in Chicago, Illinois, in March 1998.",
