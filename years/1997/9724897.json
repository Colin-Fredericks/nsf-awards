 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cooperating Hampton Roads Organizations for Minorities in   Engineering (CHROME) network of community organizations,  founded  in 1983, impacts students in elementary, middle and high school.   This proposal does a fine job of outlining how CHROME meets each  criteria while specifically highlighting CHROME activities and  successes.  As a result of it clubs throughout the K-12 school  system, this program is able to \"follow through\" with youngsters  and offer a variety of support and activities.   As a result,  CHROME claims \"virtually all students who remain\" in the program  graduate high school.  CHROME claims 95 percent of its club members  go to college and 80 percent major in SMET or related fields proven  by  conducting a follow-up survey with alumni and maintaining a   database.  CHROME's ability to track students demonstrates how the  program has made a difference in students graduating, going to  college and choosing majors in SMET fields.  While this program  mostly benefits African American students, there are a number of  other minorities who participate in the program including Hispanic,  Asian/Filipino, and Native American students.  The strengths of the  nominee include:        .  Sixty community organizations working together providing            outstanding programs for youth and students.    .  Constant communication to keep individuals informed by             providing information online.    .  Provides training for teachers and counselors to be             effective leaders of local clubs through a variety of summer        training programs.    .  Excellent outreach structure.    .  Provides internships through its business members, holds            educational forums, funds scholarships, and tracks       participants.        In summary, CHROME is a comprehensive community networking   effort that goes beyond establishing mentoring relationships   between senior and junior individuals.  The program's activities  sustain encouragement for SMET disciplines from elementary schoo l  through high school.  It trains teachers and counselors to  encourage students to pursue careers in technical fields,  establishes and sustains partnerships among business corporations,  higher education institutions, and government agencies plus  supports community educational improvements in science,  mathematics, and engineering areas.  It even brings parents into  the picture by offering them workshops with themes such as \"How to  Rear an Engineer\" or \"Preparing for College.\"",
