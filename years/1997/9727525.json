 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manteuffel   9727525           The researcher and his colleagues organize a conference   devoted to iterative methods for the solution of linear and   nonlinear systems of equations.  Particular themes are   nonsymmetric linear systems, globally convergent algorithms for   nonlinear systems, algorithms of optimal order of work, saddle   point problems, and applications on multiprocessor computer   architectures.        The mathematical description of real-world problems leads   inevitably to equations to solve.  Many times the equations are   nonlinear ones, arising because the underlying problem is   nonlinear.  Often, however, the original problem is linear and   the mathematical equations are too.  Such problems arise in all   areas of science and technology, and are of special interest in   biology, materials, environmental studies, and manufacturing.     Progress in these areas requires solution of more comprehensive   modeling equations --- such models are usually more nonlinear   than simpler models ---, or more accurate solution of existing   models --- increasing the size of the numerical problem to be   solved.  In certain problems, notably in fluid flow and in   elasticity, computational methods for the equations describing   the phenomena yield numerical systems having a saddle point;   the solution is on a surface that looks locally like a saddle.   Computational methods for such problems offer special   difficulties.  The conference addresses advances in algorithms   to deal with larger numerical systems, nonlinearities, the   amount of time and work needed to get a solution, saddle points,   and the use of multiprocessor computers.",
