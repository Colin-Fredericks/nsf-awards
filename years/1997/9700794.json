Feldman, for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, \"High-Performance Digital Electronics Using Superconducting Integrated Circuitry Technology.\"  This project is aimed toward students who seek careers in both the superconductor and semiconductor integrated circuitry industry.  The superconducting electronics \"industry\"  is still quite small, limited to specialized niche applications, however superconducting electronics provides an ideal training ground for engineers preparing to join the forefront of semiconductor electronic and integrated circuitry technology; the design principles and testing methodology employed in superconducting circuitry development will clearly have a growing importance to semiconductor technology as current trends toward faster and lower power semiconductor circuits continue.  A two-semester lecture/laboratory course will be developed for Senior undergraduate and beginning graduate students.  Superconducting digital electronics is presently practiced at a modest level of integration, thousands of active elements, so that students may manage the entire development and testing of a superconducting integrated circuit with state-of-the-art performance.",
