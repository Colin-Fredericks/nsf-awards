 "awd_abstract_narration": "9509020        Stiglich        This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will design and  construct an improved, optimized machine that will produce nanoparticles of alloys and  dispersed phase composites using electrodes of inexpensive normal grain size materials, opposed  electrodes of different materials or braided wire electrodes. The feasibility of producing  nanoparticles of iron and nickel aluminides as well as Ta (tantalum), W (tungsten), and W-2%   ThO2 (thorium oxide) was demonstrated  during Phase I by using equipment that was adapted based on pulsed reactive electrode (PRE) technology. The machine will have much greater control over the process parameters, and hence, the final size of the nanoparticles produced. A secondary objective of Phase II will be to  increase production rates from g/hr to kg/day, typically 5-10 Kgs of nanopowder per 8 hr shift, thus demonstrating a prototype production capability scaleable to a full size commercial process in Phase III. The redesigned machine will be used to produce intermetallic nanoscale powders  such as a and y titanium aluminides and molybdenum di sulphide (MoSi2 )- both pure and in  composite form with refractory metal (e.g. Nb (niobium), Ta) dispersed phases. The addition of reactive gases to the particle production process can cause formation of carbides, nitrides, and borides  thus creating unique nanocomposites.          A potentially large application area exists for MoSi2 based nanomaterials in the Kiln/                                             incinerator/metallurgical furnace industries. A significant retrofit business has been identified for converting from direct fired rotary kilns and calciners to indirect fired systems. Additionally, automotive manufacturers such as GM and Ford are interested in connecting rods, hollow shafts, and fan blades from TiAl.",
