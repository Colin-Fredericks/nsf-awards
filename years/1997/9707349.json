 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707349  Nordell  One of the most important decisions that an animal must make  during it's  lifetime is determining which individual(s) to choose as a  mate.  This  decision is often made by the female since she usually  incurs the higher  cost in reproduction and is therefore very choosy in her  selection of a  mate.  The mate will provide genetic material for the  offspring and  perhaps other resources as well (such as food, care,  defense, etc.)  therefore it is important to choose the best possible  individual.  How do  individuals decide who to mate with?  The mate choice  decision involves a  decision about which individuals to reject and which  individuals to select  as mates.  This research will address the question of how  individuals  assess the quality of potential mates.  Prior theoretical  work assumes  that females can perfectly assess the quality of potential  mates and that  they should mate with the first male whose quality is  greater than the  expected quality of future potential males (One-Step  decision rule).  However, empirical studies often find that females sample n  males and then  select the one of the highest quality (Best-of-n decision  rule).  One  explanation for the discrepancy between theoretical  predictions and  observed behavior is that females can not perfectly assess  the quality of  potential mates.  This research will specifically address  the ability of  female guppies to discriminate between pairs of males that  differ only  slightly in their quality.  This research will allow a  better  understanding of the discriminatory ability of individual  female guppies  and therefore their mate choice decision process.  Understanding how  animals make mate choice decisions is an important aspect of  the  management and conservation of species.",
