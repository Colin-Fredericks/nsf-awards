Most recent attention, however, has  focused on the role of female preference for male ornaments.  One model regarding how such traits and preferences can  begin to co-evolve is pre-existing bias. According to models  of pre-existing bias, female preference predates the trait.  The reasons such biases may exist are numerous, such as, a  bias may be related to some other context (i.e. feeding) or  to some means of nonspecific evaluation or due to some bias  that no longer extant.  Any trait that arises that can take  advantage of such a bias would be selected.  Though such  biases are demonstrated in females of many species,  contributing to the exaggerated and maintenance of male  traits, it has not been examined whether males may also have  such biases.  This study will examine whether the males of  one group may have pre-existing biases (in addition to the  females) which has contributed to the exaggeration of a  sexually selected trait.  Intra-sexual selection due to pre  existing biases may play an important role in the  exaggeration of male traits, but have not been previously  examined.  Positive results from the proposed work would  suggest that students of sexual selection should reexamine  the role of male-male competition in the evolution of male  traits.",
