 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is aimed to develop a novel 3-D surface contouring system which can be used for industrial inspection and reverse engineering purposes.  The system is based on the full-field fringe projection technique, with a digital fringe projection system for rapid, automated surface contouring.  The planned research tasks include: digital fringe creation and projection, adaptive fringe projection, phase-shifting and fringe-ordering, calibration and error compensation, and on-the-object error mapping.  The technology goal is to enable high-accuracy, high-resolution contouring with abilities for fast and accurate location of defects.   There are many challenging issues in the proposed development, adaptation and integration of novel technology components for a 3-D surface contouring system.  The system, if successfully developed, has many advantages compared with the coordinate measuring machines and mechanical checking fixtures presently used in the automotive, aerospace, semiconductor, and other industries.",
