In  recent  years,  the study of relaxation and diffusion has grown  and  become  interdisciplinary in nature  with  involvement  from  colleagues in condensed matter physics, chemistry,  chemical  engineering  and  materials science and engineering.   Rapid  developments  across many areas in this  vast  field  on  an  international  level make it profitable  to  bring  together  researchers  from  around the world to  discuss  the  recent  advances,  explore  new  ideas, promote  collaborations  and  stimulate  future research.  The Conference at  Vigo,  Spain  (June  30  - July 11, 1997) is organized to follow two  very  successful  previous meetings.  The meeting is supported  by  several  agencies of Spain, by the Max Planck  Institut  fur  Polymerforschung-Mainz  and the Naval  Research  Laboratory.  Application is made to NSF for a grant to support  partially  the travel expenses of American colleagues, particularly the  young investigators.  %%%  The  main  objective  of this International  Meeting  is  to  discuss  the  current important issues  in  the  studies  of  relaxations  in  complex materials and systems.   Scientists  with  backgrounds  as  varied as condensed  matter  physics,  statistical mechanics, physical chemistry, materials science  and   engineering,  glass  science,  polymer   science   and  engineering,  metallurgy, thermodynamics and  rheology  will  have the opportunity to discuss critical issues which impede  progress  in  this  vast interdisciplinary  research  field.  Following  the tradition of the past two Meetings (Heraklion  1990,  Alicante  1993),  the conference  will  cover  recent  advances in relations in the following areas:  a)  Theories and models of  relaxation  b)  Computer simulations  c)   Glass  transition, relaxations in supercooled  liquids,  glasses, co lloids and melts  d)   Relaxations  in polymers, physical aging,  plastization  and antiplastization  e)   Polymer  dynamics  on  surface,  at  interface  and  in  confined spaces  f)   Viscoelastic  and rheological properties  of  polymers,  solutions, ionomers,       polyelectrolytes, copolymers and blends  g)  Polymer diffusion  h)   Solid  State  Ionics, conductivity and NMR  relaxation,  ionic diffusion  i)     Structural  relaxations  of  electronic  and  optical  materials, gels and ceramics  j)   Dielectric studies  k)  Optical and laser relaxation spectroscopy  l)   NMR, X-ray and neutron scattering  ***",
