 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research collaboration project between NCR-9714702, Jaime B. Kim,  California State University, Northridge, and NCR-9714700, W. Melody Moh, San Jose State University, aims to study traffic management in wireless ATM  networks.  It includes the following two phases:    PHASE 1: BASIC TRAFFIC CONTROL     In this initial  phase, we will focus on two basic traffic management issues for wireless ATM networks:    1.  Admission Control   We propose to develop admission control schemes which can provide a high degree of QoS guarantee for the multimedia traffic carried in micro-cellular, wireless  ATM  networks.  The proposed schemes can also adapt to the changing network conditions by constantly monitoring current network traffic load and adjusting the amount of reserved bandwidth.    2. Multicasting Flow Control   We propose two new branch-point control  mechanisms:  the  ISQ (Ignore the Slow reQuests) and the WS (Weighted Sum) schemes.  Both schemes can be readily  applied  to the  existing multicasting  ABR flow control mechanisms, most of which adopt the LSQ (Listen to the Slowest  reQuests) principle.  We also propose two complete multicasting flow control mechanisms for non-real-time traffic, each  includes specific controls  at switches, branch-points, destinations, as well as the source.    PHASE 2: INTEGRATED AND EXTENSION OF BASIC TRAFFIC CONTROL      This phase will focus on integration of basic traffic control mechanisms to achieve the ultimate goal of a complete traffic management scheme.  For this purpose, extensions on basic traffic control projects of Phase 1 will be carried out in the following directions:    1. End-to-end admission control for multicasting connections  2. Multicasting flow control for real-time traffic  3. Integrated traffic management by combining admission  control,     dynamic bandwidth allocation, and flow control    For each of the sub-projects in both phases, we have identified research issues  for  investigation  and presented analytical and simulation me thods.  We believe that the proposed research is vital to the next generation of broadband wireless networks.",
