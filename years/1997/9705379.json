 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Jonathan Kenoyer, Mr. Kildo Choi will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze several large samples of fossilized mid-Pleistocene bone from Java to search for traces of human butchering marks. He will also conduct actualistic studies to determine the cutmark signatures different raw materials which are available on the island cause on fresh bone. The research is directed at a major anthropological enigma. Archaeologists know that hominids first produced stone tools over two million years ago and these virtually indestructible objects have been recovered in many parts of the world. Although they do not always co-occur in the same site, areas which contain early human remains are usually rich in stone tools which served a number of functions. Java is a very interesting exception. Homo erectus, early hominid remains have been discovered at a number of sites in Java. However stone tools of similar antiquity appear to be lacking. Several reasons - none supported by strong data - have been suggested for this. It has been argued that the people subsisted primarily on soft vegetable foods and did not have a need for stone tools. Others have proposed that bamboo, which retains a sharp edge and is still used today, served the needed cutting function. It is also possible, although unlikely, that no tools were used at all.   Mr. Choi has examined faunal remains, some associated with the hominids themselves, and found evidence of what he believes are cut marks on the bones. When bones lie on the ground for significant periods of time, they acquire abrasions and scratches through natural means. Many experimental archaeologists argue however that humanly induced cut marks can be distinguished from these other phenomena. In a preliminary study Mr. Choi has found, what he believes to be evidence of such cut marks. If such marks do exist, they argue strongly for the presence of tools. In a first phase of the current study Mr. Choi will use types of stone which are locally available, as well as bamboo, to butcher animals. He will observe through low power as well as scanning electron microscopy the marks which are recorded on the bone. With these controlled data in hand, he will then examine large series of Pleistocene faunal remains which have been recovered on the island.  This research is important because it will address one of the major anomalies in the archaeological record. It will shed new light on the cultural abilities of early hominids and assist in training a promising young scientist.",
