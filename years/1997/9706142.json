 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706142  Schoonen  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  use the sulfur oxyanion speciation of hydrothermal   solutions   and   acid   crater   lakes   as  indicators  of magmatic-hydrothermal  and  volcanic processes.    The effort will focus on two  processes:  1) sulfur hydrolysis and 2) the changes in S-speciation in acid  crater  lakes  due  to  the  discharge  of  H2S  and SO2 gas.  Sulfur hydrolysis  may  be  important  in  (1) hydrothermal systems as a source of sulfate  where  native  sulfur  occurs  in  the subsurface (e.g., as buried solfataras); and (2)  in crater lakes where the  sulfur oxyanion speciation during  quiescent  times  is likely to be controlled by colloidal sulfur or pools  of  molten  sulfur.   Upon increased activity, crater lakes act as a scrubber  of  magmatic  S-bearing gases.  The influx of these gases changes the  sulfur oxyanion speciation in crater lakes drastically (polythionates, SnO62- ,  are  lost  from solution), but details are not understood.   The research  strategy is based on a combination of field work and experimental work.  The goal of the field work is to develop a sampling and preservation protocol  for sulfur oxyanions based on the notion that these anions can be retained  on a resin.  A protocol in which columns with this resin are used to  preserve  the  speciation would allow for the study of crater lakes and hydrothermal  systems  around  the  world. Experiments will be conducted to simulate  sulfur  hydrolysis  and  condensation  of  sulfur gases in crater lakes.",
