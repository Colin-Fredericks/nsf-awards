 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Engineering Faculty Enhancement Workshop on:           THE ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES OF ENGINEERING DESIGN         It is widely accepted that 70-80 percent of a product's total costs over its life cycle are determined during conceptual/preliminary design. Yet the impact of the design activity upon the ultimate success (or failure) of a product is not fully integrated with economics in most engineering curricula across the United States. The mission of this workshop is to address this shortcoming by \"educating the engineering educators\" in how to integrate economics and design in the undergraduate curriculum.     Our central purpose, therefore, is to provide a workshop to transfer knowledge regarding the economics of engineering design to all engineering faculty who teach design-intensive courses. This knowledge was gained, in part, from a three-year multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional National Science Foundation grant entitled, \"Integration of Economic Principles with Design in the Engineering Science Component of the Undergraduate Curriculum\" (DUE-9155917).      During 1996 two three-day workshops and a one-day follow-on workshop were funded by NSF's UFE program.  In view of the strong reception for our 1996 workshops dealing with \"The Economic Principles of Engineering Design,\" we will offer two more workshops in 1997 (each 2 days in duration). Participation in each will be limited to 25 individuals in order to encourage dialog and in-depth interaction with the workshop instructors. These workshops will be followed by a one-day colloquium in 1998 during which teaching experiences and curricular issues associated with courses presented in the workshop will be discussed by participants who have implemented these ideas at their respective institutions.",
