Already the investigator,  jointly with R. Stern, has accomplished this for the Alexander polynomial.  Any symmetric Laurent polynomial P(t) with absolute value of P(1)=1 occurs  as the Alexander polynomial of some knot in the 3-sphere.  For  example, R. Stern and the principal investigator have constructed a  family of distinct 4-manifolds, each homeomorphic to the K3-surface,  constructed from knots, and distinguished by the fact that their  Seiberg-Witten invariants are the Alexander polynomials of the knots.  There are other knot invariants that should correspond to other  constructions.  A related issue is the geography problem for simply  connected irreducible 4-manifolds.  Each such manifold can be assigned  a lattice point in the plane corresponding to its characteristic  numbers.  The problem is to study which points are realized.  There  has been notable progress, but much work still remains, and the  principal investigator plans to seek new methods for constructing  irreducible simply connected 4-manifolds of positive signature.  He  and R. Stern also conjecture a replacement for the Noether  inequality for certain symplectic 4-manifolds that generalize the  notion of `general type'.  The investigator has a promising  technique for its proof, which he plans to pursue.       The theory of smooth 4-manifolds gains its importance both from  its central location between low and high-dimensional topology, and  from its close interaction with high energy physics.  The major  problem in this field is the classification of smooth simply connected  4-manifolds.  The interaction between topology and physics has  stimulated the construction of invariants - at first Donaldson's  invariant, and then the invariant of Seiberg and Witten - tha t are  useful in distinguishing the (diffeomorphism) types of 4-manifolds.  These have led to major advances in the classification problem.  Specifically, researchers who have constructed possibly new families  of 4-manifolds can use these invariants to confirm that their phenomena  are indeed `new'.  Recent years have given rise to simply connected  (irreducible) smooth 4-manifolds that admit no complex structure (even  up to homotopy), then to those that admit no symplectic structure.  These examples have confused the issue of classification to the point  that we are left without even a conjectural classification, but they  have also invigorated the theory and reinforced its richness.  ***",
