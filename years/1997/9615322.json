 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for two years of support to perform radar  investigations across former shear margins at Roosevelt Island  and Ice Stream C in order to measure changes in the configuration  and continuity of internal layers and the bed.  The broad goal of  these investigations is to gain an understanding of ice stream  flow and the timing and mechanisms of ice stream shutdown.  A  high-resolution short-pulse radar system will be used for  detailed examination of the uppermost hundred meters of the firn  and ice, and a monopulse sounding-radar system will be used to  image the rest of the ice column (including internal layers) and  the bed.  Changes in the shape and continuity of layers will be  used to interpret mechanisms and modes of ice stream flow  including the possible migration of stagnation fronts and rates  of shut-down.  Variations in bed reflectivity will be used to  deduce basal hydrology conditions across lineations.  Accumulation rates deduced from snow pits and shallow cores will  be used to estimate near-surface depth-age profiles.  Improved  understanding of ice stream history opens the possibility of  linking changes in the West Antarctic ice sheet with the geologic  evidence from Northern Victoria Land and the ocean record of the  retreat of the grounding line in the Ross Sea.",
