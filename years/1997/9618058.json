The high quality instructional materials  are to reflect a real-world focus and relate to the industrial  applications of biology.  One goal of this proposal is to make  science accessible and interesting to all high school students,  regardless of their academic abilities or career goals.  A primary  objective is to involve academic and industrial scientists with  educators in the development of an innovative, real-world science  program designed to engage high school students, especially from  historically underrepresented groups, in the process of scientific  inquiry.  The eight modules are designed to be used in life science  classes to teach fundamental concepts of biology.  This hands-on  curriculum with a science, technology, and society focus, is to be  developed as a collaborative effort between secondary school  teachers, university scientists and science educators, and  microbiology consultants from St. Louis-based industries.",
