 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates a statewide infrastructure that provides education and training in network technology for 2-year college and secondary computer technology faculty that, in turn, enables the implementation of a computer network management curriculum for 2-year technical students, a related curriculum for secondary students, and enables the utilization of computer networks as an instructional tool.  Teacher preparation is a significant element of this program.  Many of the students of this program are future K-12 teachers.  They will be well prepared to introduce, teach, and maintain information technology systems in the K-12 schools.  This project will provide the foundation for a smooth transition from high school to community college in the field of information technology.  The objectives that are designed to accomplish this purpose are as follows:   1.  Establish an approved infrastructure to implement the training of secondary and post-secondary in local area networks and telecommunication networks.   2.  Educate and train a core of 2-year college faculty who are qualified to implement an approved networking curriculum for technical students throughout the state and to utilize computer networks  as instructional tools.   3.  Educate and train a core of secondary faculty who are qualified to teach an networking curriculum for secondary students and to manage and utilize computer networks for instructional purposes.   4.  Provide the training and resources to use the world wide web as a teaching and learning resource.",
