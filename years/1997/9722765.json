 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722765  Condon         This proposal will investigate the control of  reproduction by the brain and pituitary in an ancient fish,  the lamprey.  Lampreys are important because they are  members of the oldest lineage of vertebrates, the Agnathans  or jawless fish, and raise interesting questions on  evolution.  This laboratory has focused on the structure and  function of two brain hormones involved in the brain-  pituitary gonadal axis in lampreys.  The primary structures  of two brain hormones, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH-  I and GnRH-III) have been determined in lampreys.  This  information combined with immunocytochemical and  physiological studies provides strong evidence for the  regulatory influence of the brain on the pituitary-gonadal  axis in lampreys. In addition, lampreys are the first  vertebrates to clearly demonstrate a dual role for GnRH  molecules as neurohormones mediating the pituitary-gonadal  axis.  However, the investigations on the role of GnRHs in  reproductive processes have been impeded by the lack of an  identified gonadotropin that could be used in assays as a  measure of pituitary responsiveness to GnRH.  The  purification and identification of lamprey pituitary  gonadotropin, GTH, is critical to examine the hypothalamic-  pituitary-gonadal relations in lampreys.  Thus  identification of GTH and verification of the ways in which  the hypothalamus affects the pituitary gonadal axis are  needed in the lamprey, and are part of this project.  The  experiments will incorporate a variety of approaches to  further define the relationship of the brain and pituitary  in Agnathans.  The ongoing and proposed studies are focused  on molecular, biochemical and functional studies of GnRHs in  lampreys to test the hypothesis that multiple forms of GnRH  released from the brain influence the synthesis and  secretion of a gonadotropin-like molecule which regulated  the function of the gonads.  Results fsrom these studies in  lampreys will provide better understanding of  the molecular  evolution from invertebrates to later evolved vertebrates.  %%%    This research is looking to see if there is regulation  from the hypothalamus to the pituitary and the gonads in the  lamprey. The lamprey belongs to one of the oldest lineage's  of vertebrates and is used to look at the origin of various  vertebrate signaling systems.  This laboratory has  identified and sequenced the gonadotropin releasing hormone  from the hypothalamus of the lamprey, and now wants to  identify the hormone released from the pituitary in response  to GnRH. Also the effects of environmental factors on this  hormonal pathway will be determined.  This research will  provide a better understanding of molecular evolution of the  reproductive system.        ***",
