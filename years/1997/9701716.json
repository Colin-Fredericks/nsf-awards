 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Nemiroff    The universe we live in changes continually, but most changes are not  easily observed. The planned projects will have a  focus on some of the  few areas of astronomy where significant change occurs on easily  measurable time scales.   The study of change may brings clues which  have far reaching implications - from the better understanding of the  nature of dark matter to the better understanding of the nature of high  energy environments.  The temporal nature of humanity's understanding  of our universe lends itself nicely to public outreach efforts and  educational programs.  Programs on the following topics will be carried  out:    Gamma Ray Bursts:  The temporal aspects of gamma-ray bursts will be  further explored.  Previously, there was the successful detection of  the existence of time-dilation in gamma ray bursts (GRBs).  The precise  amount of time-dilation. however, is still unknown by almost a factor  of 1.5.   The effort will be to  work toward increasingly accurate  calibration of this important attribute with regard to different  samples, systematic errors, and the amount expected from calibration to  best-fit cosmological brightness distributions (Log N - Log P).  Definitive resolution of the GRB distance scale debate would occur were  a gravitational lensing signature isolated.  The search for lens  detection in GRB data will be extended to all GRB data as it becomes  available.   The search for new hard GRBs in the BATSE data stream will  be extended.     Gravitational Microlensing:  The temporal aspects of gravitational  microlensing will be further explored. Previously, there was success in  quantifying the success rate of microlensing (MACHO) searches before  results were reported, and predicting the usefulness of finite source  lenses in determining the nature of the lenses. Currently, the  microlensing searches are entering a new era - one where common single  lens, point source events have only statistical value. More complex  events, such as those  involving binary lenses and finite sources, have  become increasingly important as they give more direct evidence of the  mass, velocity, and distance to the lens. The effort will continue to  study how best to deconvolve mass, distance, and velocity using  multiple lens and finite source size effects. The mass and density of  Galactic lenses currently implied is controversial and goes to the  heart of the Galactic dark matter problem. The effort will include the  use of computer simulations to better study which microlensing  measurements best deconvolve mass from the amplitude and duration of  finite source events, predict which type of MACHO surveys would yield  best information about the density and composition of our Galactic  halo, and scrutinize public domain data for finite source size effects  and implications.     Astronomical Debates: Disputes at the forefront of astronomy also  change.  Two successful astronomical debates have been staged.  These  modern debates act a natural platform for the teaching of astronomical  subjects and for public outreach. Three more debates are planned.     Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD): As the universe changes daily, so  does APOD. Each day APOD will display a different astronomically  oriented picture on the World Wide Web along with a heavily hyperlinked  description. In its 1.5 year existence, APOD has acquired many  thousands of readers and has been praised by magazines including The  New Yorker. APOD' s archive now contains many of the most famous  astronomy pictures. APOD's use in education is shown by it popularity  in astronomy class home pages, and its outreach potential by the high  access rate from the businesses domain. The  APOD's will be expanded,  to create an outreach program for cooperating U.S. universities, and to  directly incorporate student interns in APOD's daily routine.",
