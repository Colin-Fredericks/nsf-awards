 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  96-61683  Weeks     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project will demonstrate the feasibility of producing a composite electrical lead material which has a controlled expansion section for bonding to the electronic device, and a ductile region which can be bent and formed. The lead should have electrical conductivity 70 to 80% of copper and thermal conductivity equivalent to copper. Bonding to ceramic materials will be demonstrated in Phase I. As electronic device structures and materials continue to be improved, increasingly greater amounts of electrical power can be switched and controlled by smaller devices. There is an increasing need for lead materials which can be directly bonded to the electronic devices and other ceramic materials. While copper/graphite composite materials can be produced which match the coefficient of expansion of silicon and other ceramics, these composites cannot be formed or bent during packaging of the electronic device.                These leads will be useful in motor controls to electric cars, and high power, high frequency   semiconductors. Power electronic devices continue to increase in importance as electric controls   replace hydraulics.      ***",
