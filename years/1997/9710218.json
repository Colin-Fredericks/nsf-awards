 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)   project is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and   the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  It focuses on interaction   between Wake Forest University and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in   both research and education.  Students enrolled in the Instrumental   Analysis course at Wake Forest will perform six of their experiments at   the Company laboratories using equipment not available at the University.    Directed by Professor Bradley T. Jones, graduate students will hold six   month intern positions at the Company to learn the use of   instrumentation, serve as teaching assistants for the course experiments   conducted at the Company, and carry out research projects in diverse   areas of Analytical Chemistry.  One of these projects is to investigate   trace metal determination in natural waters by extraction onto solid   phase disks followed by x-ray fluorescent spectroscopy for the   measurement step.    Professor Bradley Jones of Wake Forest University and staff scientists of   the inorganic spectroscopy laboratory of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco   Company will cooperate on experiments for the Instrumental Analysis   course at Wake Forest using facilities and equipment at both the   University and the Company.  In addition, graduate student interns will   be placed at the Company for six month terms to learn equipment operation   in depth and pursue research on projects of mutual interest to the   principle investigator and the Company.  These involve areas such as   trace metal determination in natural waters, and interferences in   spectroscopic measurements occurring with biological samples.",
