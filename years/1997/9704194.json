Dr. Gofron will work with Dr.  Jun'ichiro Mizuki, Lead Scientist at the Spring-8 Facility,  on a research project entitled, \"Novel Element-Specific  Studies of Magnetic Materials.\"    The proposed research will use a magnetic circular x-ray  dichroism technique (MCXD)  in conjunction with photoemission and conventional magnetic  probe to study the element specific magnetism of magneto-  optic materials.  The novel, high-resolution magnetic study  will focus on both the empty and occupied electronic states.  Attention will also be paid to orbital specificity.  In  these synchrotron radiation experiments the polarized x-ray  photons will be used as an element sensitive magnetic probe  for precisely monitoring the electronic structure of  specific atomic species in magneto-optic material.  As  magneto-optic materials are currently used in data storage,  of particular interest are materials with a large Kerr  effect, the rotation of the plane of polarization of  incident linearly polarized light.  One of the foremost  goals of the research is to better understand how individual  chemical species contributes to magnetism and magneto-optic  response, as well as obtain insight as to how each orbital  of a given atomic species contributes to the magneto-optic  response.  ***",
