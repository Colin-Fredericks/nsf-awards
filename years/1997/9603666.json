 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9603666  Tonks            The phosphorylation of  proteins on tyrosyl residues is an  essential element  in he control of many fundamental cellular  processes including growth and proliferation, differentiation,  cytoskeletal function and the cell cycle.   At the present time  there is a lot of progress in determinating the structure,  regulation and function of protein tyrosine k8inases (PTKs) and  protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), the coordinated action of  which governs the levels of cellular  phosphotyrosine.  This  grant is to provide funds for the third meeting on Tyrosine  phosphorylation and cellular signaling ,which will provide a  format in which studies of PTK and PTPs will be integrated so  that the scientists can see how their results contribute  to the  overall big picture. The sessions will be organized around  physiological processes and  cellular functions to provide a  biological context.  With the exception of 2 keynote addresses,  all speakers will be selected from the submitted abstracts.  This  will encourage graduate students, postdocs and young independent  investigators to present the talks. It shoud  also facilitate the  presentation of the most recent results.        This meeting on tyrosine phosphorylation and cell signalling ,  palcae emphasis on the biological function of htese proteins.  The format also encourages young scientists and new findings to  be presented and discussed.   The intent is to encourage  cohesiveness and communication among scientists working on  phosphorylation and cell signaling.                                ***",
