 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619638  The research proposed focuses on algorithmic aspects of  programming language theory and pragmatics, continuing the  research agenda of the principal investigator. Further  investigation is targeted on the area of optimal evaluation  for lambda-calculus, concentrating on relevant cost models,  the necessity of and possible improvements to bookkeeping  for sharing, with applications to linear logic and game  semantics. A long-range goal is to investigate optimal  evaluation as a possible implementation technology for  functional programming. In addition, work will be continued  on syntactic approaches to parametricity and reasoning about  polymorphic programs based on their types, on fixed-rank  type inference, typed lambda-calculus as a venue for  capturing complexity classes, and intensional properties of  contraction of proofs to programs as a general technique for  program synthesis. Some of the work will also be relevant to  curriculum development, even at the undergraduate level.  ***",
