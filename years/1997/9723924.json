In previous studies, we found that DNA triplexes formed prior to or during in vitro DNA polymerization severely block this process.  The mechanism of this phenomenon lies in DNA polymerase's inability to untangle triplex regions in DNA templates, while being perfectly capable of untangling the corresponding duplex regions.  Thus, DNA triplexes can form a stable barrier to DNA polymerases under physiological conditions.  We hypothesize, that DNA triplexes might also inhibit DNA replication in vivo.  Supporting this hypothesis, we recently found that a particular triplex-forming DNA sequence, d(G)n(d(C)n, blocks replication fork movement in E. coli cells.  This effect depends on the length of the repeated sequence and its orientation relative to the replication origin, and is not abolished by a protein synthesis inhibitor.  These results are very suggestive of an unusual structure formed by d(G)n(d(C)n in vivo that may be responsible for the replication arrest.  The specific aim of this research is to obtain direct proof that the triplex structure of the d(G)n(d(C)n repeated sequence causes replication arrest, and to expand these studies to include different triplex-forming repeats.  We will accomplish detailed mutational analysis of the d(G)n(d(C)n repeat combined with analysis of replication intermediates to distinguish between the numerous structural opportunities known for this sequence.  To provide direct insight on the structure formed by this repeated sequence in vivo, we will carry out chemical probing of (G)n(d(C)n-containing plasmids in E. coli cells using the structure-specific chemical chloroacetaldehyde.  We will also analyze the effects of triplex-forming repeated sequences of various length and composition on plasmid DNA replication in E. coli cells using two-dimensional electrophoresis of replication intermediates.  The long term goal of this research is to understand how triplex-forming DNA  repeated sequences affect the regulation of DNA replication in vivo.  %%%  DNA triplex structures conform a stable barrier to DNA replication under physiological conditions.
