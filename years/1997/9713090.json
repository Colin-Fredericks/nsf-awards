These participants,  graduate students or postdoctoral researchers,  will   receive assistance with registration fees and travel expenses.  The site   of this conference has been moved from  California to Rhode Island and   the time of the meeting from January to July.  The subject of this   conference is multidisciplinary and technologically important.  The   situation is opportune for the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program   in the Division of Chemistry, Directorate of Mathematical and Physical   Sciences  and the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems in the   Directorate for Engineering to provide an opportunity for young people to   attend the conference and participate in the discussions.   This award assists graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to   participate in the Gordon Research Conference on Organic Thin films.This   is a research area of major potential impact in a number of technological   fields.",
