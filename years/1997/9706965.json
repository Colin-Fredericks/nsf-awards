 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Schwartz, Connett    Schwartz and Connett will continue to study the harmonic analysis   of expansions in a family of functions on a subset H of Euclidean   n-space when H is not a  group. This lack of group structure can   often be compensated  if the measures on H form a hypergroup or some   more general measure algebra with the basis functions as characters.   The research proposed here falls into several areas: (1) Extend the   proposers' work on the  classification of hypergroups with polynomial   characters to those with multivariable polynomials as characters,  (2) continue to investigate the relation between hypergroups and   linear (partial) differential operators, (3) develop  the abstract   harmonic analysis of hypergroups, especially in the light of the  behavior of the maximum subgroup, (4) investigate the harmonic  analysis of the spheroidal wave functions which arise in signal   processing and other applications, (5) study the properties of   non-hypergroup measure algebras with orthogonal polynomial characters.  and (6) a student research project.     It is well known that any sound, no matter how complicated,   can be decomposed into a series of pure tones, such as those produced   by a tuning fork. This kind of decomposition of a complicated object   into simple building blocks (such as the tuning fork tones) is at the   heart of many modern technologies such as signal compression and high   definition TV, cat scans, nmr scans and image processing. It also   plays a role in mathematical modeling of climate and other physical   phenomena as well as for many important problems inside of mathematics.   In many of these situations, the basic building blocks are more   complicated than the pure tuning fork tones. The purpose of this   project is to study and understand the properties of a variety of   these systems of building blocks and to discover new systems that  may prove to be useful in the future.",
