 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706648    Verchota    The Principle Investigator wishes to study solutions to scale  invariant elliptic equations in Euclidean spaces under modification of  certain frequently assumed hypotheses, with the goal of better  understanding the role they play. Hence, symmetry for systems of  equations, non-commutativity or nonvariational formulation for higher  order operators with bounded coefficients, or boundary values on  non-Lipschitz boundaries will be considered. Harmonic analysis  techniques, singular integrals over Lipschitz and non-Lipschitz  boundaries, and modern elliptic Partial Differential Equation theory  will be used.     Though the proposal stays within the theoretic framework of elliptic  PDE, the subject matter is related to applications in engineering,  numerical analysis, and applied mathematics. Special cases of the  equations considered have been used for some time to model, for  example, the distribution of electrical charges, distribution of  temperatures in a solid body, or the displacements an elastic body can  undergo under stresses imposed on its outside surface or boundary. The  emphasis here and recently on scale invariance allows for bodies that  have arbitrary numbers of corners and edges (something that occurs  naturally in many materials, e.g. in crystals). This is because the  measure of angles remains the same whether the angles are viewed  through a microscope or through the wrong end of a telescope, i.e.  these very elementary quantities are scale invariant. In contrast, our  idea of how smooth the surface of some material might be changes  dramatically upon magnification, i.e. change of scale. By grounding  our theory in quantities more elementary than those which describe  smoothness and obtaining various results and estimates on the  quantities modeled (temperature, etc.) we obtain a theory that can be  applied both to bodies with rough boundaries or to bodies with smooth  boundaries. The proposal can be seen as a search for other more  elementary quantities  leading to further generalizations or  applications.",
