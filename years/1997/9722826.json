 "awd_abstract_narration": "Synapses are the points of communication between neurons.  Alterations in their strength can critically affect the  operations and functions of neural circuits in the brain.  Many hormones and drugs affect synaptic strength.  Sometimes  they act by altering presynaptic calcium channels through  which calcium ions enter to trigger the secretion of  neurotransmitter, the substance one neuron releases in order  to communicate with another at a synapse.  But often  neuromodulators act without affecting calcium channels in  ways still not understood.  Serotonin is a circulating  hormone in crustaceans which strongly enhances transmission  at neuromuscular synapses.  Serotonin increases transmitter  release without altering presynaptic levels of calcium  concentration or increasing the influx of calcium into nerve  terminals during action potentials.  Just how serotonin  regulates transmitter release is not known.  Long-term  facilitation (LTF) is a form of synaptic plasticity observed  at crayfish neuromuscular junctions where prolonged neural  activity results in an increase in transmitter release per  action potential.  It is not associated with any change in  presynaptic resting calcium level or calcium influx during  action potentials, and like serotonin's action, its effects  are mediated by the presynaptic biochemical intermediate  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).  It is not known what  aspect of the secretory process is altered in LTF.  Transmitter is stored in vesicles and released by their  fusion with the presynaptic membrane during action  potentials.  Preliminary results suggest that serotonin acts  at crayfish neuromuscular junctions to increase the supply  of vesicles available for release.  This preparation will be  used to test this hypothesis, and also to develop procedures  that could be used to assay other drugs that might enhance  the size of the vesicle pool. It will also be determined  whether vesicle pool size is altered during (LTF).  In this  project, a membrane labelin g fluorescent dye (FM1-43) will  be used to label presynaptic vesicles and determine whether  serotonin and LTF increase the number of available vesicles  or the probability they are released by action potentials.  A slowly developing depression of synaptic transmission due  to exhaustion of the vesicles available for release will  also be used to estimate the number of vesicles in the  releasable pool and whether their number or their  probability of release is increased by serotonin and LTF.  Other experiments will test for changes in the rate of  recovery of released vesicle membrane in serotonin and LTF,  and for involvement of cytoskeletal proteins in vesicle  availability and release during serotonin action and LTF.  Finally, new cAMP-sensitive indicators will be used to  measure changes in presynaptic levels of cAMP during  serotonin action and LTF.",
