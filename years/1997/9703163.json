 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigation and development of a new algorithmic framework for media  representation is proposed, with emphasis on digital images and video.  In  particular, a new architecture for visual information representation is detailed  based on the notion of programmable terminals, essentially considering the  decoder as a Turing machine.  In such a framework, the algorithm becomes itself  the content, rather than just being used to process content.  The benefits of  such an approach are numerous, and can be appreciated by considering the  revolutionary benefits derived from the transition of computer usage from the  days of simple text terminals for number-crunching mainframes to today's powerful  graphical user interfaces that host Web browsers.  Computers were initially  considered as calculation devices, but are not mostly used to generate elementary  forms of algorithmic content, such as windows, menus, icons, fonts, etc., that  empower users to perform advanced text document creation, distribution, access,  etc.  The proposed framework generalizes this paradigm to the case of digital  images and video, and allows its use in a wide range of applications.    The shift towards algorithmic representations requires both theoretical and  applied innovations.  From a theoretical standpoint, it is shown that a new  mathematical theory can be developed (called Complexity Distortion Theory),  providing a universal mathematical framework in which all coding techniques (from  traditional entropy coding to model-based video coding) can be appropriately  analyzed.  This theory builds on the notion of a programmable terminal and  promises significant results for real systems that operate under time and space  constraints, or when compression is only one of the representation requirements.   From a practical, applications-oriented standpoint, this new approach allows the  elimination of decades of lag of audio-visual information representation with  respect to modern software design.  A software-based archi tecture is described,  centered around a new programming language paradigm (FLAVOR - Formal Language for  Audio-Visual Object Representation), and developed to provide the basis for real,  functioning systems.  Several applications and application domains are discussed  in which the proposed approach can have a fundamental impact, empowering users  with seamless creation, manipulation, and access to visual information.",
