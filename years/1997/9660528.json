 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  96-60528  Downing     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of using a monolithic capillary optic to enhance the capability of microfocus X-ray fluorescence (MXRF) instrumentation.  X-ray fluorescence is useful because of its ability nondestructively to perform elemental analysis on essentially any sample with high sensitivity.  In commercial MXRF instruments, spatial resolution is typically achieved by pinhole collimating, at the expense of greatly reduced flux and detection limits.  Multifiber polycapillary X-ray optics have a demonstrated capability to collect and focus X-rays; however, the spot size is typically 0.5 mm or larger.  Focusing monolithic (one-piece) multichannel capillary X-ray optics have just been developed.  By collecting a large solid angle from laboratory X-ray sources and focusing to less than 40 microns, they should provide greater performance, potentially increasing X-ray intensity by more than two orders of magnitude while decreasing the spot size compared to available MXRF systems.  This would improve detection limits, spatial resolution, working distance, and reduced measurement time.   Commercial applications include use a process monitoring system in predictive maintenance.  Low cost installation, simple operation, and lower personnel requirements, as well as its capability to access non-traditional process variables, are expected to be commercially attractive.  In addition, improved microfocus X-ray fluorescence is expected to be used in many scientific disciplines, including geochemistry, mineralogy, environmental monitoring and remediation, biology, and advanced materials.  ***",
