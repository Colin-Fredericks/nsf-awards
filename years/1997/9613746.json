Chang and Chen will carry out an  observational study of the spatial and temporal variability of the  East Asian monsoon, focusing on its interannual-scale interactions  with the South Asian monsoon and the relationship to the tropical  biennial oscillation.  The principal approach will be to use  statistical methods, including composite and principal component  techniques and a technique developed by the principal investigators  called multiple-set canonical correlation analysis, to analyze  long-term data sets (reanalysis products, climate rainfall data,  and out-going longwave radiation data sets, among others).  The  monsoon systems will be described in terms of their rainfall  characteristics as well as their wind and pressure patterns.           The Asian monsoon system(s) is a major signal in the general  circulation and the global climate.  Better understanding of its  role in the global system is essential to improving both weather  and climate prediction, even in remote regions such as over the  United States.  The Large-scale Dynamic Meteorology and Climate  Dynamics Programs will share in the support of this project.  ***",
