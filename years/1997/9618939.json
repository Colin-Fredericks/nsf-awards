 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans  communicate using speech, prosodic cues,  hand  gestures,  gaze  and  facial expression.  The focus of this project  is  the  interaction  among these modalities in humans and in  interactive  humanoid  communicating  agents.  The  goal  is  to  be  able  to  synthesize  and  understand  natural face-to-face  conversational  behavior --  that is, spontaneous gesture and facial movements in  the  context of speech with intonation. Two converging  lines  of  research  will  be  carried out:  first, a  series  of  empirical  experiments on the interaction among these modalities,  including  experiments  on  the  association between gestural  features  and  motion   verbs,   the   relationship  between   turn-taking   and  information  structure, the interaction between facial  movements  and gesture, and the distribution of listener-looking-at-speaker-  gesture.   Second,  the continued development of  an  interactive  humanoid   agent,  including  generating  gestural  features   in  association with dialogue, refining dialogue generation  to  take  into account turn-taking, distributing conversational load across  speech, gesture, and facial expression, and replacing the current  system of gesture input by dataglove with a stereo vision system.  The  results  of this research will contribute to theory  of  the  interaction  between  verbal and nonverbal  modalities  in  human  interaction, and aid in the development of autonomous agents  and  humanoid  interfaces  that depend on natural human  communicative  behavior for increased efficiency, naturalness and flexibility of  human - computer interaction.",
