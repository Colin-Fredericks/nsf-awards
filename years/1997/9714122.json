In doing so, it is particularly important for      decision-makers and educators to understand the ways technology can impact learning in the      context of the culture, the curriculum, educational system goals, evaluation criteria, as well as the      costs and projected benefits of the technology implementation. To help inform national policy      decisions related to the application of technology in education, it is particularly important to      identify and carefully document exemplary practices within different educational systems.            A well-designed study of U.S. and international experience in educational technology      implementation will provide examples of successful strategies and will identify the problems and      pitfalls encountered and how they were overcome. The study may identify the importance of the      knowledge, skill and commitment of the teacher in successful integration of technology into the      learning environment and help define patterns and profiles that may help distinguish successful      technology implementation efforts within and across countries. For example, what common      characteristics and strategies can be identified in the planning and implementation of technology      at the state or provincial level? In addressing these questions and others, the study should help      further an understanding of the appropriate application of technology within different cultural      contexts. It should also describe effective ways of facilitating the transfer of educational      technology under varying resource constraints.            The Academy for Educational Development (AED) and the International  Society for Technology      in Education (ISTE) propose a project that will develop a framework for an international study of      exemplary practices in the application of the new information technologies to K-12 education.      The framework would be developed by a distinguished group of approximately 20 national and      international researchers, educators and policy-makers who would come together in a short-term      intensive workshop. Prior to the workshop, a larger group of educators, technologists, and      policy-makers will be engaged in a 4-6 week mediated on-line discussion in order to capture a      broad view of the most significant issues, approaches and experiences.            Both AED and ISTE have extensive experience and expertise in addressing international issues      of technology in education. The co-investigators and a number of individuals identified in the      potential list of invitees (see Attachment 1 ) have worked together in designing the UNESCO      ITEC Project: An International Study of Information Technology in Education of Children. This      experience will provide a base of knowledge related to many of the issues related to designing a      study of technology across national contexts, educational systems, and cultures and will help      assure that the workshop and subsequent on-line work is productive and focused. The experience      of the ITEC study participants, coupled with fresh perspectives provided by other invitees, will      assure the development of a coherent and realistic framework for an international study of      exemplary practices in the application of technology to education.",
