 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compilation technology has contributed to the success of  computational science by allowing users to achieve high  program performance without worrying excessively about  details of the underlying hardware architecture. Most  compiler optimizations focus on improving computation  efficiency, but the growing disparity between processor and  memory speeds has made exploiting reuse of registers and  cache important as well. This project will explore  techniques for improving program performance by modifying  the data layout in a program to improving spatial locality  and avoid adverse memory effects such as conflict misses and  false sharing.  Target optimizations include modifying the  base addresses of variables, changing fields offsets within  structures, group-and-transpose of related data, padding,  transposing, and reindexing array dimensions.  The main goal  of this project is to develop heuristics for guiding data  layout optimizations, both individually and as part of an  overall optimization strategy which includes computation  transformations.  To evaluate the impact on scientific  applications, optimizations will be implemented as passes in  the Stanford SUIF compiler and tested on benchmark suites  such as Perfect, NAS, and SPEC for both scalar and parallel  architectures.",
