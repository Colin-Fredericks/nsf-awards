 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed career development plan provides the PI  with the means to develop a complete and balanced career  that includes both research and education.       Traditionally, models for dynamical systems are  developed from first principles considerations which yield  physical meaning to variables, parameters, and results of  the model.  In contrast, phenomenological models are  developed directly from experimentally measured data.  The  objective of the research plan is to reconcile these  approaches by developing analytic coordinate transformations  between the two representations.  The path from experimental  data to physical model is a new method for understanding  nonlinear systems when the physical model contains terms  that are unknown, or not easily determined.  The proposed  research will add to our understanding of all nonlinear  systems including mechanical, fluid, optical, and chemical  systems.  It also has engineering applications related to  control, monitoring, and maintenance of experimental  systems.       The objectives of the education plan are curriculum  development, supervision, outreach, and mentoring of  students.  The plan is designed to give students the  educational background necessary for careers in industry  and/or academia.  To achieve this I will develop and teach  new cross-disciplinary courses at the undergraduate and  graduate level.  In addition, students will participate in  conferences, academic research, and research applicable to  industry.  The latter will grow out of a visiting scientist  program involving scientists from industry and national  laboratories.",
