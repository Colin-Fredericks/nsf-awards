 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested to purchase a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope  system to  establish a multiple user confocal facility. This system best fits the  needs of the user group  and the diverse projects and approaches proposed here. The user group  represents a cross  section of the Salk faculty and departmental representation. The11  listed users of the  requested confocal system include faculty representatives of 5  departments of the Salk  Institute. The 7 major users include faculty representatives of 4  departments, and the 4 minor  users listed include faculty representatives of 3 departments.        The research projects contained within this proposal emphasize  cellular and molecular approaches to study a broad range of issues in  experimental biology, including chromosome replication and segregation,  regulators of DNA replication, the trafficking of macromolecules from  the nucleus to the cytoplasm, localization of neurotransmitter  receptors and ion channel in the brain, and fundamental events in  neural development such as neural induction, cell fate and  differentiation, neuronal migration and axon guidance, and the  development of neural circuits.",
