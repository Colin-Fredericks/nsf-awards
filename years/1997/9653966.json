 "awd_abstract_narration": "9653966  Sternheim     The Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Teacher Education Collaborative (STEMTEC) links the members of the Five Colleges, Incorporated consortium - the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges - with the three area community colleges, Springfield Technical, Holyoke, and Greenfield, and the neighboring school districts in a collaborative effort to promote reform in the science and mathematics preparation of teachers.  PALMS, the Massachusetts NSF State Systemic Initiative program, and the Continental Cablevision Corporation are also participating.  In order to improve the preparation of pre-service teachers, stimulate the interest of undergraduate science and mathematics majors in the teaching profession, and increase the educational effectiveness of science and mathematics courses, the collaborative draws on its expertise to make use of effective active-learning strategies: cooperative learning, investigation-based teaching, educational technology, new assessment techniques, and opportunities to teach.  Teams including college science, mathematics, and education faculty members are re-designing existing college courses and creating new ones.  The teams include K-12 teachers who participated in earlier NSF supported collaborative ventures to improve teacher preparation, and who have adopted these teaching strategies in their own classrooms.  The project is developing strategies to attract students to science and mathematics teaching, especially women, under-represented minorities, and rural and inner city residents.  Strong assessment and dissemination components are accompanying a comprehensive program of course reform and preservice teacher education that can serve as a national model.  ***",
