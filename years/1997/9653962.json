 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a framework for implementing a statewide plan to improve the preparation of science and mathematics teachers in Texas.  Led by Dr. Mauro Castro, Chair of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University-Kingsville, it will 1) design and develop a series of inquiry-driven, technology-infused modules to be concurrently integrated into the science and mathematics curriculum at the nine partner universities; and 2) organize a subset of Texas Presidential Awardees, comprised of Texas' nominees for the NSF Presidential Award for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching, to serve in an advisory capacity to the Collaborative and to assist in developing the Texas Presidential Awardees Alliance, comprised of all 168 of the state's Presidential Awardees.      These two interrelated activities will involve teams of university faculty from science, mathematics, and education representing nine universities; teams of exemplary science and mathematics teachers from approximately 20 school districts; and administrators from K-12 schools, community college and university partners.  Importantly, these objectives will be integrally tied to the continued development of a full implementation plan to improve science and mathematics teacher preparation programs across the state.",
