 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722509  Mohnen    This Americas Program award  will support a  collaborative research project between Dr. Debra  Mohnen, University of Georgia, and Dr. Ariel Orellana,  Universidad de Chile, to study pectin biosynthesis in  plants.  Pectin is a polysaccharide of plant primary  wall that plays critical roles in plant growth and  development.  A full understanding of these roles  requires elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate  its biosynthesis.  The goal of the proposal is to  determine the topology of the pectin biosynthetic  enzyme, with the long term goal of elucidating, on a  molecular level, how pectin is synthesized.   In this  study, the researchers will try to identify enzymatic  activity, determine the topography of the enzyme, and  solubilize and purify enzymes.  The increased  understanding of their biochemistry, gained during the  identification and purification process, will be  important for building accurate models of biosynthesis  of pectin.    The proposed collaboration  brings together two  complementary groups required to achieve the project's  objectives.  The US scientist's expertise in  biosynthesis of pectin complements Dr. Orellana's  experience in nucleotide sugar-transport and topography  of membrane proteins.  In addition to its importance to  plants, pectin is an important food fiber that  contributes to the roughage of fruits and vegetables,  and is an economically important gelling and  stabilizing agent in foods.  ***",
