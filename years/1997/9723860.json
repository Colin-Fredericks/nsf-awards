 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carey  9723860          This project will examine the role of stress proteins in  the  process  of  mammalian hibernation. Stress proteins are  made  by  cells  in  response  to stressful conditions  such  as  excessive  heat,  cold,  lack  of  glucose, viruses and chemical  toxicants.  Stress  proteins  help  to  prevent cellular  death  in  part  by  protecting  cellular proteins that may be damaged by  stress,  or  by  helping the process of protein degradation when proteins  are  irreversibly damaged by stress. Animals that hibernate provide  a  natural  system with which to study the adaptive significance  of  stress   proteins  because  of  the  extreme   shifts   in   body  temperature  and  metabolism that occur over the  course  of  the  annual  cycle,  as  well  as  during  the  transitions  from  low  temperature   to   high  temperature  that  hibernators   undergo  periodically  throughout the winter. The PI will  compare  levels  of  stress  proteins  in  intestine, liver,  heart  and  skeletal  muscle  of  fed, fasted and hibernating 13-lined ground squirrels  and  in  mitochondria  isolated from liver, skeletal  muscle  and  heart  in  these  groups. Tissues samples  will  be  obtained  at  precise  points  during the periodic arousals that  occur  during  the  hibernation  season. The PI will also correlate  changes  in  stress   proteins  with  the  extent  of  protein  damage  during  hibernation.",
