 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633285  Fall        Plants are a significant source of non-methane hydrocarbons to the atmosphere,  yet the biochemical and physiological factors that influence these chemical emissions  from terrestrial vegetation are not well understood.  This project investigates the  production and emission of 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (methylbutenol) in ponderosa pine  and other pine species.  Methylbutenol is a trace atmospheric constituent that has been  measured in pine forests and is classified as an oxygenated hydrocarbons (oxHCs).  The oxHCs are hypothesized as a potentially significant group of compounds that is  important in the overall photochemistry  of the Earth s planetary boudary layer and  free troposphere.     In addition to study of the biochemical mechanism of  methylbutanol production in pine species, the project seeks to establish the  relationship of this compound to the enzymatic formation of other isoprenoid  chemicals synthesized by conifers.         Results from the project will provide improved understanding of the biological   and environmental factors that regulate the emission of natural oxHC to the  atmosphere.  This knowledge is necessary for developing predictive algorithms and  models that will estimate fluxes of oxHCs in response to environmental conditions and  to seasonal changes in plant metabolism.          ***",
