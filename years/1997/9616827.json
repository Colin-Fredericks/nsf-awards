 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616827  Grove    This grant provides $72,800 as partial support of the costs of  upgrading the automation systems on each of two electron  microprobes maintained at MIT's Center for Geochemical Analysis.  While one of the EMP's was originally purchased in 1972 and has  since been upgraded with an additional wavelength dispersive  spectrometer (for a total of five), an additional used EMP was  purchased in 1992 (EAR-918402) to alleviate demand on the  original instrument.  Both instruments are fully subscribed by a  wide variety of regional researchers from MIT, WHOI, Boston  University, Wellesley College and Harvard University to name a  few.  The purpose of this upgrade is to replace the antiquated  and no longer supported Tracor Northern, DEC PDP-11 based  automation systems which control both the stage and spectrometer  drives on these EMP's and also control the electronics of the  energy dispersive detectors (EDS) and additionally handle the  data reduction and image analysis programs.  These upgrades will  ensure continued functionality of these EMP's and provide for  state-of-the-art digital image analysis of backscattered electron  images thus aiding these scientists to tackle fundamental  problems in petrology and geochemistry such as studies of the  growth and evolution of continental crust and the lithosphere,  studies of magmatic processes within the crust, studies of the  mechanical properties of partially molten rocks under varying  condition of temperature, stress and lithostatic pressure,  petrologic investigations into the formation history of mantle  peridotites, the nature of hydrothermal alteration of oceanic  crust and studies of carbonate diagenesis.  ***",
