The first meeting was held in New Hampshire in  1971 and every other year thereafter.  The meetings  alternate between domestic and foreign locales.  The  conferences are generally attended by 150-200 world leaders  in enzyme engineering research.  Over half of the speakers  are from foreign nations.  The theme of the 1997 conference  is \"technologies that have the potential for dramatically  shaping biotechnology and chemical technology in the 21st  century\".  Leading enzyme scientists, including many of our  BES awardees (e.g., Arnold, Dordick, Clark) are  participants.  Among the key sessions are:            Protein engineering enzymes       Fine chemical synthesis using enzymes       Extremozymes       Artificial enzymes       Environmental biocatalysis       Analytical applications of enzymes    The conference will provide an excellent opportunity for  U.S. researchers to network with foreign scientists in the  field, many of whom come from countries with extensive  enzyme-use history, e.g., Japan.    The proposal requests $12,000 from NSF to support the travel  and registration costs of six of the U.S. speakers.  ***",
