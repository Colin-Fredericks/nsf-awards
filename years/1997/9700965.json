There  are two cases to consider: (1) the describing characteristic theory in  which the representations are taken over a field k having the same  characteristic as the defining characteristic p of G; and (2) the  non-describing characteristic theory in which k has characteristic  different from p.  Over the past decade the investigators have developed  many new techniques (often in collaboration with E. Cline) for attacking  case (1).  These methods have often come about by adapting geometric  methods, such as the theory of perverse sheaves, to classical algebra  (especially the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras).  In  the proposed work they will continue in that direction.  At the same time,  the investigators will integrate their approach with high dimensional  deformation techniques which have also been applied to (1).  In addition,  the investigators have recently developed new endomorphism algebra  techniques for attacking (2).  In particular, their introduction (with Jie  Du) of Kazhdan-Lusztig cell theory into the theory of Hecke endomorphism  algebras suggests that much progress can be made on developing a general  theory (i.e., valid for all types) for the non-describing characteristic  theory.  The project involves, and/or will have applications to, many other  areas of mathematics, including cohomology, Lie theory, finite dimensional  algebras, and the maximal subgroup theory of finite groups.         A mathematical group is an abstract embodiment of symmetry.  Its  concrete realizations can provide powerful constraints on the behavior of  complicated physical and communications systems.  This project concentrates  on determining the ways in which the most important abstract finite groups  find concrete representations as square matrices over finite number  systems.  The groups and representati ons the investigators study comprise  the most important basic ingredients for creating a general theory of all  finite group representations.  In this century, similar theories for  continuous groups over familiar continuous number systems have played a  large role in quantum theory and the theory of elementary particles.  Their  finite analogs have already proved valuable in the design of communications  and data storage devices, though this finite theory remains very  incomplete.  In the next century, one reasonably expects that the finite  discrete worlds of computers and communications will become even more  important. The task of creating a viable general theory of finite group  representations -- as is the investigators' long-term goal -- is, thus, a  central problem for the future.",
