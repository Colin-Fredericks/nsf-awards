 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617675  Fisher          The biogeochemical cycling of many trace elements in  ocean surface waters is strongly influenced by biological  process.  Despite this fact, relatively little is known  about what controls the fate of elements once they are  incorporated into biomass.  For example, metals can be  assimilated into the food web, or regenerated to the  dissolved phase or exported on sinking particles.  Given our  lack of understanding in this area, it is difficult at  present to predict the fate and relative importance of  different pathways in metal cycling throughout the wide  range of oceanic settings.         The principal investigators propose here to advance our  understanding of trace metal cycling by quantifying for the  first time the effects of subcellular partitioning and metal  stoichiometires on metal biogeochemistry in natural systems.  There are two main approaches, consisting of laboratory and  field work.  The lab studies use controlled measurements and  labeled metal radionuclides to examine carbon:metal ratios  and the partitioning and the fate of metals incorporated  into biomass.  A novel dual labeling technique allows the  principle investigators to separate between intercellular  and cell surface pools of metals.  In the field, natural  assemblages of phytoplankton will be examined for the  cellular partitioning of the various metals, and ship board  incubation experiments will be conducted to examine the  rates of metal turnover.  The results of this study will  significantly increase our understanding of the role of  biological processes in chemical cycling and transport in  the oceans.",
