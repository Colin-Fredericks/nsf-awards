 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Sheldon G. Shore, Department of Chemistry, Ohio State University, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division to synthesize and study lanthanide-transition   metal complexes that form extended arrays and for the study of the   reactions of metal complexes with new borane ligands. Materials that have   direct lanthanide transition metal bonds and a series of compounds with   cyanide and cyanate bridged lanthanide-transition metal backbones will be   prepared. This phase of the program is designed to develop and expand   avenues for the synthesis of polymeric, extended array complexes that   incorporate both lanthanide and transition metals into a one, two, or   three dimensional arrangement of metal moieties. Secondly, the reactions   of lanthanide ions with new borane anions that are isoelectronic with   nitrogen donors and that can function as ligands will be examined. This   aspect of the program will uncover a new aspect of borane chemistry and   yield routes to new types of lanthanide boranes.   Lanthanide-transition metal complexes can be or can serve as precusors to   electronic, superconducting, and magnetic materials. In addition there   are a number of commercially important catalysts that contain both types   of metals. Nonetheless, complexes containing both lanthanide and   transition metals are not common. This project aims at extending the   number and types of compounds that contain these types of metals joined   to each other in unique large `arrays,` designed to be logical forms from   which the materials or catalysts mentioned above may be obtained.",
