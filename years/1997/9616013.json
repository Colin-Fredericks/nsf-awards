 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT: CMS-9616013, Glenn Rix, Georgia Tech    The response of particulate materials such as soils to  dynamic loads is characterized by the velocity and  attenuation spectra over a range of frequencies. Prior  research on the near-surface characterization of soil  deposits has emphasized the study of velocity, due in part  to difficulties in measuring attenuation in the laboratory  and field. However attenuation data can be uniquely used to  more fully characterize the response of near-surface soils  to dynamic loads.    The particulate nature of soil and the attenuation due to  geometric spreading and wave-phenomena add to the complexity  of evaluating the loss mechanisms for material attenuation  in soil. The objectives of this research program are to  enhance the understanding of loss mechanisms in near-surface  soils and to develop robust assessment procedures. The  problem is approached from two extreme scales: the  clarification of underlying physical processes at the  microscale and the development of adequate methods for field  (i.e., macroscale) measurement. These are initial steps  toward developing laboratory and field measurement  procedures which reflect a detailed understanding of the  loss mechanisms.    Research tasks include the study of energy losses in double  layers (micro-level simulations and experimental studies),  reassessment of hysteretic losses at low strain in light of  new phenomenological hypotheses (experimental studies), and  development of active and passive field testing procedures  (analytical, model, and field studies). Specialized devices,  new laboratory and field measurement procedures, and unique  simulation software and algorithms are used.    An improved understanding of loss mechanisms and the  development of new methods of assessment will enhance the  ability to characterize near-surface materials (e.g., aging,  chemical effects, saturation), and improve the wave-based  monitoring of geoprocesses (e.g., inversion of state of  stress in situ, assess ment of the spatial evolution of  liquefaction, and response of systems to dynamic  excitation). The improved understanding of material loss  mechanisms and advances in field assessment methods will  also benefit site characterization for earthquake hazard  mitigation.",
