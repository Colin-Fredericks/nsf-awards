The co-investigators are Andrew Bocarsly of  Princeton University and Prabhakara Rao of the Central  Electrochemical Research Institute (CERI) in Tamil Nadu.  Their  studies will focus on the structure and reactivity of platinum(II) and  palladium(II) complexes with cyanometallates that form polymeric  structures.  These materials form hydrogel-like structures with  unusual photochemical and electrochemical properties.  Bocarsly's  interest is the solid-state properties of these materials, while Dr.  Rao will pursue the potential sensor applications of these systems.   Both groups are strongly grounded in electrochemistry and the use  of electrochemical methods.  The expertise and facilities available  at these two laboratories are complementary and should be  enhanced by the collaboration.    Scope: This research will add an international component to  domestic research that is currently funded by the NSF Division of  Chemistry.        The discussions leading to this collaboration have been thoughtful,  deliberate and point to the potential that solid scientific work of  mutual benefit will result.  CERI is a research facility of the central  government that is managed by the Council of Scientific and  Industrial Research (CSIR). The mission of CSIR laboratories is to  conduct research consistent with national priorities and India's  development as an industrial nation.    ***",
