 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618984  Wood    This Local Systemic Change project is submitted by a Coalition of  nine Delaware School Districts, the State Department of Public  Instruction and the Delaware Science, Math and Technology Education  Foundation.  Support and expertise is drawn from the State  Legislature, the school districts, business, industry, and  academia.    The project will initiate a hands-on science program in all 58  elementary schools in the 9 school districts.  Approximately 1800  elementary teachers in the program will receive professional  development in order to help them fully implement exemplary  curricula; FOSS, Insights and Science and Technology for Children.    This program will:    *    Provide every elementary teacher with 150 hours of       professional development linked to exemplary curricula in       order to deepen their understanding of science content,       strengthen their capacity to teach science and embed science       as a central element in the K-6 curriculum.    *    Build the capacity to sustain science education in every       district by developing a network of teacher leaders in every       school in the Coalition and creating a core of district       Science Specialists throughout the state to support the Lead       Teachers.    *    Foster partnerships with higher education to align pre-service       and in-service teacher education.    The request is for $5,402,013 for 5 years with cost sharing  estimated as $6,700,000.",
