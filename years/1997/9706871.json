 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tuskegee University proposes to establish a Center for  Innovative Manufacturing of High Performance Materials based  on a strong foundation in materials research developed over  two decades.  The activities of the proposed NSF/CREST  Center will be directed towards achieving the following  objectives:         Diversify existing research in high performance    composite materials.       Provide additional training in mathematics and science    and exposure to the areas of materials science and    engineering to minority middle and high school students by    involving them in various pre-college programs.       Increase the involvement of undergraduate and graduate    students in the research of high performance materials.       Launch a doctoral program in Materials Science and    Engineering.    Advanced Materials Research:  The proposed Center will  address the critical issues related to the manufacturing of  affordable, high performance, and rapidly fabricated liquid  molded composites.  These composite materials and structures  are primary candidates for defense and commercial  applications.  The research is divided into four major  components:    1.   Chemical synthesis and analysis of resins for liquid    molding;  2.   Innovative resin transfer/resin infusion molding and  non-destructive evaluation;  3.   Performance modeling and simulation, and  4.   Static and dynamic performance evaluation and failure  analysis.    The researchers involved with the proposed Center will  actively collaborate with their counterparts from several  research universities, industry, and national laboratories.  An extensive collaboration already exists as part of on-  going research efforts and the research activities of the  proposed Center is expected to further strengthen them.  Undergraduate students will take part in the research  activities through the research experience for  undergraduates (REU) program built into the research  components.    Pre-College Programs:  The proposed Center will recruit,  m otivate and train minority students in the field of science  and engineering starting at an early age.  The pre-college  programs that will be offered with support from this grant  and matching funds from industry include Saturday Academy  (for 8th -12th  graders during the academic year), Pre-  Freshman Enrichment Program (six week summer program for 8th  - 10th graders), Minority Introduction to engineering (one  week summer program for 11th graders), Research  Apprenticeship for Disadvantaged High Schoolers (eight week  summer program for 11th graders) and Analytical Chemistry  Program (eight week summer program for 10th and 11th  graders).  A one week summer institute for teachers will  also be held as part of these programs.    Doctoral Program:  The development and implementation of  Ph.D. programs represents one of the key strategic  directions authorized recently by the Board of Trustees of  Tuskegee University.  The establishment of a Ph.D. program  in Materials Science and Engineering at Tuskegee University  will be spearheaded by the proposed Center.  The Center's  role in the Ph.D. Program is primarily to provide access to  the students to the state-of-the-art research in materials  science and engineering.  This will be the first doctoral  program offered at Tuskegee University.",
