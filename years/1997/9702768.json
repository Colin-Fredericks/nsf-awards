 "awd_abstract_narration": "The realistic deployment of highly articulated robots relies on a  provably   complete  sensor  based  planner  for  these   robots.  Consequently,  the operation of such robots motivates  the  long-  term  research  effort to develop a sensor based  planner  for  a  broad  class of highly articulated robots. The research considers  the  next step towards this goal: this approach introduces a  new  roadmap structure for an arbitrary shaped object. The roadmap  is  termed the hierarchical configuration Voronoi graph (HCVG) and it  can  be used to plan a path between two points and to explore and  map  an  environment. Furthermore, and perhaps more  importantly,  the  HCVG  applies to situations where the robot has no a  priori  information about its environment and thus, the robot  must  rely  on  its  sensor  information to achieve  its  goal.   A  powerful  feature  of  the HCVG is its incremental construction  procedure,  which  is a necessary component of a sensor based planner because  there typically is no one vantage point from where the robot  can  ``see'' the entire environment; the robot needs to couple sensing  with  motion.  Four key aspects of this ppocedure are (1) it uses  only  line of sight distance information, (2) it requires minimal  sensor  processing,  (3)  it  need  not  explicitly  compute  the  configuration  space of the robot, and (4) it is complete.   This  incremental  construction procedure is  general  to  any  roadmap  method  and thus provides a framework in how local line of  sight  information  can be used to create a global map.  This  award  is  coordinated  with  a  companion award from the  Office  of  Naval  Research in support of this research.",
