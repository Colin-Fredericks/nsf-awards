 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Cooperative Agreement provides support for the formation  of  a  Scientific Management Office (SMO) for the National  Ice  Core  Laboratory  (NICL),  a  facility in  Denver,  Colorado  which  is  jointly  managed and operated by the National Science  Foundation  (NSF)  and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and  which  provides  a state-of-the-art, safe and controlled environment  to  preserve   ice  cores  and  an  ice  core  processing  area   for  investigators  to  conduct research .  The Scientific  Management  Office (SMO) will be housed in the Climate Change Research Center  (CCRC) of the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans and  Space  (EOS)  at  the University of New Hampshire (UNH).  The Scientific  Management  Office  for NICL (NICL SMO) will serve  as  a  direct  point of contact for principal investigators interested in access  to  ice cores.  It will also facilitate the formulation of a  new  Ice  Core  Working  Group  (ICWG) that will  represent  ice  core  researchers  and  those  in  related disciplines  whose  research  utilizes  or  applies  to  ice  core  research.   The  ICWG  will  investigate  a wide range of topics related to ice core  research  including   NICL  oversight,  sample  access  and   distribution,  inventory, policy issues and the development of a plan for future  activities.   Through yearly meetings and reports the  ICWG  will  provide  leadership  and  direction to the  ice  core  community.  Members  of the ICWG will be elected by the scientific  community  and  will serve on a rotating basis.  The first Chair for the new  ICWG will be the Director of the NICL SMO and will serve for  one  year  until  ICWG  members elect a Chair.   A  Sample  Allocation  Committee  (SAC)  developed from members  of  ICWG  will  provide  timely  recommendations to NSF and USGS on sample allocation  and  core  access  for  qualified investigators.   A  data  management  coordination system with existing data centers will be  organized  by the ICWG through  the NICL SMO.",
