This conference will  emphasize efforts to expand the intellectual and industrial scope  of biotechnology and to expand the contributions which  biochemical engineers can make to such growth.  Three opening  lectures will cover important aspects in this field.  These  include: (a) the biotechnology industry in the past half century  and what biochemicals engineers have contributed to advance this  industry, (b) the academic experimental research in the United  States, including food technology, biomass and biofuels, cell  culture, protein folding and bioanalytical instrumentation, and  (c) mathematical modeling in biochemical engineering, including  unstructured models, segregated models, cybernetic models,  metabolic flux analysis, and pattern recognition.  Technical  sessions will include: (1) bioenergy, chemical and renewable  resources (2) environmental issues and waste reduction (3)  metabolic engineering and quantitative physiology (4) biochemical  engineering in the medical industry, (5) biomaterials,  miniaturization and automation (6) bioprocess development and  manufacturing, (7) unit operations and scale up, and (8)  frontiers in bioprocessing.  This conference will provide and  important service to the research community in this area and  provide the opportunity to potentially impact future research  directions in a significant manner.  Information generated at  this conference will be useful for planning purposes for the  Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Programs in the BES  Division.  ***",
