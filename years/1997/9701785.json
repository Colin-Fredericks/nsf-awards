Research and implementation projects  are in two focus areas:  (a) identification and evaluation  of possible seismic hazards; and (b) development of loss  reduction strategies for the built environment.  Research  projects address seismic source modeling, ground motions  (i.e., synthesis, instrumentation, catalogs), site  characterization and response, ground failures,  soil-structure interaction, assessment and strengthening of  foundations and structures, risk and reliability, societal  response, and economic impact.  The initial focus is on  essential facilities (i.e., buildings that support functions  related to post-earthquake emergency response and disaster  management) and transportation networks (i.e., highways,  railroad systems, major waterways and shipping facilities,  and airports).  Research teams will use recent advances in  networking technology to interact.  The MAE Center's World  Wide Web communications link the core institutions, as well  as earthquake research centers around the world, and include  public education features.  Center goals include educating  the next generation of seismologists and earthquake  engineers, attracting under-represented minorities and women  to these technical disciplines, and implementing research  results in practice.  The MAE Center will be one of three  EERC's networked with an overarching governing board to  provide synergism in creating new knowledge, educating the  next generation of earthquake engineers and scientists, and  providing outreach to industry, government, pre-college  schools and potential user groups.",
