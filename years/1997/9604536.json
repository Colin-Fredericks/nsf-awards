 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morton  9604536         The correct functioning of the brain of all animals,  including humans, is dependent on chemical messengers.  Neurotransmitters are examples of such chemical messengers  which carry information from one nerve cell to another  within the brain. Nerve cells often respond to the presence  of the neurotransmitter by altering the levels of additional  chemical messengers, known as second messengers, within the  nerve cell.  Many hundreds of different neurotransmitters  have been identified in a wide variety of species. Some of  these are conserved between species and others are found in  only a few species.  In contrast, there are only a handful  of second messengers and these are conserved across almost  every species which has been studied.  Dr. Morton and Dr.  Nighorn  have identified a simple animal model system that  is ideal to examine the function of two specific second  messengers, guanylyl cyclase and nitric oxide synthase,  in  regulating neural processing and behavior.  They will  concentrate on the olfactory system since its structure and  function are very well characterized and they can manipulate  the chemical signals that the animals smell.  Using  sophisticated molecular and cellular techniques, Dr. Morton  and Dr. Nighorn will first clone the genes for both of these  enzymes.  They will then identify which cells in the  olfactory system contain these enzymes and hence utilize  these second messengers.  This enables them to examined how  chemical pheromonal cues will alter the system in the cells  which first perceive odors and the cells in the brain where  this information is first processed.  The results from these  studies are important to understanding the fundamental  properties of neural processing.  It will provide new  knowledge towards understanding the neural mechanisms  underlying the processing of vital information obtained from  the environment.",
