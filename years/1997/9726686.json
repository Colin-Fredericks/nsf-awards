 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will prototype and implement an Internet-based  data exchange architecture, the \"Authority Data Server\"  (ADS), which will nucleate a global information system for  taxonomic data in support of biodiversity researchers  worldwide.  The ADS prototype will use leading-edge  informatics technologies, such as the Common Object Request  Broker Architecture (CORBA) and Java, to replicate shared  community data -- initially among three institutions: The  Harvard University Herbaria, The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew  (UK), and The Australian National Herbarium.  These  institutions have formed a consortium whose goal is to make  the combined plant names data from the Gray Herbarium Index  (New World plant species), Index Kewensis (global plant  species), and Australian Plant Names Index available as a  shared and replicated authority resource on the Internet as  the combined \"Plant Names Index.\"    This SGER proposal requests funding to implement a proof-of-  concept using data from Royal Botanic Garden's \"Authors of  Plant Names\" - a community authority work endorsed by the  International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases as the  core data set.  A functional prototype ADS system will  demonstrate the feasibility of the larger \"Plant Names Index\"  as well as provide a working example of a distributed object  approach to authority data distribution. The establishment of  the latter will increase the adoption and integration of on-  line taxonomic authority files at research institutions  worldwide.  The resulting architecture and methods will be a  significant contribution to the development of the US  National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) within  the context of an international collaboration which is  unprecedented in the history of the biodiversity informatics  community.",
