 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Cooper  9618700    This award supports the US contribution to the Antarctic Seismic  Data Library System for Cooperative Research (SDLS), an  international agency under the auspices of the Scientific  Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and under mandates of the  Antarctic Treaty (ATCM Recommendation XVI-16), that is  responsible for providing open access worldwide to Antarctic  multichannel seismic reflection (MCS) data, including the more  than 135,000 km of data collected to date by more than 11  countries, including the U.S.    The SDLS was designed by consensus of Antarctic MCS data  collectors in April 1991, and was adopted by the Antarctic Treaty  in October 1991.  The SDLS serves the international community,  and now has 12 library branches in 11 countries.  MCS data are  kept at library branches on CD-ROMs, and each branch, overseen by  a senior Antarctic researcher, now has 27 CD-ROMs with over  60,000 km of MCS data. Processed data must be submitted to the  SDLS within 4 years of the time of data collection, to be kept in  the SDLS until 8 years from time of collection, after which data  will be sent to World Data Centers (i.e. National Geophysical  Data Center (NGDC)).    Since inception of the SDLS, the US Geological Survey (USGS)  worked with SCAR to manage the SDLS, and until 1994 provided  start-up funding to produce CD-ROMs and establish two U.S.  library branches.  In 1994, SCAR recommended that funding for  SDLS should come from Managers of National Antarctic Programs, to  assure that data collected by their country were entered into  SDLS in accord with Treaty mandates.  The U.S. Polar Research  Board recommended that funds to support U.S. participation in  SDLS (e.g. 2 current U.S. library branches, data submittal, CD-  ROM costs, etc.) be provided by NSF-OPP.    In 1994, USGS and Italy's Osservatorio Geofisico Sperimentale  (OGS) agreed, pending funding from U.S. and Italian National  Antarctic Programs, to jointly operate SDLS through the year  2000. Under thi s agreement, Italy would produce CD-ROMs and USGS  would provide general oversight and data distribution to SDLS  branches.  Individual countries would support their own SDLS  branches.    This Interagency Agreement provides a mechanism to support U.S.  oversight and participation in SDLS, with funding from the U.S.  Antarctic Program to USGS, who will provide general oversight for  SDLS and will implement U.S. participation in accord with ATCM  Recommendation XVI-12 and science recommendations of SCAR.",
