 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kendall N. Houk, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of   California, Los Angeles, is supported by the Organic Dynamics Program to   carry out experimental and theoretical investigations of organic reaction   rates and mechanisms.  Using several levels of theory, but with   particular focus on density functional theory (DFT), Dr. Houk will   examine a number of problems of chemical and biological importance,   including the femtosecond dynamics of pericyclic reactions, the   stereoselectivity and isotope effects in vinylcyclopropane-cyclopentene   rearrangements, the dynamics and anomalous activation parameters of   carbene rearrangements, and aromaticity and bond localization in   cyclocarbons and novel non-alternant polycyclic aromatics and   anti-aromatics.  Studies of the origins of stereoselectivity in biradical   reactions and of the use of DFT to probe biradical surfaces will also be   carried out.  Explorations of biological catalysis and transition   structures in enzyme- and antibody-catalyzed reactions will lead to the   development of synthetic enzyme mimics.  Theory and experiment play symbiotic roles in chemistry - experiments   lead to new observations, theoretical work is often required in order to   develop an understanding of these observations, and the resulting   theories then often lead to proposals for additional experimentation in   order to test their validity.  Professor Houk and his collaborators will   direct theoretical and experimental studies toward the elucidation of a   number of central reaction processes in organic and biological chemistry,   including the complex issue of how enzymes effect chemical   transformations.  These studies will lead not only to a fundamental level   of understanding of these important processes, but also to the discovery   of new reaction chemistry predicated on the theoretical findings.  The   studies of biological systems, for example, will lead to the development   of synthetic enzyme equivalents, compounds designed and synthesized to   effect chosen molecular transformations in a highly selective manner.",
