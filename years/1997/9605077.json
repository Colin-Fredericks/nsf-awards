 "awd_abstract_narration": "All life on this planet is ultimately dependent on  photosynthesis for its energy requirements.  At Arizona  State University the Center for the Study of Early Events in  Photosynthesis, comprised of faculty in the departments of  Botany, Chemistry and Biochemistry, takes an  interdisciplinary approach to understanding the energy  storage process carried out by photosynthetic organisms and  mimicking photosynthesis using artificial systems.  Undergraduate students will participate in the individual  research programs of the center faculty.  Projects will  include organic synthesis and spectroscopic studies of model  compounds, spectroscopic studies of bacterial and plant  photosynthetic reaction centers, and molecular biology and  genetics of photosynthetic systems.  Structured interaction  between faculty and student participants, including the  weekly photosynthesis seminar series, research group  meetings, instrumentation workshops and a concluding  undergraduate symposium, will help educate the students in  the extremely diverse modern approach to the study of  photosynthesis.  Student participants will be recruited from  targeted colleges and universities in the Southwest United  States with the help of local department chairs and  individual faculty.",
