 "awd_abstract_narration": "The wireless and high speed data communications industry is driven by the ability  to achieve high levels of integration in electronics.  The ever increasing  circuit complexity and demands to reduce power consumption have pushed available  technology to its limits.  These limits have been acceptable in the case of the  circuitry needed to realize the digital signal processing functions, but these  same limits are not at the threshold of compromising the performance of the  necessary analog signal processing circuitry which must be exist at the front end  of most systems.  The research here involves the development of a new concept in  the design of this analog circuitry that allows very low voltage operation of  high frequency circuits.  The \"Log Domain\" filters studied here permit the  development of next generation electronics that will operate using less power,  which translates, for example, to fewer batteries in portable equipment.    Log Domain, and more generically Exponential State Space (ESS), filters are the  result of a new paradigm in linear filter synthesis.  Specifically, the  nonlinearity of the transistors which comprise the active circuitry is designed  explicitly into the circuit formulation.  The investigators are studying the  mathematics of this design approach more fully so as to improve our understanding  of these circuits.  This research effort explores the effects of transistor  parasitics, such a finite beta, Early effect, and bulk resistance, on Log Domain  filter performance.  In addition, the state space mappings used to generate the  design equations for these filters are being studied to generalize the  formulation to include both class A and class AB filters.  Results on noise and  distortion performance of these filters is also being examined.  Finally, the  practical performance of these filters is being investigated using a test IC  fabricated by Analog Devices, Inc.",
