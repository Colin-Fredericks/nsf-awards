 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700490  Pedersen  Osteoporosis is the most common systemic bone disease which  causes an increased fracture risk in especially older women.  It is a debilitating and costly disease which a decade ago  was estimated to cost to the US society $6 - $7 billion.  Osteoporosis affects primarily the trabecular bone which is  the mesh-like structure in the center of a bone.  A  clinically accepted measure of the degree of osteoporosis is  the bone mass density (BMD), and so all instruments in  clinical use attempt to estimate BMD.  The dual-energy x-ray  absorptiometry (DEXA) technique is considered the most  accurate technique today, but an ultrasound transmission  technique, referred to as broadband ultrasound attenuation  (BUA), is also widely used.  Among the limitations of the  current techniques are: i) difficulty in diagnosing  osteoporosis in its early stages, ii) inability to carry out  localized measurements, and iii) only modest correlation  with fracture risk.    The goal of the proposed research is to generate preliminary  data based on a new ultrasound system which will utilize  both transmission and reflection measurements.  The  motivation for the research is to develop a technique which  can provide information about both the architecture of the  trabecular bone and BMD and thus be more sensitive to  changes in the trabecular bone structure and to changes in  bone mass density, i.e., to the degree of osteoporosis, than  existing techniques.  The attractiveness of ultrasound for  assessing osteoporosis lies in the relatively low cost, its  portability and the absence of ionizing radiation.    The measurements will utilize cow bone samples chosen to  cover a range of bone mass densities corresponding to the  densities from normal to osteoporotic bone in humans.  Several ultrasound parameters will be measured, such as  sound speed, absorption, and scattering in different  directions.  The ultrasound results will be compared to  results obtained with DEXA measurements which will be  carrie d out at Univ. of Massachusetts Medical Center.  ***",
