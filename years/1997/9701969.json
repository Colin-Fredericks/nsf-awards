 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Deming's research focuses on the use of transition metal   complexes as initiators for the synthesis of well-defined polypeptides.    Polymerization of alpha-amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides using various Cu,   Ni, Pd and Zn complexes provides a nonbiological alternative for the   preparation of polypeptides, including block co-polymers expected to   display properties rivaling those of naturally occurring structural   proteins.  Light scattering, viscometry, and x-ray diffraction, as well   as mechanical testing and processing, will permit characterization and   evaluation of the materials produced.  Professor Deming will introduce a   biomaterials curriculum at the undergraduate and graduate levels,   presenting core macromolecular courses and covering biopolymer synthesis   and the structure, dynamics, and processing of biomaterials.  With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the   research and educational activities of Professor Timothy J. Deming of the   Materials and Chemistry Departments at the University of California,   Santa Barbara.  Professor Deming's research focuses on the use of   transition metal complexes as initiators for the formation of   well-defined polypeptides, specifically targeting materials which are   expected to mimic naturally occurring structural polypeptides such as   spider silk and collagen.  These materials are of particular interest   because of their excellent physical properties, biocompatability,   biodegradability, and potential for biomedical applications.  Professor   Deming's educational activities are focused on the development of a new   curriculum that consists of a core sequence of courses covering the   science of large molecules and additional courses focused on biological   materials.  This training, at both the undergraduate and graduate levels,   will be complemented by student involvement in biomaterials research   programs, affording a unique opportunity to participate in   multidisciplinary research and laying the groundwork for effective future   collaborative research efforts.",
