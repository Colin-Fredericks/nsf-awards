Current treatment options for  degenerating tissues include fusion of the joint to prevent  further motion, or replacement of the joint with an artificial  prosthetic.  These treatments are limited in their effectiveness,  however, and are appropriate only for repair of end-stage  disease.  There is a great need for new methods of restoring the  mechanical function in these cartilaginous tissues.  Our long-  term interest is in developing a tissue-engineered approach to  controlling function in the intervertebral disc with a focus on  inhibiting or reversing progressive degeneration.  In this 4-year  plan, we propose a comprehensive research activity and  complementary educational program focused on biomechanics and  tissue engineering with application to the intervertebral disc.  Our research plan is focused on studies of a mechano-chemical  coupling mechanism in the intervertebral disc which influences  tissue function through biochemical composition.  This coupling  mechanism gives rise to swelling-induced residual stress and  strain fields in the anulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc  which may be important in contributing to the load-bearing  functions of the intervertebral disc.  The primary objective of  this research plan is to determine the function of these residual  stress and strain fields in the anulus fibrosus, as well as in  synthetic biomaterials with potential for disc repair.  The  motivating hypothesis is that these residual stresses and strains  significantly contribute to the mechanical function of the  intervertebral disc by improving its ability to provide for  compressive load-bearing in the spine.  A set of design criteria  based on residual stresses, residual strains, and compressive  behavior will be defined for the anulus  fibrosus, and used to  engineer a novel biomaterial for tissue repair in the  intervertebral disc.  The proposed research plan is organized  about four specific aims.  First, new experimental methods will  be developed to quantify the residual strain fields in the native  anulus fibrosus.  Second, theoretical model advancements will be  pursued to calculate the residual stress fields in the native  anulus fibrosus.  Third, experiments will be performed to  directly test the hypothesis that residual stresses and strains  modify the compressive load-bearing behavior of the anulus  fibrosus.  Fourth, these methods will be applied to evaluate  synthetic biomaterials supplied through industrial collaborations  for their utility in intervertebral disc repair.  Teams of  industrial and academic collaborators will work together to  develop and evaluate new biomaterials for restoring mechanical  function in the intervertebral disc.  A complementary educational  plan in biomechanics and tissue engineering has been designed for  students at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels.  First, an internship program will be organized for second-year  undergraduate students from underrepresented minority  backgrounds.  The broad objective of this aim is to maintain  interest in a subset of students who suffer from low retention  rates in the undergraduate engineering education.  Second, the  undergraduate and graduate engineering curriculum will be revised  to expand course offerings in biomechanics.  The broad objective  of this aim is to provide a direct channel for incorporating  applied research in educational programs at the undergraduate and  graduate level.  Third, a new hands-on biomechanics laboratory  will be developed for high school students as part of the Women  in Engineering Outreach Program at Duke.  The broad objective of  this aim is to provide female high school students with a problem-  solving and confidence-building experience in engineering, and  expose them to female faculty and  engineering graduate students  in leadership roles.  The integration of these research and  education plans is expected to promote partnerships for the  transfer of engineering research to the industrial sector, to  increase the numbers of underrepresented minorities and women in  engineering, to better prepare these students for achieving  excellence in engineering in an academic or industrial setting,  and to expose a broad base of students to the excitement of  discovery and learning that is characteristic of research in  engineering.  ***",
