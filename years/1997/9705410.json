It is  proposed  to  study the thermal convection of pressurized gases confined between two  parallel plates, a system which has been a paradigm for a wider  class  of pattern forming phenomena.  In particular the program will focus on  the investigation of the following two topics:  (1)  The  continued quantitative study of the bifurcation  diagram  of  inclined  layer  Rayleigh-Benard convection over a range  of  Rayleigh  numbers and inclination angles.  (2)  The detailed experimental and numerical investigations of Spatio-  temporal chaos in horizontal and inclined situations.  Details      in     the     research     can     be      found      at  http://www.milou.msc.cornell.edu.  %%%  This  is a renewal project to study locally ordered patterns, many  of  which abound in nature.  Examples are from cloud streets to ripples in  the windblown sand.  When observing these pattern over time it becomes  obvious  that  they  are constantly changing. We  call  this  behavior  spatio-temporal  chaos.   The  aim of this  research  project  is  the  experimental and numerical investigation of spatio-temporal  chaos  in  patterns of thermal convection.  When heating a shallow fluid layer at  the  bottom  and  cooling it at the top, above a  certain  temperature  difference  convection sets in form of convection rolls: hot fluid  is  rising  at the bottom and cold fluid is descending from the  top.   To  realize  a  system  that  has  many  convection  rolls  we  are  using  pressurized  gases.   We investigate the pattern  evolution  by  using  digital  imaging and image processing techniques and also large  scale  numerical investigations using the latest supercomputer technology.  ***",
