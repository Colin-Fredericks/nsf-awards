 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research part of this CAREER project develops accurate and  efficient numerical methods for a number of important problems  including high relative accuracy (tiny percentage error)  eigenvalue and singular value computations, updating the singular  value decomposition (SVD), and distance problems in linear  systems and control computations.    Although current methods for solving them are abundant, many  important questions remain unanswered. For example, a large  number of recent papers describe numerical methods to compute all  eigenvalues and singular values to high relative accuracy for a  few isolated special classes of matrices, but a common  explanation and a common numerical method are missing. As another  example, the ability to rapidly update the SVD is critical in  signal processing applications since problems are often real-  time, but none of the current methods is efficient enough for  this purpose.    A goal is to provide a common explanation and a common numerical  method for high relative accuracy eigenvalue and singular value  computations. It turns out that the common explanation and common  numerical method are applicable to many new interesting classes  of matrices, arising from areas as diverse as combinatorics and  numerical solution of ODE's and PDE's. The project also aims at  providing rapid methods for updating the SVD, hence removing a  major bottleneck in SVD-based methods for various signal  processing applications.    The education part of the project is to develop software tools so  that students taking abstract mathematics courses can clearly  envision and play with the sometimes abstract objects and results  on the World-Wide Web with vivid graphical display. The plan also  includes new graduate courses in numerical linear algebra with  scientific and engineering applications.",
