 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prof.  Raul F. Lobo will study the host-guest interactions of organic structure-directing agents in as-synthesized high-silica zeolites, in order to obtain correlations between organic structure and pore structure. The synthesis will evolve systematically from pure silica cathrasils to high-silica silica-alumina zeolites, utilizing various derivatized alkylammonium salt templates, and will affect cage and pore structures. Additionally, Prof. Lobo will investigate how to control the density and location of defect and Al3+  sites during the synthesis. Thermogravimetry will be used to measure internal volume. Multinuclear solid-state NMR experiments will be used to characterize the interaction, deuterium NMR to investigate the dynamic state of organic molecules as a function of temperature and molecule size, and NMR of other selected labels of the organic molecule to describe the molecule motion in several zeolite structures.  Heteronuclear chemical shift correlation of 29Si and 1H will be used to obtain information on the molecular arrangement with respect to the location of tetrahedral Al3+  cations and zeolitic framework defects. To characterize the defects, also X-ray diffraction experiments will be done, for which 25 ? single crystals of pure ZSM-11 will be synthesized. The NMR experiments and in particular the spin-echo double resonance (SEDOR, 23Na{1H}) and rotational echo double resonance (REDOR, 29Si{23Na}) will be done to determine the spatial proximity of organic and inorganic components of the as-synthesized zeolite. The proposed research will help to improve the design and synthesis of zeolitic materials. This information will also be reflected in more accurate molecular mechanics and quantum mechanical models used for template selection and zeolite synthesis, and will improve the molecular simulation models of transport and diffusion in zeolites. Extrinsically, it will provide a stronger fundamental basis for the design of catalysts and molecular sieve separation materials with tailor ed pore structure and active site distribution. These chemically active materials support a major fraction of the chemical industry, including petrochemical, fuels, fine chemical, agrochemical, and others.",
