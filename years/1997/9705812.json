 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705812  Gorelick    Among the most pressing problems in hydrogeology is describing heterogeneity in fractured-rock systems.  Accurate 3D characterization of the hydraulic properties controlling fracture flow is required for predictive models of hydraulic head changes and solute migration.  The problem has been difficult because typically a single type of data (e.g., hydraulic tests) has been used to deduce the complex pattern of fracture flow paths and flow barriers.  Individual analysis of data set may lead to \"maps\" of fractured rock geometry and hydraulic properties that are inconsistent with each other.  We suggest that simultaneous inversion of multiple types of information ranging from geophysical data (local and cross well radar) to hydraulic tests to tracer tests provides an approach that can identify fractured-rock aquifer heterogeneities including fracture zone geometry, connectivity, and transmissive properties.  Each type of data is analyzed with the appropriate physical simulation  models, including ones for wave propagation, hydraulic head changes, and solute migration.  We propose a coupled-inversion process based on a very flexible optimization procedure known as simulated annealing.  The method will yield images that are consistent with all the types of data (e.g., heads, concentrations, radar) and indicate fracture-zone geometry, hydraulic conductivity estimates, and spatially variable uncertainty estimates.  It will be developed and applied to both synthetic and field data.  Our past experience for sedimentary deposits has shown that synthetic data analysis exercises can promotes rapid development and testing of the \"coupled\" inversion approach.  Once the benefits and limitations of the proposed method are understood, application to complex field data provides a true test of the method.  The field data will be from the fractured-rock experimental site at Mirror Lake, New Hampshire.  To date, the USGS has collected radar tomography, seismic tomography, borehole geophysical log s, hydraulic test data and tracer test data.  In what we consider to be a unique opportunity, they are willing to make these newly collected data available to us.  The project will provide insight into the information that can be extracted from different types of data, the relative worth of data, and how joint analysis of different types of data can be used to deduce fracture-zone architecture.",
