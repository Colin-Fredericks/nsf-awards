 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Kopotun      Kopotun will work on the area of Constrained Approximation.   In many applications, it is desirable for the mathematical model  to preserve certain geometric properties (e.g., monotonicity and  convexity) of the data.  This is the subject that Constrained (or   Shape Preserving) approximation deals with. Kopotun has obtained   a number of results in the area of approximation by polynomials   that preserve shape (or which satisfy other constraints).   He will work on estimates of the rate of constrained polynomial  approximation  in the integral metrics and in nonlinear constrained   approximation.    Kopotun will work on a variety of topics in the field of Constrained   Approximation.  Approximation theory is one of the areas of   Analysis that interacts more actively with applications.   In Constrained Approximation theory the objective is to approximate  a certain model preserving certain geometric characteristics of  the model. A major open area here is the nonlinear  case of  constrained approximation.",
