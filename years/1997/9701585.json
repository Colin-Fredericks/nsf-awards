Student protests that occurred between 1930 and 1990 will be investigated using data from student newspapers at forty-eight U.S. colleges.  Data on relevant covariates of protest will be gathered from archival sources.  Event history methods, which take into account the timing of events, will be the primary method of analysis.  The data gathered will be used to empirically test theoretical propositions regarding the location and levels of student protest over time, which will enable the investigator to refine social movement theory. This research will also increase our understanding of how social movements shape U.S. college campuses and society at large.  ****   ??",
