 "awd_abstract_narration": "Duke University has been selected as one of ten recipients of the National Science Foundation's Recognition Awards for the Integration of Research and Education.  Duke has embarked on a comprehensive and institution-wide effort to integrate research and education in the major aspects of university life.  A Center for Teaching and Learning has been established to facilitate: a) development of  discovery-based courses; b) transfer of cognitive research results on learning styles to classroom practices; and c) evaluate teaching effectiveness of faculty for consideration in salary, promotion, and tenure decisions.  Campus networking (including dorm rooms) now provides students with access to Web-based course resources and linkages to faculty research.  A Preparing Future Faculty program seeks to introduce graduate students to effective teaching methods that engage students in research and discovery-based activities.  A new science building juxtaposes classroom teaching and faculty research.  The university's efforts to integrate research and education were designed to create a new cultural paradigm on campus.  Taken together, Duke University's basic restructuring of the undergraduate curriculum, creation of a mechanism that prepares graduate students to excel in their future teaching, and a significant revision of the faculty appraisal system represent profound change.  The university is being awarded $500,000 with the goal of expanding, documenting, and disseminating its exemplary practices over the coming three years.  Plans for the use of the award funds include: creating and implementing two new science and technology course clusters; implementing a senior capstone experience; expanding the summer orientation program for graduate teaching assistants; conducting an on-campus dissemination workshop for sharing program results; and conducting a three-day national conference to disseminate the Duke University model.",
