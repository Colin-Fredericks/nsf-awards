 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dybas  9727681    A major issue in ecological and evolutionary physiology is the  relationship among the traits of complex organisms, organisms'  ability to exploit diverse environments, and species'  persistence in time. The proposed investigation examines the  heat-shock protein Hsp70 in Drosophila to address this issue.  In response to heat or other stresses, nearly all organisms  express heat-shock proteins (Hsps), highly-conserved proteins  that contribute to stress tolerance by functioning as molecular  chaperones. Research supported by a previous NSF award has  established that experimental manipulation of copy number of  the hsp70 gene of Drosophila, which encodes Hsp70, is  sufficient to cause changes in thermotolerance. The proposed  research will build upon this finding to examine the  physiological mechanism of Hsp70 function; i.e., how thermal  stress disrupts function and how Hsp70 protects against heat  damage or aids recovery from it. This issue will be examined in  the larval gut of Drosophila, which is especially susceptible  to heat damage. Electron microscopy will be used to determine  which particular tissues and cells are most vulnerable to heat  damage, and to document protection of these tissues and cells  by the heat-shock protein Hsp70. Larval Drosophila that differ  in Hsp70 expression will be examined. The projected outcome of  the proposed research has immense potential to integrate  molecular, genetic, functional, and evolutionary perspectives  to advance understanding of adaptation.",
