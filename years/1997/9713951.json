 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Award: CMS 97-13951  P. K. Banerjee et al., SUNY Buffalo  \"Pile Group Under Transient-Impact Loading\"      This research focuses on the principal force experiences in  transportation and waterfront structures during impact which  is transient horizontal loading.  Such loads are often  transmitted to the structure's foundation supported on  groups of piles and/or drilled shafts.  State-of-practice  design for lateral loading of pile and drilled shaft  foundations used beam-on-elastic-foundation analysis to  model this dynamic loading.  In this analysis, load shedding  from a pile to the soil is represented by \"p-y\" springs in  which the soil response (p-y or force versus deflection  curves) is modeled as a series of discrete nonlinear  springs. Although p-y curves have been empirically modified  to take into account many of the observed phenomena such as  non-linearity, slow cyclic response, shadow zones and group  interaction factors, etc., the propagation of dynamic  disturbance from pile-to-pile in a group has never been  considered.  Therefore, the use of these springs for dynamic  loading has !  to be significantly improved and soundly validated by  combined experimental and analytical research.    The objective of this research is to develop and validate an  improved method of analysis for the design of pile groups  (including drilled shafts) subjected to transient lateral  impact loads.  The research tasks encompass:  a) a critical  study of the transient impact behavior of pile groups  founded in layered media, both analytically and  experimentally, b) development of improved methods of  analysis; c) testing and validation of the proposed new  methods; and d) implementation of the improved methods in a  numerical code.  Experimental research will involve analysis  of existing load test data as well as creation of new test  data for testing and validation of the improved analytical  method.    The work will have national applicability as well as an  immediate impact.  From the re sults of this study, revisions  can be recommended to AASHTO for inclusion in rationally  applicable design specifications for the design of new  structures subjected to vessel impact loading.        ****",
