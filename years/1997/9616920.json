 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shub  9616920       The investigator continues studies of the complexity theory  of continuous problems and dynamical systems.  The main issues  are: 1) the construction of a theory of computation and  complexity which speaks to scientific computation and numerical  analysis, and 2) the extent of validity of statistical robustness  as a property of dynamical systems, especially chaotic dynamical  systems.  The research involved is of interest to a large class of  mathematicians and has implications for the relations between  abstract mathematics and computer science on the one hand and  abstract mathematics and physics and engineering on the other.       Complexity theory develops bounds on how much work a method  requires to produce the solution to a typical problem in a class  of problems.  Common and important examples include methods to  find the solutions of a system of linear or nonlinear equations.  Part of the project indeed at aims at just this issue.  Equation  solving is at the heart of much of mathematics and, together with  its computational aspects, is a main way that mathematics is used  by engineering, physics, economics, and many other disciplines.  The other part of the project studies questions about much alike  certain kinds of chaotic systems may be.  Predicting the specific  behavior of a chaotic system is difficult, because small errors  in any measurement of the system are amplified.  But chaotic  systems may be relatively nice in a statistical sense; if so,  then sets of samples measurements may provide useful information  about the system's behavior even though any single measurement is  error-prone.  The investigator studies these properties in  dynamical systems and particularly in chaotic systems.  There are  important implications for the statistical analysis of chaotic  systems --- hence practical consequences for weather and climate  studies, agriculture, and engineering.",
