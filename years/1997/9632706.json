 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Cioslowski of Florida State University is being supported by   the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program.  During the next   three years his group will cary out a comprehensive research program that   aims at gaining theoretical knowledge of the electron-electron   interactions in molecules will be carried out. The program will involve a   suite of five innovative approaches to efficient computation, accurate   approximation, and detailed analysis of the electron pair density and   related two-electron quantities.   High-performancealgorithms for the   evaluation of the electron intracule and extracule densities on arbitrary   grids of points will be developed.  New applications of the   Hiller-Sucher-Feinberg identity will afford accurate electron intracule   densities that possess proper coalescence cusps at the origin, opening an   avenue to fully non-empirical correlation energy functionals of the   one-electron density matrix. Topological analysis of various components   of the intracule and extracule densities will provide intriguing insights   into electron correlation in molecules, whereas partitioning of   two-electron properties will elucidate the relative importance of intra   and interatomic correlation effects.  A new approach to assembling the   correlation holes from approximately transferable contributions will   yield highly accurate density functionals for the correlation energy.     The planned research will result in new approaches to computing   properties of large molecules that are of importance to diverse branches   of chemistry.  The introduction of new correlation energy functionals   will allow such computations to be carried out more rapidly and   accurately, making it possible to study electronic structures of an   ever-increasing number of chemical species.  Consequently,   first-principle modeling of biochemical systems, new pharmaceuticals, and   advanced materials will become more feasible than ever before.",
