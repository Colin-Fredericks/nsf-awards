 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9714049  Sirkis       A structurally embedded fiber optic transducer of 1 cm  gage length will be developed, capable of simultaneously  measuring the (1) temperature, (2)normal strain parallel to  the optical fiber axis, (3) secondary principal strains  in  the plane perpendicular to the optical fiber axis, and (4)  orientation of the secondary principal plane, inside a  structural composite material. Successful development of the  proposed fiber optic sensor technology will provide  experimentalists with a capability that is simply  unavailable today - the ability to measure key components of  the strain state inside structural materials.       This  proposed transducer is based on cascading (1) an  in-line fiber etalon (ILFE) sensor, (2) a saturated Bragg  grating written into a standard low birefringent (LoBi)  optical fiber, and (3) a normal (unsaturated) Bragg grating  written into an elliptical clad, stress-induced high  birefringent (1-liBi) optical fiber. The 11,FE sensor has  very small intrinsic temperature sensitivity, and is  sensitive to only the axial strain component in the host  structure. As a result, the ILFE component of the proposed  sensor leads to one of the five requisite independent  optical measurements required to solve for the five sought  after Thermo-mechanical field variables (three normal  strains, temperature, and secondary principal direction).  The saturated Bragg grating written in the LoBi-Fiber  produces two reflected Bragg wavelengths, thereby yielding  two more independent optical measurements. Finally, the  Bragg grating written into the elliptical clad HiBi optical  fiber takes advantage of residual birefringence coupled with  this fiber's anisotropic mechanical response to yield the  final requisite two independent optical measurements. The  multiaxial thermo-mechanical strain sensor will be  demodulated using a hybrid coherence division/wavelength  division multiplexing technique coupled with scanning,  dithered Fabry-Perot filter Bragg grating dem odulation and  path-matched differential interferometry with pseudo  heterodyne ILFE demodulation. The thermo-mechanical strains  will be deduced from the resulting optical measurements  through the use of composites micromechanics models based on  concentric cylinders modeling techniques and nested multiple  inclusions models, The sensor system will be evaluated  through tests of progressively increasing complexity,  starting with uniaxial tension of an unembedded sensor and  ending with the combination of temperature and transverse  compression applied to AS4/3501-6 graphite/epoxy laminates  with embedded sensors.       The  potential uses of the proposed sensor assembly  include: (1) material measurements to aid constitutive model  development; (2) field measurements to verify micromechanics  models; (3) real-time in-situ health monitoring; (4) process  monitoring; and (5) residual stress  measurements. This  sensor can provide information to engineers and scientists  that is Simply unavailable today, thus enabling the  realization of more cost-effective, safe and highperformance  systems.***",
