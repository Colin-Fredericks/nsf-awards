 "awd_abstract_narration": "9752985       This project will result in a set of high-quality, interactive  learning tools for organic chemistry.  It has three main  components: the designing and writing interactive materials for the  EMOC website, developing tools for facilitating alternative methods  of assessment, and evaluating existing and future materials as they  become available on the EMOC website.  The materials are being  developed using hypertext markup language (HTML) with interactivity  provided by common gateway interface (CGI) scripts written in the  Perl scripting language.  Database interface tools will be  developed for the Oracle Database Server using the OraPerl add-on's  to Perl.  This combination of technologies provides flexibility  while serving the intended audience through commonly available  software interfaces.       Evaluation will be highly interactive and consist of free-  response student surveys as well as individual interviews and focus  group meetings.  Student attitude towards both the interactive  technologies and the learning impact of the materials will be  surveyed.  The development of interactive database tools removes  the 'bookkeeping' related with authentic, process-oriented  assessment of large introductory undergraduate courses.       This project advanced the development of learning environments  for undergraduate organic chemistry courses involving large numbers  of students.",
