 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of  this project is to improve our understanding of investment behavior by documenting and explaining the reallocation of physical capital across economic sectors.  The project will address issues such as:  How specific is capital to a particular firm or economic sector? How costly is it to move physical capital from one use to another? and How might such investment behavior influence the business cycle?  A new data set on the sale of individual items of equipment will be created and analyzed. These data will be used to study the cross-industry flow of used capital and the economic depreciation resulting from such flows.  How economic depreciation rates depend on whether capital stays within an industry or flows across industries will analyzed in order to quantify the specificity of capital.  Preliminary work suggests that capital loses much of its value when it is moved across industries.  In addition, the gross flows of capital using firm-level accounting data will be analyzed.  These data will be used to analyze the relationship between gross additions and gross subtractions to firms' capital.  These data will also be used to estimate the length of time taken by firms to decide to discontinue operations. These decision lags might be quantitatively important.  Indeed, the decision lag owing to uncertainty could be longer than the lag in selling and reinstalling the capital once the decision has been made.   Finally, a general equilibrium simulation model will be used to analyze the aggregate effects of allocative shocks under costly capital mobility.  The specification and parameterization of this model will derive from the empirical findings of this research.  This model will help quantify the role of capital reallocation in the business cycle.  Given the potentially high costs and long lags for reallocating  capital, the business-cycle effects may be substantial.",
