 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues are developing new  theory and computational algorithms to improve and extend  current methods for analysis of biological macromolecules  and their assemblies by x-ray diffraction analysis.  The new  algorithms specifically target problems where the molecules  are, or can be, oriented, but not crystallized.  The number  of such systems is large; including nucleic acids, muscle  proteins, viruses, bacteriophages and some membrane  proteins.  These new algorithms will extend current methods  to systems that are currently inaccessible, and will reduce  the time and cost involved in such studies.  The structural  information obtained from such studies contributes to our  understanding or the structure-function relationships in  such systems.    The manipulation of biological molecules and processes is  fundamental to the prevention and treatment of disease, and  to the development of new, and environmentally friendly,  biomaterials.  Success depends, however, on a detailed  understanding of the structure of the molecules at the  atomic level, and relationships to their behavior and  properties.  This project is concerned with new  computational methods for studying the atomic structures of  certain biological molecules using x-ray diffraction  analysis.  The approach is a synthesis of techniques from  mathematics and modern computing, to model and analyze  biological systems.  The new algorithms being developed will  broaden the scope, and improve the efficiency, of such  investigations.",
