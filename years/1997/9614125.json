 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614125 Ganz  This research project aims for greater atomic level understanding of thin film epitaxy of semiconductor materials.  New investigations utilizing an atom tracker are proposed for atomic resolution studies of diffusion at speeds 100 to 1000 times faster than previously possible with tunneling microscopy.  These studies will be incorporated into existing studies by the PI of nucleation and growth on silicon surfaces using tunneling microscopy at elevated temperatures. The atom tracker results will be linked to conventional high resolution room temperature STM images and high temperature STM movie studies to enhance and quantify understanding of diffusion and growth on the Si(001) surface. %%% The project is multidisciplinary combining materials physics with materials synthesis and processing studies including advanced characterization tools and analysis methods to address forefront research issues in a topical area of high technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of processing and fabricating electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry.  Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
