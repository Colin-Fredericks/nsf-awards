 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706887    Li    This research is on geometric problems  in  three related areas, all based on solving nonlinear second order partial   differential equations of various types. The first concerns an analogue  of the Yamabe problem on manifolds with boundaries: To study, for a given  compact Riemannian manifold with boundary (M,g), the existence  and compactness of metrics  conformal to g that have constant  scalar curvature and constant boundary mean curvature.  This is equivalent  to the study of the existence and compactness of positive solutions to a  certain semilinear elliptic equation with critical exponent satisfying  certain nonlinear Neuman boundary conditions.  The second concerns  the problem of   prescribing scalar curvature on the n-sphere.  The problem is better  understood in dimension n=2,3,4.  The goal here is to search for good  existence criterion in dimension n >= 5  that allow the prescribed  curvature functions K to be  Morse functions.    The third concerns the study of degenerate Monge-Ampere equations,  especially those arising from geometry.     Partial differential equations arise naturally from physics, geometry,  and many other fields and form a basis for mathematical modeling  of the physical world.  The role of mathematical analysis is not so  much to create the equations as it is to create qualitative and quantitative  information about the solutions.   This may include answers to questions  about existence, uniqueness, smoothness, and growth. In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.",
