 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kneib  9629621  Mechanisms by which materials are exchanged across boundaries within landscapes are crucial to ecosystem functioning, yet are not well understood. Flowing water is a powerful force that can shape spatial patterns within landscapes and provides a medium for the transport of material across the boundary between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Flooding events, which temporarily blur this boundary, enhance material fluxes not only through the hydraulic movement of passive particles but also via the active migrations of fishes and other aquatic organisms (nekton). Spatial patterns, such as those defined by the complexity of drainage channels that direct the flow of water through a landscape, may have profound effects on ecological processes that link components of the environment. Drainages of freshwater rivers and tidal marshes are similar in appearance, but marshes differ from freshwater lotic systems in that their drainage channels experience a bidirectional flow of tidal water and flood their banks more frequently -- as much as twice daily. These features of the marsh environment make it an attractive arena in which to explore the role of nekton in the movement of production between landscape elements, and to determine if these fluxes are affected by complexity in the structure of the landscape. The proposed research will show whether drainage patterns within a marsh landscape influence the transfer of intertidal production to the subtidal estuary via nekton populations. This will be accomplished by comparing species- and size-specific nekton densities, growth, movements, diets and tidal dynamics across a series of marsh sites representing a range of drainage patterns from simple to complex. The research is guided by a conceptual model that links spatial patterns in the landscape and temporal patterns of tidal dynamics with nekton life histories, movements and trophic interactions across a range of temporal and spatial scales. Findings will contribute needed empirical data to  the area of landscape ecology that deals with how spatial patterns affect ecological interactions across boundaries within landscapes. The research directly addresses a long-standing issue regarding the functional role of salt marshes in trophic support of adjacent estuarine and coastal ocean ecosystems. It also is directly applicable to questions involving the success or failure of current efforts to create or restore valued functions of coastal marshes that have been degraded or destroyed. Because marsh mitigation efforts frequently involve the alteration of tidal drainage patterns, an understanding of how drainage complexity relates to the role of marshes in providing trophic support for fisheries species is needed to insure success in recovering some of the lost functional value of these critical estuarine nurseries.",
