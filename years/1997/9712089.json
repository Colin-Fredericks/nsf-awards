Two types of innovation exposure will be examined in this study: an informational video and brochure.  To examine the dynamics of the household response to the innovation, a panel survey of San Francisco Bay Area residents exposed to the intelligent station car concept will be conducted.  The information gathered in this survey will be used to evaluate several dynamic household hypotheses.  For instance, a household's valuing response to an innovation's mobility limitations (e.g., range) will be altered by exposure/time with the new technology.  Dynamics in the household's valuing response will be revealed in attitudes, activities, and travel behavior of the household and reflected in the travel diaries and surveys administered to study participants.  The insights gained from this study could be used by individuals in both the public and private sectors to assess the demand for the intelligent station car innovation and other related technologies e.g., smart taxis, smart paratransit, and car-sharing organizations.  A wide-range of transportation technologies could benefit from the understanding gained from this study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
