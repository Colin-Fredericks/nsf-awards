 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory research project investigates an innovative idea on design and fabrication techniques for low-cost and high-performance novel fiber sensors.  The proposed approach represents a major breakthrough over the traditional optical fiber sensors currently available but not widely used in practices due to their lack of robustness, low reliability and high cost.  Major research tasks in this project will include (1) development of fabrication techniques; (2) development of a prototype optical fiber displacement and accelerometer, together with their central signal processing units; (3)  experimental investigation on sensor performance; (4) study multiplexing techniques and develop a prototype multipoint sensor network; and (5) improvement of existing designs.  The sensor heads may also be embedded into materials, typically in advanced composites, to monitor their properties and behavior not only during processes but also over their service life.   This is an emerging research area in both mechanical and civil engineering.  The  project demonstrates a preliminary work on untested and novel ideas.   In addition, the project involves in a multi-disciplinary work in the areas of materials processing, mechanical, and civil structure.  With the attractive combination of high performance and low cost, the sensors can have unlimited applications in monitoring health conditions of various material and structure systems ranging from mechanical, aerospace, to civil  infrastructure systems. The research findings could significantly contribute to the development of a new generation of material and structural systems equipped with smart sensing capability to ensure system integrity, minimize maintenance cost and maintain material and structural longevity.",
