 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concurrency control and recovery are essential components of transaction systems. Whereas much  research has gone into concurrency, resulting in a wealth of results integrated into a fairly mature  theory, recovery has remained limited to mostly implementation-specific knowledge. This is undesirable for  technical and economic reasons: lack of a model of recovery precludes meaningful comparisons between  alternatives, in terms of their cost and functionality, and forces the reinvention of basic abstractions  and the adoption of ad-hoc approaches. Motivated by these inadequacies and by the need to support recovery  for applications such as information retrieval, workflows, and mobile computing this project is  developing means for specifying the recovery requirements of an application, identifying the recovery  abstractions and protocols needed to realize complex recovery requirements, working toward the modular  construction of recovery based on standard abstractions and protocols, developing ways to demonstrate the  correctness of this construction, and enumerating the tradeoffs involved in implementing given recovery  requirements. All of these facilitate the adjustment of recovery to changing infrastructure support and  application requirements. In sum, this project aims to enable the crafting of efficient and correct  recovery, in the conventional and advanced transaction realms, thereby influencing the way emerging database  applications can be supported.",
