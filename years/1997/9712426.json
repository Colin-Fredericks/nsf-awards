 "awd_abstract_narration": "A  new application for object recognition, indexing image sets in  digital  libraries, demands recognition strategies that  are  (1)  effective  in  cluttered  scenes and (2)  effective  for  objects  recognised  at  a class level - for example, people  or  animals.  These  needs can be met by recognition algorithms that  interpret  the  world  in  terms of stylised properties in  shape,  shading,  texture  and  colour,  which  are caled  'primitives.'   In  this  approach,  objects  are  represented by a collection  of  spatial  relationships between primitives.  The primitives themselves  are  used  as  a source of grouping constraints.  Recognition proceeds  by  grouping together features or regions that could represent  a  primitive,  and then assembling groups of primitives  that  could  have come from an object.  There is no explicit 3D reasoning, but  the  grouping processes may contain a great deal of  implicit  3D  reasoning.   This  approach to shape and  to  recognition  unites  themes  studied  in active research programs in computer  vision,  both in the United States and in the European Community.  A joint  workshop, involving both US and E.C. participants (for whom  E.C.  funding will be available), will explore representations that use  grouping  and symmetry as a recognition  strategy.   Topics  will  include: shading primitives, image shape constraints that  result  from     volumetric    primitives,    building     grouping-based  representations  and  overall strategies for object  recognition.  The  workshop will be held in Erice, Sicily, in early 1998.   The  proceedings will be published as a volume in the Springer Lecture  Notes in Computer Science series.",
