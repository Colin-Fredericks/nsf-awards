 "awd_abstract_narration": "While linear approximations and models possess simplicity and tractability in  analysis, most real life problems entail nonlinear effects.  Nonlinear system of  current interest in signal processing and communications are encountered with  satellite links, high-speed telephone channels, power amplifiers, magnetic and  optical recording systems.  This research is exploring novel techniques for  identification, performance analysis, and mitigation of nonlinear systems.  The  goal is to use state-of-the-art statistical signal processing tools to analyze  long-standing issues in nonlinear modeling and applications to tele-  communications problems.    The present approach is taking a fresh look at the traditional Volterra model and  exploiting carefully designed cyclostationary inputs that result in closed-form  kernel expressions with input-output data.  Such solutions will apply to finite  memory Volterra models of any order, reduce computational complexity and noise  effects even with relatively short data records, and allow for analytical  performance evaluation using variance expressions.  The investigator plans to  simulate and test the resulting algorithms using real data received from  satellite links where amplifiers are driven to the nonlinear saturation region.   She is also studying blind nonlinear Volterra system identification that relies  on single or multi-sensor data only.  The potential of blind nonlinear channel  estimation and equalization is of paramount importance when no training inputs  are available, or when new communicators join a multiport broadcast and  transmission cannot be interrupted for training.",
