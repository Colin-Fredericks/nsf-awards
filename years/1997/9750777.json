 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mathematics department oat College of DuPage proposes to establish two computer classrooms with eighteen computers in each room for the purposes of exploring the integration of computing technology into the mathematics curriculum.  fourteen additional copies of the software will be installed in an open lab for students to use when class is not in session.  The department has some technology for demonstration purposes, but limited technology for student use in the classroom.  The goal of the project team is to achieve the following six outcomes during the proposed two-year project:    Improve mathematics teaching and learning through the increased use of symbolic algebra and graphing technology;    Provide staff development workshops for secondary and postsecondary mathematics teachers and faculty, to be conducted by the team of project investigators, on the use of technology in the classroom;    Meet the recommendations of the Illinois Articulation Initiative of the Illinois Board of Higher Education to address the quantitative literacy needs of postsecondary students;  and    Meet the goals of curriculum reform set forth by the American Mathematical Association for two-year Colleges and the Mathematics Association of America;    To achieve these outcomes, mathematics faculty and students will engage in discovery learning to be led by classroom instructors.  Classes will be modeled to enable students to do mathematics as it is done in the workplace.",
