 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614789  Rubin       This research is to build on recent success with precise earthquake locations at Kilauea, Hawaii, to learn more about the interaction between magmatic and tectonic processes within the volcano.  Seismicity combined with high deformation rates and good geodetic coverage permit quantitative interpretation of the earthquake relocation results using two- and three-dimensional elastic boundary element models.  Earlier relocations from the volcano's east rift in 1991 delineate a left-lateral strike-slip fault zone that is 2.5 km long but only 100 m tall over much of its length.  Both this remarkable ribbon-like geometry and the long-term pattern of moment release are in quantitative agreement with a mechanical model in which the rift-zone stress was \"reset\" by dike intrusion in 1982, and subsequently loaded by geodetically-inferred motion of Kilauea's deep rift.  These types of models are of importance to estimation of earthquake hazards in this seismically active zone.  This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***  ??",
