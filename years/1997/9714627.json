This project will build on   a joint program in theoretical astrophysics developed in 1987 thru  1992 between the University of Chicago and the Tata Institute of  Fundamental Research (TIFR).  The current project is under the  direction of David Schramm, University of Chicago and Pijushpani  Bhattacharjee, Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bangalore.     These nodel institutions will serve as organizational centers rather  than sole research venues for the participants.  The research will  build on the earlier effort which in the beginning had a natural  focus on the Supernovae, and later on the role of the quark-hadron  phase transition in the early universe and ultra high energy cosmic  ray interactions.  The current objectives will be to work out  cosmological and astrophysical implications of phase transitions in  the early universe, particularly the implications of topological  defects and electroweak baryogenesis; and to study the phase space  distribution of dark matter in the Galaxy and the phenomenon of  gravitational lensing as a probe of large-scale distribution of dark  matter in the universe.    Scope:  This collaboration is an outgrowth of a joint research  program among several of the most distinguished astrophysicists in  the US and India.  The output was most impressive including the   pioneering work by the Indian PI.  This award will support several  short-term visits by Indian coPIs and postdocs, as well as visits to  India by the US PI.  In addition to the advances in fundamental  knowledge expected from the research, the exchange of ideas with  Indian leaders of cosmology will be valuable for the US scientific  community.       ***",
