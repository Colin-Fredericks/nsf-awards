Experimentation with  surface and grain boundary chemical characteristics should  lead to a better understanding of their relationship to  oxidation and wear properties and to such basic phenomena as  surface or interface reactions, diffusion, and tribochemical  interactions in the silicon nitride ceramic system.    This project will combine the expertise of the Korean team  in the processing and sintering of ceramics with Dr. Du's  extensive work on the corrosion resistance of these  materials.  Silicon nitride ceramics are used extensively in advanced  engines and for other structural applications.  Thus, the  oxidation and wear of these ceramics presents important  engineering issues.  ***",
