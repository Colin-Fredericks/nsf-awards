 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614882  Urban    The overall objective of this research is to investigate  thin film materials deposited from beams of nanoparticles  (clusters), a fraction of which may be ionized and  accelerated to the growing surface.  There are three focus  areas:   synthesis of intense nanoparticle beams, nucleation  and growth of thin films deposited from nanoparticle beams,  and the modeling of both particle synthesis and subsequent  film growth.  In the area of synthesis, the objectives are  to explore the limitations of the pure expansion method and  build two new sources, using simple vaporization with gas  aggregation and magnetron sputtering with gas-assisted  aggregation.  The prime objective in the thin film materials  properties area is to fabricate films and investigate  nanophase dependent properties of materials including  magnetic and semiconductor materials.  A second objective is  to investigate films in which the nanoparticles are  exploited to influence the film (microstructure, surface  roughness, density, stresses, etc.) without preserving the  particles, but rather by taking advantage of super-thermal  condensation and transport properties of the beams of  incident particles.  The final focus area improves  mathematical models of the nanoparticle synthesis process  and the phenomena occurring as they arrive at the growing  surface.  This is carried out using existing molecular  dynamics simulations.  %%%  This research has a direct impact on materials science, both  in the development of nanophase thin films and in obtaining  other novel film microstructures resulting from the unique  transport, nucleation, and film growth mechanisms connected  with nanoparticle depositing beams.  ***",
