 "awd_abstract_narration": "This technology development project deals with acoustic travel-  time current meters (ACMs) that are widely used in oceanography   and the atmospheric sciences to measure boundary layer   turbulence.  These sensors infer velocity by measuring the   difference in time required for acoustic pulses to travel both   ways between opposing transducers separated by a distance L.  The   response of such a device to turbulence having spatial scales   equal to or smaller than L should be attenuated, and a simple   model of the ACM response function based on this idea has been   known for almost 30 years.  However, recent field and laboratory   measurements of the spatial response of ultrasonic ACMs to   turbulence in water show that measured velocities are less   attenuated than this simple model predicts. Research will be   conducted to test whether anomalous behavior of ACMs is due   either to flow distortion or to spatial variations in the   amplitude and phase of the acoustic field, and to distinguish   between these alternatives. It is expected that an improved   understanding of the spatial response of ACMs will considerably   enhance their usefulness as turbulence sensors in the ocean, and   should lead to improved sensor design and performance.",
