The co-  organizers are Professors Ronald J. Kuhr of North Carolina  State University and Naoki Motoyoma of Chiba University in  Japan.  This seminar will address a broad range of issues  related to pesticides, including pesticide epidemiology, new  modes of action to minimize nontarget exposure,  bioremediation of contaminated areas, molecular biology of  the modes of action and detoxication of pesticides, and the  dynamics of pesticide movement in the environment.  %%%  Although efforts continue toward reduction or elimination of  pesticide chemicals in the management of pests in  agriculture, public health and the urban arena, chemicals  will continue to be one of the main weapons in control of  insects, weeds, nematodes, and plant diseases for some time  to come.  Information on the chronic effects from exposure  to pesticide residues is limited.  This seminar will address  both practical issues related to pesticide use and  fundamental questions related to metabolic pathways and  ecosystem dynamics.  The exchange of ideas and data with  Japanese experts in this field will enable the U.S.  scientists to advance their own work, and will set the stage  for future collaborative projects.  The seminar proceedings  are expected to be published as a book.  ***",
