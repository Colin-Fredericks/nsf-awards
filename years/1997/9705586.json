 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grunow  OPP 9705586    Abstract  Geological and geophysical research sponsored by the US Antarctic  Program of the National Science Foundation along the Antarctic  margin has usually concentrated on the areas traditionally  visited either by ship, such as the Antarctic Peninsula and Ross  Sea regions, or areas easily accessible by aircraft from McMurdo  Station.  Limited access to  much of the margin has resulted in  data sets and interpretations that are skewed toward processes  and events within and along the Ross and Weddell sea regions and  West Antarctica.  This award supports a workshop with primary  objectives of identifying key scientific questions which could be  addressed through cruises to the Wilkes, Enderby and Queen Maud  Land areas of the East Antarctic margin, and assessing the level  of interest within the US community of implementing research  cruise initiatives.  Potential research objectives can be divided  into the following sub-disciplines: a) nearshore marine research  with an emphasis on paleoclimatic studies; b) continental shelf  to oceanic crust marine research stressing questions of Mesozoic  breakup and rifting geometry; c) onshore pre-Tertiary geological  research looking at Gondwana assembly and breakup events; and d)  onshore Late Tertiary geological and geophysical studies, also  primarily of paleoclimatic significance.  The unifying element  between these disciplines is the essential need to develop a  circumpolar view of Antarctic earth sciences.  Implicit in this  goal is cooperation of USAP efforts with other national programs,  particularly Australia and Japan.  A secondary objective of the  workshop will be to coordinate a logistics plan which would mesh  the scientific goals of onshore and offshore programs in order to  take full advantage of the allocated ship-time.",
