 "awd_abstract_narration": "Buck  9706865       The investigator collaborates with Prof. J. Simon,  University of Iowa, to study knots and their applications.  Knots  are closed loops in space that may be tangled in complicated and  essential ways.  While knots usually have been studied as  idealized one dimensional filaments, the focus here is on  \"physical knots,\" knots made of real physical stuff, from rope to  DNA or other large flexible molecules.  These are modeled as  mathematical knots endowed with physical like properties such as  self repelling energy or thickness.  The twin goals of physical  knot theory are to mathematically model and help understand the  real physical systems, and to use the physically inspired  measures of knot-complexity to develop novel methods for knot  recognition and classification.  The specific targets of this  project include: determining precise relations between different  measures of knot complexity, understanding critical points and  the configuration space of polygonal knots, understanding the  connections between parametrizations and topological properties  of harmonic knots, extending knot energy ideas to other  structures such as graphs, modeling gel electrophoresis of DNA  loops, and using knot energies to help understand physics  phenomena such as self-radiating tubes and knotted vortices.       Knotting and tangling happen at every scale studied by  science, from microscopic DNA loops to everyday rope to tangled  magnetic field loops in the solar corona.  The investigators and  their students will study problems that are fundamental and arise  in all the physical systems:  How are knots and tangles created?  What mathematical properties of the physical systems lead to  knots becoming simplified or completely untangled?  How do the  mathematical properties of different kinds of knots influence  their physical behavior?  One focus task is to gain a better  understanding of gel electrophoresis of DNA loops, hence of the  gel process itself; this is one of the most important  b iotechnology techniques, so a solid understanding is important.  The project requires powerful computing and visualization, so it  will train students, as well as stretch the technology, in these  areas.",
