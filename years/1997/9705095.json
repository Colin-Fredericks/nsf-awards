 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705095    Koch    Professor Koch is investigating continuous-spin models near criticality,  quasiperiodic orbits for classical Hamiltonian flows, and lattice gases  related to aperiodic tilings and quasicrystals. The first two of these  projects involves the use, and further development, of renormalization  group techniques. In a previous renormalization group analysis of  ferromagnetic spin models, some fundamental questions were answered in a  simplified hierarchical setting. Ongoing work now deals with the problem  of restoring some of the ingredients that have been missing. The  investigation of quasiperiodic motion for Hamiltonian flows is based on a  new class of renormalization group transformations that was introduced in  a previous project. One of the goals is to develop these transformations  into tools for studying non-perturbative phenomena, such as the breakup of  smooth invariant tori. Other interesting questions concern the accumulation  of closed orbits at invariant tori and the interplay between renormalization  group transformations that correspond to different frequency vectors.  The third project deals with a promising but largely unknown class of  statistical mechanics models: Lattice gases with non-periodic Gibbs states.  The current investigation focuses on a few examples, based on aperiodic  tilings, for which the minimum energy configurations are well known.  The goal is to identify and understand the low temperature properties of  these models and to develop the appropriate methods for analyzing them.    Professor Koch's study of ferromagnetic spin models is part of a long-term  effort toward a mathematical foundation of the modern theory of critical  phenomena in condensed matter physics. One of the striking phenomena is that  there are observable quantities (critical indices) which seem to be  independent of the system considered, within large classes of different  systems. Starting from some basic assumptions, the current theory allows  an approximate computation of  these universal quantities. But it is still  an open problem to show that these assumptions hold, within a class of  reasonably realistic models. Ongoing investigations in this area use  computer-assisted proofs and involve further development of these techniques.  This includes validated numerics -- a technique which is of increasing  interest also in engineering and modern industrial design. Another critical  phenomenon investigated in this project is the loss of stability of quasi-  periodic orbits in classical Hamiltonian systems. In certain cases, this  loss of stability is believed to be associated with a significant increase  in \"chaotic\" motion. The process appears to be universal, in the sense  described above, but it is not yet understood. Interest in this problem stems  from celestial mechanics and plasma physics, where questions of stability  play an important role. And of course, the mathematics involved is  interesting in itself. The third project deals with statistical mechanics  models whose minimum energy configurations are non-periodic. Some of these  models are believed to describe quasicrystals, and others may have features  similar to spin glasses. They are unusual by current standards, but not  exceptional. In fact, non-periodicity is a generic property for ground  states in a standard class of statistical mechanics models. So far, almost  all investigations of such models have been limited to studying the zero  temperature state. The goal now is to obtain some useful information about  the behavior at positive temperatures, using a combination of (large scale)  numerical simulations and analytical techniques.",
