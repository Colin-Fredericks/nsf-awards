 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is automating the existing college observatory as part of a major expansion of the astronomy offerings.  This expansion also includes the development and improvement of courses for both majors and non-majors, and a significant increase in student astronomy research and outreach programs in the surrounding community and at other schools.  A unifying theme for student observations is the study of variable and transient events.  Variable and transient events are a hallmark of astronomy at all wavelengths and on many time scales.  Three types of studies are being conducted: (1) a long-term supernova search; (2) studies of known variable stars; and (3) studies of active burst sources and supernovae, including searches for optical counterparts to gamma-ray and x-ray bursts.  A telescope with a flexible observing schedule and the ability to respond rapidly to new events can be very useful for the discovery and study of variable astronomical objects.  The observatory is also being used in lower-level classes.  Such a facility is made significantly more efficient if the observatory is automated in its operations, scheduling, data collection, and data analysis.    The automated facility includes a telescope and CCD camera, along with a custom built automation control board interfaced to weather sensors, roof control, and telescope control.  Full development of an automated observatory is being carried out over several years in a manner that is maximizing student participation during implementation.",
