 "awd_abstract_narration": "9720363  Stillings    This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS) Initiative.  to study tutorial interaction and learning outcomes in a feasible   model of college-level inquiry-oriented instruction, as it is implemented   in the Hampshire College science curriculum. This research will occur   during the first two years. It will be conducted by Neil Stillings,   Lawrence Winship, and a post-doctoral fellow in cognition and education,   with the assistance of undergraduate research assistants and an outside   educational research consultant.    We will extend current intelligent multimedia tutoring technology to   support college-level inquiry-oriented instruction. This research will   involve the development of new software architectures to support inquiry   in simulation environments and in integrated, computer-controlled   laboratory environments. It will be conducted by Lee Spector, Beverly   Woolf, Steven Weisler, and a post-doctoral fellow in computer science,   with some additional involvement from Neil Stillings and Lawrence Winship.    We will demonstrate our extensions of educational software technology by   developing three college-level  inquiry-oriented software packages in the   biological and cognitive  sciences. Our plan is to produce one    application in the language sciences, one in the environmental sciences,    and one in human biology. These applications will be classroom-ready and    suitable for use outside the research context. The primary developers   will be Lee Spector, Steven Weisler, a post-doctoral fellow in computer   science, a professional programmer, and graduate assistants in computer   science. They will work with faculty members in the appropriate   disciplines. The original plan was to develop six applications rather   than three. The budget has been reduced accordingly.    At least two of the software applications will be tested at  Hampshire,   and at least one of them will be revised to reflect the testing results.    The  classroom testing involves an important feature of the proposed    software architectures, which will have built-in educational and    psychological measurement capabilities. The primary researchers for the   software testing phase of the project are  Neil Stillings, Beverly Woolf,   the post- doctoral fellow in cognition and education, and an outside    educational consultant. The original proposal also involved the   introduction and testing of  software at the University of Massachusetts.   That aspect of the proposal has been dropped and the budget reduced   accordingly.",
