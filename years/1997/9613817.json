 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless networking is rapidly becoming a major component of the  modern communications market and increasingly competes with wired  networking, in terms of business volume, driven by the demand  for personal communication systems & services.    The ubiquitous untethered access that wireless networks  provide to users, coupled with the high bandwidth of wired  networks, offers a comprehensive solution to modern global  communication requirements.    Contrary to the protected environment of the wire, the wireless  channel can be highly erratic and essentially stochastic;  interference is an omni-present fact one has to cope with.    Historically, networking science has evolved based on the wired  network paradigm, where concepts like routing, admission control,  packet & circuit switching, congestion management etc. first emerged.  However, the advent of wireless networks introduces a whole new  dimension to the networking problem, which this project is exploring.    Modern applications (multimedia) are rapidly driving wireless  communication to the point where advanced networking capabilities,  previously limited to the wired world (active congestion control,  guaranteed quality of service etc.) need to be readily available;  yet, they have to be supported by the highly erratic radio channel  and under node mobility, making sporadic connectivity and  unpredictable propagation events (shadowing, fading etc.) the rule  rather than the exception.    This dichotomy introduces a number of interesting research issues  which this project explores. They are mainly centered around the  control of transmitter power of network nodes for the quality of  qervice maintenance of network links in the presence of interference,  node mobility and severe channel impairements. Such control results  in prolonged lifetime of battery powered (mobile) nodes, higher network  capacities, and more stable and efficient system operations, all of which  are of high practical importance.    --------------------  Details abo ut the project will be appearing on the web site:  http://www.netlab.stanford.edu/wirelss_nsf.html",
