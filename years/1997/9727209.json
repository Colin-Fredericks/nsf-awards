 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727209   Stuart   This proposal focuses on engineering approaches for   sustainability and design for materials reuse through the   development of polymer degradation models, product   characterization models, and life cycle material content   decision models.  Because these challenges are   multidisciplinary, collaboration between Chemical   Engineering (polymer processing), Industrial Engineering   (manufacturing processes), Operations Research (applied   mathematical modeling), and Mechanical Engineering   (product design) are described.  An important element of   this proposal is the integration of environmentally   conscious engineering approaches into undergraduate and   graduate engineering curriculum.      As the demand for plastics by the transportation,   aerospace, and durable goods industries is increasing, the   disposal of plastics is also increasing.  The analysis of   life cycle trade-offs between use of recycled plastics,   recyclability, reduction of process wastes, energy   consumption, yields, and product performance are complex.   To date, most companies process either 100% virgin   material or virgin material with small percentages of   regrind.  Sources of pure regrind may be internal or from   another industrial processor(s).  Companies embracing   product stewardship are struggling to develop viable   approaches to economically process and recycle returned   products.  Post-consumer polymers have been exposed to   various thermal and mechanical conditions.  In addition,   post-consumer products contain polymer blends as well as   additives such as reinforcements, paint, or flame   retardants.  Thus, post-consumer plastics introduce   additional raw material uncertainties into the   manufacturing process.      To achieve corporate sustainability goals for cradle to   cradle products, companies producing advanced polymers and   composites need polymer degradation models, product   characterization models, and decision tools for recycled   material content choices as well  as engineers who   understand sustainability issues and approaches.  Several   materials, manufacturing, design, and decision modeling   issues as well as curriculum integration must be   addressed.      First, we must be able to identify the measure of   degradation for incoming recycled materials.  Previous   studies have demonstrated the relationship between the   molecular weight distribution (MWD) and polymer   degradation properties such as viscosity and melt index.   We will investigate the feasibility of measuring the MWD   for common material mixes where mixes refer to various   recycling generations (virgin through fifth generation) as   well as polymer blends.  We must also characterize the   product complexities and the corresponding material   properties required.  Next, we will investigate the   relationship between the product complexities and the   material degradation properties.  Typical industrial   processing parameters for temperature and pressure will be   used.  The goal is to characterize the relationship   between the ratio of recycled content to virgin content   and the mold geometry, mechanical properties, and   rheological properties.  The materials degradation models   will provide valuable input for the life cycle material   content decision model.  The objective of the life cycle   material content decision model is to select material   content ratios in order to minimize costs subject to   constraints on regrind, post-consumer, and virgin material   supply, energy consumption, cycle time, and quality.      In five different undergraduate and graduate classes, the   principal investigators will motivate future engineers to   grapple with environmental materials selection challenges.   Industrial ecology principles as well as analytical   methods for life cycle material content decisions will be   integrated into the engineering curriculum.   ***",
