 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiconductor manufacturing technologies now enable the placement of up to 50  million devices on one die, and allow clock speeds to approach the GHz range.  These advances, however, are accompanied by larger yield losses (both  catastrophic and parametric) and lower reliability. This project is on the  development of techniques for improved yield-reliability estimation and  enhancement. These techniques include hierarchical yield estimation and  enhancement, minimum perturbation approach for yield and reliability enhancement  and new methods for crosstalk and electromigration minimization. The tradeoffs  among yield, reliability and other optimization goals such as speed and area, are  being investigated as well. This research emphasizes the integration of the yield  and reliability enhancement objectives with the primary goals of performance and  area, while keeping design data volumes manageable. A major focus of the project  is on proving the advantages of the new techniques by implementing and  integrating them into existing design frameworks.",
