 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Jang-Yen Wu  Grant Application (IBN-9723079) -  Regulation of Taurine Biosynthesis in the Brain       Taurine (2-amino-ethanesulfonic acid), a sulfur amino acid  with a  simple chemical structure, is one of the most  abundant amino acids in  mammals.  The physiological role of  taurine has received considerable  attention since the reports that cats fed a taurine  deficient diet  developed visual impairment, abnormality in  brain development and  heart function.  Now, taurine has  been shown to be involved in many  important physiological  functions e.g., as a trophic factor in the  development of  the central nervous system, maintaining the structural  integrity of the cell, regulating calcium homeostasis, and  modulation of communication between nerve cells.  Despite  its importance, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of  taurine formation in the brain remain elusive.  Taurine may  be formed in biological systems by several routes.  The  major route of taurine  formation in the brain is by  converting sulfur-containing amino acids  such as methionine  and cysteine to cysteinesulfinic acid (CSA) and subsequent  conversion of CSA to taurine.  The catalysts used in  biological systems are called enzymes.  The particular  enzyme  involved in converting CSA to taurine is called  cysteinesulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD).  Recently, it  was found that the activity of  CSAD to synthesize taurine  is altered when the structure of CSAD is  modified.  Specifically, CSAD activity is enhanced when a  phosphate is  attached to certain amino acids in CSAD  molecule while CSAD  activity is suppressed when the phosphate group  is removed  from CSAD molecule.  The proposal is designed to  understand  the mechanisms involved in the regulation of CSAD  activity.  Some of the questions to be addressed are: (1) What are  the  biological catalysts involved in adding or removing  phosphate  group to or from CSAD molecules?  (2) What are  the amino acid  residues in CSAD responsible for CSAD  activity?   (3) Are the changes  of CSAD structure related to  the state of the brain functions?  Information obtained from  the proposed studies should shed new light  regarding the  mechanism involved in the regulation of taurine  biosynthesis in the brain.  In addition, it may also provide  a better  understanding of the function of this important  substance in the  mammalian nervous system.",
