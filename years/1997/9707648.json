 "awd_abstract_narration": "SBR-9707648     At the end of September 1996, an earthquake of magnitude 5.0 preceded an eruption of the Grimsvotn volcano, beneath Vatnajokull, Europe's largest glacier, in SE Iceland.  Glacial meltwater drained into a subglacial lake.  An early November earthquake resulted in a tremendous flood of meltwater (such a flood is called a Jokulhlaup in Icelandic and to the relevant scientific community).  The November Jokulhaup had an estimated peak flow of 45,000 cubic meters per second, compared to regular (5-10-year) flows of 3,000 cubic meters per second.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) entails investigation of the geomorphic impacts of such a massive, sudden flood, toward the larger purpose of improving paleo-hydrologic models of flood events based only on the post-flood geomorphology.  The research supported entails the use of remotely sensed data to estimate the total flood discharge, measure pre- and post-flood digital elevation models and sediment patterns in the outwash plain (sandur), and identify the appropriate field sites for field measurement.  Spectral mixture analysis will be used to estimate the concentration and composition of sediment in the flood water.  The summer field work, conducted by the PI along with colleagues Francis Magilligan at Dartmouth College, Leal A.K. Mertes at UC-Santa Barbara, and Laurence C. Smith at UCLA, will test the accuracy of the digital elevation models and obtain information of the nature, type, and distribution of sediment deposits on the surface of the sandur.  Subsequent work will model the relationship between hydrologic energy of the flood (extrapolated from the volume estimates and the temporal record) and the nature and magnitude of the geomorphic change.  This work complements several other studies by international scientists on the nature of the flooding and the rates of geomorphic change, but not on the specific relationships among flood energy, sediment suspension, sedimentation, and geomorphic change.     The basis for th is award as a SGER is the necessity of a relatively rapid request to NASA to plan a special geodetic airborne laser resurvey of the sandur surface in March-April 1997.",
