The underlying  physical problems arise from fluid dynamics, rarefied gas dynamics and  wave propagation.  I plan to work on three main projects:  1. the development of robust shock capturing methods for hyperbolic  systems with relaxations, including  kinetic equations;  2. the construction and study of relaxation approximations and  relaxation schemes for viscous systems of conservations laws and  Hamilton-Jacobi equations.  3. asymptotic and numerical study on wave propagation in random media.  These projects if successfully carried out will provide  attractive  numerical methods that are able to simulate a wide variety of  challenging physical and industrial problems. They also help to gain  more understanding of the underlying physical phenomena.      With the development of modern computers, scientific computation has  been playing a central role in scientific investigation. The physical  and industrial problems we study here arise in complex fluids, optics  and materials, which can not be solved by other scientific tools.  Nervetheless, numerical computation has been demonstrated to be an  effective tool to obtain very good approximations to the solutions of  these problems. Our goal, if met,  will advance our ability to utilize  modern computers to solve these problems of significant importance.",
