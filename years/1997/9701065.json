 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701065  Sin      This award provides funding for a research project that lies at the intersection of three areas, modular representations of finite groups, finite projective geometry and the theory  of designs and their codes. Under this project, Sin will try to on the one hand build a general framework in which techniques of representation theory and group cohomology can be applied to attack combinatorial problems about codes and geometries, while on the other hand he will study how the latter areas may provide a more geometric viewpoint in representation theory. The successful outcome of this research should lead to new methods and results in all three theories and, above all, to a cross-fertilization of ideas among them.      This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of  Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections  of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely  important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research.",
