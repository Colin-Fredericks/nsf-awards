Under this Program, the National Science  Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Office of Naval Research are jointly  evaluating and supporting research of high priority to the USWRP.           The precedent circulations that contribute to the development of damaging  weather systems over the western and mid-western U.S. often approach from the  data-sparse region of the eastern Pacific. In many cases, these precedent circulations  have small horizontal dimensions that are not well resolved by the existing upper-air  sounding network. A special set of upper-air observing stations called the West-  Coast Picket Fence was established to measure the circulations crossing the west  coast of the U.S. during the Stormscale Operational and Research Meteorology-  Fronts Experiment Systems Test (STORM-FEST) held from February to March  1992. In particular, three-hourly Picket Fence soundings were obtained from the  combination of seven special and seven existing upper-air stations during four  intensive observing periods. Analyses completed thus far demonstrate that the higher  spatial resolution of the combined Picket-Fence sites with three hourly soundings  better resolve the energy fluxes crossing the coast than the seven existing sites with  the regular 1 2-hourly soundings. This Picket Fence is considered to be a prototype  for a future system of ground-based remote sensors that might be deployed along the  west coast that would monitor all circulations crossing the coast.        One goal of the USWRP is to determine the \"best practicable mix\" of  observations, data assimilation schemes, and forecast models that will yield cost-  effective weather forecast improvements for operations beyond the year 2000.    Crucial steps towards realizing this goal, and the associated goals of the North  American Observing System (NAOS) Program include the development and  evaluation of new data sources and observation strategies. We propose to evaluate  the potential impact of a quasi-linear array of special observing sites along the west  coast of the United States for the purpose of improving the downstream 0 - 2 day  forecast accuracy over North American.  Specifically, we propose to utilize the  operational and special west coast Picket Fence data collected during STORM-FEST  in tests with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) mesoscale  data assimilation and modeling system to examine the impacts of the special data  and new observing strategy on simulations of selected events during (the experiment  ***",
