 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603590  Levin    The functional contacts between nerve cells are called synapses,  and the biochemical compounds that carry signals between the cells  at the synapse are called neurotransmitters.  The transmitter  molecules are captured on the surface of the cell membrane of the  target cell by molecules called receptors.  Classes of  transmitters, like particular amino acids, or particular  catecholamine compounds, were known to have particular receptor  types that triggered particular responses in the post-synaptic  cell.  More recently, subtypes of receptor molecules have been  found, often with different chemical binding affinities, molecular  arrangement, and coupling mechanisms.  This symposium covers recent  advances at the molecular level in understanding the subtypes of  the particular receptors called muscarinic receptors, which  modulate the responses of nerve and muscle cells to a widespread  neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.  Support is to help cover  some travel costs young investigators in the field to be able to  attend and deliver their own research results at this meeting.   This support will have an impact on fostering the career  development of young neuroscientists, and the symposium  presentations will have an impact on muscle and cardiovascular  research as well as neuroscience.",
