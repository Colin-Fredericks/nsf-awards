 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614687  Schwartz    This proposal is to investigate the seismic and geodetic behavior  of several andesitic stratovolcanoes in Costa Rica that are in  different stages of their volcanic cycles in order to better  understand the properties and dynamics of active magmatic systems  and to improve volcanic  hazard mitigation.  In 1995, two permanent Global Positioning  System (GPS) receivers and five stations equipped with broadband  seismic sensors and electronic tiltmeters were established on  Arenal Volcano, Costa Rica.  These observations are among the  first few broadband seismic recordings and continuous, high  precision, geodetic measurements made on an active volcano.  Preliminary interpretation of the GPS data suggest ongoing  depletion of a relatively shallow magma reservoir and magmatic  injection at shallower levels in the form of dikes or sills.  Quantitative constraints on the geometry and behavior of this  magmatic system will be obtained by expanding spatial resolution  of the GPS measurements and analyzing the seismic recordings of  the harmonic tremor and summit explosions at Arenal.  Modest GPS  networks and seismic observations on Irazu, Turrialba and Rincon  de la Vieja (including 2 permanent GPS stations on Irazu) will  allow the characterization of surface deformation associated with  these volcanoes in  between eruptive cycles.  Baseline deformation data at presently  inactive volcanoes is quite rare, but potentially very valuable  for evaluating volcanic hazards and for understanding magmatic  processes on the longer time scale of major eruptive cycles.  ***",
