 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hope College will host an REU program for six undergraduates in  mathematics in the summer of 1998.  At least three of the  students will be recruited from outside of Hope College.   Students will work in groups of two with one of three faculty  mentors.  Projects will be chosen from algebra, dynamical  systems, probability, and number theory.    Primary goals are to help talented students develop as  mathematical researchers, to promote mathematics research as a  career, and to have the participants achieve significant  mathematical results in partnership with a faculty mentor.   Moreover, students will be encouraged to present their work at  professional meetings and in published form.    The program will be eight weeks.  Student pairs will be given  their own project or problem to solve.  After introductory  lectures given by the faculty researchers, students will be set  loose to tackle their own problems which will initially involve  reading background material and library research.  Students will  generally meet with their faculty mentors daily.  Toward the end  of the project, students will write up their results and present  their problems and discoveries to each other.",
