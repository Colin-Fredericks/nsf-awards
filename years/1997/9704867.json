 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the greatest novelties of recent non-linear dynamics is the new meaning of a qualitative theory: it is no more a weak theory but a theory that allows one to understand changes in the topology associated to dynamical behavior when one varies the parameters controlling an experiment. Mathematically, one has to know how to describe complicated bifurcation structures to be able to make qualitative predictions about an experiment. In the non-linear regime, one cannot hope for many quantitative predictions (or quantitative tests on the validity of models). It is then important to remember that, in the non-linear aspects of classical statistical mechanics, the theory can only predict numbers at transition points.  At some transitions, the main observables are universal in that they do not depend on a precise experiment but on a small number of (generically) small integer numbers. Not so surprisingly, most of the numbers non-linear mathematics can predict about non-linear sciences are also universal and associated to transitions. These transitions can be local (and one then uses local bifurcation theory; for instance one describes in this way most instances of onset of periodic behavior) or global (like the transition from order to chaos). In the global case, as in statistical mechanics, the main theoretical tool is a renormalization group, indeed, essentially the same sort of renormalization group as in statistical mechanics.  The goal of this research is twofold.  One aspect of the work will involve locating new examples of renormalization groups for dynamics and using them to understand dynamical properties.  A second aspect will involve investigating the bifurcation structure of parameterized families of maps which exhibit both simple and complex dynamical behavior, focussing in particular on the transition between order and chaos (more precisely the transition between zero and positive topological entropy).  The  basic aim of the project is furthering the understanding of complicated dynamic s and the transition from order to chaos which appears as essential to understanding climate changes and other major ecological events such as earthquakes or population dynamics. More specifically, renormalization is essential in explaining a variety of phenomena, from the transition to turbulence to the dynamics of some basic pieces of electronic circuits such as digital filters. Global bifurcation theory is the branch of mathematics which addresses our need to understand quantities which vary in time under adjustable or varying constraints.",
