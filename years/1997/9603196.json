 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores the role of electric fields in the flame-synthesis of nanoparticles.    Recent theoretical developments indicate that electric fields can alter the particle size and   narrow the distribution of particle sizes.  The lack of data in this area has caused a division   in the aerosol community over the effect of such fields on particle size.  Proof of the   concepts proposed in this research may lead to significant improvements in the production   of finer, more uniform nanoparticles.  The research could have direct application to the   manufacture of ceramics and semiconductors, and to the production of pigments and   cosmetics.  The two-year cooperative study involves a series of student/PI visits to the University of   Karlruhe which is carrying on a similar project and has a strong record in aerosol research   as well as state-of-the-art equipment.  Collaboration with the German group will   significantly enhance the chance of success because of the enlarged group and the   enhanced facilities.",
