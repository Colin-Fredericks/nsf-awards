University of New Hampshire  History of forcing Significance of GISP2 Record    There is growing recognition of the special \"window on the past\" provided by ice cores.  In particular, completion of deep drilling at Summit Greenland has presented paleoclimatologists with a well-dated, high resolution, multi-parameter record which is providing an unprecedented view of climate change over the last glacial/interglacial cycle.  This award supports a project focused on:  (1) developing even more robust descriptions of paleoclimate utilizing the multivariate (e.g., isotopes, particles, chemistry) GISP2 record; (2) utilizing the GISP2 as a framework for comparison with other paleoclimate records; (3) developing proxy records for atmospheric circulation systems in order to investigate seasonal-to-interannual and decadal-to centennial scale variability; (4) investigating and interpreting changes in the sources and production rates of the chemical species recorded in the GISP2 record in order to contribute to our understanding of biogeochemical cycling; (5) enhancing our understanding of the complex behavior of Holocene climate through the detailing of Holocene climate change (e.g., changes in atmospheric circulation, aridity, biological activity) and forcing; (6) investigating analogs for near-Holocene climate including interstadials, Eem and transitions into and out of stadials to further elucidate Holocene climate response and forcing; (7) investigating global phasing of climate change events; (8) investigating natural versus anthropogenic forcing of climate to enhance prediction of future climate and; (9) interpreting the preceding in light of the human dimensions of climatic change.",
