 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619885  Hoffmann  This is an award to provide support for research on use of  titanium dioxide as a catalyst in a photocatalytic process for  treatment of aqueous and gaseous waste streams to reduce their  pollutional impact on the receiving environment.  The goal of  this project is to determine whether the rate of the  photochemical reaction can be significantly increased in aqueous  heterogeneous media to levels comparable to those obtained in  application of the photocatalytic process to gas-phase waste  streams.  The research is designed to address the fundamental  basis for this apparent discrepancy by studying the reaction  mechanism using a pulsed source of ultraviolet radiation.  Two  hypotheses are planned to be examined.  One is that the  difference in reactivities between the process application to  liquids and gases relates to differences in the mode of substrate  adsorption on the surface of the aatalyst.  The other is that  water may inhibit oxygen reduction and/or substrate competition  for available adsorption sites on the target compound.  Results of this project are expected to contribute to a better  understanding than now exists of photochemical reactions as they  may be applied to decontamination of soil and water.  This in  turn is likely to result in improvement of the engineering design  of processes that can be used reduce the pollutional effect of  liquid and gaseous waste discharges on the quality of surface and  groundwater and to decontaminate soil.***",
