 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727151  Edgington    Research will be undertaken in response to an Announcement   of Opportunity (NSF 97-38)for Coastal Studies in the Great   Lakes.  This is a collaborative research project between   investigators from ten academic and government research   institutions.  The research is being conducted under the   auspices of the NSF Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) program   and the NOAA Coastal Ocean Program.    This collaborative, 5-year research program will focus on   the importance of episodic events on nearshore-offshore   transport and subsequent ecological consequences. The study   seeks to 1) determine what processes control the cross-  margin (inshore to offshore) transport of biological,   chemical, and geological materials in the coastal margins of   the Great Lakes, and to 2) develop and test scientific   strategies for assessing, quantifying, and predicting the   impacts of multiple stresses both natural and anthropogenic,   in the Great Lakes or selected coastal sub-regions.    A tight coupling between contaminated sediments and   overlying water exists in lakes and coastal ecosystems  through the process of sediment resuspension. Satellite   observations in Lake Michigan illustrate an annually   recurrent episode of nearshore-offshore transport, a 10 km   wide plume of resuspended material extending over 200 km   along the southern shores of the lake. Preliminary evidence   indicates that this episodic event may be the major   mechanism for cross-margin sediment transport in Lake   Michigan.  This type of event impacts recycling of   biogeochemically important materials (BIMS), ecosystem   responses, cross-isobath transport in the Great Lakes. The   program results will be applicable to similar events in many   coastal areas.    This comprehensive, interdisciplinary study will implement   an integrated observational program and numerical modeling   effort to identify, quantify, and develop prediction tools   for the winter-spring resuspension event and to assess the   impact o f this event on the transport and transformation of   BIMS and on lake ecology.    This component of the study focuses on a variety of in situ   and laboratory techniques designed to look at the fate and   transformation of biogeochemically active particles in a  dynamic coastal system.",
