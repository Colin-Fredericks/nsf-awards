 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9623084  Vydyanathan   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at optimizing the approach of coulombic pairing of dopants-feasibility of which was demonstrated in Phase I-to produce high conductivity p-type GaN for blue LEDs and lasers.   Avyd Devices' approach to create shallow acceptors entails the coulombic pairing of a double acceptor with a single donor with the resulting pair acting as a single acceptor in its unpaired style. Specifically, GaN crystals will be simultaneously doped with an element from group I and an element from group IV or group Vl and then the crystals will be annealed under well controlled thermodynamic conditions which would promote the association of the group I element occupying gallium lattice sites, acting as a double acceptor with the group IV or group VI element occupying gallium or nitrogen lattice site acting as a single donor.  The resulting pair would act as a single acceptor with an expected energy level much closer to the valence band edge than that of either the first or second level of the group I acceptors in their unpaid state. Phase II research will focus on optimizing the coulombic pairing approach to create acceptor levels at 50 meV above to value band edge in GaN-much shallower than that Mg in GaN-and demonstrate prototype blue LEDs with superior brightness; by reducing the acceptor level from 150 meV for Mg to less than 50 meV with coulombic pairs, an increase in ionization by a factor of 200 is expected at room temperature.  Creation of shallow  acceptor levels at 50 meV above the valence band edge would also open the possibility of realizing the ultimate goal of blue lasers in the nitride system.
