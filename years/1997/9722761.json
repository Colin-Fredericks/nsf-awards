 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722761 Cargill This GOALI proposal addresses basic materials science issues in a collaborative program between Columbia University and Philips Laboratories to understand fundamental phenomena and interactions between electron-hole pair recombination, atomic displacements and defect generation in ZnSe-based heterostructures. Research at Columbia will involve T-dependent CL microscopy, spectroscopy, and x-ray microbeam mapping of microstructure and strain. Philips Laboratories will provide state-of-the-art MBE-grown samples and devices characterized electrically and optically. The joint activities include staff exchange with the PI and graduate students spending time at Philips, and with the co-PI, T. M. Marshall from Philips spending time at Columbia. Additionally, an on-going collaboration with Brookhaven NL will continue in connection with the x-ray microbeam work. The proposed research emphasizes understanding of fundamental mechanisms and processes along with some the practical aspects of electronic/photonic materials technology. This project is supported by the DMR/EM program and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA). %%% The project addresses forefront materials science research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry, in general.  Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
