 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Mars-Rock Special Research Opportunity activity   supports study of carbon-14 abundances in martian meteorites by Dr. Greg   H. Rau of the Institute of Marine Sciences, University of California,   Santa Cruz.  The project is funded by the Office of Polar Programs, the   Chemistry Division, and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.    Carbon isotopic measurements (C-13/C-12 ratio and C-14 concentration)   will be conducted on carbon collected from the ALH84001 meteorite using   discrete inorganic and organic carbon extraction techniques.  The goal of   the project is to gain a better understanding of the sources and possible   martian biogenicity of carbon contained in the meteorite.  The work will   be conducted as part of a collaborative research project based at   NASA-Ames Research Center where individual acid, UV-laser ablation, and   stepped heating extractions will be performed on AHL84001 samples and   terrestrial analogs.  Isotopic analysis will be performed on the carbon   dioxide released from these extraction fractions.  The mass and isotopic   abundances within the organic and inorganic fractions will be determined,   as well as the degree of terrestrial contamination of each fraction, and   the isotopic carbon ratio of both the meteorite organic and inorganic   carbon.  The results will be interpreted in the context of Martian   geology and climate.  It is likely that terrestrial carbon contamination   may have influenced the meteorite's organic carbon concentration, and   this will be considered in order to accurately infer Martian   organic/inorganic carbon isotope abundances, fractionations, and organic   carbon formation process.  Carbon in planetary samples may be present in inorganic forms or may have   been modified by biological activity.  As a result of either physical or   biological forces, the isotopic composition of carbon in the sample may   have been altered to provide a distinctive `signature.`  This research   brings together a unique combination of carbon isotope extertise from   NASA-Ames, the University of California, and the Lawrence Livermore   National Laboratory to investigate both terrestrial and meteorite   samples.  The results will aid in determining whether or not the evidence   from martian meteorite ALH84001 is consistent with biological activity.",
