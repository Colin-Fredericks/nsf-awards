 "awd_abstract_narration": "9629133  E    This work is supported by a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists   and Engineers.  The research component will focus on the understanding   and modeling of complex materials and complex fluids.  This includes   polymeric liquids (of which liquid crystal polymers are one example),   turbulent flows, and flux flows in type-II superconductors, etc.  The work   on liquid crystals and polymers includes two aspects: (1) the phase   separation process and (2) the hydrodynamics of liquid crystal polymers.    The main issues for the first problem are the dynamics and morphology for   polymerization driven phase transition and the interplay between phase   separation and orientational order.  For the second problem, the role of   defects in the hydrodynamics of large molecule liquid crystals is of interest.    The focus of the work on turbulent flows will be on turbulence models and   large eddy simulation.  The understanding of macroscopic instabilities of   flux fronts and flux flows in type-II semiconductors requires a macroscopic   theory of flux flows.  A macroscopic theory for thin films has been   developed by considering the hydrodynamics of interacting vortices in   combination with a novel interfacial boundary condition.  The approaches   to these three problems involve similar steps:  (1) establishing continuum   models under the guidelines of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, (2)   developing effective numerical methods, (3) using asymptotic analysis of   simplified situations to provide insight, and (4) identifying prototypical   problems for rigorous mathematical analysis.  The investigator has worked   toward enhancing the curriculum at his institution through the development   of special courses in computational incompressible fluid mechanics and   materials science and has been actively engaged in summer programs to   enhance interactions among different groups (university faculty, high school   teachers, students) in the mathematical sciences community.    The Presid ent Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE)   were created to recognize demonstrated excellence and promise of future   success in scientific or engineering research, and the potential for eventual   leadership of the awardees in their respective fields.  These awards are   designed to produce a prominent cadre of scientists and engineers and to   encourage their continued development.",
