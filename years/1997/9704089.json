 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704089  Avci       An award is provided for the acquisition of a Scanning Force  Microscope (SFM) and a Cryopreparation System, the latter as an  accessory for an existing scanning electron microscope (SEM), in the  Image and Chemical Analysis (ICAL) of Montana State University (MSU).  These instruments will complement existing imaging and analytical  equipment used to characterize the morphology, atomic structure,  composition and chemistry of solid state materials, and will also  expand the capability of ICAL to undertake similar studies involving in  situ characterization of biological specimens in their natural state.       ICAL is a central, multi- and interdisciplinary user facility.  It  was established in order to serve research-needs and promote  collaboration in research, education, and industrial technical  applications in the physical and life sciences, as well as engineering  disciplines.  ICAL provides critically needed analytical facilities  based on microscopy and spectroscopy for bulk and surface analysis of  materials.  At present, the laboratory is home to an SEM with energy  dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDS), cathodoluminescence spectrometer  (CL), and backscattered-electron (BSE) microanalysis capabilities; a  scanning Auger microprobe (SAM); a small-spot X-ray photoelectron  spectrometer (XPS); a time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometer  (ToF-SIMS) with the ability to do ion microscopy; and an automated X-  ray powder diffractomer (XRD).       A high resolution SFM will augment and extend the range of these  capabilities to provide in situ, nanometer-scale characterization of  the morphology and variations in composition, adhesion, friction, and  viscoelasticity on the surfaces of natural and synthetic solid  materials as well as biological samples.  The SFM can operate under  fluid environments, and thus, can be used to monitor materials that  have undergone sorption, catalytic, and dissolution/precipitation  processes.  A high-resolution SFM in tapping or contac t mode of  operation in liquid or air makes complex biological structures as well  as complex macromolecules accessible to study in their natural  environment, a capability outqide the scope of traditional electron  microscopy.  The cryo-preparation stage for the SEM will allow high-  resolution imaging of biological samples in their natural state,  without the risk of introducing artifacts associated with standard  sample preparation procedures.  With the crucial advantage of cryo-  fixation allowing the specimen to be preserved in a state closest to  its natural living state, added to the imaging and spectroscopic  compatibility of the electron microscope, study of living organisms  preserved in their hydrated environments become possible.  The cryo-  state will also enhance the CL signal in studies of trace element  distribution in synthetic and natural materials.       The ICAL facility serves researchers in all fields of science and  engineering at MSU and also supports research in the private sector and  government agencies.  The existing items of equipment support many but  not all the research needs of many groups.  For example, the  researchers from the NSF-supported Center for Biofilm Engineering who  study biofilm formation on surfaces can currently obtain chemical  mapping over the region of interest, but are unable to obtain simple  high resolution images of bacteria in their natural surrounding, since  the existing equipment is not equipped to carry out such research.  The  proposed equipment will augment in a very essential way the  instrumentation available to these researchers.  Other projects are  proposed to characterize the distribution and geochemical pathways of  organic and heavy metal contaminants in natural systems.  Related  projects are proposed by life scientists in Microbiology and Plant  Pathology as well as materials scientists in Physics, Chemistry, Earth  Sciences, and Plant and Soil Sciences.",
