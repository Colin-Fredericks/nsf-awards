The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Sheryl H. Ehrman to work with Dr. Urs  Baltensperger at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen,  Switzerland. The Institute has strong programs in glacier  and ice core research.    This project will study snow crystals using a scanning  electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive  spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry  (SIMS) to gather information on how concentrations of  chemical species in ice relate to concentrations of chemical  species in the atmosphere.  By studying ice cores, they can  find evidence of past volcanic eruptions, nuclear weapons  tests, and past global heating/cooling cycles.    The selected site is ideal for this research, not only  because of its geography, but because the Monte Rosa glacier  which will be studied, is a cold glacier, the temperature of  which never rises above zero, thus avoiding melting which  can blur the time resolution in the ice core samples.  ***",
