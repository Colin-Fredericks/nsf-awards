 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program continues support for research on homogeneous catalysis by Dr.   George G. Stanley of the Chemistry Department, Louisiana State   University.  The goal of the work is to understand cooperativity in   bimetallic catalysis by studying a dirhodium complex that is active and   selective in hydroformylation.  This dicationic complex contains a   binucleating tetraphosphine ligand.  The nature of the binding site will   be elucidated with the aid of molecular modeling, in addition to   experimental approaches, including kinetic, spectroscopic and isotopic   labeling studies.  The results will be used to make improvements in the   regio- and enantioselectivty of the catalyst.  After this stage of the   research, attempts will be made to extend bimetallic cooperativity to   other catalytic reactions, such as hydrosilylation, silylformylation,   hydrocyanation, and C-C bond coupling reactions with alkenes and alkynes.  In some catalytic systems, the cooperative action of two different metal   sites has been suggested to be effective in promoting reactions not only   more quickly, but also shape-specifically.  In this project, the   potential of cooperativity in catalyst design will be determined.  The   ability to control reaction rates and products is very important in many   areas of chemical manufacturing, such as production of  pharmaceuticals,   polymers, and fine chemicals.",
