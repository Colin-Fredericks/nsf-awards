 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707975  Martin  This  research  project will investigate the  microstructure  and   macroscopic  properties  of  specific  grain  boundary  defects  in  crystalline, semiconducting polymer  materials.  The  long-term  goal  of this work is to isolate  individual  grain  boundaries so that their microstructure and influence  on  macroscopic  properties can be determined unambiguously.  \"Polymer  bicrystals\"  make  it  possible  to  examine   the  mechanical and electrical properties of these materials as a  function of defect geometry.  Measurements of the mechanical  strength  and  photocurrent  transport  both  decrease  with  increasing  misorientation between component grains.   These  properties   measurements  are  corroborated  by  structural  investigations  using opticalmicroscopy,  scanning  electron  microscopy,  atomic  force  microscopy  (AFM),  transmission  electron    microscopy   (TEM),   selected   area   electron  diffraction   (SAED),  and  white-beam   synchrotron   X-ray  topography   (WBSXT).   The current  research  project  will  involve  (1)  investigations of  new  materials  of  current  interest  for device applications,  (2)  processing  schemes  for    introducing   defects   into   crystalline    organic  semiconductors  in  a  controlled  manner,  (3)   structural  characterization   by   transmission  electron   microscopy,  electron  diffraction, and WBSXT, and  (4)  measurements  of  macroscopic properties by mechanical and electrical testing.  Of  particular scientific and technological interest is  the  manner in which carrier transport and mechanical deformation  is  accommodated  across individual  grain  boundaries.  The  manner in which slip deformation is accommodated across  the  engineered grain boundary interfaces as a function  of  tilt  and  twist  misorientation angle will be investigated.  From  these results we will learn about the manner in which planes  of  oriented polymer molecules laterally translate  by  what  are expected to be dislocatio n-mediated mechanisms of slip.  %%%  This  research  should provide an insight into  the  defect-  limited  behavior of ordered  polymer  and organic   solids.  These  efforts  will  provide fundamental  information about  the  relationship  between  microstructure  and  macroscopic  properties   of   these  materials   in   the   solid-state.  Optoelectrically  active  polymers  are    of   considerable  interest for devices such  as  thin film  transistors,  flat  panel  displays,  chemical sensors,  and  injection  lasers.  Recent  publications  have identified the critical  role  of  grain  boundary  defects  in  limiting  the performance   of  these  flexible,  organic-based electronic  devices for  low  cost,  large  scale applications.  ***",
