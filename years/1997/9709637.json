 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns two inverse problems for hyperbolic  equations.  The first problem involves the wave operator P for  the Laplace-Beltrami operator for a smooth, Riemannian metric on  a bounded n-dimensional domain.  The inverse problem is to  describe material properties (represented by the coefficients of  P) of an object (represented by the n-dimensional domain) given  only measurements made at the surface of the object (modeled by a  boundary operator, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map).    We consider the continuous dependence of the metric on the  Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for P.  For this inverse problem (and  inverse problems in oil prospection and seismology, for example)  it is known, though, that the material properties of the object  are not uniquely determined by surface measurements, in general.  In particular, a metric is not uniquely determined by the  Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for P since the pullback of a metric by  a diffeomorphism that fixes the boundary has the same associated  Dirichlet-to-Neumann map as the original metric.  Sylvester and  Uhlmann have shown that unique determination does hold at the  boundary, though,and in the case that surface measurements are  available for all time, it follows from Belishev and Kurylev that  uniqueness holds in the interior, up to the pull-back by a  diffeomorphism that fixes the boundary.    To study the dependence, then, of material properties of the  object on surface measurements, for this inverse problem for  which uniqueness does not hold, we propose showing that the  metric depends continuously on the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, up  to the pull-back by a diffeomorphism that fixes the boundary.    Having shown that continuous dependence holds, one can expect  that material properties of the interior of the object  (represented by the coefficients of the differential equation)  can, in principle, be reconstructed arbitrarily accurately from  measurements made only at the surface (that is, from the  Dirichlet-to-Neumann map).    In t he second problem we consider an inverse problem for  the system of operators P for elastodynamics with residual  stress.  The linearly elastic, nonhomogeneous, isotropic object  being studied is represented by a bounded, 3-dimensional region  with smooth boundary.  The behavior of the object is described in  terms of solutions of the system of equations for elastodynamics.   Coefficients of these equations represent material properties of  the object, and surface measurements are modeled by the  associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.  It is assumed there are no  body forces acting on the object after time zero but that events  in the past have built up a residual stress in the object, which  is modeled by a smooth, symmetric, second-rank tensor that is  divergence-free and has zero traction on the boundary.    The central question we pose here is to what extent the  Dirichlet-to-Neumann map associated with P uniquely determines  the density, coefficients of elasticity, and residual stress at  the boundary.",
