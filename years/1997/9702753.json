 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of of nanostructures and   polymers by means of metal complexation of terpyridal ligands.  Using   building blocks containing two or more terpyridal units, rigid rod   polymers, rings and molecular monolayers will be constructed.  The use of   carboxylate-substituted terpyridal groups in the synthesis of rings and   molecular monolayers will allow the self-assembly of nanotubes and   organometallic zeolites.  Applications as molecular wires, slow release   devices and as channels for cross-membrane transport of ion and molecules   will be stressed.  Course and curriculum development featuring polymer   laboratory and lecture courses will be the focus of the educational   component of the award. With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic   Program, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Office   of Experimental Programs to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) are   supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Debra L. Mohler of   the Department of Chemistry at  West  Virginia University.  Professor   Mohler will focus her work on developing methods for the assembly of new   materials by metal complexation of terpyridal ligands.  The resulting   nanostructures will be will be examined for the ability to act as   molecular wires and slow release devices and as channels for the   cross-membrane transport of ions and molecules.  The experience gained   from the research will be be applied to the development of an   undergraduate lecture and laboratory polymer courses.",
