 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705134 Wessels  This GOALI proposal addresses doping induced defects in wide bandgap III-V nitride semiconductors. Issues being investigated include the structure and identity of defects in high conductivity materials, the structure and identity of compensating acceptor and donor defects, their concentration, and their stability. Studies of both atmospheric pressure MOVPE and flow modulation epitaxy are an integral part of the project. Joint collaborative activities include staff exchange with graduate students spending time at Lucent, Motorola, and Emcore. The proposed research emphasizes understanding of fundamental mechanisms and processes along with some practical aspects of electronic/photonic materials and device technology. %%% The project addresses forefront materials science research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry, in general.  Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
