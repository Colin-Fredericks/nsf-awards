 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Howell's research focuses on the synthesis of   2-alkylideneoxetanes and their use as potential inhibitors of serine and   cysteine proteases as well as precursors for the synthesis of medium-ring   carbocyclic compounds and spiroketals.  Compounds bearing structural   analogy to simple insect pheromones will be prepared using the latter   methodology, which is designed to be simple and chemoselective, without   extensive use of protecting groups, while proceeding under mild   conditions.  Approaches to other functionalities through the intermediacy   of 2-alkylideneoxetanes will also be explored, as will the polymerization   of 2-alkylideneoxetanes, expected to yield polyketones.  Professor Howell   will seek to facilitate student and faculty interactions with industry in   order to achieve three goals:  (1) to increase student appreciation of   industrial career opportunities,  (2) to improve faculty understanding of   how to assist students with their job searches, and (3) to foster   academic-industrial and industrial-academic collaborations.   With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the   research and educational activities of Dr. Amy Howell of the Department   of Chemistry at the University of Connecticut.  Professor Howell examines   the chemistry of a class of versatile precursor molecules that, to this   point, have received little attention from the synthetic community.    These compounds, comparatively small in size but containing a number of   reactive groupings of atoms, permit synthetic access to a wide range of   important compounds, including molecules anticipated to display unusual   biological activity, as well as polymeric materials.  Professor Howell's   educational activities target the enhancement of student awareness of   career opportunities in industry and the development of faculty-industry   collaborations through workshops, in-house courses taught by industrial   chemists, and internships in academic and industrial laboratories.",
