Focusing on Chinese and English, it will build on the progress  made in recent years in research on reading English and other  alphabetic writing systems.  Chinese, as a writing system based  on characters, rather than letters, offers a maximal contrast to  alphabetic systems.  In Chinese, each character typically  symbolizes a word, in contrast to English, where the basic unit  (a letter) corresponds to a meaningless speech sound (phoneme).   Thus, Chinese is a system in which the basic units can connect  more directly to meaning than is the case in an alphabetic  system.  Nonetheless, although reading Chinese logically allows  meaning to be accessed directly without contact with the sound  system of the language (phonology), actual reading may involve  phonology in both writing systems.  Recent research suggests that  both Chinese and English may be read by implicitly converting the  written form into a spoken language form.  These studies will use  a variety of experimental tasks in both languages.  On the  English side, experiments will secure the interpretation of  brief-exposure procedures that have produced evidence for  automatic implicit phonology in word reading.  On the Chinese  side, the experiments will examine the time course of meaning and  phonological events and provide for the development of  computational models of the reading process.  The outcome will be  conclusions regarding both differences and similarities in  reading English and Chinese.  This will be an important step in  unraveling which aspects of reading are dependent on the  particular writing system of the language being read and which  are universal and not dependent on the language's writing system.    ***",
