 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619520  Sheldon    One problem with CVD deposition of diamond on many  substrates is that the intrinsic stresses in the diamond  film are larger than the stresses caused by the  film/substrate thermal expansion mismatch, which causes the  diamond film to spall off or the substrate to bow.  Post-  deposition annealing does not remove these intrinsic  stresses.  Recent work by the PI's group  has determined  that an intermediate annealing step, after significant grain  impingement, but before a dense film was formed, can  minimize intrinsic stress in the diamond film, and reduce  the spallation.  The intermediate annealing step alters the  film microstructure in such a way to reduce stress evolution  during subsequent diamond film growth.  Preliminary electron  microscopy studies (ex situ SEM and in situ TEM hot-stage  experiments) indicate that contacting diamond grains rotate  during annealing.  A reasonable explanation for the observed  stress reduction is that grain rotation results in better  crystallographic alignment between adjacent grains.  Subsequent growth on top of these grains can then form more  stable grain boundary configurations that are less  susceptible to the relaxation mechanisms that can induce  intrinsic tensile stress.  The proposed research would study  the fundamentals of this phenomenon in order to optimize and  control stress levels in diamond and other thin films.  The  research will be performed by a Focused Research Group  consisting of the PI (CVD/thin films), and 2 co-PIs (a  transmission electron microscopist/crystallographer and a  physicist/Raman spectroscopist).  %%%  One problem with CVD deposition of diamond on many  substrates is that the intrinsic stresses in the diamond  film are larger than the stresses caused by the  film/substrate thermal expansion mismatch, which causes the  diamond film to spall off or the substrate to bow.
