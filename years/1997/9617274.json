 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617274  HENDERSON  Visual perception is a dynamic process:  The two-dimensional  image of the world projected onto the receptor surface at the  back of the eyeball (the retina) is in a constant state of change  due to eye, head, body, and object movements.  These changes lead  to two-dimensional geometric transformations of the retinal image  (e.g., a rectangular door projects a trapezoidal image when it is  seen at an angle), size transformations of the image (e.g., an  object projects a smaller image when farther away), and temporal  gaps in the image (e.g., an object disappears from the image when  it moves behind another object).  In addition, because our eyes  move in rapid, discrete jerks (called saccades), and because the  visual system is effectively blind during those movements  (information is acquired only during fixational pauses between  the movements), the entire image disappears about three times  every second.  Yet, in spite of all of this change and variation,  we experience a constant, stable visual world.  This research is  concerned with the way we are able to experience visual object  constancy, particularly across saccadic eye movements, in the  face of the highly fluctuating visual image with which we are  presented.  The theoretical framework guiding the research holds  that the visual system maintains visual constancy for objects  using two sorts of internal representations, a relatively  abstract description of the object (i.e., an object type), and a  more veridical representation that is tied to the object's  spatial location and that includes more specific visual details  about the object (i.e., an object token).  Experiments will use  the preview paradigm, in which participants will see one image  during a first fixation, and a second image during a subsequent  fixation.  Since the ahange from the first to the second image  will take place during a saccade, it will not be directly  perceived.  Manipulation of the similarity of the first image to  the second will ma ke it possible to determine the nature of the  information that the visual system acquires and retains across a  saccade.  The research will then be able to address five  questions:  (1) What kind of information is preserved across  saccadic eye movements during dynamic identification of real-  world objects?  (2) How is the information about an object  preserved across a saccade related to its spatial position?    (3) Do object types and object tokens represent the same sorts of  information?  (4) What is the nature of the spatial reference  frame(s) used to represent object position across a saccade?   (5) Does object constancy operate similarly across saccadic eye  movements and within a single eye fixation?  An understanding of  the processes involved in maintaining visual constancy across  saccadic eye movements should allow for improved design of  graphical display systems, including virtual reality systems, as  well as for the development of improved artificial vision  systems, particularly those that attempt to integrate visual  information dynamically over time.  Finally, this research should  contribute toward understanding of visual impairments that lead  to an inability to recognize objects and scenes (visual agnosia).  ***",
