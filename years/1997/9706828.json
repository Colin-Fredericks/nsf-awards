It tries to specify the following        problem: Given the norm topology of a Banach space, how        different are the equivalent norms generating this topology?        Our main question is the following: Are there any Banach        spaces which are distortable but not arbitrarily distortable?        Directly connected to the concept of distortion is the concept        of stabilization and  the spectrum of Lipschitz functions on        the sphere of an infinite dimensional Banach space. It was introduced        by V. Milman in 1971. The author intends to discuss the         question whether, after stabilization, the spectrum of a        Lipschitz function must be a connected set. Furthermore it is        intended to work on several problems concerning the asymptotic        structure of Banach spaces. They could be summed up as follows:        How much information about the infinite dimensional         properties of a Banach space can be deduced from its asymptotic        properties? The second part of this proposal treats the following        problem about Gaussian measures: Are two n-dimensional convex        symmetric sets positively correlated with respect to the standard        Gaussian measure?              Banach spaces were introduced to provide a frame in which        solutions of Differential Equations exist, i.e. equations which        model dynamic systems. The author intends to continue his study        about their structure. Roughly speaking, one might summarize the        problems as follows: What are the building blocks of Banach spaces,        are there \"atomic\" spaces? The second part of the proposal treats        a group of questions concerning multi-dimensional normal distributions.        The following question is a generic problem in statistics: One has        tables for standard normal distr ibutions, but no tables for             multi-dimensional normal distributions (there are simply       too many of them). So, if we are dealing with a multi-dimensional        problem for which the data can be approximated by a multi-dimensional             normal, how can we deal with it? In order to find estimates of        confidence regions the author intends to  find lower estimates for               probability of multi-dimensional events using the one dimensional        standard distribution.",
