The  project has three parts.  The first part is related to the  classification problem for these 4-manifolds.  While the recent  failure of the Minimal Conjecture shows that smooth 4-manifolds tend  to defy classification schemes, there are other related conjectures  like the 3/2 Conjecture and the Simple-type Conjecture, and the  investigator will try to disprove these conjectures as well.  In the second part, the investigator will continue his joint  work with John Morgan to study how Seiberg-Witten invariants change  along an h-cobordism.  This problem is related to the Simple-type  Conjecture and also to the third part of the project, in which the  investigator will study the relation between the combinatorial  presentations (Kirby calculus pictures) and Seiberg-Witten invariants  of simply-connected smooth closed 4-manifolds.  A long-term goal in  this direction is to find generalizations of the Seiberg-Witten  invariants.        The study of smooth structures of simply-connected 4-dimensional  manifolds was initiated in 1984 by Simon Donaldson.  In his ground  breaking work, Donaldson applied the Yang-Mills equation and the  corresponding Yang-Mills moduli spaces over the 4-manifolds.  The  corresponding Donaldson invariants were used to settle various  problems in 4-dimensional topology.  The Yang-Mills equation is a  partial differential equation that has special importance in  theoretical physics, and its use in the classification of smooth  4-manifolds revealed a surprising link between topology and  theoretical physics.  This link has been underlined by Seiberg and  Witten in 1994, when, using ideas coming from theoretical physics,  they discovered a pair of new partial differential equations and the  corresponding Seiberg-Witten invariants of smooth 4-manifolds.  ***",
