 "awd_abstract_narration": "Floss  9604888    This award supports a three-year collaborative research  project between Dr. Heinz Floss of the University of  Washington and Dr. Yu Sam Kim of Yonsei University in Seoul,  Korea on \"Stereochemical Studies of Malonate Metabolism.\"  The goals of the project are 1) to determine the  stereochemical course of malonate decarboxylation by the  malonate decarboxylases from selected species and 2) to  determine the stereospecificities, if any, of methylmalonate  activation.    Dr. Kim's  research group in Korea has a long-standing  interest in the metabolism and physiological role of  malonate and its derivatives in plants and microorganisms  and has done extensive research on this subject.  Dr. Heinz'  research group has extensive experience in the  stereochemical analysis of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and  has developed methods for the analysis of reactions  involving malonate as substrate.  This project will bring  these research groups together to study the steric course of  a number of enzyme reactions involving transformations of  malonate or its derivatives.  The study should lead to  improved understanding of enzyme reaction mechanisms.  ***",
