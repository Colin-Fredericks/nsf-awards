 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Young Investigator Opportunity award is to formulate and test a model that explains and predicts the terms of surrender negotiated between warring parties.  This research contributes to the extant literature on war consequences in several ways.  First, the model specifies how individual preferences and expectations, domestic constraints, and international conditions affect the bargaining power of the war participants and, as a result, their ability to negotiate favorable terms of settlement. Second, the model integrates the literature on war outcomes and war termination, leading to expectations not only about severity of the settlement but its timing as well.  Finally, the model establishes a link between the domestic consequences of war, on which work has proceeded rapidly, and the international consequences of war which has received much less scholarly attention.    This preliminary investigation has many important implications.  First, a model which explains the consequences of war will be extremely relevant to the literature on war causes if we make the very reasonable assumption that the decision to wage war is conditioned at least in part on the expectation of the results of war participation.  Second, the empirical results will extend existing research on the influence of regime type, the relevance of international alliances, and the importance of such psychological factors as resolve and aspirations to international relations.  Finally, the project provides a general theoretical framework, tha of bargaining, to understand and evaluate both the domestic and international consequences of resorting to force to realize political gains.",
