 "awd_abstract_narration": "Travel funds in this grant help to support a philosopher and U.S. students in engineering and in science and technology studies, to attend the IEEE Society on Social Implications of Technology International Symposium on Technology and Society this June in Glasgow, Scotland.  The students will participate in a special session on two major themes of the meeting - intellectual property rights and new technology, and ethical, legal, and value issues that arise in university-industry research interactions.  The faculty participant will present a paper on issues of patenting and biotechnology.  Student selection will be based on a national call for applications sent electronically to major programs in science and technology studies in the U.S., as well as to engineering faculty interested in ethical and value issues related to technology.  Applicants will submit short research papers which will be reviewed for merit by the IEEE Administrative Committee, including the student representative who is organizing the special session.  Results from the conference are expected to be published in the SSIT magazine Technology and Society, and in the Social Science Computing Review.",
