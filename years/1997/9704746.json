 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704746  Siegel    The goal of the proposed project is to study  the effects of surfactant on free surface flows in  their highly nonlinear regime.  This includes the  time-dependent evolution of an interface that is severely  deformed and contains many excited wavelengths.  Attention will be focused  on a simple model system, namely the  displacement of a viscous fluid by a less viscous  fluid in a Hele-Shaw cell (a cell consisting of  two closely spaced glass plates). The interface   between the fluids is subject to the Saffman-Taylor  instability and develops a finger-like pattern.  This system serves as a model for flow through porous media.    Moreover, since the Saffman-Taylor instability is  an undesirable phenomena in crude  oil recovery, the problem is industrially important.  The main emphasis will be on examining  the effects  of surfactants on   steady and time-dependent finger patterns,  and their role in enhancing or suppressing  finger-tip splitting and side-branching instabilities.  This differs from studies of surfactant effects  in most other systems, since typically the free surfaces  are assumed to be fixed in space or only slightly deformed,  or close to a steady state configuration.  Methods  employed will include asymptotic analysis  and numerical simulation. The practical goal  of such studies is to control the size  and shape of fingers, in the hopes of enhancing  oil recovery.    Free surface motions, such as waves on water or bubbles rising  in a liquid, are important in many areas of science and  engineering. A number of modern technological processes  involve free surface flows. Examples include coating processes,   ink jet printing processes, and oil recovery.  The presence of surfactant  on a free surface can significantly  affect the properties of the   surface.  Common surfactants include detergents,  fatty acids, and alcohols.  Even very small amounts of surfactant can  cause significant variation in the value of surface tension  at a fluid-fluid interface.  Thi s can have a dramatic influence on  the evolution of the free surface.   Such effects are particularly important during materials processing in   the microgravity environment of space.  Understanding  the role of  surface tension variations in interfacial evolution  will hopefully lead to better  control of free surface motion in engineering applications.",
