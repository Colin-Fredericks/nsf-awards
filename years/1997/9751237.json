 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biology and Chemistry departments have recently joined efforts to formulate an Undergraduate Program in Biotechnology designed as an emphasis within either a biology or a chemistry major. This program will enhance classroom and laboratory instruction by training students in the modern laboratory methodologies of biotechnology. Relevant equipment being requested includes 12 molecular biology workstations (set of three micropipettors, a mini-gel electrophoresis box & power supply, a picocentrifuge, and a vortex mixer). Dry-bath incubators, safety splash shields, automatic pipet-aids, micro-centrifuges, Mini-protean  gel boxes & transblot inserts, water baths, and orbital mixers will be shared by the stations. Individual equipment items being requested include the following: thermocycler amplitron & printer, refrigerated micro centrifuge and table-top centrifuge, fluorometer,UV spectrophotometer, UV transilluminator & documentation system, Sequencing System, vacuum concentrating speed dryer, and low pressure automated liquid chromatography unit. This program will improve the curriculum by: 1) allowingfor effective instruction of the principles and technologies associated with current Biotechnology applications through a new course, Molecular Biology (BIO 4325), anG enhancement of existing courses, Genetics (BIO 3325), Cell Biology (BIO 4352), and Biochemistry (BIO OR CHM 4361,4362 AND 4362) 2) including relevant biotechnology applications in lower division courses for science major such as General Biology (BIO 2101,2102, AND 2103) The focus of this program is consistent with the departmental goal of effectively preparing students for careers in the health sciences, research, teaching, and the biotechnology industry.",
