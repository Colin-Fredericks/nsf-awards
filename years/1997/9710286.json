 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences   Directorate, Professors Mark J. Kurth and Neil E. Schore, of the   Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Davis, are   developing broadly applicable methodologies for the preparation and   evaluation of reactive polymer systems of use in organic synthesis.    Polymers with functionalized cross-links provide more homogeneous sets of   environments for substrate, catalyst, and reagent linkage, while polymers   based on cyclopolymerized functional monomer units afford less flexible   polymer backbones and potentially greater stereocontrol of linkage sites.    New traceless linker strategies are designed for use in both organic and   organometallic cycloaddition reactions of utility in combinatorial   studies, and an iterative strategy affords access to novel   polyisoxazole-based polypyrimidine and polypurine systems.  Following the successful development of solid-phase peptide synthesis, a   technique which allows the rapid and efficient preparation of   polypeptides, the possibility of carrying out other sorts of organic   transformations on solid `supports` has attracted a great deal of   attention.  Professors Mark J. Kurth and Neil E. Schore, of the   Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Davis, with the   support of the Organic Synthesis Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences   Directorate, synthesize new polymeric solid supports designed to   facilitate specific chemical reactions of importance in the synthesis of   significant organic molecules.  They investigate new strategies for the   attachment of molecules to these solid supports, for the conversion of   these molecules to new species via various types of reactions, and for   the release from the solid support of the products of these reactions.    These solid-phase organic synthetic strategies are of direct relevance to   the field of combinatorial synthesis, wherein `libraries` of related   molecules of potential activity may be rapidly prepared and screened for   activity.",
