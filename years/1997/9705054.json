 "awd_abstract_narration": "Process Design, Modeling and Optimization in Electronics and Health Care  Products    This proposal structures two teams of graduate traineeships that integrate  graduate research with practical contributions to industrial problems. The  industrial partners use cutting edge technology to create new health care  products (Becton Dickinson) and electronic devices (Nortel) and the need  for statistical support to develop and control new processes is acute.  This training plan leverages the close collaboration between the principal  investigators and the partner companies and the projects have been chosen  because of their importance to the companies and their statistical  complexity and depth. Many of the statistical issues are nonstandard and  provide a fertile ground for thesis research in design and estimation for  nonparametric regression models, spatial and spatio-temporal models for  batch processes and run-by-run process optimization.  By weaving the  trainee's research with their industrial experience they will learn to  transfer the problem solving skills expected for thesis research to the  development of innovative statistical approaches to meet a company's goals  of product development and product quality.    This project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
