 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-day training workshop, \"Data and Information       Management in the Ecological Sciences,\" will address       environmental information management challenges identified by       research scientists of the Ecological Society of America and the       Organization of Biological Field Stations (OBFS). The workshop       will be held in conjunction with the 1997 annual meeting of the       Ecological Society of America in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The       workshop is endorsed by ESA's Long-Term Studies Section, OBFS,       and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis,       and will be additionally supported (logistics) by the Long-Term       Ecological Research Network Office at the University of New       Mexico.              Workshop participants include directors of field stations       and marine laboratories or their appointed representatives,       individuals or organizations engaged in long-term ecological       studies, and individuals directly involved in the management of       ecological data and information. Workshop objectives are to       introduce attendees to data and information management concepts,       protocols, and relevant technology. Specific topics include:       hardware, software, communication and networking strategies,       data entry, quality assurance/quality control, scientific       databases, metadata, data archival, World Wide Web, site       implementation strategies, managing climate data, data analysis       and scientific visualization tools, as well as a series of       roundtable discussions of related issues. In addition to       seminars and hands-on training at the workshop, relevant       materials and workshop proceedings will be collated and       \"published\" via the World Wide Web to ensure broad dissemination       of information.  In addition, all organizational, agenda, paper       abstract information, etc. will be on the WWW by the time of the       workshop, August 8, 1997.  See www.lternet.edu for the link.",
