 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703891  Williams   A number of mathematical problems for multidimensional diffusions arising in   applications are being studied. These are grouped under three headings. (i) Approximation   of multiclass queueing networks in heavy traffic. Most queueing network models cannot   be analyzed exactly and must be approximated by more tractable models. A certain class   of diffusion processes, known as reflecting Brownian motions, have been shown to   approximate heavily loaded single class and some multiclass queueing networks. However,   currently there is no general limit theorem to justify such approximations for heavily   loaded multiclass queueing networks with feedback. Although it is known that such   approximations do not hold in complete generality, the PI seeks to identify broad classes   of multiclass networks for which they do hold and to provide limit theorems to support   such approximations. (ii) Long run behavior of reflecting Brownian motions. For the   purpose of obtaining approximate measures of performance for queueing network models   and as a problem of intrinsic mathematical interest, it is natural to consider the long run   behavior of reflecting Brownian motions. In particular, conditions for positive recurrence   of semimartingale reflecting Brownian motions are being sought by study of a related   deterministic dynamical system. (iii) Stochastic differential equations with   discontinuous/degenerate coefficients and applications to nonlinear time series. The need   for nonlinear models in time series analysis has become increasingly apparent in recent   years. Continuous time models can greatly facilitate the analysis of irregularly spaced data.   A useful class of nonlinear continuous time models are the continuous time threshold   autoregressive models. These are defined by stochastic differential equations with a   discontinuous and degenerate diffusion coefficient. A compelling problem for future use of   these models is to resolve the problem of uniqueness for solutio ns of these equations when   the order of the model is larger than two. This problem, as well as multivariate versions of   it, are being studied.  Multidimensional diffusions processes are used as stochastic models in a wide   variety of applications in the physical, biological, engineering and social sciences.   Motivated by such applications, a number of mathematical problems for diffusions are   being studied. As an illustrative example, queueing networks are of current relevance for   analyzing congestion and delay in computer systems, communication networks and   complex manufacturing systems. These networks may process more than one class of   customer or job (e.g., voice, video and data may pass through each node in a   communication network), have complex feedback structures (e.g., as in reentrant lines for   semiconductor wafer fabrication) and are frequently heavily loaded. In general such   models cannot be analyzed exactly and one is naturally led to seek tractable   approximations, such as multidimensional diffusions. A challenging mathematical question   here is when is such an approximation valid? Results of recent years have revealed this to   be a complex issue for multiclass networks with feedback. This question and others for   multidimensional diffusions are being pursued under this grant.",
