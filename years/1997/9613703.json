 "awd_abstract_narration": "9613703  This NSF-CONACyT collaborative research project is on very  high level programming languages that will facilitate  flexible ways of problem as well as query specification.  The term \"very high level\" is used to mean a declarative (as  opposed to a conventional, procedural) language, in which  the emphasis is on what a program should compute rather than  on the details of how the computation should be carried out.  The focus of the research is on sets, which are central in  applications of database query languages and logical  specifications of problems.  While previous research has  laid the foundations for a set-oriented declarative  language, the new research will expand the paradigm with two  important capabilities: constraints and preferences. In this  programming paradigm, a user can specify the mandatory  requirements (or constraints) of a problem and also the  optional requirements (or preferences) that guide the  search for optimal solutions. In considering how to  formulate preferences based upon aggregate values, the  research will examine how to integrate sets, constraints,  and preferences. The proposed research covers design and  implementation issues, as well as applications, and will be  carried out in collaboration with Professor Mauricio Osorio,  at the Universidad de las Americas, Puebla, Mexico.  ***",
