 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Slodkowski    Slodkowski will continue working on  polynomial hulls improving on   understanding the structure of hulls of families of Jordan arcs  under low regularity assumptions. The first part of the proposal   concentrates on a series of problems generated by the crucial question   when is such a hull a topological hypersurface. Slodkowski plans to   investigate them under regularity assumptions formulated in terms of   quasiconformal geometry. Realization of this program will yield  applications to holomorphic motions, among others.  The second part   of the proposal concerns the evolution  of subsets in   higher-dimensional space, defined in terms of weak solutions of   certain degenerate nonlinear PDE's involving  the Levi curvature.  The main focus is on analyzing  the evolution of pseudoconvex   hypersufaces and  of pseudoconcave sets, in order to understand the   structure of weakly pseudoconvex domains and of polynomial hulls.                A successful completion of this proposal would solve, among   other things, important problems on holomorphic motions, which would   have significant applications to the theory of dynamical systems and   to Teichmuller theory. The theory of the dynamical systems, which is   developing very rapidly at present, has important applications to   to many applied problems. The  Teichmuller theory has not only   fundamental implications for geometry,  but it is also an important   tool  for string theory, one of the newest theories of the elementary   particles' physics.
