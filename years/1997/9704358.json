 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  This project addresses  the integration of speech  recognition and natural language processing components in a  speech understanding system.  Most current speech  recognizers  use  word-level  hidden  Markov  models  (HMMs)in conjunction  with n-gram language models.  Additional flexibility can  be  achieved by using phones as  the basic recognition  unit. This  research  proposes  a  new  technique  called  a  SOHMM   Stochastic  Observation  Hidden Markov Model  -  for  recognizing words  from  phone  candidates.   Most  current  spoken  language systems use  probabilistic language models to model syntactic  and  semantic  patterns.   This project will integrate  a  SOHMM-  based speech  recognizer  with  a Constraint-Dependency  Grammar  (CDG) parser,  which supports the use of lexical,  prosodic,  syntactic, and semantic knowledge sources in a  uniform modular framework, as well  as the use of domain-  specific constraints.  This work  will refine  the  model  for the SOHMM-CDG spoken language  processing system  and  address  the problem of building  and  pruning  word graphs,  which act as the interface between the two components. An  experiment will be conducted to demonstrate the  effectiveness  of the  integrated system for recognizing and  parsing utterances  in the  TIMIT  and  Resource Management  corpora.  Sentence  accuracy should be significantly  improved over what is possible using only statistical  language  models,  especially  when  domain-specific  constraints are used ***.",
