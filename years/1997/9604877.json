The subject matter is \"Current Trends in High Energy  Physics and Cosmology\".  Many of the leading topics in high  energy physics and cosmology will be presented.  In addition to  the core set of lectures, discussion groups will be created  enabling participation in \"cutting edge\" research and the  initiation of collaborations.  The major goal of BCSPIN is to  provide a stimulating environment in which the brightest student,  postdocs and faculty from the BCSPIN countries can come in to  contact with leading physicists, particularly from the U.S.      Scope:  The establishment of a school of excellence in physics  will enhance interest in this field in the South Asia region and   will greatly strengthen the scientific potential of young  researchers there.  Without the opportunity given by a school of  this kind, it is unlikely that the majority of the students would  ever have exposure to such outstanding scientists.  Previous  schools have been highly regarded and the best students will no  doubt eventually enrich American science.  BCSPIN is supported   multinationally with substantial funding provided by the  International Center for Theoretical Physics in Triest.        This award is jointly funded by the Division of International  Programs and the Division of   Physics.    ***",
