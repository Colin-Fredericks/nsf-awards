A topic  of  interest is the nature of the superconductor-insulator transition  in lower dimensional systems. A further topic is the search for a  useful     analogy     between     two-dimensional     disordered  superconductors and high Tc cuprate superconductors.  Samples  of  varying  dimensionality are to be studied by means of  transport,  tunneling,  and  scanning tunneling microscopy,  emphasizing  the  effects of dimensional crossover and disorder.   %%%  This  experimental  research project  is  based  on  use  of  the  technique  known  as  electron tunneling, and  in  particular  on  finding  methods to fabricate barriers suitable for  the  use  of  this   technique.  Electron  tunneling  is  a  quantum-mechanical  process  by  which  an electron can pass a potential  barrier  or  \"hill\",  which could not be overcome under the rules of classical  physics,  governing macroscopic objects like planets  and  tennis  balls. Quantum mechanics allows such hills to \"tunneled under\" on  a  probabilistic basis with measurable rates of transfer  limited  to cases of very small mass and short (Angstrom scale) distances,  such as the case of electrons in atoms. The technique of electron  tunneling  is  important in determining the  density  of  states,  especially  in  superconductors; and also as the  basis  for  the  scanning  tunneling microscope. This research project probes  the  effects  of atomic scale disorder and geometric configuration  on  transport,  with  emphasis  on  the  metal-insulator  transition.  Geometries of interest include planar and one-dimensional  linear  samples.  Results  from  this research may  include  unusual  new  effects  or  st ructures which may find application in technology.  This research project is interdisciplinary in nature and involves  graduate  and  postdoctoral  students  who  will  be  excellently  trained to enter positions in industry, government or education.  ***",
