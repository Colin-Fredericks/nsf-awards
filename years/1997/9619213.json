 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Frank R. Stermitz, of the Department of Chemistry of Colorado   State University, is supported by the Organic Synthesis Program for his   studies of alkaloids of importance in plant-insect interactions.  His   studies focus on the isolation, structure, biosynthesis, and insect   processing of alkaloids in conifers (pine, spruce, and fir trees).  The   structures of an array of 2,6-disubstituted piperidine alkaloids is found   in the conifers are being elucidated by a combination of isolation, mass   spectral analysis, and spectroscopic methods, as well as by synthesis   and/or semisynthesis.  Plant feeding experiments with carbon-13 labeled   compounds appearing to be plausible biosynthetic precursors will   elucidate details of the synthesis of these alkaloids.  The ability of   spruce species to generate trans-disubstituted piperidines, whereas pine   species generate only cis-disubstituted compounds, will also be explored.    Analysis of conifer-feeding beetle, butterfly, and moth larvae and their   excretion products will determine how insects process the piperidine   alkaloids.  Finally, extracts of plants displaying activity against   Mycobacterium tuberculosis will be analyzed in order to identify   potential anti-tuberculosis agents.  With support from the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Frank R.   Stermitz, of the Department of Chemistry of Colorado State University,   studies the occurrence in conifers (pine, spruce, and fir trees) of   compounds displaying biological activity.  The particular `alkaloids`   (naturally occurring nitrogen-containing compounds) found in these trees   are found in similar or identical forms in an astounding variety of other   natural sources, including the Mexican bean beetle, which synthesizes the   alkaloids itself, and poisonous frogs, which obtain the alkaloids from   unknown food sources.  Study of both the plant sources of the alkaloids   and the insects which feed upon them is expected to shed light on a   number of important issues, including the way in which insects circumvent   the defensive strategies of plants and possibly use ingested compounds to   deter their own predators.  In the course of related studies, plant   extracts were isolated which display activity against the bacillus which   causes tuberculosis.  These extracts will be analyzed in order to   identify new classes of compounds with potential therapeutic applications   against strains of tuberculosis resistant to current drug therapies.",
