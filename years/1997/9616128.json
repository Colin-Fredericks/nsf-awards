 "awd_abstract_narration": "Daniel Akins of CUNY City College is supported by the Experimental   Physical Chemistry Program to investigate electron transfer (ET) between   donors and acceptor molecules in ordered molecular matrices using   picosecond time-resolved Raman spectroscopy.  His research will focus on   (a) structural changes accompanying ET; (b) the interplay between the   conformational change induced in neighboring molecules and the ET   process; and (c) a system in which porphyrin derivatives are positioned   in artificial matrices with well-defined distances and orientations.  The   PI will investigate the structural changes of the scattering species   (reactant, intermediate, product species or matrix) as a function of time   after the photoinitiated ET process.  Specific experiments include   monitoring conformational change in a model system:  a synthetic bilayer   with intercalated donor and acceptor of known distances and orientations,   and measuring rates of ET as either separation distance or orientation is   varied.    These studies focus on electron transfer between molecules embedded or   attached to media that separate and orient electron donors and acceptors.    Alignment systems of this nature are crucial for important biological   processes such as enzymatic reactions and photosynthesis.  Some practical   `spin-offs` that may be facilitated by an improved understanding of ET   are the use of synthetic ET systems in bioengineering applications such   as drug delivery and the elucidation of the cancer-killing mechanisms of   some drugs.  In addition, improved knowledge might enable us to design   efficient artificial molecular devices for capturing and storing solar   energy and for information processing at very high efficiencies.",
