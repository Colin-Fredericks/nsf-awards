Significant research effort has focused  on this margin in recent years with objective of NSF support on  understanding history and amplitude of sea level change during the  Tertiary. Series of holes has been drilled on-shore New Jersey (EAR  and OCE support) and Ocean Drilling Program has focused on drilling  offshore sediment sequences. Additional ODP drilling planned for  July of this year in mid-shelf region. Office of Naval Research  also supporting large project in area to examine acoustics and  physical properties of shallow sediments. Present project has  series of objectives, including seismically tieing land drilling to  offshore work; mapping spatial variability in imaged Tertiary  sediments; examining sea-level fluctuation in seismic data; and  surveying shallow water sites for potential future drilling.  Principal investigators at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory and  Rutgers University have been leaders in focusing community research  effort on this margin.  ***",
