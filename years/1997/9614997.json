 "awd_abstract_narration": "McCormick  9614997       The principal investigator and his colleagues organize the eighth Copper Mountain conference on multigrid methods, in cooperation with the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics.   This grant provides support for students to participate in the conference.         Numerical methods for solving a differential equation usually begin by imposing a grid on the region where the equation holds.  From the differential equation, algebraic equations are then developed; their solution represents the solution of the differential equation.  The accuracy of the approximate solution commonly is measured by the fineness of the grid.  Multigrid methods are numerical methods for solving partial differential equations that systematically exploit the relationship between approximate solutions on different grids to arrive at a solution whose accuracy is consistent with the finest grid but for considerably less work.  The methods are often dramatically more efficient than others.  Research in the past dozen years has extended the methods to a broad range of problems of considerable practical import in engineering, manufacturing, materials, physics, and fluid dynamics.  This project supports student participants at the eighth Copper Mountain conference on multigrid methods.  The students present a talk on their research in the regular sessions of the conference.  The primary objective here is to encourage student participation in this rapidly evolving field, and to provide an excellent opportunity for these students to demonstrate their new results, to learn more about the field from its experts, and to become a more integral part of the discipline.  Supporting student participation is critical for improving the infrastructure of this important field and for advancing the quality of its core contributors.",
