 "awd_abstract_narration": "9709101  Balazs    This is a theoretical research grant to study the effects of  applied forces on polymer films and blends in order to  fabricate tailored interfaces and high-strength materials.  To do this, theoretical models and computer simulations will  be developed to incorporate external forces; determine how  these forces affect morphology; and, to correlate morphology  to macroscopic properties.    In the study of polymer films, the focus will be on polymer  chains tethered to solid surfaces.  The interactions between  such polymer-coated surfaces are responsible for stabilizing  colloidal solutions and reducing friction between  interfaces.  To model this problem of mechanically  compressing, stretching or deforming confined polymer  layers, two-dimensional self-consistent field calculations  and scaling theory will be used.  The results will provide  guidelines for fabricating optical devices, such as bistable  switches, flocculating agents, which are important in the  production of wood and paper products, and layered  composites with tailored properties.    In the study of polymer blends, the focus will be on the  mixing of \"off-the-shelf\" polymers.  This process holds  considerable promise as a means of creating new materials at  relatively low cost.  The actual fabrication of polymer  blends, however, poses significant challenges. Most polymers  are immiscible and phase separate into macroscopic domains.  Shear and flow can produce finer dispersements which improve  mechanical properties.  %%%  This research grant will use theoretical models and computer  simulations to study the impact of various forces on the  properties of polymers.  In particular, the research will  study polymer films, such as are used for coatings, and  polymer blends (mixed polymers).  These studies are at the  forefront of research in polymer science and engineering,  Besides being of great fundamental interest, and a  significant theoretical challenge, the research has the  potential to directly affect th e design and production of  new materials.  ***",
