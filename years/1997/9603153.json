 "awd_abstract_narration": "Procedures for Analytical Ultracentrifugation        The ultracentrifuge provides direct and reliable information about the  molecular weights and the interactions of macromolecules as they exist  in solution. Sedimentation equilibrium approaches are based on  equilibrium thermodynamics and thus can provide reliable estimates of  the parameters of molecules in solution. Interferometric observations  of concentration distributions provide a high degree of precision for  such estimations. The recent commercial introduction of automated  interferometry in a modern ultracentrifuge provides a powerful tool  with a high \"signal to noise ratio\" for studying macromolecular  distributions. The proposed research will examine ways to improve the  precision of such measurements. This should lead to the ability to  carry out experiments under a wider range of conditions and to better  distinguish amongst alternative explanations (models) of the systems  investigated both for equilibrium and velocity experiments.         Software and new approaches to equilibrium sedimentation experiments,  if successful, will make experiments easier to carry out, and either  faster or more precise and thus able to provide more meaningful  information. These improvements would, for example, facilitate  determinations of levels of impurities in protein preparations or  estimations of the strength of interactions between molecules. The  programs to be developed should make it easier (and sometimes possible)  to obtain information from difficult interacting systems, such as the  complexes formed between cytokines and their receptors. These systems  often exhibit a sequence of complex formations where it is difficult to  determine stoichiometries.         These various approaches will be applied to problems of topical  interest, largely, but not completely, from biotechnology enterprises  to try to answer interesting questions.",
