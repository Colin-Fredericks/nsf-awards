 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award permits the Psychology Department at Washington University to purchase instrumentation to store and analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission typography data. Currently cognitive scientists in the department conduct cognitive research using fMRI and PET machines located at the Washington University Medical School campus and they must analyze the resultant data there. This makes convenient and continuous access difficult both for senior researchers and students. The instrumentation provided will allow transmission of this information to the Psychology Department where it can be analyzed. The system includes: a server computer which will receive the large data structures and store the images for distribution to other work stations; an SGI Work Station that takes advantage of programs that have been developed to provide 2-dimensional surface reconstructrions of the human cortex; three work-stations; an eithernet hub; a color printing device; a half-time technician who will be responsible for the initial development and maintenance of the system.  Two projects currently under way will make immediate use of the system. Both address the neural underpinnings of cognitive components of behavior. The first - PET Activation Studies of Words - addresses those areas of the brain which are actively engaged in processing distinct aspects of words and the neural underpinnings of the attentional control systems that coordinate such processes. The second project - Imaging Studies of Learning and Memory - addresses those brain areas which are involved in the distinct aspects of encoding and retrieval of information from episodic, semantic and procedural memory systems.  This equipment will also be used for training graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the area of cognitive neuroscience.",
