 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603035  Glazier    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Professor James Glazier of the University od  Notre Dame and Professor Masaki Sano of the Tohoku  University in Sendai, Japan.  This project provides for  research in the area of pattern formation and complex  systems.  The researchers will be studying cell sorting and  turbulence.  They will study the physical and biological  mechanisms of cell sorting during embryonic development,  both theoretically and experimentally.  This should  establish detailed quantitative agreement between  experiments and the Potts model simulations and explain  several morphogenic processes.  Their next goal is to study  turbulence in Rayleigh-Benard convection in Hg.   They will  accomplish this by characterizing the velocity histograms  and spectra of hard turbulence using new velocity probes.  They will then determine velocity histograms for the  ultrahard turbulence regime which they expect to differ from  hard turbulence.    The proposal brings together the efforts of two laboratories  which both work on living and non-living materials and both  combine experimental and theoretical studies of physical and  biological pattern formation.  Their equipment and expertise  is also complementary.  The results of the research will  provide realistic parameters in their computer models that  would allow for full quantitative simulations.  Through the  exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden  our base of basic knowledge and promote international  ulderstanding and cooperation.",
