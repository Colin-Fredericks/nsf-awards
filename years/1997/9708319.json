 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708319  Grist  Cardiovascular disease costs an estimated $151.3 billion in  the U.S. annually, and atherosclerosis is the leading cause  of these expenditures.  The treatments for atherosclerotic  vascular disease require an accurate diagnosis of the degree  and extent of arterial vascular disease.  Diagnosis of  atherosclerotic vascular disease currently relies on digital  subtraction angiography (DSA), in which an intraarterial  catheter is placed at the vessel of interest, and iodinated  contrast is injected during the acquisition of images  depicting the arterial lumen.  Magnetic resonance  angiography (MRA) has recently been widely advocated as a  noninvasive method for imaging arterial disease.  The method  can be performed at a much lower cost than DSA, since it  does not require arterial catheterization and is nearly risk  free.  Cost savings using the MRA techniques have been  estimated at from $800 (aorta studies) to $3,430 (carotid  studies) per examination.  For the carotid arteries alone,  this could account for $1.5 billion in medical savings.  However, the expected savings would exceed this value  because the MRA methods can be used in several different  anatomic regions, including the renal, carotid, aortic,  peripheral, and pulmonary arteries.    The investigators have developed a method called 3D MR-DSA  that combines a number of the positive attributes of MRA and  digital subtraction angiography.  The method has been shown  to be very powerful, but the operational aspects need to be  improved by research.  Results from this project are  expected to : 1) Improve operational aspects of 3D MR-DSA  data acquisition and processing to provide an examination  procedure as close as possible to X-ray DSA, 2) Improve  image quality for 3D MR-DSA, 3) Identify, methods to reduce  the dose of contrast agent required for 3D MR DSA, 4)  Develop a strategy for disseminating 3D MR-DSA to 5 study  sites, and 5) Determine the costs of 3D MR-DSA relative to  conventional angiography.  The ultima te goal of the  investigation is to develop a robust, low cost MRA technique  that provides accurate diagnostic information and has  operational characteristics similar to conventional  angiography.  This requires a collaborative research effort  between medical physicists, engineers, and radiologists to  define the performance requirements and identify technical  solutions to the existing problems.  The educational  component of the project is directed towards developing a  seminar series course that teaches engineers and medical  physicists the basics of cost analysis and technology  assessment.  The initial implementation of the course will  be performed at the University of Wisconsin and is to be  presented at the 1999 International Society for Magnetic  Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) meeting.  ***",
