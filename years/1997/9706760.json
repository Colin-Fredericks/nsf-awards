 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706760    Swiech    The proposed research revolves around the notion of viscosity  solution, which is a notion of weak solution for equations of  Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) type. It is both basic  and applied and can be divided into two parts: partial  differential equations in infinite dimensional  spaces and applications to stochastic optimal control, and  elliptic and parabolic equations. As regards the first part, the  investigator plans to continue research in the development of  the theory of viscosity solutions (i.e. generalized solutions)  of second order HJBI equations in Hilbert space. The basic  issues are the existence and uniqueness of solutions, their  regularity, convergence properties, etc. HJBI equations are  of great importance from the point of view of applications,  since they are so-called dynamic programming equations,  corresponding to problems of stochastic optimal control of  dynamical systems driven by stochastic partial differential  equations. The second part of the proposed research concentrates  on some fundamental problems in the theory of fully nonlinear,  second order, uniformly elliptic and parabolic partial differential  equations. The major issue is the regularity and uniqueness of  solutions of nonlinear, uniformly parabolic and elliptic  equations which are not continuous in the space variable and,  on a larger scale, the development of a theory of generalized  solutions for fully nonlinear equations with measurable  ingredients. Despite some recent results, uniqueness is in general  still a major open problem, even for linear equations, where it is  connected to the uniqueness of so-called martingale solutions of  stochastic differential equations with discontinuous diffusion  coefficient. Finally the investigator proposes to work on a notion of  weak solution for degenerate elliptic and parabolic partial differential  equations with measurable terms. Equations of this type appear, for  instance, in problems involving motion driven by mean curva ture.  The classical theory of viscosity solutions does not apply here.  Its extension to such cases is needed.    The notion of viscosity solution is widely used by applied   mathematicians, and the proposed research has a potential of having  far-reaching consequences in applied sciences, especially the part  of it dealing with HJBI equations and control of dynamical systems  driven by stochastic partial differential equations. In real life  these are systems governed by partial differential equations that  exhibit noisy behavior. Applications range from engineering to  mathematical finance. One has to mention stochastic optimal  control of nonlinear partially observed systems (so-called  nonlinear filtering), distributed and boundary control of systems  modelled by stochastic partial differential equations, minimax  type control of infinite dimensional systems widely used in  engineering (which is connected to infinite dimensional differential  games), risk-sensitive control of small noise systems  (important in control of adaptive tracking devices), and recent  market models of interest rate dynamics (option pricing). The  investigator is convinced that the proposed research will help  understand the above problems and will provide a mathematical  framework that can be used by people working in these areas.",
