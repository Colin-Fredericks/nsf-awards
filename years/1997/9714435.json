 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southwest Center for Advanced Technological Education (SCATE) was funded to experiment and demonstrate how advanced technological education can be delivered over distance learning systems.  In the first three years the Center focused on the development of a distance learning infrastructure, professional development of faculty and revising materials for distance education delivery.  Now the Center is focusing on development and testing of technical courses that require a hands-on laboratory component.  Some of these courses are being developed in conjunction with other ATE Centers at Maricopa Community College District and Bellevue Community College; others are being developed for use at industrial sites.  An AAS degree program for distance learning technicians is also being developed.  The Center is increasing its role in professional development of faculty and in representing the infrastructure needs of the technical education community in distance learning networks.",
