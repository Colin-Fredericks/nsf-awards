 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618957  Friel    The Camden County, Edenton-Chowan, Elizabeth City-Pasquotank, Gates  County, and Hyde County public school systems in northeast North  Carolina collaborate with the University of North Carolina at  Chapel Hill, East Carolina University, and Elizabeth City State  University in a fifty-four month teacher enhancement project.  The  project targets all 378 K-8 teachers of mathematics in the  participating districts, each for 196 - 304 hours of professional  development in summer workshops and academic-year sessions, linked  with classroom implementation of exemplary instructional materials  in mathematics.  The effort is driven by student needs, national  standards, state standards and new requirements for graduation, and  North Carolina's new ABC's Program which places accountability for  student achievement at the building level, with incentives and  sanctions.    Submitted under the guidelines for Local Systemic Change through  Teacher Enhancement, Grades K-8, MIPS seeks to (1) implement  consistent and proven mathematics curricula that promote problem  solving and inquiry in the teaching and learning of mathematics, K-  8; (2) implement instructional models that are student-centered and  focus on quality work; (3) promote and effect an articulated  mathematics curriculum that is well integrated with district  classroom instruction; and (4) develop sustainable interactions  among the collaborating districts, along with the necessary support  and teacher leaders to institutionalize the changes made in  mathematics instruction, K-8.    The districts will initially focus the elementary teacher  enhancement and curricular components on helping teachers learn and  teach statistics through the NSF-funded Teach-Stat.  Elementary  teachers then participate in further enhancement centered around  children's mathematical development, leadership, and implementation  of exemplary instructional materials, especially Investigations in  Number, Data, and Space and Everyday Mathematics.  Middle  grades  efforts center around implementation of the Connected Mathematics  Program.    Expected cost-sharing in the project, derived from the five  participating school districts, is approximately 127% of the NSF  request.",
