The project is under  the direction of James W. Dufty, University of Florida and Shankar  P. Das, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.  The  investigators will study the long-standing problem of describing  glass formation and the properties of glasses.  Their objectives are  to identify qualitative mechanisms responsible for very slow  dynamics and to develop practical methods for quantitative  analysis.  They will limit their study to the idealized hard sphere  system in order to take advantage of recent developments which  permit accurate theoretical analyses of the dynamics in both dense  fluid and crystal phases, not available for any other atomic or  molecular systems.  These prototype studies will address some of  the most basic questions relevant to glass formation and their  properties.  Glasses and related composites play an essential role in  the development of new materials in a wide range of applications.     Scope:  This collaboration is driven by the research interests of two  highly competent investigators who have worked together on  closely related research for the past six years.  The unique  approach they have developed for solving a significant problem has  excellent potential for scientific breakthrough.  The support  requested is primarily for travel and per diem.  Postdocs and  graduate students involved in the program will be supported by  their respective institutions.    ***",
