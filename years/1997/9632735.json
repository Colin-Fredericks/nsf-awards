 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Number: ECS-9632735  Principal Investigator:  Thomas Katsouleas    Title:  Novel Tunable Light Source Based on a Laser Ionized Capacitor Array- An Electromagnetic Accordion    The fundamental principles of a new radiation source capable of high power, variable pulse length and broad tunability over orders of magnitude will be investigated.  The approach may be characterized as an \"electromagnetic accordion\", in which a short laser pulse is used to ionize a low pressure working gas between an array of alternately charged capacitor plates.  The moving ionization front produced by the laser creates a time varying dielectric function that converts the static electric field of the capacitors into electromagnetic radiation.  In essence, the laser sweeps up the static waveform and squeezes it like an accordion into a similar but shortened propagating electromagnetic wavetrain.  The frequency of the output radiation is controlled by changing the gas pressures and/or the capacitor plate spacing; in principle, the frequency output could be varied over three decades.  Moreover, since the input waveform can be arbitrarily shaped by varying the bias and size of the capacitor plates, the output radiation can be designed to have arbitrary frequency chirp, amplitude modulation, or number of cycles.  The research will lead to the development of a single compact device that would produce MW pulses of coherent radiation spanning the spectrum from microwaves to visible light, with arbitrarily shaped and chirped or encoded wavetrains.  Such a device could economically provide many of the light source requirements for research, industry and medicine.",
