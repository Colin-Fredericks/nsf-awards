 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award to Omar Yaghi at Arizona State University is supported   by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division. The research   is aimed at developing and understanding new synthetic methods for the   construction of crystalline solid-state materials from purely inorganic   building blocks. The research will focus on utilizing transition metal   and main group oxide cages and cage aggregates in polymerization   reactions to produce porous materials that have diverse  pore size, shape   and function. Cationic, anionic and neutral, open-frameworks will be   synthesized having channels where guest molecules may reside.  Molecular   aggregates will be used as guests to prevent interpenetration of porous   networks.  The presence of weak interactions with the aggregates will   facilitate evacuation of the channels, leading to high mobility of the   guest species.  Zeolites and other porous materials have had an enormous   impact on the global economy, for example in catalysis and separations.   This study will advance our understanding of inclusion phenomena and lead   to diverse compositions with larger channels and  enhanced properties.  Through the CAREER plan, undergraduates, graduate students and precollege   teachers will participate in the above research with specific projects   directed at their needs and experience. Emphasis will be on solution and   solid-phase synthetic techniques, computer graphics and literature   searching. An introductory level course will be developed using case   studies as a teaching tool to highlight chemical concepts. An industrial   exchange program will also be instituted which will permit up to three   students per year to work with a company having interests in porous   solids.",
