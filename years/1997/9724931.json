The  event has three important goals: (1) build better linkages  between the research, business, and policy communities; (2)  encourage implementation of lessons learned to date; and (3)  scope future research needs in one comer of this young, cross-  cutting field.    More than just a powerful metaphor, industrial ecology offers a  systematic way of looking at the environmental impacts of modern  industrial activity.  It emphasizes the dense web of  interconnections between actors in modern economies, and it  highlights the prominent role of industry determining the overall  environmental burden.  The normative vision includes a  transformation from a simple, linear, oncethrough industrial  ecosystem to a more efficient arrangement which re-uses most  materials and requires few exogenous inputs to keep the system  going.  Implicit in this vision is active participation of  industry, and public policies designed to complement rather than  substitute for market forces.    Scale issues become important when (1) sorting out the relative  merits of proposals for example, an eco-industrial park versus a  waste exchange strategy; (2) the boundaries of economic and  political systems are not coincident; and (3) analyzing the  system's dynamics-how an industrial ecosystem evolves.    This project includes four tasks: prepare a background paper and  agenda, select workshop participants, convene the workshop, and  write up the results.  The investigators see the workshop as the  scoping phase of a longer term research project on scale issues  in implementing industrial ecology.  It is timely to hold this  workshop for two reasons: key lessons from previous research are  now ready to be implemented, and future research in this  burgeoning field needs to be prioritized.  ***",
