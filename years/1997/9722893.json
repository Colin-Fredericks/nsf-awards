 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722893  Zusman        This proposal focuses on determining the functional significance of the Drosophila Position      Specific (PS) integrin cytoplasmic domains. The experiments address the following questions:      1) Which morphogenetic and signaling processes require integrin cytoplasmic domains? 2)      Which regions of a subunit cytoplasmic domains affect specific developmental processes? 3)      Can a subunit cytoplasmic domains function in developmental processes without a ( subunit      cytoplasmic domain? 4) How do integrin cytoplasmic domains influence extracellular binding      and gene expression? 5) What are the molecules that associate and/or are involved with the PS      integrins in developmental processes and signaling pathways? These questions will be answered      using molecular, genetic and cellular techniques that will involve the following: 1) The ability of      integrin subunits lacking all or a portion of their cytoplasmic domains or having mutated      cytoplasmic domains to function in developmental processes, signaling pathways and gene      expression will be assessed. These experiments will involve altering cDNAs encoding a      subunits by in vitro mutagenesis techniques, inserting them into the Drosophila genome with P-      element transformation and expressing them with the Drosophila GAL4 system. Genomic DNA      encoding the ,( subunit will also be altered and expressed. 2) The requirements for a cytoplasmic      domains in processes requiring PS integrins, but not requiring ( subunit cytoplasmic domains      will be examined. 3) DNA encoding Drosophila integrin subunits with mutated cytoplasmic      domains will be transfected into S2 cells and examined for their ability to induce cell spreading      on matrix molecules. 4) A molecular characterization of mutations that produce \"integrin-like\"      phenotypes and show genetic interactions with mutations in integrin-encoding genes will be      performed. 5) Integrin cytoplasmic ligands and functio nally related molecules will be identified      by a genetic screen for suppressors of the dominant lethality caused by misexpression of the      cytoplasmic domain of an a subunit .",
