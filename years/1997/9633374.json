 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   program provides continued support for studies of organometallic reaction   mechanisms by Dr. Robert G. Bergman, Chemistry Department, University of   California at Berkeley.  Efforts will be focused on three projects.  The   first concerns interaction between transition metals from the left and   right sides of the series, respectively, within a single molecule.  A   second goal is generation of organometallic complexes that are highly   reactive due to the presence of an unpaired electron at the metal center.     In such species, relatively strong covalent bonds are formed to the   metal so that organic compounds that do not ordinarily associate with   metals may bond and then exhibit new reactivity.  Some chemistry of   analogous 18-electron metal anions will also be included.  The third   project is the synthesis of new ligands that confer planar chirality on   early and late transition metal complexes so that the stereochemistry of   metal-centered reactions that carry out organic transformations with   asymmetric induction may be investigated.   New metal dimerization   catalysts for preparing oligomers and polymers with unusual structures   from dienes and polyenes will be developed.  Chemical reactions involving organic molecules and transition metal   complexes are fundamental to the understanding of important catalytic and   biological processes.  In this program, the details of reactions in which   the presence of one or two metals imposes steric restrictions or develops   unusual electronic driving forces will be investigated.",
