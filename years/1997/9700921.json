 "awd_abstract_narration": "RESHETIKHIN      The main theme of this proposal is the study of quantized  universal enveloping algebras, their representations and their applications  to low dimensional topology and to quantum integrable models.  Among specific goals of the proposal are: q-W algebras their  quantization and their role in the representation theory of   quantum affine algebras, the duality aspects for q-W algebras,  tau- functions as spherical functions on Poisson Lie groups  and their quantization, various aspects of interrelations  between quantum and classical integrable systems and representation theory.      Recent decades were characterized by intense and productive  interaction of mathematics and physics. Large part of this  process was initiated in the study of classical and quantum  integrable systems and developed from there to various  questions related to conformal field theory and to  a very productive developments in the string theory.  On the mathematical side of this interaction are  various aspects of algebra, geometry and topology.  My research is focused mostly on the study of algebraic   structures resulted from this interaction and inspired   by it. They are remarkable not only because they are  quite exceptional but also because they have   important applications ranging from low dimensional topology and geometry  to solid state physics.",
