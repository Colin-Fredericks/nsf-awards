 "awd_abstract_narration": "OPP 9614847  Taylor and Taylor    Abstract  This award supports a project to systematically collect and  analyze the Jurassic fossil floras from three levels at Carapace  Nunatak, in southern Victoria Land, and to complete  reconnaissance for similar aged deposits at Shapeless Mountain  near the head of Wright Valley.  These floras represent the most  extensive deposits of Jurassic fossil plants that are known from  the continental portion of Antarctica.  They are poorly known,  both from a biostratigraphic and floristic standpoint, and as  such are important not only to our understanding of floral  changes in Antarctica, but also to correlations with other  Gondwana continents.  In addition to impressions and  compressions, the site also contains permineralized specimens.  In this rare preservation type, cells and tissue systems are  intact so that details about the anatomy and morphology of these  Jurassic plants can be evaluated.  The preservation of the  permineralized floral elements at Carapace is identical to those  of Permian and Triassic age that have been studied in over the  past ten years.  As a result a continuum of structurally  preserved plant fossils extending from the Permian into the Upper  Jurassic of Antarctica are available for examination.    In this context it will be possible to examine details of seed  plant growth, development and evolution at high paleolatitudes  during the latter stages of the Paleozoic and extending into the  Jurassic.  The few specimens collected during an earlier  reconnaissance at Carapace Nunatak suggest a flora rich in  conifers and seed ferns.  The conifer components will be  important in evaluating basal character states within the major  conifer families, while the seed ferns will be useful in  evaluating the characters and relationships of these Mesozoic  gymnosperms to the geologically younger flowering plants.  The  site also contains some woody specimens (small twigs, fragments  of wood), in which the tree rings will be analyzed and com pared  with those from other high latitude sites, both older (Permian  and Triassic) and younger (Cretaceous, Tertiary).  Because of the  patchy nature of the silicification and the discontinuous  sedimentary beds, field work is anticipated to involve primarily  day trips via helicopter to the sites immediately followed by  sectioning of material in the Crary Laboratory at McMurdo Station  in order to reduce the collecting of unproductive material.",
