 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604617  Hall  Phaseolin, the major seed protein of the bean Phaseolus vulgaris, is highly expressed and accumulated during embryogenesis but is absent from vegetative tissues of bean plants.  A similar pattern of gene expression is observed in stable transformants of tobacco with the beta-phaseolin (phas) gene.  As for many plant genes, cis-elements essential for spatial regulation of the phas gene promoter lie close to the transcription start site.  Although many DNA sequence motifs known to interact with transcription factors are present in this promoter region, none of these transactivators has yet been shown to be tissue specific.  Indeed, the substantial activity seen in transient assays of phas/gus constructs introduced into leaf cells by bombardment or electroporation indicates that nuclear factors present in vegetative tissues can interact productively with phas promoter elements.  In contrast, stable transformed plants using identical constructs show no expression in vegetative tissues or in calli from such plants even when treated with a range of growth regulators.  As for several animal and yeast genes, these observations suggest the integration into plant chromatin plays a role in regulating phas gene expression.  This research will use tobacco transformed with a single copy of the phas gene to evaluate the role of chromatin in phas gene expression.  Cis-elements that regulate the phas promoter in vivo will be identified by footprinting methods that compare the interaction of cis-elements with cellular factors in vegetative (leaf) and seed tissues.  Mapping of nucleosome position in leaves and seeds will determine if nucleosomes are positioned over specific regions of the phas promoter, which could prevent access by transacting factors resulting in the inactivity seen in vegetative tissues. The goals of this research are generally to understand the cellular mechanisms that confer stringent developmental and spatial regulation on the phas gene promoter, and specifically to determine  how that promoter is converted from a totally inactive state in vegetative tissues to a highly active state during embryogenesis.
