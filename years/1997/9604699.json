 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graham  9604699      The mudskipper fish are in the subfamily Oxudercinae of the family  Goblidae. There are10 genera and  about 25 species of oxudercines, including the mudskippers. This  subfamily has a broad geographic  range, from West Africa to Samoa, and most species live in shallow,  warm, hypcxic tropical regions. The  mudskippers (Periophthalmus, Periophthalmodon, Boleophthalmus, and  Scartelaos) are distinguished  from other oxudercines by their ability to live at the water  surface, with their heads exposed to air, or to even  leave water and live in the air for extended periods. Mudskippers  accordingly have adaptations for air  breathing, for terrestrial locomotion, and for aerial vision, as  well as other specializations related to being out  of water. This study will examine some of these adaptations and  attempt to understand the  macroevolutionary sequence of their acquisition, - - - that is to  say, the point in the expansion of this group  when adaptations related to air exposure appeared. This sequence is  important to know because, while  the current theory about the evolution of vertebrate life on land is  replete with details, based on fossils,  about the structural changes that accompanied the land invasion,  much less detail is known about the  changes that occurred at the behavioral, sensory, physiological and  biochemical levels. Because the  oxudercines contains species that never leave water and others that  are highly terrestrial, this group  provide a special window to the \"bows\" and \"whys\" of terrestrial  invasion. This study will investigate the  nature of the functional elements related to the transition from  water to land, in particular, how access to  aerial oxygen affected breathing and metabolism. The mudskippers, in  an ecological sense, are exploiting  an open ecological niche between water and land, one that was not  filled by amphibians. The PI thus  provide clues as to how ancient ancestors of ail land animals may  have made the transition from living  in  shallow-water to living on land.",
