 "awd_abstract_narration": "9321351  Drukier    The goal of the proposed research is to develop low cost desktop and portable systems with very high computational capabilities for both scientific and applied engineering applications.  In Phase I we developed a transputer-based hardware platform coupled with a very powerful analytical tool, the wavelet transform.  We demonstrated that with appropriate coding the wavelet algorithm allows almost perfect parallelization, i.e. the computational speed is practically proportional to the number of transputers used.  The Phase I results demonstrate that the hardware/software system we developed is scalable over two orders of magnitude in speed and memory.      The Phase II effort will consist of software development for two-dimensional wavelet transforms and its implementation on next-generation HTRAM transputers.  The 2D algorithms will be optimized for high efficiency (25:1 or better) real time image compression as well as for a number of other applications.  These include analysis of destructive wave propagation in complex mechanical structures, properties of nonlinear dynamical systems, and the properties of stochastic webs and percolation clusters.  These analyses have important applications in turbulent diffusion, transport properties in plasma physics, hydrodynamics, and magnetic field generation.  ***",
