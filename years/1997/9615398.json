Recent hypothesis suggest that the passive margin phase  resulted from Neoproterozoic rifting of Laurentia from Antarctica  (\"SWEAT\"  hypothesis).  The succeeding active margin phase  (Ross  orogeny)  was  one  of  several tectonic  events  (\"Pan  African\"  events)  that resulted from plate convergence/transpression  that  was  probably a consequence of the assembly of components of  the  Gondwana  supercontinent.  Although these basement units  provide  one  of  the keys for understanding the break up and assembly  of  these major continental masses, few precise ages are available to  address the following important issues:    (1)  Is  there any pre-rift high-grade cratonal basement  exposed  along  the Transantarctic Mountains, and what is/are its  precise  age?  Is this age compatible with a Laurentia connection?  (2)  What  is the age of potential rift/passive margin  sediments  (Beardmore  Group) along the Queen Maud Mountains sector  of  the  orogen?  (3)  What  is  the relative and absolute timing of magmatism  and  contractional  deformation of supracrustal units in  the  orogen?  Was   deformation  diachronous  and  thus  possibly  related   to  transpressional  tectonics, or did it occur in a  discrete  pulse  that is more compatible with a collision? How does contraction of  the  orogen  fit in with emplacement of voluminous  plutonic  and  volcanic rocks?    The  answers to these questions are central to understanding  the  kinematic evolution of this major orogenic belt and its  role  in  Neoproterozoic-Early  Paleozoic continental  reconstructions  and  plate  kinematics. Hence, this award supports funding for precise  U-Pb dating, using zircon, monazite, baddeleyite, and/or titanite  from  a  variety  of magmatic rocks in the Queen Ma ud  Mountains,  which can address the foregoing problems.    In addition to the issues above, precise dating of volcanics that  are interbedded with carbonates containing probable Middle  Cambrian fauna could potentially provide a calibration point for  the Middle Cambrian, which will fill a gap in the absolute time  scale for the early Paleozoic.",
