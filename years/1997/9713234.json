Dawson    COLLECTIVE ABSORPTION PROCESSES OF NEUTRINOS IN SUPERNOVAE    A program to investigate the influence of collective interactions of  the intense neutrino flux from the core of a supernova with the plasma  of it's surrounding stellar envelope will be carried out. The mechanism  is similar to the Forward Raman Instability that occurs when intense  light interacts with plasma by generating electron plasma waves.  In  the neutrino case, the instability is much weaker due to the weakness  of the neutrino electron interaction.  Recent work at UCLA has shown  that because of the extreme conditions that exist in a supernova, the  forward Raman instability takes place.  In the photon plasma case this  instability increases the interaction with the plasma by many orders of  magnitude.  By analogy, large enhancements of the neutrino plasma  coupling can be expected.  The neutrinos carry away most of the energy  of the supernova (100 times the light output).  Models of supernova  explosions have run into problems explaining how the supernova explodes  if so much energy is carried off by the neutrinos and additional energy  must be expended in dissociating iron and other heavy nuclei.  Explosions can be made to occur if a few percent of the neutrino energy  can be deposited in the stellar envelope.  The forward Raman  instability appear to be strong enough to do this and thus to influence  the dynamics of the supernova.  Techniques for computing the transport  of the neutrinos through the stellar plasma and the resulting energy  transfer will be developed.  This will involve two quasi-linear  equations, one for neutrinos and one for electrons, plus an equation  for the evolution of plasma waves.  The quasi-linear equation for the  neutrinos describe the evolution of the neutrino spectrum due to their  interaction with the plasma waves.  The plasma wave equation computes  the spectrum of plasma waves produced by the neutrinos and includes  damping by electrons and the r esultant flow of energy from neutrinos to  electrons.  The quasi linear equation for the electrons describes the  evolution of the electron distribution function; this is primarily a  heating.  When the electrons become hot enough (~ 500Kev) the Forward  Raman Instability becomes the Forward Stimulated Compton Instability  because the waves become heavily Landau damped.  It is expected that  the Forward Stimulated Compton Instability will be much weaker and to  effectively turn off.  Computer software codes to solve these coupled  equations will be written and then used to explore the neutrino energy  deposited in the electrons and the electron temperatures reached as a  function of position in the star.  The effects of the interaction on  the neutrino energy distribution will be calculated to explore possible  signatures of the process that might be detectable.",
