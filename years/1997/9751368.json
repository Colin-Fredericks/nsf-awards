 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the Electrical Engineering (EE) Department establishes an undergraduate fiber-optics communications and photonics laboratory.  This new facility is unique in the region.  The communications area of the EE curriculum is enhanced by this project.  A total of 11 experiments are taught in a new one-credit laboratory course, EE 472, concurrent with the Fiber Optic Communications course, EE 471.  The laboratory is also used for extra individual projects assigned under Special Topics, EE 493, or under Senior Design Projects, EE 464/465.    The objectives of this laboratory are to (1) optimize students' learning by using a practical framework with hands-on, integrated, and inquiry experiences to reinforce classroom theoretical concepts of basic photonics and optical fibers; (2) provide students with practical skills needed for handling and testing fiber optic systems; and (3) stimulate students' curiosity and eagerness to pursue research and independent study in the area of fiber-optic communications, photonics, and sensing.    Interdepartmental ties also enable the facility to be used by Engineering Physics and Electronics Engineering Technology students.  This facility also provides a resource that may have long-term and far-reaching effects through outreach programs and workshops targeting precollege students, school teachers, and the engineering community in the vicinity.   A laboratory manual, including a revised set of experiments and necessary equipment, can be published and made available to interested faculty in other institutions.  A comprehensive assessment for the project will be administered by a panel consisting of the Office of Academic Evaluation and Assessment at the university, an external evaluator, and the faculty participating in the project.  *",
