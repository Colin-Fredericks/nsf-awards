 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Clifford P. Kubiak, Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division for an investigation of charge transfer in   organometallic systems that occur on the vibrational time scale and that   can be interpreted within the framework of the Marcus-Hush theories of   electron transfer. Intervalence charge transfer occurs near the   vibrational time scale in some triruthenium clusters, as evidenced by   coalescence of carbonyl infrared stretching bands, and differences in the   electron exchange rates in these complexes reflect differences in the   electronic coupling within the complexes. In this project the factors   that control this coupling will be delineated. A self consistent physical   description of the phenomenon will be developed through detailed   spectroscopic studies of the dynamical IR averaging in the triruthenium   complexes. The picture then will be generalized by investigations of   three additional, strongly coupled organometallic charge transfer   complexes: (i) laterally interconnected dimers of trinuclear clear nickel   clusters; (ii) oligomeric metal clusters with strong metal-metal   interactions; and (iii) new tetra(diphenylphosphino) quinodimethane   bridged dinuclear metal complexes. Many of these complexes have   appropriate redox potentials and catalytic properties for the   electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, and this aspect of their   chemistry will be developed.   The transfer of electrons between reactants and products is a critical   step in many chemical reactions. In these processes the maximum rate of   electron transfer is defined by the rate of vibrations within and solvent   motions about the reactant and product molecules. This study addresses   electron transfer processes that take place at the same speed as   molecular vibrations and will determine the factors that control the   electron transfer rate. The results will permit both a better basic   understanding of electron transfer and provide a basis to design systems   with tuned electron transfer properties. The application of the basic   knowledge gained in the project will be demonstrated by devising systems   that are capable of chemically activating carbon dioxide.",
