 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704912  Hager    This proposal concerns the numerical analysis of infinite dimensional   variational problems such as variational inequalities involving ordinary   differential equations, differential inclusions, and optimal control problems.   Using recent stability results, errors estimates will be derived for discrete   approximations of state constrained optimal control problems.  For   linear/quadratic problems with control and state constraints, efficient   algorithms will be developed for computing a solution.  In addition, the   stability theory will be applied to generate both a priori and a posteriori   estimates for the errors in the computed solutions.  For differential   inclusions, discretizations will be developed with sufficient generality to   encompass problems with discontinuous right sides and state constraints.    The algorithms and theory that will be developed in this proposal are   applicable to a variety of problems in industry such as those associated with   the optimal performance of robots, flight control in aerospace, the design of   thin films with desired properties, or the optimal engineering of chemical   processes. When any of these problems is solved on a computer, the   continuous process is decomposed into tiny time steps.  This proposal   studies the errors that are caused when this continuous process is discretized   in this way.",
