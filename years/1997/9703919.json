 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a new instrument for evaluation of geologic formations at the drill bit in oil and gas drilling operations.  Radioactive measurement while-drilling (MWD) instruments are currently in use for measuring formation porosity and density.  However, these have limited capabilities and use active radioactive elements.  This research will develop an electrical neutron/x-ray (N/X) instrument, which may replace existing radioactive tools.  The new instrument is novel in offering: (1) improved measurement capabilities; (2) lower life-cycle costs; and (3) greatly reduced safety and environmental risks.  Phase II will develop a laboratory prototype MWD N/X instrument integrated into a 6.75 inch diameter drill collar.  Phase II will conduct:  (1) preliminary instrument design; (2) component development; (3) N/X instrument final design, construction, and testing (including measurement of neutron and x-ray outputs, response to simulated formations, testing at high temperatures, and shock and vibration tests); and (4) experimental evaluation in calibration boreholes at facilities of Sperry-Sun Drilling Services in Houston, TX.  Potential commercial application of the instrument is expected in low-risk, low-cost MWD operations during oil and gas borehole drilling.",
