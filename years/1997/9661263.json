 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  ABSTRACT      9661263  Debs     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will complete the research required to introduce some basic new functionality to the EPRI Operator Training Simulator (OTS) to meet the needs of deregulated (restructured) electric utilities. A key element here is to upgrade the EPRI-OTS to become an effective tool for training the ISO (Independent System Operators) dispatchers for system operation. ISO engineers and management staff will be able to use the enhanced product for operation planning and other studies. The main objective of this work will be to integrate new models and programs into the EPRI-OTS consisting of: (1) a novel Multi-Area Optimal Power Flow; (2) simultaneous transfer capability coordination program; and (3) measurement and evaluation of ancillary services program. Other objectives relate to testing and evaluation of these programs and the preparation of a Phase II plan. The result of the Phase I research will be a demonstrable product which will clearly differentiate itself in the arena of Operator Training Simulators for the deregulated electric utility.   It is expected that the OTS developed during this research will be implemented at most major electric utilities--including an estimated 100+ United States and 50+ international utilities who need the results of the proposed research and development. ***",
