 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724544  Griffin  Sacred Heart University is an independent, liberal arts  institution with 3500 undergraduate and 1500 graduate  students.  The school does NOT offer any Ph.D. programs.    The proposal requests $94,500 to purchase equipment that  will be used to investigate the biology of hypothalamic  neurons and their response to chemical and environmental  pressures.  Among the equipment required are computers,  signal amplifiers, oscilloscopes, data recorders,  microtomes, etc.    Until recently the University has provided little  opportunity for undergraduate research.  There is a current  high level commitment to improve these opportunities as  illustrated by the construction and renovation of new  biology and chemistry laboratories, new science faculty, and  by the appreciable matching funds to this proposal.  One  goal of this proposal is to improve the recruiting and  retention of talented undergraduates, and to improve the  quality of the undergraduate training.  ***",
