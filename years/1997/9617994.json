 "awd_abstract_narration": "The key impediment to the widespread use of 3D layered fabrication like Shape  Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)  processes is not the limitations of the processes themselves, but the ability of  engineers to explore and master the expanded design space they enable.  A design  interface comprising an exchange format and an accompanying suite of services is  proposed for these processes.  This interface is based on formal representations  of process-related constraints expressed in terms of three-dimensional design  features with associated rules to ensure manufacturability.  The interface  specification will be build in collaboration with process developers at Stanford,  Carnegie Mellon University and other institutions, and will build upon emerging  standards for exchanging product specifications and representing manufacturing  processes.  In addition, the supporting communication infrastructure for  exchanging design features, constraints, process capabilities and manufacturing  analyses over the Internet will be developed.    A series of design exercises are also proposed.  The exercises will explore the  ability of designers to construct libraries of re-usable elements to be scaled  and miniaturized to take advantage of MEMS technology, and will explore the  feasibility of integrating designs and processes from different institutions to  create miniature electromechanical systems.",
