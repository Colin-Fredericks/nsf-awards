The seven institutions bring expertise in four major areas:  1) mixed signal design and test, 2) limits of flipchip packaging, 3) radio frequency and optoelectronics, and 4) thermal management.  The seven institutions are the Technical University of Berlin, University of Oregon, University of Illinois, Tufts University, University of Puerto Rico, University of Minnesota, and Lehigh University.  The addition of these partner institutions bring expertise and equipment and facilities which are unique and complement those of the existing center.  The Technical University of Berlin opens a door to Europe.  The impact on  the educational experience of students involved with the ERC likewise enhances the ability of the center to make a lasting contribution to electronic packaging worldwide.  The collaboration with the University of Puerto Rico will have a positive impact on the education of minority engineering graduates.",
