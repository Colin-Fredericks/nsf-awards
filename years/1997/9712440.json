 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Drs. Bertram Malle and John Orbell will develop a wireless laboratory for the study of interpersonal cognition at the Hill Center, University of Oregon. The instrumentation provided through this award will be used to permit wireless communication among subjects and to record and monitor the subjects' behavior. The communication system will be assembled from commercially available material as off-the-shelf systems are considerably more expensive and limited in range. An audio-visual system will also be assembled and installed from commercial sources and includes four cameras, two computer-controlled video recorders and three 20 inch color monitors. The proposed facility will be used by 11 researchers from the psychology, economics, political science, sociology and anthropology  departments and the individual research projects address a wide group of topics from social psychology (intentionality and theory of mind, empathy and perspective-taking, personality, stereotyping) and decision and game theory (prisoner's dilemma task, collective decision making in juries, emergence of structure in groups.)  The equipment will primarily be used in a suite of rooms with built-in audio and video capabilities, and with portable information devices to provide two-way communication with the experimental subjects. The portable information devices serve both for the subjects to enter responses or judgments during the experimental sessions, and for the experimenters to provide feedback and information to the subjects. The equipment will provide a significant advance over the traditional pen and paper methods more typical of social psychology and hopefully will provide a prototype for other laboratories.",
