 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to enhance training in the fields of biology and chemistry related to the areas of biotechnology. The focus of the project is to establish an interdepartmental degree in biotechnology as a joint effort of the biology and chemistry departments. This degree will be designed as a laboratory intensive, research rich experience. The degree will culminate in all students being members of a research team performing a project under the supervision of a faculty member. Students will be encouraged to submit successful research projects to be presented at local and regional scientific meetings. This degree will prepare students to seek employment in research positions related to the growing agriculture based molecular genetics and pharmaceutical industries in this region of the country as well as providing training for students interested in application to graduate school. The introductory courses in the core of this new biotechnology degree will be comprised of courses currently offered as part of both the biology and chemistry majors at Moorhead State University. The majority of these courses have been converted to an investigative laboratory format to enhance student involvement and enthusiasm for science. The equipment purchased will allow additional exercises to be added to the laboratory portion of several of these large enrollment introductory courses in order to give students the background and experience required for upper division courses in biotechnology. The benefit of using courses which are already part of the biology and chemistry majors to initiate this new degree is that all students taking courses in the two departments will be exposed to new techniques and have the opportunity to learn more about molecular and cellular biology and biochemistry research.",
