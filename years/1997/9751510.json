 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of Biochemistry has changed significantly in the past 20 years.  Lectures are easily updated to reflect these technological improvements and applications, but laboratory exercises often lack equivalent modernization.  Because laboratories are needed to reinforce lecture concepts, to teach technical and analytical skills, and to provide active and cooperative learning, they must be improved.    This project introduces new, relevant experimental problems for biochemistry courses servicing both science majors and nonmajors.  In the elementary nonmajors course, two new experiments are introduced which focus on the analysis of LDH isoenzymes and LDH cDNAs in normal and disease states.  These experiments require a PCR system for DNA amplification, a simple fluorometer for DNA quantitation, and electrophoresis equipment for protein electrophoresis and DNA SSCP analysis.  This project provides these instruments to perform PCR, SSCP analysis, and isoelectric focusing in a laboratory project for science majors focused on the analysis of apolipoprotein E variants.  Through their participation in the project design, science majors learn to use literature and protein and DNA structure databases.  The equipment selected allows further modification in project designs that incorporate modern electrophoresis techniques and the use of computer-accessed information.",
