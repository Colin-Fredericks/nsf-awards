 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been a long-standing goal of both the Artificial  Intelligence and the Robotics communities to develop  physical artifacts that can act intelligently .  From the  Robotics side, the priority has been on the development of  mechanical agents that would exhibit navigation,  manipulation, perception, and action skills, along with the  ability to work cooperatively.  The results on low-level  control, including sensor uncertainty, limited reasoning  about geometric and physical properties, and skills like  object avoidance have proved interesting and useful, but  most autonomous robotic agents still lack the ability to  perform higher level intelligent operations either alone or  in concert.  This is partly because of their need to proceed  with reasonable expedience, while the known methods are  demonstrably very complex, and therefore slow.  It is hoped  that recent results in AI planning, learning, reasoning, and  cooperation among agents will help in bridging the gap  between high-level reasoning and low-level physical  execution.  The purpose of this workshop is to examine the  available results and research agenda in this `bridging`  area, while also establishing international links between  American and Brazilian researchers working in the same areas  and between NSF and its Brazilian counterpart organization  CNPq, which will provide support for the Brazilian  participants.",
