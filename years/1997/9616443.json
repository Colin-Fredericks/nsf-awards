 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616443  Crane   The paleobotanical collections of the field Museum are an important national and international resource for systematic plant biology.  In the past five years these collections have grown by over 7800 specimens (10%), and currently total approximately 77,800 specimens.  This collection is severely overcrowded in its current quarters, and many specimens cannot currently be accommodated within the collection space.  The Field Museum has recently constructed new collections space at a cost of $4.25 million; of this space 1,929 square feet (worth $240,000) have been dedicated to the paleobotanical collection.  The Field Museum is also providing graduate student and summer intern stipends to match the graduate student stipends and equipment funded by NSF.  The total cost of the project is $550,000, of which the Field Museum has or will carry 48%, in partnership with the NSF.  Once the project is complete, the paleobotanical collections will be moved into new compactorized storage near the neontological plant collections, have no backlog (as that will be integrated into the collections as part of the move), and a detailed description of the entire collection will be available on the World Wide Web.  This project will also benefit the Field Museum's other fossil collections, as they will be moved into space vacated by the paleobotanical specimens, thus alleviating overcrowding in vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology.",
