 "awd_abstract_narration": "OPP 9614928  Hammer    Abstract  This award supports continued research on Triassic and Jurassic  fossil vertebrates from the Transantarctic Mountains.  During the  1995/96 austral summer, a field team collected 120 new specimens  of Triassic vertebrates from sites near the Shackleton Glacier.  In previous seasons Triassic to Jurassic age vertebrates were  recovered from localities near the Beardmore Glacier.  This award  supports the continued preparation and study of these  collections, particularly the material collected recently.  The  new fossils are all from the Early Triassic age lower Fremouw  Formation and they represent at least 12-16 different taxa,  several of which appear to be new.  Included are 15-20 partial to  complete skeletons and numerous additional skulls, jaws, and  other diagnostic pieces of numerous herbivorous and carnivorous  synapsids, small diapsids, procolophonid anapsids and  temnospondyl amphibians.  Preparation of most of the specimens is  required before more precise identifications can be made.  This  extensive amount of material will be used to determine whether  the greater diversity in assemblages found in the Shackleton  Glacier area compared to similar age collections made near the  Beardmore Glacier is due to climate or facies.  The Shackleton  localities are upland from the Beardmore vertebrate sites and the  climatic differences may have effected the relative diversity of  the faunas.  An interpretation of the taphonomic/depositional  settings for each locality will also be made.  Finally, studies  on the evolutionary significance of the high latitude vertebrate  faunas from the Mesozoic (Early Triassic, early Middle Triassic  and Early Jurassic) will continue.  Because vertebrates of  several different ages spanning the Triassic to Jurassic are now  known from Antarctica, they provide a unique opportunity to study  the evolution of high latitude faunas.  These faunas also  contribute to our understanding of high latitude climates during  this time.",
