 "awd_abstract_narration": "Green  9705101  The overall goal of this study is the development of a  microscopic understanding of the effects of confinement and  of surfaces and interfaces on the dynamics and phase  stability of polymeric thin film mixtures.  The strategy is  to use information about the interface as a probe to  understand the phase stability and dynamics.  A critical  aspect of this strategy is focused at independently \"tuning\"  the molecular parameters of the substrate and of the  polymers in mrder to have control over the molecular  interactions.  This will involve novel synthesis of new  norborene-like polymers with varying functionalities,  synthesis of novel inorganic tellurium dioxide-based glasses  whose reactivity can be tailored and surface treatments of a  silicon substrate.  The proposed study is divided into two  parts, the first of which involves using a combination of  variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) and forward  recoil spectrometry (FRES) to study the development of the  interfacial thickness between homopolymer bilayers of  varying thickness, L.  Information learned from the  equilibrium  interfacial thickness from this aspect of the  study will give insight into the effect of copolymers  (random and diblock) on the phase stability of the mixtures.  The second phase of this proposal involves a related study  of the formation of wetting layers and coexistence phases in  mixtures of these polymers in contact with the substrates of  varying characteristics in order to gain insight into the  role of the \"interfacial\" fields on the formation and growth  of the wetting layer in homopolymer mixtures.  An additional  aspect of this work is to use information about the wetting  layer to develop new insights into the effect of copolymers  on the phase stability of the thin film mixtures.  %%%  Interest in this area is motivated by technological need  since thin film polymers serve \"active\" and \"passive\" roles  in many technologies.  For example, they serve \"active\"  roles in microsen sors, large area light emitting displays  and selective membrane applications.  \"Passive\" applications  include use as protective coatings and lubricants for  magnetic storage media, biocompatibility and use as thin  film adhesives.  Because information about bulk properties  provides limited guidance, it is critical to develop a  fundamental understanding of polymeric properties under  these conditions.  ***",
