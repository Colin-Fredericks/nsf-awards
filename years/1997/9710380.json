 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Maurice Brookhart, Department of Chemistry, University of North   Carolina - Chapel Hill, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, with a contribution for   instrumentation from the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the   Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, for mechanistic and   design studies of late transition metal olefin polymerization catalysts.   The major thrust of the project will be the study of Ni(II) and Pd(II)   complexes of bulky alpha-diimines, which have, for example, the ability   to control polymer chain branching through ligand variation. Rigorous   mechanistic studies of the polymerization reactions will be carried out   in order to gain understanding of the factors that control the behavior   of the catalysts and that determine the properties of the resultant   polymer. A variety of alpha-diimine based catalysts, with a variety of   ligand architectures, will be synthesized with the objective of probing   the effect of ligand structure on polymer microstructure and mechanisms   of monomer enchainment. These catalysts will be evaluated for the   polymerization and copolymerization of new monomers. Using insights from   these studies new neutral Ni(II) and Pd(II) catalyst systems will be   prepared containing bulky bidentate anionic ligands. These systems should   exhibit great functional group tolerance and be especially good catalysts   for the copolymerization of ethylene and polar olefins.  Intensive research has been directed toward understanding fundamental   aspects of metal-catalyzed olefin polymerization and the results of these   studies have been used to develop new catalysts. These have been   enormously important contributions since over thirty billion pounds of   polyolefin are produced in the United States each year. Most of the   commercial olefin polymerization catalysts are based on early transition   or lanthanide metals. In this project a series of highly versatile late   transition metal catalysts will be investigated. These will provide   fundamental information on how catalysts join olefins to one another   during the polymerization process as well as new catalyst systems with   potential industrial applications.",
