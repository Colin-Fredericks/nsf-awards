 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, `Development of a Multichannel Time-Resolved Fluorometer  for  Macro  and Microstudies', is to update and improve the ability of the Time-  Resolved   Fluorescence  Facility  at  Mount  Sinai  to  provide  pertinent  information  about the structure and dynamics of biological  macromolecules  and their complexes. The present instrumentation in the Facility was funded  in  part by a 1986 NSF award (DMB-8516318) entitled `A Multi-User Laser for  Time-Resolved Fluorescenc'. The new proposal has three main objectives:         replacement of the outdated, limited-wavelength range pulsed laser  system with a state-of-the-art pulsed        laser system capable of providing the UV and visible excitation  wavelengths required by numerous        research programs         construct and implement a new sample chamber with three simultaneous  detection channels to enhance         the collection and the precision of time-resolved fluorescence  intensity and anisotropy data sets         combine time-resolved fluorescence with microscopy to permit studies  on 'micro' samples    A  three year program is outlined, with most of the acquisition/development  of the major components to  occur in the first year. Implementation, testing, and commissioning will be  performed in the following two years.",
