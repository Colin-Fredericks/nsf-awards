 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618935  Bronzino  This research is designed to test the hypothesis that there are  significant changes, during early postnatal development, in  synaptic plasticity in a specific neuronal circuit, the perforant  path/dentate granule synapse, in the hippocampal formation, a  structure intimately involved in learning and memory.  Recently,  it has been shown that hippocampal circuit responses to afferent  input vary depending upon the frequency and pattern of the input.  Specifically, the response to certain patterns of hippocampal  afferent inputs may result in either enhancement (long-term  potentiation), or a diminishment (long-term depression) of the  hippocampal synaptic response.  The major goal of this research  is to apply recently developed surgical and recording techniques  to quantify the development of frequency-dependent responses of  the perforant path/dentate granule cell synapse in preweaning,  freely moving male and female rats.  In this research, evoked  field potential analyses will be used to evaluate changes in both  synaptic activation and cellular discharge.  This work will  attempt to quantify changes in frequency-dependent synaptic  function during an early period of development.  This research  could provide information on the functional development of a  neural network known to be involved in cognitive processes  including spatial learning, memory and mapping.  ***",
