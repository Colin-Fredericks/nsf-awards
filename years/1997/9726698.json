 "awd_abstract_narration": "Viruses have shells made of repeated protein subunits surrounding  their genetic information. Many viruses, including polio, herpes,  and influenza, have icosahedraloshaped shells. It is not  understood how these shells self-assemble from hundreds of similar  protein subunits. A resolution to this question is important  because it allows us to better understand biological phenomena in  general and provides a paradigm for nano- and meso-scale self-  assembling systems which will become increasingly important in  materials and manufacturing. It might also eventually result in  mechanisms for interrupting shell formation and interfering with  the infection process.    Drs. Berger (MIT) and Prevelige (Univ. of Alabama at Birmingham)  are using cutting edge high performance computing and  biotechnology to design a realistic computer \"toolkit\" that will  allow biologists to study virus shell assembly on a computer  screen more easily and less expensively than comparable laboratory  work. The synergy of computational and biochemical approaches  promises rapid advances in our understanding of virus assembly and  self-assembling systems in general. This work is supported by the  Computational Biology Activity (BIO), the Computational  Mathematics Program (MPS), and the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities (MPS).",
