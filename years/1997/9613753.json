The methods to be employed consist of thermodynamic calculations and computer experiments carried out with the aid of equations of state using compositional and thermodynamic data reported in the literature to characterize the causes and consequences of microbial activity in diagenetic processes.  The significance of the proposed research to the advancement of knowledge is to improve our understanding of the effect of hydrocarbons and mineralogic substrates on microbial metabolism and the biogeochemical role of thermophilic microbes in catalyzing irreversible reactions among minerals and organic and inorganic aqueous species and biomolecules in diagenetic processes.   It has become increasingly apparent in recent years that understanding the biogeochemistry of the organic-inorganic interface and the role of thermophilic microbes in catalyzing diagenetic reactions in sedimentary basins is critical to accurate description and interpretation of phase relations in these basins.  A myriad of reversible and irreversible reactions occur among biomolecules and other organic aqueous species, minerals and inorganic aqueous species, and hydrocarbon solids, liquids, and gases in diagenetic processes, all of which are in prin ciple amenable to thermodynamic analysis.  This approach can be used to assess reaction pathways and the energy, carbon, and nutrient sources used by thermophiles in mediating diagenetic reactions.  It can also be used to quantify the relative stabilities of extracellular enzymes and other biomolecules required to support life at high temperatures.  Experimental data reported in the literature indicate that biomolecules become increasingly sensitive to their chemical environment with increasing temperature.  However, if the chemical potentials of H2 (and therefore O2), H2O, CO2, NH3, and H2S are favorable, biomolecules may persist at high temperatures for periods of time well in excess of those required for regeneration of the molecules by thermophilic microbes.  Calculation of the relative stabilities of biomolecules in the interstitial fluids of sedimentary basins as a function of the fugacities of these gases can be carried out with the aid of group additivity equations of state developed in this laboratory with prior NSF support.  Combining these equations with thermodynamic data and equations of state parameters permits investigation of the chemical and thermodynamic consequences of reactions among biomolecules and a wide variety of minerals, gases, hydrocarbon liquids, and both organic and inorganic aqueous species at elevated temperatures and pressures.  These include irreversible reactions which provide an energy source for microbial metabolism, as well as reversible reactions representing local and partial metastable or stable equilibrium states such as those described by Shock (1987, 1988, 1989, 1990a), Helgeson et al.  (1993, 1995), Helgeson and Amend (1994), Seewald (1994, 1996), and Schulte and Shock (1996).  The purpose of this proposal is to request long-range support for continuation of this research in order to investigate and quantify thermodynamic constraints on the biogeochemical role of microbes in diagenetic processes.",
