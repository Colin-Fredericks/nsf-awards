 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706388     DiBenedetto    The main issues of this investigation concern the local   and global structure of solutions of some classes of    degenerate and/or singular evolution equations, including   those (Buckley--Leverett system) bearing  lower order terms   with critical (Hadamard) growth conditions.  Special issues include   the local regularity of the solutions, intrinsic   Harnack estimates, the boundary behavior, and Quasi--Minima   in the Calculus of Variations. For evolution equations   bearing logarithmic singularities the solvability of   the Cauchy problem will be studied. In space-dimensions   higher than two, this hinges upon  a preliminary description   of the asymptotic behavior permitted by the possible solutions,   as well as the solvability of the corresponding elliptic   equation. This is a severely ill-posed problem, as, for   example, compactly supported data do not generate a solution.   Solvability depends on the possibility of generating   uniform lower bounds for approximating solutions at one   single point. Then the global Harnack estimate we have developed   would yield a lower bound in the whole space. The main difficulty   in this process is that there is not a natural   topology by which to approximate the data.      The flow of two immiscible fluids in a porous medium   (Buckley--Leverett model)  is modeled by evolutions equations   bearing singular terms. One asks whether, despite the jump in   internal energy, the saturation remains continuous. This would   amount to say that the interface of contact of the two fluids   occurs in such a way that the mass is locally conserved.   A class of singular equations arises in the slow evolution   of thin colloidal films spread over a flat surface. The singularities   are logarithmic and are due to the van der Waals forces.   As the film spreads, it may undergo a spontaneous rupture. Since   the film is applied as a coating to protect metal surfaces, one is   interested in the evolution of such a process and possibly    in some sort of understanding of the phenomenon of rupture.  The solvability of these equations, their structure, and possibly   an understanding of the rupture phenomenon will be investigated.",
