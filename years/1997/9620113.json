 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Description. Intragroup processes and intergroup perceptions have long been central concerns of social scientists and society in general. Researchers interested in intragroup processes have examined the process by which new members are socialized into a group. There has also been considerable research examining intergroup perceptions. Indeed, the development, representation, and perceptions of stereotypes about ingroups versus outgroups have been primary foci of social psychologists for many years.  The proposed research is based on an integration of the literature from these two areas. The proposed research examines the effects of two features of intragroup socialization on the stereotypes that new members develop about ingroups and outgroups: new member uncertainty about being accepted by the group and the use of abstraction- versus instance-based information. These features of the socialization process will be experimentally manipulated and their effects on new members' perceptions of ingroups and outgroups assessed. The outcome of this work will be a more complete understanding of stereotype change and development and, in particular, the influence of group socialization on perceptions of ingroups and outgroups. This work may ultimately help identify ways in which groups can promote more positive and constructive intergroup perceptions.  &&&  Project Justification. Intragroup processes and intergroup perceptions have long been central concerns of social scientists and society in general. In many groups, individuals undergo an induction process during which they are socialized by the group before they can become full-fledged group members. Many occupational groups, for example, have a probationary period during which new members gain experience with and information about their own group and relevant outgroups through on-the-job training, formal training sessions, and informal interactions with other group members. Thus, perceptions of ingroups and outgroups are likely to undergo a great deal of change during this time.  The proposed research examines the effects of two features of the induction process on the stereotypes that new members develop about their ingroups and outgroups. The outcome of this work will be a more complete understanding of stereotype change and development and, in particular, how induction into a group affects the perceptions of ingroups and outgroups that new group members develop. This work may ultimately help identify ways in which groups can promote more positive and constructive intergroup perceptions.",
