 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616833  TRUESWELL    This research project will examine the rapid grammatical  decisions that people make during reading, listening and  speaking.  The comprehension of a sentence requires readers and  listeners to make immediate decisions about how incoming words  combine with other words and phrases, in order to develop an  interpretation of \"who is doing what to whom\" in a sentence.  In  this way, people are able to maintain, in an incremental fashion,  an interpretation of the events and actions described in each  sentence.  This research will focus on the processing of  temporary syntactic ambiguities, which occur when a comprehender  must choose between two possible grammatical alternatives of an  ambiguous word or phrase.  Examining this rapid decision process  can help uncover how the language processing system is organized  to consult linguistic and non-linguistic information.  One line  of research will examine how readers and listeners process  syntactically ambiguous phrases.  The experiments will test the  hypothesis that a comprehender's initial guess about the intended  interpretation of a phrase is determined automatically by  consulting prior experiences concerning how often individual  words have appeared in different syntactic contexts.  The  experiments will focus on the hypothesis that recognizing a word  includes the rapid retrieval not only of the meaning of the word  but also of probabilistic information concerning how often the  word has appeared in different types of phrases.  This research  will use a variety of different experimental techniques which are  aimed at uncovering the time-course of language processing,  including the monitoring of eye fixations during reading and the  measurement of the response time to words during listening.  A  second line of experiments will examine whether speakers are  sensitive to syntactically ambiguous phrases in their own speech,  and whether this impacts the way in which they produce sentences.   In particular, the experiments  will examine whether speakers  provide helpful phrasing (prosodic) cues when there is an  increased chance that the listener may incorrectly interpret an  ambiguous phrase.  These two lines of  research may help the  development of computational systems that interact with humans  via language.  In addition, furthering the understanding of how  normal adults process language may improve the treatment and  education of those individuals with language impairments.    ***",
