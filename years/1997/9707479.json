 "awd_abstract_narration": "Critical to an understanding of the maternal regulation of vertebrate embryogenesis is an analysis of the mechanisms used to translationally activate stored maternal mRNAs. Analysis of these mechanisms can expose additional maternal regulators, for the molecules involved in triggering the translation of stored maternal mRNAs by definition play central roles in regulatory cascades. One such mechanism was discovered in mouse and frog that involves the cytoplasmic polyadenylation of specific maternal mRNAs. While initially observed in the oocytes and early embryos of several vertebrate species, it is now clear that cytoplasmic polyadenylation is also required for the temporal activation of the bicoid, Toll, and torso mRNAs in Drosophila embryos. The analysis of cytoplasmic polyadenylation in Drosophila, a genetically tractable system, has led to the discovery of mutants in which this mechanism is impaired, While these studies should lead to the identification of additional molecules that play a role in the cytoplasmic polyadenylation pathway, molecules that are unique to vertebrate embryogenesis will not be identified.    In this proposal, the PI outlines experiments directed toward identifying novel maternal regulators in vertebrate embryogenesis, using the zebrafish system. Using a PCR-based assay that was originally designed to follow cytoplasmic polyadenylation in mouse and Drosophila, changes in the polyadenylation status of a series of known maternal mRNAs in zebrafish will be followed.  The results of this screen will set the stage for future research aimed at my long-term goal of identifying novel maternal regulatory factors in zebrafish.",
