 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Snapper's research focuses on synthetic and mechanistic studies   of metal catalyzed alkylidene metathesis reactions.  The scope of the   ring-opening cross metathesis of strained cycloalkenes will be examined,   and both improvement of the stereoselectivity of this process and   development of enantioselective cross metathesis reactions will be   explored.  Asymmetric syntheses using substrate control, by means of   chiral tetraenes, and reagent control, through use of chiral Ru   complexes, will be examined.  A conceptually related photo/thermal   (2+2)/retro(2+2) cyclization pathway will also be investigated.    Professor Snapper will develop an undergraduate research course, assemble   outreach programs that will provide chemistry demonstrations and   laboratory equipment to local schools, and initiate a program designed to   improve the teaching, speaking, writing, and organizational skills of   graduate students.  With this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the   research and educational activities of Professor Marc L. Snapper of the   Department of Chemistry at Boston College.  Professor Snapper's research   is directed toward the use of a metal catalyzed reaction of compounds   containing carbon-carbon double bonds, the so-called olefin metathesis   reaction, to effect the formation of various types of organic products.    By variation of the specific structures used in this reaction, Professor   Snapper is able to prepare compounds which may serve as convenient   starting points for the synthesis of more complex molecules of relevance   to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  Professor Snapper's   educational activities involve enhancing the research experiences of   undergraduates, facilitating the interest of high school students in   chemistry through outreach programs, and improving the teaching and   communication skills of graduate students.",
