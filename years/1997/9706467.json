 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706467  Stute     One of the key questions in paleoclimate research is the degree of symmetry and the mechanisms of climate change on both hemispheres.  We plan to address this issue by improving the continental climate record for the last glacial period in South America.  We will primarily use the concentrations of atmospheric noble gases dissolved in 14C dated groundwater which is used as archive of climate change.   We request funds for collection and evaluation of geochemical data (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, 14C, 13C, D, 18O, 34S, 3H and major dissolved ions) from two groundwater flow systems in South America, the Botucatu aquifer in Brazil, and the Bahia Blanca aquifer in Argentina.  Noble gas paleotemperature records from these aquifers will provide quantitative reconstruction of paleotemperatures for South America covering the past 35,000 years.  These two records will complete a glacial paleotemperature north-south transect along the Americas based on 'noble gas temperatures' archived in groundwater flow systems.  The transect will (1) allow us to address the interhemipheric symmetry of long-term climate change, (2) provide a firmer footing for presently used paleoclimatic proxies, and (3) help us to better understand the coupling of climate change between the northern and southern hemispheres.  This work contributes directly to the goals of IGBP through PEP I, a subprogram of PAGES.  Additionally, we request funds for studies of some new methodological aspects of noble gas thermometry which were documented in the framework of our previous paleoclimate studies.",
