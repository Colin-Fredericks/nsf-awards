The core of the innovative technology is a Central Processing Unit (CPU) called a Program Interface Chip (PIC).  A PIC differs from general purpose computer processors in that it is low cost and has a smaller number of functions.  The Phase I feasibility activity will consist of the development and testing a scientific calculator for blind and visually impaired students.  VEST products have the potential of assisting thousands of visually impaired students and business professionals through the world enabling them to have low cost access to technology that increases their independence, productivity, and qualifty of life.  Potential products include a large print and talking scientific calculator, large print and talking restaurant menus, large print and talking pocket organizer, and many more.  These products will be converted to speak different foreign languages.  ***",
