This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled \"Genetic basis  of floral traits associated with mating system divergence.\"  Knowledge of the genetic basis of adaptation is central to  understanding evolutionary processes.  Floral traits  associated with mating systems are prominent adaptations of  higher plants.  DNA marker-based genome mapping techniques  are being used to investigate the number and magnitude of  loci controlling floral traits distinguishing 2 species of  Linanthus that have diverged in mating systems.",
