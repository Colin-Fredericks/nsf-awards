 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9604729  Brandt     Calcium plays an integral role in regulating cellular  function.  It exerts  its effects in the cell through interactions with a variety  of specialized  proteins.  One of these proteins is the plasma membrane (PM)  calcium pump.  PM calcium pumps remove calcium from the cell, while  consuming ATP to drive  the reaction.  It has recently been found that genetic  manipulation to block  production of one type of PM calcium pumps in a neuronal  cell line prevented  this cell from developing into a mature nerve cell when  treated with nerve  growth factor.  This observation suggested that PM calcium  pumps may be  important in nerve cell development and regeneration.  Further, it was found  that a class of steroids known as glucocorticoids, which  have been known to  prevent the type of neurons used in these studies from  developing into  mature nerve cells, had a greatly enhanced effect when PM  calcium pump  production was blocked.  From these two observations it was  hypothesized  that PM calcium pumps might be involved in controlling  calcium levels in the  cell responsible for determining how effective  glucocorticoids are in  preventing neuronal development.  The studies to be  undertaken as part of  this research project will first examine changes in internal  calcium levels  that might be affecting the efficiency of glucocorticoid  action by  interacting with another calcium-regulated protein called  calreticulin.  If  changes in internal calcium levels are found, then the  underlying alteration  in biochemical properties will be determined by studying  possible changes in  proteins that regulate calcium levels in the cell, among  these proteins will  be the PM calcium pumps.  The ultimate goal of this research  program will be  to better understand the mechanisms of calcium regulation  that affect nerve  cell development and regeneration.",
