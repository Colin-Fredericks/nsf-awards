 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723160  Rutowski  In the course of their lives, animals are often faced with  conflicting demands on their behavior and how these  conflicts are resolved within an individual's life and over  evolutionary time are important questions in the study of  behavior.  For example, when active, many  insects use a  variety of behavioral mechanisms to regulate their body  temperature within a preferred range.  However,  thermoregulatory adjustments occur while animals are engaged  in other activities, such as searching for mates.  The  interaction between these adjustments and the simultaneous  performance of other activities are not well understood.  This  study addresses how thermoregulatory behavior patterns  interact with visual mate-location efforts in a butterfly of  the Sonoran desert.  Males in this species of butterfly  occupy and defend perching sites in the morning where they  perch and wait for females to appear.  During the morning  perch preferences change as temperatures rise to maintain  body temperature in their preferred range.  When cool, males  perch on the ground; however, as the morning progresses and  temperature rises, males switch to cooler perches about 1 m  off the ground.  This study examines the impact of this  thermally-driven change in perch preference on males'  abilities to detect passing females and competing males. If  perch preference leads to changes in how the butterfly's  visual system is positioned in space relative to the flight  paths of conspecifics, this may effect the likelihood that  passing conspecifics will be detected.  To address this  question, several research approaches will be taken.  Information will be gathered on the flight paths of females  and intruding males, variation in visual acuity across the  field of vision, and changes in male body position and  orientation. Studies of visual system acuity involve a  complex pseudopupil analysis procedure, which will be done  in collaboration with a researcher at the University of Lund  in Sweden, one of  few places in the world where such  analysis can be done. Another experimental approach will be  to use a model flying device (a motorized dummy butterfly  with wings attached) at field sites in Arizona to assess  directly how and why the probability of detecting  conspecifics changes with perch preference.  Ecological  variables such as background contrast will be of special  interest.  The end results should be a better understanding  of how insects see their world, and a novel integration of  behavior, physiology, and ecology that will permit a more  comprehensive understanding of the immediate and  evolutionary resolution of conflicting behavioral demands in  animals.",
