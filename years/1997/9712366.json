 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project extends the lemma generation heuristics and failure  analysis of induction schemes in an induction and rewrite-rule  based theorem prover called Rewrite Rule Laboratory (RRL).  Finding an appropriate induction scheme and speculation of  intermediate lemmas are critical steps in mechanization of proofs  by induction.  For theorem provers to be effective for  applications, it is essential that a theorem prover be able to  automatically perform inference steps considered routine in the  application domain. This can be achieved, to a considerable  extent, with the help of decision procedure for data structures  used to model the application domain.  Further, these decision  procedures should be tightly integrated with other inference  steps and heuristics including simplification (rewriting),  generation of induction schemes and their analysis vis a vis  likelihood of success, lemma speculation, and appropriate  instantiations of definitions and lemmas needed in proof  attempts.  Motivated by the application of hardware verification,  this project seeks to design and implement decision procedures  for data structures including bits, bit vectors, numbers, lists  and sequences, and arrays, and integrate them in the induction  based prover RRL.",
