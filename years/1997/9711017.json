 "awd_abstract_narration": "Joseph Dalton Hooker became one of the most influential British naturalists of the nineteenth century: he produced impressive taxonomic and phytogeographical research, served as director of Kew Gardens and president of both the Royal Society and the BAAS, provided seminal botanical advice for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, enjoyed close personal relationships with numerous preeminent scientific authorities throughout Europe, and played a central role in the transformation of the amateur natural scientist into the professional civil servant.  Yet despite his distinguished career, he did not hold his first permanent professional scientific position until three weeks before his thirty-eighth birthday.  This study will examine his life during the formative, unsettled years of 1845 (when local; politics cost him his bid to become professor of botany at Edinburgh) and 1855 (when   he finally achieved assistant directorship at Kew), a period anchored by three-and-a-half years of scientific exploration in India.  It will trace his experience as he navigates diverse, social, cultural, and physical terrain in the quotidian practice of his daily life, to uncover his methods for acquiring natural knowledge, how he communicated this knowledge to colleagues and the public, what won his reputation, what he had to do to provide a living income, and the ways he harmonized science and family life.  Among the historiographic issues addressed will be the importance of `traditions` within natural history, the apportioning of scientific authority among field and museum work, the role of professionalization and institution-building, the methods and purposes of scientific representation, the relationship between science and imperialism and between metropole and periphery, and the position of women, and more strictly wives, within `manly`  Victorian science.  The decade surrounding Hooker's time in India provides an excellent opportunity to chart the ways an ambitious, talented and accomplished but professionally insecure young naturalist negotiated his identity in high Victorian Britain, and in turn reveals much about the character of science during a period  of distinct social and cultural change.",
