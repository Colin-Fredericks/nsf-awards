 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to plan, conduct and assess a \"Shaping the Future\" regional workshop the purpose of which would be able to improve the science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) education at the undergraduate level within the state of Arizona.  This workshop would have as invitees teams of faculty and administrators from three public universities and and the community colleges within the state, along with appropriate representatives of government agencies and the K-12 system.  The proposed workshop would be one and one half days in length and tentatively set for January 1998.  A steering committee with representation from each of the three state universities and the community college districts will be formed to work with a meeting facilitator so that the meeting format would best address the Shaping the Future:  New Expectations for Undergraduate Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology report (NSF 96-139) goals as they relate to:  SMET faculty : Building \"a sense of wonder and the excitement of discovery, plus communication and teamwork, critical thinking, and life-long learning skills into (SMET) learning experiences\".  SMET departments: Setting \"departmental goals and accept responsibility for undergraduate learning, with measurable expectations for all students... offer a (SMET) curriculum engaging the broadest spectrum of ... use technology effectively to enhance... work collaboratively with departments of education, the K-12 teachers\".  Governing boards and administrators:  Reexamining \"institutional missions in light of needs in undergraduate SME&T education; provide strong programs of faculty development;...(and) reduce organizational rigidities\".  During the meeting, facilitated discussions will be used to address these issues.  A review of how each institution (or district) is approaching the issues will also be conducted.  The meeting results will be  summarized in a report and captured on a state-wide SMET web page.  The steering committee will  be reconvened in the late spring or early summer of 1998 to assess the progress made on all campuses and to plan appropriate follow-up SMET activity.  *",
