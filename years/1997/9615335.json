These maps not only are essential for isolating genes of interest, but they also can be used to study important questions in population biology such as how new species are formed.  However, mapping data sets are very large and complex, and the current theoretical and analytical tools for exploring them are inadequate.  The purpose of this grant is to develop and apply a new theoretical approach called the \"method of junctions\" to the analysis and interpretation of these complex data sets.  Specifically, this method will be applied to mapping data sets derived from hybrids between wild sunflower species of the genus Helianthus.  Problems that will be addressed include determining exactly what genetic changes are necessary for new species to be formed and estimating how rapidly this process might take place.   Although this proposal will rely on mapping data sets generated for wild sunflower species, the analytical methods developed here should be broadly applicable to any data set that involves genetic mapping data.  Some theoretical and practical issues that these methods may affect range from understanding how genes interact with other genes to determining the most   effective strategies for moving genes of agronomic importance from wild plants into related cultivated species.",
