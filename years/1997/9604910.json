 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604910  Leibacher   Description:  This award supports the U.S.-India Cooperative  Research: Study of Solar Oscillations Phase III, which will examine  the Sun s interior utilizing the data set from the Global Oscillation  Network Group (GONG).  This recently completed network of six  identical oscillation observing stations that circle the globe will keep  the Sun under 24 hour surveillance and will yield unique data  having importance not only for solar physics, but for astrophysics,  solar-terrestrial physics, geophysics, and nuclear physics.  The U.S.  team is headed by John Leibacher of the National Solar Observatory  (NSO), Tucson, and the Indian team by Arvind Bhatnagar, Udaipur  Solar Observatory (USO) Udaipur, and S.M. Chitre, Tata Institute  of Fundamental Research, Mumbai.  The new field of  helioseismology has evolved from the discovery of solar acoustic  waves that emanate from randomly-excited seismic vibrations from  within the Sun.  This powerful new tool for studying the Sun s  interior structure and dynamics can probe the interior of the Sun  with the same precision that terrestrial seismology can probe the  Earth s interior.  During Phase III of the study, the U.S. and Indian  teams will pursue collaborative research in numerous areas that have  been stimulated by GONG data.  These include inversions;  hydrostatic Sun structure; helium abundance in the solar envelope;  excitation mechanisms for solar oscillations; background solar  spectrum; global magnetic fields in the sun s deep interior; nearly  steady flows and magnetic fields; and deterministic detrending.      Scope:  The U.S.-India component of this large international project  is exceptionally well balanced.  For the United States, Udaipur has  physical attributes such as atmospheric clarity and a unique  geographic position on the globe diametrically opposite to Tucson,  as well as strong infrastructural resources.  Solar physics is a field  in which Indian scientists excel.  The project will involve USO staff  and w orld class researchers from India s premier Tata Institute.   For India, the project offers entry to the field of helioseismology,  state-of -the-art instrumentation, and involvement in an important  international effort.  This project has thus far yielded a large  number of publications under U.S.-Indian authorship.       ***",
