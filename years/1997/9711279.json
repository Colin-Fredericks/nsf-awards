At each workshop a selected group of around ten U.S. environmental chemical scientists will confer with fifteen local scientific counterparts to develop plans and recommendations for scientific research addressing the unique environmental problems of the region.  Also, for each year, the American Chemical Society will select three early-career scientists from among nominees identified by the counterpart organizations.  Each of the participants will make a short-term visit of at least two months' duration to a research laboratory in the U.S.  The project will give U.S. chemical scientists an opportunity to consider environmental problems in unique regions of the Baltics, the NIS, and central Europe.  The participants can be expected to develop long-term cooperation and joint research in environmental chemistry between U.S. laboratories and some of the \"best and brightest\" early-career chemical societies in the Baltics/NIS/central European region.  In addition, the program should strengthen U.S. relationships with the non-governmental professional societies of the region.     These workshops should result in many new collaborative research efforts in quantum optics between U.S. researchers and their Lithuanian, Russian, and Czech counterparts.  They fulfill the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and these countries to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.    ***  ??",
