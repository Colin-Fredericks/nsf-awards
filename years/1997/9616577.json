Specifically,   the    liquid-glass  transition  will  be studied, with emphasis on  the  dynamics  of  supercooled  liquids  and the physical mechanism  underlying  the  liquid-glass  transition.  The  quantitative  comparison  of  the  measurements  with theory will focus on, but not be  limited  to,  the  Mode  Coupling  Theory, which provides  a  detailed  set  of  predictions  for  the dynamics of supercooled liquids  and  their  evolution  with  temperature.  The  critical  evaluation  of  the  several   theories  will  include,  in  addition  to  the   light  scattering  data, data from collaborating groups  using   neutron  scattering,  dielectric  susceptibility, and  molecular  dynamics  techniques.  %%%  This  project will advance the fundamental understanding of phase  transitions,  and  critically  test  theoretical  models,   using  advanced   methods   of  laser  light  scattering   spectroscopy.
