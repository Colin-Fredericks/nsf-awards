 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703285  Sudderth   Basic research is proposed in four areas:(1)abstract gambling theory, (2)two-  person, zero-sum stochastic games, (3)strategic market games, and (4)predictive inference   in statistics. The first three areas all involve agents controlling stochastic processes either   alone or jointly. Abstract gambling theory is a particular formulation of one-person   stochastic control theory, whereas two-person, zero-sum stochastic games have two   controllers with opposing interests. Strategic market games typically have many agents   and are used to model features of an economy such as price formation and loan markets.   In the fourth area, predictive inference, research is proposed on two criteria that seem   natural to require of any statistical prediction.   Most of the proposed research is on questions of how one or more individuals   should act when faced by a series of successive choices that must be made with   considerable uncertainty about their consequences. An example is the problem of how   much of one's income should be spent on current consumption and how much should be   saved (or invested) for the future. This problem, when formulated for a single individual,   fits into the framework of abstract gambling theory. If two individuals are in direct   competition for resources, the problem can be viewed as a two-person stochastic game.   Finally, if the problem involves all the individuals in a large economy, it can be viewed as a   many-person, strategic market game in which the individuals as a group determine, or at   least influence, prices and interest rates. If a central bank is added to the game as another   player that has the power to set interest rates, the question arises as to how the bank   should set interest rates so as to minimize inflation or improve the general welfare. This is   likely to be a difficult problem for our models just as it is in the real world.",
