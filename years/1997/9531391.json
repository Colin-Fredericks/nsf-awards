 "awd_abstract_narration": "DeBarber  9531391   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project builds on the successful results of the Phase I research that demonstrated an optical diagnostic technique capable of real-time measurement of species concentration in complex, multi-phase, spray combustion environments. A significant accomplishment of the Phase I work was to integrate photorefractive crystals with the technique of Resonant Holographic Interferometry (RHI) to record and reconstruct species specific holographic interferograms of combusting sprays at video data rates. In this Phase II effort, research will conducted to develop a compact, cost effective instrument that permits high speed acquisition and automated reduction of RHI interferograms. The milestones of the research are to develop and implement an automated data reduction method with photorefractive crystals, integrate compact tunable laser diodes, and design and build a fiber optic based prototype system. The Phase II research will culminate with a demonstration of the prototype system in a practical combustion environment to gain its acceptance into the scientific community and generate commercial interest that will lead into Phase III commercialization.   This diagnostic instrument will lead to the improved development of a wide variety of combustion and spray devices such as fuel injectors, spray atomizers, and high pressure nozzles. Markets for this technology include automotive engineering, aircraft engine development, hazardous waste incineration, combustion research, and spray coatings.      p:\\sbir\\yhashimi\\9531391a.doc",
