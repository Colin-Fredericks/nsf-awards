 "awd_abstract_narration": "A symposium on performance-based engineering will be held in January 1997 in Berkeley.  This symposium will be used to honor the contributions of Professor Vitelmo Bertero to the field of earthquake engineering over his illustrious career.  Technical presentations on frontier research will be made on January 31 and February l. The target audience for the  two-day technical program will focus on performance-based earthquake engineering and a design.  The symposium is split into four one-half day sessions.  The four session titles are: Reinforced Concrete Structures, Steel Structures, Design Methodologies, and Learning from Earthquakes.  The Symposium will bring together many experts in the field of earthquake engineering.  It     offers an outstanding opportunity for young faculty from around the United States to gain state-of-the-knowledge information on performance-based earthquake engineering, and to meet expert academicians, researchers and design professionals.  A unique feature of this meeting is to bring 20 young faculty and 5 speakers from around the United States to the Symposium.  This will afford young researchers a valuable opportunity to interact with  senior and accomplished researchers in technical discussions.",
