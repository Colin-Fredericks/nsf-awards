 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student at the Pennsylvania State University.  The project involves changes in gender roles within the family as a result of international migration.  The student will investigate traditional gender roles in a rural community in Bangladesh, and also among a sample of Bangladeshi immigrants in New York City.  The student will test hypotheses concerning traditional gender roles, social networks and their change in the new urban environment.  Families with larger Bangladeshi social networks, and with adult women with no formal employment will be expected to maintain more traditional gender roles.  The student will draw a random sample of families in New York and in a source community in Bangladesh, and will administer a formal measure of gender roles as well as do participant observation at public events and private household contexts.    This research is important because modern means of transportation and communications facilitate rapid population movements between different societies.  Advances in our understanding of the effects of migration on basic relationships in the family will help policy makers and planners cope with problems rising from a mismatch between traditional and contemporary forms of gender relations.",
