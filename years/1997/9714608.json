This   third  Conference  is  the first ever to be held in the  U.S.,  the  result   of  a  successful  proposal  to  the  International  organizing  board.  This Conference also  focuses  on  joint  activities  between the U.S., Europe, and Japan,  especially  in  technical  areas  of great current importance  to  those  countries.   Special  attention  will  be  given   to   high  performance  composites, especially  polymeric  and  ceramic  composites,  and  to  the  time-dependent  behavior  of  all  materials as identified by the recent U.S.-EC Commission  on  materials  research in Brussels.  A unique  feature  of  the  Conference is the fact that conceptual progress is  compiled  at  the  end  of  each Conference, and the  next  Conference  builds  on  the  progress that was made  in  previous  ones.  Concepts  were chosen in that way for the primary  focus  of  the current Conference.       The   timeliness  of  this  Conference  is  of  special  importance.   Europe  has initiated several  major  national  programs   in   high   performance  materials   for   severe  environments,  and the first results of those  programs  are  just  becoming  available.  A major  reason  for  requesting  support  for  this  Conference is  to  provide  a  means  of  inviting  and bringing to the Conference the major U.S.  and  European players in those technical areas to bring important  information  about  those  activities  and  the   associated  directions of research to the U.S. technical community,  and  especially to make it possible to bring young researchers to  the Conference who could not otherwise afford to come.    Conference organization         Conference  organization is being handled   by  Virginia  Tech  with  limited financial backing from  that  Institute.  Cooperating   U.S.   organizations  include   the   Virginia  Institute for Material Systems, and Georgia Tech; others are  being  contacted.  The scope of the Conference includes  all  types  of  high  performance polymer and composite  systems,  interfaces   and  interphases,  high-temperature  materials,  smart  materials  and  structures,  fatigue,  fracture,  and  damage analysis. Some 16 invited speakers have committed  to  the  Conference,  and  40 contributed  abstracts  have  been  received.  Contributed papers will be chosen in February  of  1997.***",
