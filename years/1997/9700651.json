 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9700651  Makram      This proposal describes the existence of \"unbalance\" in power systems and draws the attention of the reader to the alarming and growing presence of harmonic unbalance in power systems created as a result of the, random use of single, double and three phase harmonic loads in power systems.  While prior attempts to characterize unbalance in power systems have been typically unclear, a review of the current literature shows no attempts to characterize harmonic unbalance although it is important, useful and necessary from both an academic and practical point of view.  Beginning with the development of advanced three phase load models for commonly used power system loads, this project endeavors to undertake the critical task of proposing a metric that quantifies harmonic unbalance.  This new quantitative metric that characterizes power system harmonic unbalance bears a large impact on the utility in terms of modifying existing tariff structures, better instrumentation & metering and power quality studies.  Using the proposed metric, unbalance profiles will be studied and limits for the safe operation of customer equipment will be established.  This proposal  aims to conclude with setting standards for harmonic unbalance in power systems, thereby enhancing basic research in the understanding of harmonic unbalance in Power Systems.",
