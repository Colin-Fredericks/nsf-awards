 "awd_abstract_narration": "In university science and engineering education, an emphasis on algorithmic problem-solving and rote memorization of abstract concepts has been traditional.  This approach does not adequately prepare the majority of students for the real challenges of life in a technological society.  The passive role often relegated to students stifles their interest and initiative; this provides scant opportunity for the development of skills with lasting value, such as effective communication, mastery in analytical thinking, productive teamwork, and responsible, independent learning and resource utilization.    Institution-wide, systemic change in science education is being made by targeting freshmen and sophomores; their enhanced learning skills and spirit of inquiry will instigate further reform in upper-level courses, changing campus-wide expectations for science is taught and learned.  Longitudinal studies of student performance and attitudes will assess the effectiveness of the change.    A core of science and engineering Foundation Courses are developed that aid students in the early acquisition of the skills and habits of mind required for learning after college and outside of the classroom.  The Foundation Courses are developed by interdisciplinary teams of faculty, supported by an annual Instructional Innovation Institute that provides training in appropriate learning strategies and computer technology.  The Institute will sustain this drive for reform across disciplines and throughout the university.  The project builds on prior NSF-supported projects at the University of Delaware: \"Problem-Based Learning in Introductory Science Across Disciplines\" and Delaware's Innovative Science/Mathematics Collaborative for Undergraduate Success\".    As a result of this project, we expect to find that our students graduate with improved learning and problem-solving skills an enhanced appreciation of and attitude regarding science, and an improved ability to learn outside the classroom.  We expect to imbue in fac ulty a renewed interest in teaching and improving their effectiveness, specifically an enthusiasm for actively engaging their students in learning.  Finally, we expect that our administration will hold in high esteem our efforts in teaching science to and increasingly diverse student body.  We seek to catalyze a shift of additional institutional resources to science and engineering departments for facilitating active learning and instructional innovation.",
