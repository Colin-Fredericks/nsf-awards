Aluminum alloys have long been  used   for  skins and frames of aircraft. and are beginning to  be   used in the automotive industry.  Two other important light   metals  for  the transportation industry ire  titanium  and   magnesium.   The  recent progress in the development  of  a   mathematical  theory  of polycrystalline  plasticity  which   predicts not only the anisotropic macroscopic stress-strain   response  and  shape  changes, but also  the  evolution  of   crystallographic texture during deformation,  has  occurred   primarily  for  materials  with  face-centered-cubic  (fcc)   crystals. Much less progress of this type has occurred  for   materials   with   hexagonal-close-packed   (hcp)   crystal   structure.  Compared with fcc materials, the hcp  materials   exhibit  more complex modes of plastic deformation  due  to   their lower symmetry.  Inelastic deformation resistances of   different  slip systems can be substantially  different  in   the  hcp materials, and unlike the fcc aluminum alloys, the   hcp  titanium  and  magnesium  alloys  exhibit  deformation   twinning.   This  causes pronounced anisotropies  in  their   macroscopic   deformation   characteristics,   and    these   anisotropies   need  to  be  properly  accounted   for   in   developing a robust computational capability for      1. Process Design - deformation processing, and      2. Product  design  -  improved  structural  response   of       components,    made from titanium and magnesium1.  Of particular importance  is the development of a fundamental understanding of the  inelastic deformation behavior of these materials by slip  and twinning, and the development of accurate elasto-  viscoplastic constitutive equations  which describe this  deformation behavior.          We  propose  to  develop  anisotropic,  elasto-plastic   constitutive  equations  and computational  procedures  for   modeling  and  simulation of inelastic deformation  due  to   both  crystallographic slip ,and twinning in  hcp  titanium   and magnesium.  The computational capability will be useful   in  simulating  the development of anisotropy  due  to  the   evolution  of  crystallographic texture.  The  mathematical   models and procedures that we propose to develop should  be   useful in the design of a variety of deformation-processing   operations,  and  the design of components  for  structural   performance.    _______________________________  1 Although the majority of processing of magnesium allows is  done by casting, magnesium is also wrought to form tubes,  plates, and sheet.",
