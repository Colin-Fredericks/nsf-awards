This   equipment will enhance research in which the primary applications will   center in the areas of electronic structure, both in the development of   new codes using density function, relativistic and ab-initio methods, and   in applications to problems ranging from chemical dynamics through   electron transfer and molecular spectra to embedded clusters.        A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new way   to satisfy the computing needs of chemistry departments. Such a \"computer   network\" also serves as a development environment for new theoretical   codes and algorithms, provides state-of-art graphics and visualization   facilities, and supports research in state-of-the-art applications of   parallel processing.        ***",
