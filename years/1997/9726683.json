 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726683  Vesecky    Research will be undertaken in response to an Announcement of   Opportunity (NSF 97-38)for Coastal Studies in the Great Lakes.    This collaborative research project between investigators from 13   academic and government research institutions is being conducted   under the auspices of the NSF Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP)   program and the NOAA Coastal Ocean Program.    This 5-year research program will focus on the importance of   episodic events on nearshore-offshore transport and subsequent   ecological consequences. The study seeks to 1) determine what   processes control the cross-margin (inshore to offshore)   transport of biological, chemical, and geological materials in   the coastal margins of the Great Lakes, and to 2) develop and   test scientific strategies for assessing, quantifying, and   predicting the impacts of multiple stresses both natural and   anthropogenic, in the Great Lakes or selected coastal sub-  regions.    A tight coupling between contaminated sediments and overlying   water exists in lakes and coastal ecosystems through the process   of sediment resuspension. Satellite observations in Lake Michigan   illustrate an annually recurrent episode of nearshore-offshore   transport, a 10 km wide plume of resuspended material extending   over 200 km along the southern shores of the lake. Preliminary   evidence indicates that this episodic event may be the major   mechanism for cross-margin sediment transport in Lake Michigan.    This type of event impacts recycling of biogeochemically   important materials (BIMS), ecosystem responses, cross-isobath   transport in the Great Lakes. The program results will be   applicable to similar events in many coastal areas.    This comprehensive, interdisciplinary study will implement an   integrated observational program and numerical modeling effort to   identify, quantify, and develop prediction tools for the winter-  spring resuspension event and to assess the impact of this event   on the transport and transform ation of BIMS and on lake ecology.    This component of the study focuses on real time measurements of   key air and water variables necessary for the observational,   modeling and forecasting activities, in particular surface   currents, winds and waves that are pertinent to the overall   objectives. Two multifrequency HF radar units will be deployed   along the shore of lower Lake Michigan to provide real time   observations of near surface current and current shear, wind   direction and wave height over an area of about 2500 sq. km.   adjacent to the lower Lake Michigan shoreline. This work will   contribute to the overall goals of understanding episodic events   and cross-margin transport in the Great Lakes and developing a   portable data assimilation nowcast/forecast system based on the   lower Michigan results.",
