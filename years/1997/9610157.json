 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS 9610157    WORKSHOP ON STOCHASTIC MODEL BUILDING AND VARIABLE SELECTION   ABSTRACT     As statistical analysis and modeling of larger and more complex data   sets is becoming more common, new and better computer based tools for   guiding the initial specification of the main features of statistical   models are being developed.  Recently, a new generation of stochastic   algorithms has been emerging as an important augmentation to   traditional deterministic strategies.  Examples include stochastic   search methods for variable selection, graphical models, selection of   variable transformations and interactions, wavelet thresholding, ARMA   modeling, CART, MARS, neural networks and more.  A workshop on   stochastic model building and variable selection that blends   methodology and case studies will significantly advance this field of   statistical research and will encourage dissemination of an important   class of modeling techniques to practitioners.     The workshop is organized in coordination with the NBER/NSF Time   Series Seminar and with the Workshop on Wavelets in Statistics. The   common research themes between stochastic model building, wavelets   analysis and times series analysis will be exploited to create both a   synergy at the research level and savings in travel expenses and   arrangements.  Funds from this grant will be used for domestic travel   expenses for participants based in the U.S.A, particularly junior   researchers, and others from underrepresented groups.",
