 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research project advances artificial-intelligence  research  in the areas of planning and reinforcement learning.  The primary  goal  of  the  research  is  to  create  theoretically  justified  planning  algorithms with wide applicability to  tasks  including  robot  navigation and control, medical decision making,  flexible  manufacturing,  communications-network  monitoring,  and   space  mission scheduling.  The research takes a two-pronged approach to  develop  algorithms for solving large-scale domains derived  from  practical, real-world problems: careful formal analysis to aid in  the  construction  and identification of justifiable  algorithms,  and  the  development  and  intensive  empirical  validation   of  algorithms.  This strategy encourages the creation of  algorithms  that  will  be  useful in solving practical tasks while  avoiding  ``over fitting'' (i.e., losing generality by tailoring algorithms  to  attributes  of  specific domains).  New  planning  algorithms  developed  in  the course of this research combine insights  from  the  areas  of  planning and reinforcement learning  to  make  it  possible  to solve larger and more difficult problems than  could  be  addressed  previously. The research is creating  methods  for  approximately solving large control problems that could  be  used  in  engineering applications ranging from elevator design to  the  adaptive  control  of  computer systems; this  will  help  create  systems that aremore efficient, safe, and reliable.",
