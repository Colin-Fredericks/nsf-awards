 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sperry  9723464    The goal of the project is to obtain a better understanding of  the mechanisms of drought tolerance in plants. The hypothesis is  that the ability of a plant to maintain open stomata and survive  under drought conditions will correspond to its ability to  extract and transport soil water to the foliage. The plant's  potential for water extraction is determined by three variables:  1) its susceptibility to xylem cavitation which eliminates plant  water transport, 2) its rooting density and distribution, 3) the  soil type. Experimental and theoretical analysis of these  variables will determine the range of drought stress over which  water transport is possible. The \"hydraulic potential\" of the  plant will be compared with its actual water use to evaluate the  hypothesis. The research will be conducted on native shrubs of  the Great Basin valleys in west-central Utah. These plants  experience a relatively wet spring followed by a predictable and  usually extreme summer drought. The nine study species represent  a spectrum of drought tolerance, differing widely in their  seasonal pattern of stomata! opening, vegetative phonology, and  rooting distribution.",
