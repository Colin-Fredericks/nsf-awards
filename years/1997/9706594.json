 "awd_abstract_narration": "Suri  9706594       The investigator studies problems arising in the h-p finite  element method.  The first problem investigated is how h-p  discretization of a complicated domain can be accomplished by  partitioning it to several independent workers, and then  reassembling the pieces, without assuming compatibility of the  sub-meshes.  The objective is to develop algorithms that use  Lagrange multipliers at the interface together with proper  mesh/degree combinations, and preserve the (exponential) h-p  convergence rates obtained when the domain is analyzed without  partitioning.  The second problem is obtaining robust,  mathematically certified h-p methods for shells.  Finite element  modeling of shells is complicated by boundary layers and locking  phenomena, which seriously affect convergence rates when the  shell is thin.  The goal is to design methods free of locking  (such as mixed methods), which resolve the boundary layers as  well.       The finite element method for solving differential equations  incorporates a mesh --- a quilt of small pieces that fit together  to make up the region where the equation holds --- and a set of  functions, usually polynomials, for each piece of the quilt.  Accuracy of the method depends on how fine the mesh is and how  high the degree of the polynomials may be.  The h-p finite element  method couples mesh refinement with polynomial degree increase  for enhanced accuracy and convergence.  Finite element modeling is  used extensively in industry, from aircraft and automobile  manufacture, to structural analysis in civil engineering, to the  precision design and fitting of e.g. electronic components.  Many  large or complicated problems (such as the modeling of an  aircraft) must be first broken into separate pieces (such as the  fuselage, wings, etc.), to be meshed separately.  This project  develops methods by which such components can be accurately and  efficiently reassembled for the final modeling.  Also, individual  components (for example wings) are  often ``thin'' and therefore  modeled as plates and shells.  The finite element modeling of  shells poses special problems, and robust methods are developed  and analyzed to address them.  The research affects  state-of-the-art engineering by influencing the development of  (and finding application in) updated versions of commercial codes  that have incorporated the new h-p finite element technology.",
