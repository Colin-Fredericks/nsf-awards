 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, eight computer-interfaced spectrophotometers are being purchased to facilitate the learning of advanced topics in biochemistry in undergraduate laboratories.  This type of instrumentation shortens time for data collection and thereby increases time for discussion of the significance and interpretation of data.  Furthermore, this instrumentation allows collection of additional data that facilitates the learning of important principles in biochemistry.  In addition, this project purchases a spectrophotometer equipped with gel scanning and six-cell compartment accessories for teaching gel analysis and advanced kinetics and spectroscopy to undergraduates involved in directed research programs.  Students benefitting from the new instrumentation are those taking biochemistry in the BS Biochemistry program; in the BA and BS Chemistry programs; in the Medical Technology, Microbiology, and Cellular and Molecular Biology Programs; and students in the Dietetics Program.    Standard methods are used to faciltitate learning of the advanced topics in undergraduate laboratories, with the advantage that the new instrumentation allows students to collect their own data rather than analyze data provided by the instructor.  Laboratory manuals can be revised to include these analyses.  Standard methods are currently in use to facilitate learning of research techniques for undergraduates involved in directed research projects.  The advantage of a new spectrophotometer for these students is that there is no software incompatibilities with the computers available in individual research laboratories as well as in the IBM laboratory where students carry out many of their data manipulations.    The significance of obtaining new spectrophotometers, which allows introduction of additional data collection for advanced analyses in undergraduate laboratories and greater ease of data manipulation for directed research students, is that students are exposed to state-of-the-art spectrophotometeric instrumen tation of the type that they can encounter in professional and academic research settings after graduation.  This exposure makes them more competitive for positions in industry and for advanced degree programs.    *",
