 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602544  Lieberman    This  project is a collaboration between the University  of  California-Berkeley group under  the  direction  of  Professor Michael A. Lieberman, and Australian National  University  group under the direction of Professor  Rod  Boswell   on  experiments,  analytical  modeling,   and  computer  simulations  of  pulsed  power  high  density  plasma  discharges  used for materials  processing,  to  obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of  these  discharges  and  their utility for  various  processing  applications.   The  U.S. and Australian  investigators  will develop analytical models and computer simulations  of such discharges and will perform experiments on high  density pulsed power helicon discharges.    High   density  sources,  such  as  electron  cyclotron  resonance   discharges  (ECR's),  inductively   coupled  plasmas  (ICP's), and helicons are regarded as powerful  tools   that   can  replace  conventional  capacitively  coupled,  parallel  plate  plasma  reactors.   A  major  advantage  is that much higher manufacturing throughput  can  be  expected because much higher plasma  densities  than  those  of parallel plate reactors are obtainable.  Another  advantage  is  that  aspect  ratio-independent  anisotropic  etch  processes are  possible  because  of  lower gas pressures.  It is also a great advantage that  the   ion   bombarding   energy   can   be   controlled  independently  of  the  ion flux.   High  density,  low  pressure plasma sources utilizing modulated power  have  been attracting much attention recently.  By modulating  the  power,  it  is  possible to further  optimize  and  control  the  performance  of  processing  plasmas   by  changing the pulse frequency and duty ratio.",
