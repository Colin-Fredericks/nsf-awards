 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel Computing for Undergraduate Faculty    The purpose of this project is to prepare undergraduate faculty to teach parallel computing. When participants have completed the course which we will  offer, they will be prepared to add parallel computing to their curriculum, either by integrating topics on parallel computing into existing courses or by teaching one or more courses specifically on parallel computing. In addition, participants will be ready to assess the feasibility of establishing a parallel computing laboratory at their own college. The course will begin with an intensive two-week session in the summer of 1997. This course will include lectures surveying the broad scope of parallel computing and instruction on the design and implementation of parallel algorithms. About half of the course time will be spent on hands-on development and implementation of parallel programs using the parallel computers at Colgate. During the fall, participants will work on projects, with site visits from the instructors where possible. At the follow-up session in January or February, 1998, participants will present their project results and will have an opportunity to discuss the practical aspects of teaching parallel computing to undergraduates.         A second group of participants will follow a similar pattern with a course in  the summer of 1998, project work and a follow-up session early in 1999.",
