 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704424  Lawson       This award is to provide partial support for a week long conference  in gauge theory and low dimensional topology at Tulane University in the  fall semester of 1997.  The conference will be held in conjunction with  the annual Clifford Lectures, given this year by Peter Kronheimer.  Gauge  theory has been the source of dramatic advances in low dimensional topology  in recent years, and the work of Kronheimer and Tomasz Mrowka has been  fundamental, particularly their settling of the Thom conjecture.  A dozen  other significant contributors to this area will give major talks, and  additional shorter talks will round out the program.       Despite the fact that we live in a universe of three spatial  dimensions and one time dimension and have available all the intuition  that this experience provides us, three and four dimensional objects  have remained remarkably resistant to full understanding.  In fact,  mathematicians have found that in some respects higher dimensional  spaces are more tractable, whereas some of the analytic tools available in  higher dimensions cannot be used in dimensions three and four.  This  means that other methods that will apply in these so-called low dimensions  are at a premium and is what makes so important the gauge theoretic methods  first introduced by Simon Donaldson and more recently strikingly simplified  by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten.  ***",
