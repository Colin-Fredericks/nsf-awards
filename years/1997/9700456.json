 "awd_abstract_narration": "The GOALI industry-university collaborative research project  deals with simultaneous design of trajectory pattern tuned  computer controlled machinery for ultra-high speed and  accuracy applications such as lithography, bonding, and  inspection in the electronics industry as well as for the  production of high quality optical components instruments.  The mail goal of the project is to develop a trajectory-  pattern based, systematic methodology for simultaneous  design, optimization, and fine-tuning of all subsystems  (structure, actuator, control) of a computer controlled  machinery to achieve ultra-high performance for the classes  of specified tanks. The project also involves the detailed  design, construction, and system integration of a testbed  for high-performance machinery. The testbed will be used to  evaluate the effectiveness of the design methodology, the  performance of the constructed systems, its various  components and motion synthesis and control algorithms. By  designing and tuning system parameters for the actual  trajectory patterns that a high-performance machine is  required to perform, one can fully take advantage of the  interaction among the machine structure, the actuators, and  controllers to achieve ultra-high performance with  significant; cost savings. The multidisciplinary project is  to be carried out in a period of three years in  collaboration with three companies (Anorad Corporation,  Morgan Matroc Electro Ceramics Division, and OmniTek  Research Development, Inc.) with expertise ranging from  machine design, dynamics, control, design of passive and  active vibration damping elements, system integration, as  well as manufacturing of piezoceramic-based active  components. The project demonstrates how both universities  and manufacturing  and engineering  industry may benefit  from cooperative research in the development, application,  and integration of available and emerging technologies in  the field of optimal design and operation of ultra-high  performance production machinery.",
