Falk      Abstract:    The first main area of study of this project is the finite element  approximation of plate and shell models.  One objective is to develop methods  which avoid the ``locking'' problem which leads, for standard approximations,  to poor results for thin shells and plates.  A second part of the project is  to design and analyze effective multigrid preconditioners for least squares  and mixed finite element approximations to second order elliptic boundary  value problems.  A third general area of study, using both computational and  analytical techniques, is to understand the predictions of mathematical models  which are concerned with stress driven instability of recrystallizable rods  and films and with curvature driven surface diffusion.  The last part of the  project will attempt to develop finite element methods for first order linear  hyperbolic systems and also for the approximation of simplified versions of  the Einstein equations.    Many problems in solid mechanics can be studied by using mathematical models.  These models offer a cost-effective way to make quantitative predictions about  how mechanical systems will change under various conditions, such as the  application of external forces. In particular, they offer an alternative to  the use of costly or difficult experiments.  Typically, when realistic  mathematical models are formulated, they are in terms of equations whose  solutions, which represent physical quantities of interest to engineers and  scientists, are not able to be determined analytically, i.e., in a simple form  one can easily write down.  However, by employing numerical methods, good  approximations to the physical quantities which are described by the  mathematical models may still be found. Typically, these numerical methods use  high-speed computers to do the large number of calculations involved.  This  project is concerned with the  design and analysis of numerical approximation  schemes for a number of important mathematical models used in mechanics.  Among the mathematical models considered are those for thin shells and films.",
