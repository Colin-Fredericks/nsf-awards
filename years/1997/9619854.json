There are three specific topics to be studied:  dense and metallic hydrogen; general many-body theory; and,  density functional theory.    Theoretical studies will be done on dense and metallic  hydrogen and will include transport properties of dense  fluid hydrogen; novel broken symmetry states; pairing of  pairs; and, persistence of proton-pairing.  Under general  many-body theory, topics will include effective electron-  electron interactions in reduced dimensions; instabilities  in layered systems; two-component quantum systems and  generalized scaling; revisiting lithium as a model system  for Eliashberg equations of superconductivity; and, helium  in a periodic field.  Topics in density functional theory  will include studies of fullerenes and intercalated  fullerenes; the Born-Green equation;  the average-ion mixing  rule; statistical description of the dynamic crystalline  state; and, coarse graining and the inhomogeneous electron  gas.  %%%  This theoretical grant involves research on a wide variety  of topics from condensed matter physics - the study of atoms  and molecules in condensed states such as liquids and  solids.  Of particular current interest will be the study of  hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe and  usually in a gaseous state, and its properties as it enters  a metallic state in which it can conduct electricity.  Other  topics of study will include superconductivity and the study  of fullerenes - a new form of carbon.  ***",
