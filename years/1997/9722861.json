 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722861  Si    This award supports participation of thirteen engineering  students in a summer research and education program between  Arizona State University, Tsinghua University, Beijing, and  Motorola.  The program will involve student participation in  engineering research projects within Motorola-China, with  supervision by Motorola engineers; research at Tsinghua on  multi-media software and on software design, and a  comparison of  Chinese and American educational systems.    Activities planned for this summer program are intended to  develop as cooperative projects enabling students to gain  access to the expertise, facilities, and unique environments  of China in ways that are mutually beneficial to the United  States and China.  Exposure to the Chinese education and  academic research systems, and to an overseas operation of a  major US multinational will provide important insights to  the student participants, promoting their ability to develop  as competitive professional engineers and engineering  researchers.    This project adds an international dimension to ECS 9553202,  a Presidential Faculty Fellows award.  Funding provided by  NSF will be matched by Motorola.",
