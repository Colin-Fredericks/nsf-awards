 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program is supporting Prof.   B.Whaley at the University of California, Berkeley.  The research, to be   carried out over the next three years will be a a continuation of ongoing   theoretical studies of foreign species in quantum clusters of helium and   hydrogen.  This research program has a two-fold design.  First, to   establish general methods of dealing with structure, dynamics and   spectroscopy of complex quantum systems when nuclear delocalization and   exchange effects are important.  The approach is based on Quantum Monte   Carlo methods, both zero and finite temperature, which have been shown to   be powerful tools for analyzing the properties of quantum clusters.  A   significant algorithmic development here is the calculation of imaginary   time correlation functions, which allows the calculation of dopant   spectra directly.  The second goal is to answer some open questions about   the interaction of probe molecules with their quantum environment which   have been raised by recent experiments on doped quantum clusters.  Thus   in the applications during this grant cycle, Prof Whaley will focus on   the study of the spectroscopy of these clusters.  This includes infra-red   spectra of dopant molecules, electronic spectra and the nature of   electronic energy transfer in pure and atomic-doped quantumclusters.  Quantum clusters of helium and hydrogen possess unusual low temperature   behavior which is of interest to both chemistry and physics communities.    While conceptually of importance because of the unique opportunity they   present for study of finite size effects in strongly quantum systems,   theyalso have significant practical use as gentle quantum matrices which   may be utilized to study spectroscopy of weakly bound systems and   chemical reactions at low temperatures.  The utility of this quantum   micro-environment has recently been dramatically demonstrated with the   production of small metal clusters inside a helium droplet.  This opens a   new controlled route to study of the reactivity of metal particles.  The   aim of this theoretical and computational investigation is to develop the   understanding necessary to interpret spectral signatures of such doped   quantum clusters, and to provide predictive power for using them to   control elementary reaction dynamics in a novel ultra-cold nanoscale   quantum matrix.",
