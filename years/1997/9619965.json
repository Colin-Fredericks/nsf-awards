 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bryn Mawr and Spelman Colleges have established a program whose  explicit purpose is to increase the number of women and minority  students who successfully complete graduate programs in the  mathematical sciences.  This program, entitled \"Enhancing  Diversity in Graduate Education (EDGE),\" is designed to  strengthen the ability of the targeted student population to  successfully negotiate the transition from undergraduate to  graduate education in mathematics, and to succeed in those  graduate programs.  The program focuses primarily on recent  graduates of undergraduate mathematics programs who will attend  graduate programs in the mathematical sciences the following  fall.    For the past four years, the Principal Investigators have co-directed the NSF-sponsored Spelman-Bryn Mawr Summer Mathematics  Program, aimed at identifying and encouraging talented young  women to pursue careers in the mathematical sciences.  Now, as a  continuation of this effort, the two institutions are addressing  a persistent problem that continues to thwart the efforts of  earlier intervention programs, namely the attrition of talented  women and minority students from graduate programs in  mathematics.  Attrition for these groups is disproportionately  high, and students who are not successful in one program are  often lost from the pipeline altogether.    In order to realize its goals, the program helps students develop  a stronger background in the basic areas of analysis and algebra.   In addition, the program establishes mechanisms to provide  prospective female graduate students with (1) a clear  understanding of what will be expected of them in graduate  school, (2) the basic tools needed to increase both their  confidence and their ability to compete in graduate school, (3) a  support network aimed at keeping them in the mathematical  sciences once they have begun their graduate work, (4) a broad  perspective about mathematics and its connections to other  disciplines, and (5) an understanding of their own  strengths and  weaknesses under stress, in group study, and in a competitive  environment.    The structure of the program involves two basic components: (1)  an intensive summer program, and (2) a follow-up mentoring  program.  The summer program includes two six-week core courses;  four one-week minicourses on exciting areas of mathematical  research; and problem sessions aimed at preparing participants  for graduate qualifying exams.  The mentoring program involves  graduate institutions in the identification of appropriate  mentors who will serve as advocates for the participants from the  beginning of their graduate study.  A continuing support network  is provided by the Principal Investigators, student participants,  and graduate student mentors.  In addition, the project includes  a comprehensive study, done in conjunction with a sociologist  experienced in investigating issues involving gender and science  in higher education and at the professional level, whose aim is  to determine the effectiveness of the program in helping students  to negotiate the various stages of their graduate education.    Over a period of four years, between forty and fifty women, at  least half of whom are from underrepresented minority groups,  will be directly supported in their efforts to persist to the  Ph.D. degree in the mathematical sciences.  As a result, it is  expected that the success rate of women and minorities in  graduate programs in the mathematical sciences will increase,  beginning with the rates at participating institutions.  The  evaluation process will also provide the mathematics community  with intensive data about the experiences of minorities and women  in graduate programs in the mathematical sciences.",
