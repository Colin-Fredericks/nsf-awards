 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Cleveland State University's Advanced Manufacturing Center (AMC) provides an  opportunity for students at CSU and three affiliated community colleges,  along with workforce trainees, to have hands-on experience in manufacturing  process development and production.  The Center's mission is to provide the  region's manufacturers with the products, processes, ideas, and people they  need to become more profitable and to create jobs.  The Center is a  partnership between Cleveland State University, the Cleveland Advanced  Manufacturing Program (CAMP), and industry, with at least half of the  revenue for the Center coming from industry.  Center students, faculty and  staff work on projects that fit the needs of a particular company and then  apply the research findings industry-wide, thus giving engineering students  an educational experience in industrially relevant engineering problems.  This award supports a National conference to benchmark best practices of  similar centers, the refinement the AMC model, and the development of a list  of possible replication sites.",
