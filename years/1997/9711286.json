 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effects of property institutions are central to economics. Yet, quanti tative work on the effects of property institutions is rare in economics be cause property institutions generally covary with political boundaries, and therefore with other important variables. Thus, their impact tends to be conflated with that of other factors. The main objective of this interdisci plinary study are: to build a database that gives a measure of the extent of ecological degradation suffered by forests in the Central Himalayas, and to use it to perform a quantitative study that examines the importance of property regimes versus demand-side factors, such as population, in causing such degradation.  The central Himalayan region of North India that constitutes the study area has three property regimes in forests within the same ecological, eco nomic, and cultural milieu. In all three cases, the forests are a common resource, (as is typical in most tropical forests), so regulation or collective action is needed to overcome the resulting tendency for over-exploitation. Reserved Forests, which are state-managed, rely mainly on regulation, while Panchayat Forests, managed by village councils, rely on collective action. The third category, consisting of village forests not under formal manage ment, also needs collective action to survive.  Data on forest quality in the region is obtained by analysis of satel lite images in conjunction with field work. A sample of several thousand small plots of forest is taken and forest quality in them measured.  The presence of thousands of Panchayat Forests adjacent to Reserved Forests provides an exceptional natural experiment to examine the effect of property regimes on forest cover. By taking a subsample of plots which lie across regime boundaries from each other, we can control for the effects of all variables other than the legal regime. Multiple regression analysis is used to relate forest quality in a plot of forest to the property regime, the ecological type, demand-side variables such as accessibility, social character istics of villages such as size and ethnic composition, and controls. Questions such as: is local collective action more effective than state control in con serving forests, how much do prices matter as compared to property regimes, and do social factors influence the effectiveness of legal institutions, are answered.",
