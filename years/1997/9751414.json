 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the rapid development of wireless networking technology and the wide use of portable computers, a new paradigm of computing called mobile computing has been predicted to be the dominant form of computing in the near future.  In the mobile computing environment, a large number of mobile computers, independent of their physical locations, have access to shared services and resources, which are situated in the land-based network and the mobile computing units.  This new environment extends the range of applications to a new dimension.  This avenue is also rich in research and development.  But the requirements to mobile computing, ranging from cellular and infrared communication links to energy-efficient data access for terminals running on self-contained power supplies, make it impractical to use old facilities for teaching and project development in the area.    With this project, a new mobile laboratory builds on old facilities.  The purpose of this laboratory is fivefold: (1) to be an essential part of a newly structured course in mobile computing and information systems; (2) to be an equipment infrastructure for the students to develop software necessary for teaching the fundamentals of mobile computing and information systems; (3) to be a center for training students in the use and development of state-of-the-art technologies; (4) to provide an environment for undergraduate students to undertake independent projects in mobile topics; and (5) to provide an environment for faculty and undergraduate students to experience fundamental and applied research in mobile computing and interdisciplinary areas.  The laboratory represents a crucial step in the initiation of a nationally recognized teaching and undergraduate research program in mobile computing and nomadic applications, by providing the much needed facilities for the development of a course and projects designed for juniors and seniors.    *",
