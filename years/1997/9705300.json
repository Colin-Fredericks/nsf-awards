 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705300  Hellman    This is a new project by a PI who collaborates with a well established  group  of  scientists  a  UC  San Diego to  study  \"highly  correlated  electron systems\".  These are complex systems, with superconductivity,  magnetism, metallic conduction, and insulating behavior found  in  the  same material system, often with only small changes in composition  or  structure.   One electron bands are narrow, screening is limited,  and  electron-electron  correlation energy is high, leading  to  a  general  instability  of  the electronic system to different  competing  ground  states.   In  the neighborhood of such instabilities, the  effects  of  reducing dimensionality, thereby increasing the correlation energy, or  of adding magnetic moments can be extremely dramatic.  This complexity  is   absent  in  more  traditional  materials,  where  properties  can  generally  be quite successfully described using Fermi liquid  theory,  and  dramatic  effects  seldom result from small  changes.   In  these  complex systems the importance of measuring all properties on the same  sample   cannot   be  overstated,  since  subtle  and   often   nearly  unmeasurable  structural or chemical changes  can  drastically  affect  properties.  Measurements of specific heat  from  low  temperature  up  through any phase transitions reveal important characteristics of  the  electronic system.  Our ability to measure the specific heat  of  thin  films  and  microgram  size  single crystals  allows  measurements  of  magneto-transport, magnetization, IR and tunneling spectroscopy on the  same samples.  We plan collaborations with Maple, Schuller, Basov, and  Dynes to prepare and measure samples of materials in which correlation  energies   can   be   varied,  either  by   composition   or   reduced  dimensionality, and with theorists Sham, Arovas, and Renn  to  develop  models for these materials.  %%%  This is a new project by a PI who collaborates with a well established  group  of  scientists  a  UC  Sa n Diego to  study  \"highly  correlated  electron  systems\".  These are materials causing great  excitement  in  condensed  matter physics  and with great potential for  applications,  such    as    high    temperature    superconductors    or    colossal  magnetoresistance.  The phase diagrams of these materials are complex,  with  superconductivity, magnetism, metallic conduction, or insulating  behavior  found  in the same material system, often  with  only  small  changes  in  composition or structure.  This complexity is  absent  in  more  traditional materials.  The interactions between the  electrons,  which  cause the magnetism, superconductivity, or insulating behavior,  compete with each other, with one or another winning.  It thus appears  that  the electrons in these new materials are perched on the edge  of  many  different types of behavior, with the potential to go  different  ways  depending  on  extremely  subtle  differences  in  structure  or  composition.   With  this  in mind, the importance  of  measuring  all  properties  on the same sample cannot be overstated, since subtle  and  often   nearly  unmeasurable  structural  or  chemical   changes   can  drastically  affect properties.  We have a unique capability  here  to  make  a  basic measurement (specific heat) on samples which cannot  be  measured   elsewhere.    This  grant  will   allow   us   to   develop  collaborations taking advantage of our unique expertise together  with  others' expertise in sample preparation, characterization, measurement  and theoretical understanding.  ***",
