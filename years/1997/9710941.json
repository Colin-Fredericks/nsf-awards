 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the   Division of Chemistry provides partial support to enable the   participation of five or more graduate students at the 1997 Secondary Ion   Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) Meeting.  This is a biennial international   meeting and represents the largest international forum for dissemination   of information on SIMS.  Students will be invited to present their   research.  The meeting is held under the auspices of the American Society   for Mass Spectrometry.  Scientists from industry, government and academic   institutions are attracted to the program and will provide students with   broad exposure to all aspects of SIMS.  Topics will include the   following: surface analysis, developments in instrumentation, depth   profiling, semiconductor applications, metallurgical and geological   applications, and fundamentals of sputtering.  This award enables participation of graduate students in the 1997   Secondary Ion Mass spectrometry (SIMS) Meeting.  The conference provides   a broad view of scientific activities involving SIMS.",
