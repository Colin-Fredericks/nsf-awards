 "awd_abstract_narration": "Luna  9615707  This project is for research planning, submitted in response  to the Minority Research Planning Grant Program  Announcement, NSF 94-147, to support preliminary studies  related to the development of a competitive research project  and proposal.    During the past five years there have been a number of  research initiatives to model the spatial distribution of  geotechnical earthquake hazards. This interest in spatial  hazard modeling was due primarily to the increased use of  geographic information systems (GIS) by the engineering  community. A GIS is an ideal platform to analyze spatial  data and information that can aid in the decision making  process of engineers and officials. On the other hand,  agencies that respond to the catastrophes produced by these  hazards have moved forward to implement disaster response  systems that serve the areas in a state of emergency. An  integration of these two approaches will incorporate  engineering analyses into the procedures for mitigation and  response of earthquake damage, injuries, and loss of life.    The goal is to enhance an existing spatial analysis system  that evaluates the potential for soil failure through  liquefaction by adding a liquefaction deformation analysis  capability and by introducing two additional hazards: ground  motion amplification and slope instability.    The overall goal is to study spatial geotechnical earthquake  hazard models in the context of damage assessment and  disaster (emergency) response systems. The following are the  specific objectives for the first phase, namely proposal  development, of this project:    * Identify publications, research activities and individuals  related to hazard modeling in the area of geotechnical  earthquake engineering, and evaluate the implementation of  these models in a spatial framework. A focus on liquefaction  deformation analyses is anticipated.    * Study the current development of damage assessment and  disaster response systems, identify collaborators, system   developers and establish contacts with national emergency  agencies.    * Evaluate the integration of the hazard modeling with  disaster response systems.    * Prepare a comprehensive proposal to NSF focused on the  development of these geotechnical earthquake hazard modules  and their use with damage assessment and disaster response  systems.",
