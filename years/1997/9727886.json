 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727886  Peirce  This is an award to support the exploratory phase of a research  project to determine the impact that land application of sludge  has on ozone pollution in the lower levels of the troposphere.  The investigator will conduct laboratory experiments to determine  the flux of reactive nitrogen oxide from agricultural soils in  the absence of nitrogen amendments, in soils that have been  amended with sludge and soils fertilized chemically.  Soils to be  investigated will be obtained from agricultural land comparable  to that currently being used for land application of sludge.  Sludge will be obtained from the Chapel Hill, North Carolina  wastewater treatment plant.  Results of laboratory experiments  will be compared with those from field studies to determine the  scope of additional research needed to relate existing knowledge  of the flux of reactive nitrogen oxide from natural and  chemically fertilized soils to soils that are used for sludge  management.    The proposal leading to this award was submitted under Special  Guidelines for Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) in  NSF 95-27, Grant Proposal Guide.  Conditions relating to  production, transport and emission of nitrogen oxide from natural  and chemically fertilized soils are currently well defined.  Recent emphasis on aggressive use of land for sludge management  suggests determining whether this knowledge is sufficient to  establish nitrogen oxide emission characteristics from these  soils and their role in contributing to emission and formation of  atmospheric ozone.  Results of this project are expected to be  used in determining the need further research to guide  engineering design of land application systems for management of  sludges and conditions under which air pollution from this source  can be minimized or eliminated.  ***",
