His research is directed toward improving our  fundamental understanding of factors that result in corrosive  behavior of materials used in distribution systems for water.  Materials used in construction of water distribution systems are  subject to corrosion over long periods of time which reduces the  effective life of the system's components and has a potentially  degrading effect on the quality of water delivered to users  through the distribution system.    Procedures to adequately determine the effect of corrosion can be  useful in improving the engineering design of water distribution  systems.  This award also continues to have the intent of  encouraging the investigator's early development as an educator.  The investigator's education plan involves exploring changes in  basic course structure that include active learning, development  of supportive learning classroom environments,, and  implementation of a reward structure that encourages development  of non-traditional target skills such as teamwork, class  motivation and interest in learning outside the classroom.  His  teaching plan involves implementation and evaluation of new  approaches to learning in the undergraduate engineering classroom  environment that will improve the way in which undergraduate  engineering courses are taught.  ***",
