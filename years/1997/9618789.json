Using well proven electronic structure techniques,  supplemented by the thermal molecular dynamics simulations,  the plans are to study: (1) the microscopic structure of  midgap as well as band-tail states and the effect of  phonons, (2) the nature of electron localization in a three  dimension model containing several thousand atoms, (3) the  effects of doping of Boron and Phosphorus in hydrogenated  amorphous silicon, using density functional molecular  dynamics on large cells (4) the AC and also estimates of DC  conductivity for intrinsic and doped systems, using Kubo  formula, followed by comparisons to experiments.  These  calculations are also expected to lead to advancements in  computational algorithms using local basis approaches, i.e.  those designed specifically for semiconductors and  insulators.  %%%  This grant, to a young PI,  is to support research on the  electronic properties of amorphous silicon and related  materials.  The research uses state of the art techniques to  conduct complex, microscopic calculations for the energies  of electrons and also the resistance.  The latter can be  calculated for both an applied DC field and an applied AC  field.  The project also includes temperature effects.  The  benefits of this project are to a detailed understanding of  the microscopic properties of doped and disordered  semiconductors, used in a multitude of devices, as well as  to some insight in to possible ways to improve the  algorithms for these calculations.  ***",
