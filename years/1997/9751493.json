 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computing technology has rapidly evolved from a focus on the single workstation to a focus on shared resources over an intranet or the Internet.  The Computer Information Systems (CIS) and the Engineering Departments are struggling to keep pace with these rapid shifts in computing technology.  A critical need, as pointed out by advisory groups, is to develop skills for software technicians such that they can productively function in environments requiring visual, event driven, distributed, object-oriented computing (VEDOC) solutions.  Teaching focus toward this end is moving rather slowly, largely inhibited by obsolete or inadequate equipment.  This project is designed to develop the computing hardware/software and curricular revisions necessary to train students in cross-platform hardware and VEDOC environments.    This project is based upon X-Window GUIs, Linux operating system, and Tcl/Tk.  These software tools are freely available and have already been implemented.  Underlying hardware is to be developed and curricula revised to meet project objectives.  Java is deployed in a later stage of curricula development.    Undergraduate students seeking the M.S. degree (a software technicians degree) through the CIS Department, undergraduate students seeking the A.S. Engineering Computer Science transfer degree, and students retraining are affected by this project.  *",
