 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617487  Emerson       Organic carbon export from the euphotic zone of the  ocean regulates the CO2 content of the atmosphere and  controls the redox balance in ocean chemistry on millenial  time scales.  One of the fundamental goals of oceanography  is to evaluate the organic carbon flux and determine the  controlling mechanisms so that system can be modeled well  enough to predict responses to changes in forcing.  Recent  estimates of carbon export by a variety of methods at the  U.S. JGOFS time-series stations indicate that the  subtropical oceans are responsible for 25-50 percent of the  global ocean new production.  Progress in estimating the  rate of new carbon export from the euphotic zone in the  subtropical north Pacific Ocean now require knowledge of the  mechanisms(s) controlling the supply rate of nutrients.  Suggestions of diapycnal mixing, horizontal transport of  dissolved organic matter, and various biological processes  are currently being advanced.  The implications of the  different mechanisms regarding the coupling of the  biological pump and ocean circulation are obvious and hold  extremely important consequences for our understanding of  the response of the ocean's \"biological pump\" to physical  forcing.        This study is designed to test the hypothesis that the  mechanism supplying nutrients to the euphotic zone in the  subtropical north Pacific is diapycnal transport.  Focus  will be on two main problems:  (1) the role of intermittent  transport in supplying nutrients necessary to create the  shallow oxygen maximum, and (2) the utility of inert gases  as tracers of diapycnal transport in the upper ocean.  A  fully instrumented deep-sea mooring will soon be deployed at  the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) and can be used to make  continuous measurements of oxygen and total gas pressure on  the mooring to determine whether formation of the shallow O2  maximum is correlated to short-term intermittent supply of  nutrients from below.  ***",
