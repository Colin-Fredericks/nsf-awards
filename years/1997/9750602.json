 "awd_abstract_narration": "The university's previous general chemistry laboratories suffer from a lack of modern equipment.  Laboratories are not tailored to the needs of students.  Standard texts in use employ the experimental recipe book approach.  Students perceive the experiments as uninteresting and irrelevant to their lives.  Laboratories reinforce lecture but do not presage lecture to spark student interest in discovery and the scientific method.  Workplace competency issues are not emphasized.    A pilot project to remedy these problems through the incorporation of computer-controlled data acquisition instrumentation is coupled with innovative collaborative exploration experiments.  The new laboratory curriculum is structured to introduce concepts that are more fully developed in subsequent lecture.  Collaborative learning projects where students use shared computer collected data across a local Intranet compose the principal laboratory effort.  Experiments are presented using a variety of contextual relevance and include digitized video images to supplement and enhance the traditional student hands-on laboratory experience.  An ultimate goal, upon extension of the pilot project, is the creation of a laboratory text and accompanying software tailored to the needs of students.  The student population is 23 percent Hispanic and 2 percent other minorities.  A typical general chemistry class may have over 60 percent biology majors.    Students actually perform experiments based on traditional topics; however, they explore and discover, guided and facilitated by the technology and their peer groups.  This laboratory-directed approach employs computerized data acquisition instrumentation and student team collaboration and holds promise for solving the Nation's science education problems.  *",
