 "awd_abstract_narration": "If you spend some time watching the checkout lines at a  supermarket, you quickly find that the number of people queued up  in each line is roughly the same. At peak times, you may find  five or six people in a line waiting to check out.  At slower  times, lines have only two or three waiting.  There is no fixed  rule governing this pattern.  Instead, the \"structure\" emerges  from other basic facts about the goals and behavior of shoppers  and supermarket managers. This simple idea of emergence through  constraint satisfaction is currently being invoked as a central  explanatory mechanism in many areas of cognitive science and  neuroscience. The current proposal focuses on an exploration of  the use of this concept in the study of language learning and  language processing.    Emergentist accounts have been formulated for a wide variety of  linguistic phenomena, ranging from segmental inventories, stress  patterns, phonotactic constraints, morphophonological  alternations, lexical structures, pidginization, second language  learning, historical change, on-line phrase attachment, and  rhetorical structures.  Formalisms that have been used to analyze  the emergent nature of these forms include connectionist  networks, dynamic systems theory, neuronal competition models,  classifier systems, production-system architectures, Bayesian  models, Optimality Theory, principles-and-parameters theory,  corpora studies, and discourse-contextual analysis. It is  remarkable that approaches as apparently divergent as  functionalist linguistics and principles-and-parameters theory  seem to nonetheless share some common ground in terms of a mutual  interest in emergentist accounts of both learning and processing.    The specific aim of this proposal is to advance our understanding  of these pivotal issues by hosting a symposium in which  researchers from these various perspectives come together to  share their findings, ideas, aspirations, and concerns.  In  particular, the symposium is designed to:  1. draw att ention to the notion of \"emergence\" as a theme  underlying some of the most exciting new work in linguistics and  psycholinguistics,  2.   explore more fully the ways in which emergentist views  provide truly new answers to old questions, as opposed to  repackagings of old answers,  3. consider ways in which isolated emergentist accounts can be  linked into a larger emergentist conceptual framework, and  4. examine ways in which an emergentist framework may serve to  overcome or neutralize certain unresolved issues remaining from  earlier periods in the development of linguistic and  psycholinguistic theory.",
