 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores methods and techniques for a design and simulation  environment with the target application being high performance and high frequency  communication circuits. Within the simulation environment a designer will have  access to a suite of models of varying accuracy and to analysis capabilities that  address the needs of high frequency design.  The analysis capabilities include  periodic-steady state solution for  RF circuits, calculation of noise and  distortion in the periodic-steady state, substrate coupling and electrothermal  interactions. The research is partitioned into three areas: (i) development of  new analysis capabilities for an integrated device-circuit- behavioral simulation  environment;  (ii) improvement of simulator performance so that it is valuable  to  designers of high performance and/or high frequency analog circuits,  and  (iii) application of the simulator to realistic design problems with  particular  emphasis on RFICs. A virtual lab environment is being developed to provide  students training in circuit/device simulation and tool development  with  applications to real life design examples.",
