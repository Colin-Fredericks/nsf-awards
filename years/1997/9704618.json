The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a three-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Yanni Zeng to work with Dr. Heinrich  Freistuhler at the Institut fur Mathematik in Aachen,  Germany.  An additional three months will be supported by  the University of Alabama at Birmingham.    Dr. Zeng will study shock wave stability.  She will  investigate a system which is a typical example of a broad  class of nonlinear partial differential equations that  together with the equation of state, determine the plane  waves of a conducting fluid in the presence of a magnetic  field. She will study the large time behavior of the  solution.  Dr. Freistuhler has expertise in the field of non-  strictly hyperbolic systems and Dr. Zeng's expertise is on  hyperbolic-parabolic systems.  Together they hope to solve  the shock wave stability for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)  equations and similar systems from physics, and achieve  their goal of qualitative analysis for such systems. ***",
