 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last decade has witnessed an explosion in the understanding of vertebrate nervous system development, largely based on work from a few models of genetic organisms.  Developmental and genetic research on the nervous system on the newest of these models, the embryonic zebrafish, began at the University of Oregon.  International interest in this organism has grown tremendously, primarily based on the success of the university's Institute of Neuroscience  research program demonstrating that zebrafish studies provide new insights in the cellular, molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying vertebrate nervous system development.  Current facilities have posed a threat to the success of the Institute's research program in isolating zebrafish mutations affecting developmental processes. The shortage of functional and efficiently organized space impairs the Department's ability to conduct research and accommodate numerous graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and visiting scientists seeking advanced training.  Funding provided by the ARI Program will be used to upgrade electrical, plumbing and mechanical systems, upgrade the facility's current flow-through water system to a recirculating water system and  install an anechoic chamber. Consolidation and modification of facilities will increase the carrying capacity of the facility, allowing for the maintenance of all mutant lines.  This project will have an impact on the Department's ability to develop a more diverse body of research personnel as well as maintain its leadership role in zebrafish research.",
