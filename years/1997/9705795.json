 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705795  Donoghue et al.  This project will inventory plant and fungal diversity in western Sichuan and eastern Xizang (Tibet) provinces of China. This area is one of extreme topographic complexity caused by  the parallel, very deep valleys of the major rivers that drain the Asian plateau. Lower elevations of the region are characterized by tropical forests, while higher elevations are dominated by conifers and alpine vegetation. Preliminary work has shown that vascular plant diversity in this area is far greater than in any other region of comparable size in the Earth's temperate zones.  It is reasonable to hypothesize that high levels of diversity will also be found among the non-vascular plants and fungi, although current knowledge of these groups is very poor for this region.  Expeditions to collect plants and fungi will be undertaken in 1997, 1998, and 1999; these will be in close collaboration with Chinese colleagues from Beijing and the Chengdu Institute of Biology in Sichuan.  Spciemens will be distributed to relevant institutions within and outside of China, and will be made available particularly quickly to experts in various groups.  The specimen data will be made available electronically, as quickly as it can be provided via the WWW.  This project is funded as a partnership among the International Programs and Biotic Surveys & Inventories Program of the NSF, Harvard University, the Chengdu Institute and other Chinese institutions and agencies, and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh. Through the course of the project, both American and Chinese students will be trained and have the opportunity for international travel and collaboration.  In addition, this project will establish long-term collaborative edforts to assess the biodiversity of China.",
