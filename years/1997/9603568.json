 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9603568  Light           Water flows freely across the plasma membrane, so any  changes in extracellular or intracellular composition that alter  the thermodynamic equilibrium will elicit movement of water, and  change cell volume.  Since animal cells cannot maintain  hydrostatic pressure gradients across their membranes, they would  quickly lyse without the operation of compensatory mechanisms  that limit cell swelling.  Exposure of animal cells to a  hypotonic solution results in an initial increase in cell size,  followed by a slower, spontaneous regulatory volume decrease  (RVD) close to the original size.  This compensatory response  results from a swelling-induced increase in membrane permeability  to intracellular solutes, thereby decreasing the driving force  for water influx.  Although the general features of RVD have been  described, the details of the cellular mechanisms that underlie  this process, especially the regulation of ion channels, are  largely unknown.  The specific objectives of this grant are to  characterize the properties and regulation of potassium channels  involved with RVD, and to examine the signal transduction and  intracellular mechanisms that regulate RVD.  These studies will  be done on the Necturus maculosus (mud puppy) red blood cells.  These cells have a great ability to regulate their volume in  hypotonic media, and this process depends on ion channels and  intracellular messengers.  Osmotic fragility and cell volume will  be measured, and ion channels will be studied by the patch clamp  technique.  These studies will increase our understanding of the  transduction step between cell swelling and ion efflux, and  provide insight on the properties and regulation of ion channels  used for RVD.         Since cell membranes are freely permeable to water,  they need to regulate their volume in dilute solutions.  When  exposed to large volumes of water or very dilute solutions cell  show an initial increase in cell size, and then a regulatory  volume dec rease (RVD) to their original size.  This grant will  study the mechanism of this process, by studying the regulation  of ion channels involved.          ***",
