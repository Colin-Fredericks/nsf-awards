 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides some travel, publicity, and publication support for a conference to advance international understanding of the implications of changing interactions among universities, industries and government in support for research.  Conference activities will take place in New York City and in Purchase, New York.  The New York Academy of Sciences (NYAS) is a co-organizer of the conference, and the Science Policy Association of NYAS is organizing a special session on problems of university-industry-government relations in metropolitan regions like New York City, London, Paris and Tokyo.  The award broadens student and speaker participation and publicity for and outreach from this activity.  It provides visibility and stimulus for this research area among U.S. researchers, an important follow-up and follow-on to the first conference, which was held in Amsterdam in January 1996.  Results should help to structure research topics in this area and provide background information to assist decision makers concerned to evaluate the implications of  business-university-industry relations for research and for economic development.  Publication plans also help to assure broad dissemination to an influential and interdisciplinary audience.",
