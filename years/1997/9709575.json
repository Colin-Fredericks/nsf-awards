 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Ezra of Cornell University is being supported by the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to continue his work on   the theoretical investigation of chemical dynamics.  Specifically the   project is a computational study whereby complex high lying vibrational   states are investigated by quantum, classical and semiclassical methods.    During this next grant period he will investigate the dynamics of   ion-molecule  collisions, with particular emphasis on the formation and   decay of  long lived collision complexes.  This research will also focus   on the  development of semiclassical periodic orbit theory as an aid in   the interpretation of molecular vibrational spectra which are of   sufficiently high energy that they lie beyond the regime of traditional   spectroscopic techniques.   These topic address several fundamental   problems in chemical and molecular physics namely the fate of energy   distribution of long lived molecular complexes and statistical versus   non-statistical  behavior in the unimolecular decay of transient species.   During the following two years Prof. Ezra will be concerned with the   theoretical analysis of the internal motions in molecules, as they   vibrate, rotate, and collide with one another. The study of these   patterns of nuclear motion leads to a deeper understanding of the factors   that determine the propensity of molecules to undergo reaction under   given conditions.  This research group will be studying a number of   topics relevant to this general theme.  First, they will investigate the   nature of the ``sticky'' collisions that can occur between charged   species and uncharged molecules in, for example, reactions of atmospheric   importance.  Such sticky collisions are often essential for subsequent   chemical reaction to occur.  Another major topic is the development of   methods that enable the nature of nuclear motions within molecules to be   inferred in a fairly direct way from molecular vibrational spectra.  Much   of this work exploits semiclassical ideas: that is, theories that are   correct with respect to quantum mechanics, while retaining the intuitive   appeal of classical ball-and-spring pictures of nuclear motion.  Periodic   classical motions of nuclei, those that repeat over and over ad   infinitum, are found to play an important role in understanding the   connection between spectra and nuclear dynamics.",
