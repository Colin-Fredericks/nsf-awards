The two classes are the  `312' and the `H-phase' (M3BC2 and M2BX, respectively, where  M is a transition metal, B is a group B-element such as Si,  Al, Ge, Sn, Pb, In, Ga,  and X is either carbon or  nitrogen).  Both classes have layered hexagonal structures,  with alternating close-packed layers of the B-group elements  and transition metal carbides (or nitrides).  These  materials were first identified in the late sixties, but  then were ignored until recent preliminary work by the PI  and his group showed that they had unusual properties.  They  have high thermal and electrical conductivity, are not  susceptible to thermal shock, and are machinable like  metals.  Like ceramics, they are refractory and oxidation  resistant.  Fully dense, single phase, bulk samples of a  variety of compositions will be fabricated and characterized  to determine the  elastic, thermal, and electrical  properties of these compounds as a function to temperature  and anisotropy.  The objective of the research is to better  understand the nature of the bonding in these compounds,  especially that between the B-group elements and the  transition metal carbide or nitride layers.  %%%  These two new classes of ceramics will be examined for their  physical properties.

They have high thermal and  electrical conductivity, are not susceptible to thermal  shock, and are machinable like metals.  Like ceramics, they  are refractory and oxidation resistant.  These materials  have a variety of potential structural and functional  applications.  ***",
