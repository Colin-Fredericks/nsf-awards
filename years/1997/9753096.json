While bulk aerogels have been studied extensively, thin film aerogels  have not been studied to any significant extent, and promise significant impact in a number of electrical and thermal applications.  In this study, Prof. Broadbridge will focus on the application of thin-film silica aerogels as low-k interlayer dielectrics with potential utilisation in intergrated circuit technology.  The PI will engage in a collaborative research endeavor at Trinity College and Brown University.  Funding provided will impact students at Trinity College, exposing undergraduates to the challenges of state-of-the-art engineering research endeavors.  This funding is also expected to provide Dr. Broadbridge with opportunity to forge a long-lasting research relationship with Brown University, thereby allowing her to establish a significant integrated research and education program.",
