 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723899  Eldon    The immune response is protection from invasion by a foreign organism.  Vertebrate and invertebrate immunity involve the rapid production of proteins which inactivate the invader.  The presence of the invader is detected usually by a receptor, and a signaling mechanism is required to transmit that information.  Cells of the immune system release cytokines or interleukins in response to their activation.  The interleukin receptor when activated induces a signal transduction cascade which activates a family of transcription factors known as NF-kB, which promote the synthesis of the proteins required for the immune response.  The interleukin R-NfkB pathway has been found in mammals as well as in Drosophila development and immunity.  The research in this grant will study the role of the IL-R-NFkB signal transduction cascade in Drosophila immunity by looking at the interactions among 18-Wheeler and Toll receptors and the NfkB transcriptions factors.  The 18 Wheeler receptors affects the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides and has sequence similarity with the interleukin receptor and the Toll receptor of Drosophila.  Attacin is the antimicrobial gene the transcription of which is dramatically reduced in 18 Wheeler mutants, so the attacin gene will be cloned and the regions essential for its regulation will be identified.  Regions in the cytoplasmic domain be identified of the 18 Wheeler receptor that are critical for signaling will be indentified, and the relation of 18 Wheeler activity to the nuclear import of NfkB transcription factors will also be examined.  This research will provide information about the immune system of insects and the immune response.  %%%    The immune response is an essential feature of all living organisms.  Similarities exist in the response of many organisms to infection.  This research will use the fruit fly, Drosophila melanagaster, to study how infection by bacteria results in the production of proteins that inactivate foreign deleterious substances.   ***",
