 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to educate undergraduate students in spatial analysis techniques through the development of an undergraduate spatial analysis computer laboratory that integrates remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and computer-aided design (CAD).   Civil and environmental engineering students are exposed to a broad array of information that can be spatially referenced, including transportation, planning, environmental, and geotechnical data.   As undergraduates, they generally address issues around these data within specific disciplines.   The fundamental goal of this laboratory is to provide students with the ability to interrelate issues and data across disciplines and to explore the affects that different disciplines have on one another.   For example, a group of students might evaluate the effects that run off from highways and parking facilities have on surrounding wetlands given varying soil conditions.   Not only does this type of problem emphasize cross-disciplinary analyses, it also fosters group-based active learning and critical thinking.  Basic GIS skills are introduced to students through carefully designed project-based laboratory exercises within existing courses.   A new spatial analysis course specifically educates students in critical thinking across disciplines.   Advanced instruction is encouraged through independent study and undergraduate research opportunities.   With the maturing of desktop GIS, spatial analysis is becoming a standard tool for many engineering disciplines and entry-level engineers are expected to have a working knowledge of this technology.",
