Mifflin   Abstract for DMS-9703952            Abstract for Space Decomposition Methods in Nonsmooth Optimization        The proposed research concerns developing theory and methods for implicitly    combining polyhedral and quadratic approximation to produce a rapidly    convergent algorithm for minimizing a nonsmooth function of many variables.    The idea is to use a bundle method to determine a so-called VU-space    decomposition such that on V-space the cutting-plane aspect of bundling works    fast and on U-space a quasi-Newton approximation of a Hessian of a     U-Lagrangian can be employed. Such methods can be used to solve large or     complicated optimization models via separation of variables or constraints.    For example, a water pressure control problem of finding values for flow    rates and pump pressure gaps to minimize pumping cost subject to maintaining    water pressures in allowable ranges at all points in a pipe network can be    solved via separation of the variables. If the flow rates are fixed then the    subproblem of finding optimal values for the pressure gaps is an easy-to-    solve linear minimization problem. With this approach the outer problem of    finding optimal values for the flow variables is a nonsmooth problem whose    solution can be found efficiently via the techniques to be developed.      The computational methods proposed for development are significant because    they can be applied in many practical decision-making situations. These    include decomposition of large or complicated models such as those occurring    in allocation of scarce resources, traffic assignment, manufacturing,    structural engineering, logistics and strategic planning. The pipe network    problem in the first paragraph is an important example occurring in civil    infrastructure design. It illustrates the need to make trade-off decisions    when considering conflicting design criteria such as simultaneously having    high reliability and low cost. Another area of applica tion is in power system    planning subject to environmental protection constraints. These decision    models will increase in importance as deregulation of the energy supply    sector takes effect. These problems naturally decompose into higher level    problems of deciding which types and sizes of power generation plants to    build and lower level problems of deciding how best to operate the various    units to meet daily energy demand. Additionally, this research fits in well    with ongoing efforts in high-performance computing, because its methods    will utilize parallel processing to solve larger or more complex decision-    making problems than are currently possible to solve.",
