 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707160  Khan  Aqueous solutions of galactomannan-based natural polymers  are used extensively as hydraulic fracturing fluids to  enhance productivity from gas and oil wells.  Chemical or  enzymatic hydrolysis of the galactomannan polymers is  necessary to remove the polymer residue and open the  fracture for oil or gas flow.  For environmental and  processing reasons, the use of hemicellulosic enzymes has  become the preferred route for hydrolysis.  However, little  is known about the mechanisms by which these enzymes  hydrolyze galactomannans or about the relationship among  biocatalysis, physical chemistry, and rheology of these  systems.  The objectives of this collaborative study are to  understand the physical chemistry and rheology of existing  and proposed polymeric fracturing solutions during enzymatic  hydrolysis at high temperatures.  Results are to produce a  new generation of stimulation fluids that would increase  accessible oil and gas reserves, demonstrate the  technological utility of a new class or thermostable and  thermoactive enzymes, and provide a fundamental  understanding of the kinetics and mechanism of hydrolysis of  galactomannan solutions and gels.  ***",
