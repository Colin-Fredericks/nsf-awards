The Water Center engages faculty and students from Engineering, Natural Resources, and Agriculture in multidisciplinary research approaches to water resources issues.  Fifteen rising seniors will be recruited each year from CSU and five collaborating Colorado public institutions.  The selected collaborating institutions have relatively large ethnic minority populations, many first-generation college students, and limited research opportunities.  We seek a cadre of students with a broad mix of disciplinary interests along with gender and ethnic diversity.  For the 8 week summer program, each student will work with a faculty mentor, commonly as a member of an established research group, and complete an independent research project.  Students will be housed together in CSU dorms and will participate in regular group activities.  These include a four-part ethics workshop, evening seminars, computer simulations, role-playing exercises, and field excursions, all designed to illustrate the scientific, sociologic, and economic complexity of water resource issues.  Near the end of the summer program, students will submit a written report and present their work in a closing symposium.  Each student will be invited to return to CSU in the Fall to participate in the Water Center Student Symposium, and again in the Spring to attend Hydrology Days, an annual CSU-sponsored, week-long professional conference.  Students will be encouraged to continue their work during the academic year, expanding it to a senior thesis, and presenting results at either the Fall Symposium or Hydrology Days.  Faculty contacts have been established at each of the 5 collaborating institutions to provide local support for non-CSU participants.  ***",
