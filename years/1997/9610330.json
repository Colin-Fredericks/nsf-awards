 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dawson  9610330  The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been a favored organism for the study of meiotic chromosome behavior because of its genetic tractability.  Its primary deficiency as an organism for studying meiosis is that its chromosomes are very small and their behavior can not be observed in meiotic cells.  The goal of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research is to develop a novel system that could allow the visualization chromosomes in living meiotic yeast cells.  The system would be based on the binding of green fluorescent protein hybrid molecules to sites placed on specific chromosomes.  Current understanding of the behavior of meiotic chromosomes has been gleaned primarily by a combination of genetic and cell biological studies.  Often these studies have been performed in different organisms.  For example, yeast has lent itself well to genetic studies while plants and insects, because their chromosomes can be visualized in living cells with a light microscope, have provided cell biologists with invaluable insights.  The coupling of these approaches would be especially powerful because it would permit the visualization of chromosome behavior in mutants known by genetic analysis to be defective in aspects of meiotic chromosome segregation (pairing, recombination, synaptonemal complex formation, spindle assembly and chromosome movement).  In the past decade a large collection of yeast mutants with meiotic defects have been identified.  The development of a system for viewing chromosome behavior in these mutants and wild type cells would have a tremendous impact on our understanding of the manner in which proper chromosome behavior is established, a process essential to all sexually reproducing higher organisms.",
