 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710587  Serrano  This is an award to support research on the role of transient  factors that affect the flow and dispersion of contaminants in  contaminated aquifers.  The investigator plans to consider  factors that are normally excluded in formulation of mathematical  expressions to describe contaminant dispersion.  The factors that  will be considered include assumption that the formation is  subjected to recharge, the water table is unstable, boundary  conditions are not negligible and fluctuations as well as  normality of hydraulic conductivity are affected by dispersion  especially as they relate to contaminant penetration of the  saturated from the unsaturated zone by contaminants from non  point sources.    Results of this project are expected to improve our understanding  of the variability of large-scale contaminant dispersion in  aquifers attributable to many conditions not now capable of being  considered by existing mathematical formulations.  This knowledge  may be directly applied to engineering design of systems for  decontamination of groundwater already contaminated and may also  have applicability to considering prevention of the pollution of  aquifers by contaminants from nonpoint sources.  ***",
