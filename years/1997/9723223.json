 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will plan the development of a biological database for  the genus Peromyscus (deer mice and 55 allied species). Mice of the  genus Peromyscus are extremely abundant throughout North America  and are widely used in pure and applied research. Research areas in  which Peromyscus is commonly used includes ecology, genetics,  systematics, evolution, behavior, physiology, metabolism,  parasitology, epidemiology, and toxicology. Currently there is no  comprehensive database for this significant group of organisms,  although more than 3500 journal articles have been published and  several hundred investigators currently use peromyscines in their  research. The database envisioned, although including genetics, is  expected to contain a broad range of information concerning many  aspects of the biology of these rodents. This database, therefore,  will differ substantially from the several mammalian genomic  databases currently accessible. The long-range objective is to have  about eight or nine topical components of the database up to date  and readily accessible on the Internet.         The Peromyscus Data Base (PDB) will be developed and operated  through the Department of Computer Science and the Department of  Biological Sciences, Peromyscus Genetic Stock Center, of the  University of South Carolina at Columbia. Other institutions may  become involved as planning progresses. Several existing free-  standing databases will be incorporated into the overall database.",
