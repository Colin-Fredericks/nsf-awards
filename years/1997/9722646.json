 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722646  Nagel    This renewal project contains a series of experiments concerning the  dynamics  in  supercooled  liquids.  In particular,  an  extension  of  dielectric  spectroscopy will be implemented so that an investigation of  \"strong\"  glass  formers  can be made possible.  A study of ordered materials  will  be  carried  out to see if they have the same complex response as has been observed  in  their disordered counterparts.  Finally, there will be a study of the  low-angle scattering from glass-forming liquids in order to search for  clustering effects.  In addition, experiments on pattern formation are proposed.  There  will  be a continuation of earlier photographic and simulation studies  that  probe the interface near where a single drop of liquid splits into two  separate  pieces.  In addition there will be an investigation  of  the  shape  of  the  fluid in the presence of an intense electric field.   Finally  there  will  be  a  study  of  the problem of contact line  sedimentation,  a  phenomenon  which  occurs whenever a partially wetting drop of liquid dries  on  a  surface.  %%%  This renewal project contains a series of experiments concerning the  mechanism  by  which a liquid becomes increasingly more  resistant  to  flow as  it is cooled.  If cooled sufficiently, it will form a glass where the  molecular  motion is highly constrained.  We will study the  molecular  motion  in a variety of liquids and disordered solids to understand this  glass-formation  phenomenon.  These studies  will  include  electronic  probes of  the behavior as well as the use of neutron and synchrotron sources.  In addition, experiments are proposed to investigate how pattern  formation  occurs in technologically important situations using  high-  speed  photography  and numerical simulations.  One situation  that  will  be  studied  is  how a drop of liquid splits into more than one piece.  There  will  also  be  an  investigation of the shape of the fluid in the presence of  an  intense  electr ic field.  Finally there will be a study of the problem of  contact-line sedimentation, a phenomenon occurring whenever a drop of  liquid dries on a surface.  ***",
