The Ocean Studies   Board monitors the status and needs of ocean science   community and assists NSF in developing and maintaining   strong programs of ocean research responsive to scientific   opportunities and national interests. OSB will: 1)   contribute to the advancement of scientific understanding of   the ocean by maintaining continuous oversight of the health   of ocean sciences and stimulating their progress; 2) foster   the application of scientific knowledge to the use of the   ocean and its resources; 3)provide leadership for the   formulation of national and international marine policy and   to clarify scientific issues that affect ocean policy; and   4)address scientific issues involved in cooperative   international oceanographic research, and to improve   technical assistance. Several other agencies also contribute   to these activities and provide support for focused studies   undertaken by the OSB.",
