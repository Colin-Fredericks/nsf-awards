 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705017  Taksar    The proposed research lies within the area of optimal stochastic control.  It   deals with optimal control of diffusion processes by means of a free   boundary as well as optimal control at a reflection boundary of the   stochastic process.  This type of control naturally appears in the problems in   which there is no natural restriction on the rates of control and the optimal   control rates are infinite. (This type of control model serves also as a good   approximation for the situations when the rates are bounded but very large.)    The optimal policy is then to reflect the process from an a priori unknown   boundary. Natural models where such type of action arises are related to the    problems with additive input, where there are no a priori limits on the   control rates or as an approximation for the problems with optimal policy of   a \"bang-bang\" type. The proposed research consists of developing the   theory of the related PDE with gradient constraints, studying optimal   reflecting barriers in multidimensional cases, and applying the results to   different mechanical, manufacturing and financial models.    This research should provide a sound theoretical base for developing   optimal control algorithms for an automatic cruise control of a missile    subject to uncertain wind conditions or a space vehicle subject to small   perturbations in mechanical units. The developed technique will enable one   to calculate the position when the maximal correction force should be   applied as well as the optimal direction of this force. At the \"ground level\"   this theory will give a tool to derive optimal inventory levels for complex   flexible manufacturing systems as well as optimal timings for changes in   the  manufacturing processes. In the financial world this theory will provide   a method for finding optimal levels of funds for financial companies whose   assets are subject to random fluctuations. For example, in the case of a large   insurance company whose liquid assets  are constantly fluctuating due to   uncertainty in the times and amounts of incoming claims, it will be  possible   to calculate the optimal level of the reserve which should be maintained in   order to have the optimal balance between the risk and profit potential.",
