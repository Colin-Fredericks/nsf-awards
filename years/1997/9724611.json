 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carrington, Walter  9724611    Project Summary:         A plan is presented to develop hardware, algorithms and  software to enhance and extend the capabilities of the  digital imaging microscope (DIM),  an approach to 3-D  fluorescence microscopy which combines wide field microscopy  with high speed CCD cameras, fast focus change,  deconvolution algorithms and visualization and analysis  software.  The plan has been developed in response to the  limitations imposed on biological experiments by even the  most advanced current systems.  Enhancements to an existing  ultra-fast 3-D microscope will be implemented, including  increasing the number of high speed images that may be  obtained before slow readout is necessary.  New  computational methods for 3-D image  restoration(deconvolution) will be developed and tested that  use L^p smoothing with non-negativity to achieve a lateral  resolution of 75nm and axial resolution of 250nm.  New  software will be written to automate the calculation of a  sub-sampled point spread function used in this super-  resolution image restoration approach.  We will develop a  new parallel implemention of these algorithms on a single 4-  processor Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) Origin 200 computer  using SGI's software development tools.  Visualization tools  that increase 3-D rendering speeds by 100x using hardware  texture mapping on low end SGI 02 workstations will be  developed.  Finally, new methods for analyzing the  statistical significance of spatial and temporal patterns in  images will be developed.  A number of biological projects  will be carried out on this new instrument addressing key  problems which are not soluble by currently existing  instruments.  For example, the pathway through the cell that  glut4 glucose transporters take when they are sent to the  plasma membrane in response to insulin will be directly  visualized and the dynamics of assembly of centrosomal  proteins and consequences of assembly and disassembly during  the cell cycle for centros ome function will be determined.  Biologists and engineers will be trained in optical methods  and digital imaging microscopy through involvement in  biological projects and instrument development respectively.  The work we propose will enhance the sensitivity,  resolution, numerical accuracy and visualization and  analysis capabilities of the digital imaging fluorescence  microscope.  It will thus extend the range of questions that  biologists can answer with it.",
