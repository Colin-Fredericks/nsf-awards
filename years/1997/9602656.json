 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Memphis is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation of four research laboratories and two support facilities in the JM Smith Chemistry Building.  Built in 1966, research space, originally designated as teaching laboratories, has not undergone any repair since that time. Although the space is sufficient, it is insufficient in terms of quality space required for conducting modern chemical research. Existing labs will be renovated for research and research training in computational chemistry and experimental chemistry. Support areas will be  modernized for sample preparation and for housing spectroscopic equipment.  ARI funds, along with University matching funds, will be utilized to upgrade, replace or install fixed equipment to allow faculty and students to maximize the utility of the space.  Specific improvements include the upgrading of air-handling, communications, electrical, and plumbing systems.  A walk-in fume hood will be installed in one laboratory to maintain a safe working environment and permit a wider diversity of experiments to be performed.  Handicap access to labs will be enhanced as part of the renovations.  Research projects to be pursued once renovations are completed include: modeling of catalysis, environmental remediation, and advanced material synthesis using quantum and classical mechanical methods.  Improved infrastructure will support the development and application of new computational methods for modeling non-linear optical materials, and support research programs engaged in spectroscopic study of chemical systems of importance in catalysis and biology, respectively.  This project is consistent with the goals  of the Department, by permitting productive faculty and student researchers to maintain their current level of scholarly activity. Modernized facilities will enhance the research aims of a young and growing department, and accommodate for future growth.",
