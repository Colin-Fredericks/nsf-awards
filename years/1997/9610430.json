 "awd_abstract_narration": "Berkeley  The focus of this research is the preparation of phenylenes employing    methodology in which transition metals are used to assemble highly   energetic alkyne precursors which are then oligomerized to produce   phenylenes with linear, angular, C3-symmetric, circular, bent and zigzag   topologies.  Structurally significant  discoveries have included benzene   rings `devoid of aromaticity` and the observation of strong curvature.    Access to spherical and planar hydrocarbons as well as materials such as   carbon nets and graphitic `onions` is potentially available through this   approach. With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is   supporting the research of Dr. K. Peter C. Vollhardt of the Department of   Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.  Professor Vollhardt   will focus his work on preparing a class of novel benzenoid hydrocarbons   known as phenylenes.  The phenylenes contain structures in which fused   cyclobutadienes alternate with benzene rings to afford systems that have   potential as organic molecular magnetic and/or conducting materials, and   serve as precursors to a plethora of other novel classes of highly   energetic compounds with novel topologies.",
