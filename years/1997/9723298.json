 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feder  9723298         A major issue in ecological and evolutionary physiology is  the relationship among the traits of complex organisms, organisms'  ability to exploit diverse environments, and species' persistence  in time. The proposed investigation examines the heat-shock  protein Hsp70 in Drosophila to address this issue. In response to  heat or other stresses, nearly all organisms express heat-shock  proteins (Hsps), highly-conserved proteins that contribute to  stress tolerance by functioning as molecular chaperones. Research  supported by a previous NSF award has established that  experimental manipulation of copy number of the hsp70 gene of  Drosophila, which encodes Hsp70, is sufficient to cause changes in  thermotolerance. The proposed research will build upon this  finding to examine three related issues whose simultaneous  resolution is possible in few other systems: (1) The physiological  mechanism of Hsp70 function; i.e., how thermal stress disrupts  function and how Hsp70 protects against heat damage or aids  recovery from it. This issue will be examined in the larval gut of  Drosophila, which is especially susceptible to heat damage. (2)  The fitness consequences of Hsp70 expression, which will be  examined by comparing survival and offspring production when  Drosophila strains differing in Hsp70 expression are exposed to  natural thermal stress. (3) The evolutionary basis for variation  in Hsp70, which will be examined by measuring Hsp70 expression,  hsp70 copy number, and the temperature threshold for Hsp70  expression in natural and experimental populations. To accomplish  these goals, the proposed research will examine genetically  engineered and natural variation in Drosophila. The projected  outcome of the proposed research has immense potential to  integrate molecular, genetic, functional, and evolutionary  perspectives to advance understanding of adaptation.",
