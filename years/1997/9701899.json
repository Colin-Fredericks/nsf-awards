 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701899  Goldstein  This proposed research focuses on the consequences and implications of leaf level  nutrient limitation to photosynthesis, forest growth, and ecosystem processes caused by  nitrogen versus phosphorus, the two most widespread and important limiting nutrients. The researchers   propose to determine the consequences and implications of leaf level N versus P limitation  in a very well-defined and constrained age sequence of sites in the Hawaiian Islands. The  sites are all natural forests dominated by a single tree species, with remarkably constant  environmental conditions, along which experiments have demonstrated that N limits  production in young sites, and P limits the oldest site. Long-term fertilizer experiments  are ongoing in these sites, so we can evaluate both nutrient-limited plots and the  consequences of removing limitation by N or P. Results from this study will both augment and be integrated with investigations of belowground processes, stand-level characteristics, and ecosystem-level nutrient cycling to better understand tropical forest dynamics. Such information will have substantial implications for both the responsiveness of forests to change, and the restoration and management of forest ecosystems.",
