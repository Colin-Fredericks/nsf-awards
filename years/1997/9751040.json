 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) (aka x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) is one of the most developed and versatile of the modern surface analysis techniques and has unique capabilities beyond those of any instrumentation currently found in undergraduate science and engineering laboratories.  This technique is routinely used for the characterization of surface and subsurface layers and interfaces of a wide variety of materials, providing insight into their elemental composition, oxidation states, structure, and bonding.     Although ESCA is a well-established technique, used extensively in both academia and industry, few undergraduate programs teach the theory associated with it, and no institution has incorporated its use into undergraduate course-related laboratories.  In the past, all commercially available instruments were not only expensive ($500,000 and up), but were very temperamental and required extensive training to operate.  With the recent advent of lower cost ($200,000 range), user-friendly, instruments designed for on-line inspection, the feasibility of ESCA's becoming a routine teaching tool has been established.    The potential for utilization of ESCA by students (both chemists and engineers) is great.  Knowledge of this technique and its capabilities gives students an awareness of the types of analyses that are currently being performed, not only in industrial and academic research laboratories, but also on the floor of manufacturing facilities.  This project provides one ESCA spectrometer for use in the science and engineering curriculum.  ESCA experiments are incorporated into six chemistry, one physics, and two or more engineering laboratories.   *",
