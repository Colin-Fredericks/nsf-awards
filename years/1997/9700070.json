 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rewrite systems are sets of equations used to substitute equals  for equals from left-to-right only.  They have important  applications to programming languages, since they represent a  simple and intuitive functional language, and in automated  deduction, where they play an important role in improving the  efficiency of reasoning about equations.    Termination of a system means that the equations cannot be used  infinitely often, without reaching a term that does not contain  an instance of a left-handed side.  Proving termination can be  difficult.  (It is, of course, undecidable in general.)    Under past support, a number of methods for proving termination  were devised which have proved useful.  New aspects of this  subject are now being investigated with an emphasis on semantic  methods for structured (hierarchical) systems and extensions of  rewriting to handle conditional equalities, associative-  commutative functions, higher-order rewriting, and a logic  programming style.    Since establishing termination is an essential component of many  automated deduction and program verification systems, this  project will also invest effort in implementations.",
