 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing new InterSymbol Interference (ISI) and InterChannel  Interference (ICI) cancellation methods in communication systems by using  pre/post coding via nonmaximally decimated multirate filterbanks.  It will also  provide up to date information in ancillary areas via several undergraduate and  graduate courses.  These include digital communication systems, error control  coding, information theory and data compression, wireless digital communications,  and multirate filterbanks and wavelets.  It is of utmost importance that students  are well trained in the rapidly growing multimedia communications area.    It has been shown that any finite tap ISI that may have spectral-nulls (or  frequency-selective fading) characteristics can be eliminated completely by using  nonmaximally decimated finite impulse response multirate filterbanks in pre/post  coding.  Moreover it has been shown that the precoding may be independent of the  ISI channels and therefore feedback may not be necessary.  In this research, not  only the ISI but also random channel noise in communication systems is being  considered as a whole.  In particular, the multirate filterbank pre/post coding  for eliminating ISI, and the traditional error protection coding for correcting  random errors, are being combined to achieve better performance that existing  techniques.  This pre/post coding technique will also be applied to mitigate ICI  in multiple-user communication systems, such as wireless mobile communication  systems.",
