 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiple Imputation:  Research for the Third Decade    DMS-9705158    Donald B. Rubin and John Barnard   Harvard University     The third decade of multiple imputation begins with ever-growing   applications, even into areas not originally proposed  (e.g., environmental studies, chemistry), an increasing   availability of software, and an increasing amount of statistical   research work being conducted.  The expanded, almost routine, use   of multiple imputation means that many technical issues,   considered relatively minor in its early development, need   attention.  This research addresses several of the most important   issues, in particular:  (1) creating multiple imputations under   more general and flexible models; (2) creating \"nested\" multiple   imputations in data sets with large and highly variable fractions   of missing information; (3) using cross-match techniques to   analyze data sets having only a few multiple imputations but large   fractions of missing information, especially for obtaining valid   p-values; (4) analyzing data sets with nested multiple   imputations; and (5) conducting exploratory and diagnostic   analyses on multiply-imputed data sets.      Missing values are prevalent in many data sets and can be a  great hindrance in making inference.  Multiple imputation has   proven to be a useful mode of inference in the presence of missing   data.  The basic aim of multiple imputation is to allow users of   incomplete data sets, who typically have little information about   the missing-data mechanism, to reach valid statistical inferences   using only (1) standard complete-data analysis techniques and (2)   simple rules for combining the output of the complete-data   analyses.  Multiple imputation has been successfully used in many   contexts including in the social and economic sciences, the   history of science, and in biomedical applications.  This effort   extends the applicability and the ease of use of multiple   imputation, which enters its third decade where it  should become   an important tool in everyday statistical practice.",
