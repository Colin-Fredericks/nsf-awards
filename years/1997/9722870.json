 "awd_abstract_narration": "Walsh  9722870    This award will support five undergraduate engineering  students and two faculty advisors to travel to Japan to  participate in the International Robot Grand Prix hosted by  the Tokyo Institute of Technology and to visit Japanese  university, government and corporate laboratories which  conduct research on robotics.  Dr. Gregory Walsh of the  Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of  Maryland, is the principal investigator for this project.  He organized and taught a senior level mechatronic design  course in which students designed and constructed an  autonomous mobile robot that will be entered in the Grand  Prix.    Robotics, which is becoming an increasingly important  generic technology, is an area in which the Japanese excel.  This project will enable a group of highly motivated U.S.  engineering students to have focused technical interactions  with Japanese students and researchers working in this  important area.  It is expected that exposure to the  Japanese laboratories, together with the interaction and  exchange of ideas with their Japanese counterparts, will  enable the American participants to initiate beneficial  collaborative research activities.  ***",
