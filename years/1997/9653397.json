 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital signal processors, made possible through advances in  integrated circuits, have added a new element to the environment of  digital signal processing (DSP).  They have found their way into a  number of applications including communications and controls,  graphics, instrumentation, speech, and image processing.  These  processors are found in cellular phones, modems, automotive and  security/identification systems, noise cancelers, etc.  They have  emerged as a response to the ever-increasing number of real-time  DSP applications.    This workshop addresses the need to add or integrate DSP techniques  into courses such as Digital Signal Processing, Controls, Signals  and Systems, etc.  It will combine both the lecture and laboratory  components of DSP, with a special emphasis on the laboratory  component to provide the participants valuable hands-on  experiences.  While a theoretically oriented DSP course can be  found at a more convenient location to the participant, the  strength of this workshop is derived from its laboratory emphasis.  The faculty participants will implement a wide range of experiments  and mini-projects such as finite and infinite impulse response  filters, adaptive filters, and the fast Fourier transform using  both simulation and real-time techniques.  DSP tools and techniques  will be provided to the participants who will quickly realize how  software and hardware experiences can be used to motivate their  students.  They would then be able to integrate these software and  hardware experiences at their home institutions.",
