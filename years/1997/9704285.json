In the classical theory, PDOs are assumed to  have infinitely differentiable symbols. Although this is frequently the  case, the assumption about smoothness is very restrictive and does not  allow one to address important practical problems. Two cases where this  assumption is especially restrictive are as follows: limited-angle  local tomography and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)  with nonsmooth attenuation. Here one is interested in recovery of the  wave front of a distribution knowing only the result of applying a PDO  with nonsmooth symbol to that distribution. Known results on PDOs,  symbols of which have limited smoothness, do not apply because of  specific nature of the singularities of the occurring symbols. Main  objectives of the proposed research are as follows (1) To develop a  theory of certain classes of PDOs with nonsmooth symbols which occur in  tomography; (2) To develop algorithms for analysis of the limited-angle  tomographic data and SPECT data when the attenuation coefficient is not  smooth. In the case of the limited-angle data, our goal is to be able  to recover as much of the visible singularities with minimal  distortions as possible. This is especially important for the  singularities which are located close to the boundary of the visibility  range. In the case of SPECT, our goal is to demonstrate that local  tomography can be used in the case of nonsmooth attenuation; and (3) To  test the algorithms on numerical experiments.  Significance of the proposed research is twofold. First, the expected  results will advance our understanding of how PDOs with nonsmooth  symbols transform wave fronts of distributions. Second, the expected  results will help solve important practical problems. SPECT is a  popular tool for noninvasive medical imaging. It is  used in cerebral,  cardiac, and other kinds of medical imaging.  SPECT is based on  reconstructing distribution of  radionuclides inside a patient knowing  counts of photons emitted from the patient along different directions  on a plane. Depending on what kind of the radiopharmaceutical is used,  the distribution provides different types of medical information about  the patient.  The main difficulty in analyzing the SPECT data comes  from the fact that, in general, the photons emitted inside a patient  are attenuated in a complicated, nonuniform manner. In this case, no  inversion formula is known. Therefore, even though the photons are  attenuated nonuniformly inside the patient, practically all current  algorithms must assume  that the attenuation coefficient is either zero  or a constant. This results in attenuation artifacts, which remain a  significant obstacle in the analysis of SPECT images. Even most recent  approaches, that are based on the idea of local tomography and take  into account variable attenuation, fail to consider the case of  nonsmooth attenuation. Our results will provide for more accurate  quantitation of SPECT images even when the attenuation coefficient  varies from point to point and has discontinuities. It appears that our  study will be the first to investigate theoretically effects of  discontinuous attenuation on SPECT images.    Research related to limited-angle local tomography is of importance in  applications involving nondestructive evaluation of big pieces of  equipment, where a scanning device cannot be rotated 360 degrees around  the object.  Examples are scanning of exit cones of rockets located on  a gantry, jet engines, turbines, etc.",
