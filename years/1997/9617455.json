The    new heat flow instrument will be deployable from a surface ship,   and have the capability of transferring thermal flux data to the   ship in real time. Heat flow measurements at bare rock exposures   near mid-ocean ridge spreading centers have been shown to be   possible using a submersible, but these single-data-point   measurements are difficult to interpret, due to the variability   caused by sub-surface circulation of hydrothermal fluid. The   dense spatial coverage of heat flow data possible using the   proposed surface-ship deployable tool would allow us to move   beyond isolated single measurements. With a number of closely-  spaced heat flow stations at a ridge axis, it would be possible   to identify zones of diffuse fluid upwelling, make quantitative   estimates of the total heat of crustal formation in these areas,   and determine how this energy is partitioned between convection   and conduction. While there is uncertainty associated with the   development of a heat flow blanket that is 'surface-ship   deployable', the potential benefit of being able to answer these   long-standing scientific questions is substantial.",
