More specifically, this project will examine reports made by Mexican-American women to police, victim-witness advocates, attorneys, and counselors.  The research builds upon pioneering work on gender -related vi0lence and how it is talked about in institutional settings and advances the literature by analyzing the impact of culture on speaking about these topics.  It examines the differences in ethnolinguistic backgrounds of interlocutors and how these background characteristics may aggravate the difficulties of reporting incidents of sexual assault and domestic violence. The research will analyze narratives structurally to locate changes that occur with repeated tellings.  In addition , linguistic forms and the use of euphemistic speech will be indexed so potential misunderstandings in communication can be identified.  The research will have an applied as well as a theoretical impact.   %%%  This dissertation research will investigate empirically the narratives female survivors of sexual assault and of  domestic violence as told to institutional authorities, in order to discover how such narratives change over the multiple tellings required by reporting a crime.
