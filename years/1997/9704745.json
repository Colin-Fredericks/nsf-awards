 "awd_abstract_narration": "A. Gabrielov proposes to continue research in two closely related areas: the theory of subanalytic sets, with applications to quantifier elimination and simplification problems, and the theory of Pfaffian functions (analytic functions satisfying systems of Pfaffian differential equations with polynomial coefficients), with applications to o-minimality and computational complexity.  The goal of this research is to find an effective estimate of complexity of the ``quantifier simplification'' for expressions with Pfaffian functions, i.e., replacing an expression with existential and universal quantifiers by an equivalent expression without universal quantifiers.  This includes estimates of the complexity of different operations with semi- and sub-Pfaffian sets, such as the frontier, closure, stratification, and resolution of singularities.    Modern computer algebra qystems allow one to perform on a computer many operations with algebraic equations and inequalities previously considered the domain of abstract algebraic geometry.  The results can be applied to such practical problems as visualisation, robotics, and coding theory.  The complexity of computer codes performing these operations becomes a practically important problem. This complexity usually grows quickly with the degree of polynomials.  A new approach to reduce computational complexity lies in the Pfaffian theory studying a class of non-algebraic functions with global finiteness properties similar to the properties of algebraic functions.  The complexity of a polynomial considered as a Pfaffian function depends only on the number of its non-zero monomials (or, more generally, on the complexity of a formula representing this polynomial) independent of its degree.  Exponential and trigonometric functions, and many special functions, are Pfaffian, too. Thus Pfaffian methods, when applicable, allow one to produce fast computer codes for computations with simple algebraic, exponential and trigonometric formulas, possibly of a high degree.",
