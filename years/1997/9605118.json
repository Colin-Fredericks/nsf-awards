Site activities enhance an already strong academic-  year program in undergraduate research participation by  increasing the summer opportunities for students, many from  regional colleges in Oklahoma and beyond. The goals of the  program are to provide research opportunities in ecology,  physiology, and evolutionary biology for students at  regional schools which lack a research focus, enhance  opportunities for participation in scientific research for  members of under-represented groups, and strengthen the  summer research opportunities for University of Tulsa  students. The overall program formally involves a research  workshop, independent research projects, weekly group  meetings, invited speakers, and a research colloquium. The  research workshop introduces students to the philosophy and  mechanics of doing science, emphasizes the development of  skills in data a nalysis, and provides an interactive  framework for students to design individual projects.  Projects focus on areas of active research by faculty  mentors, including foraging ecology, microbial ecology,  animal reproduction, and algal physiology and evolution.          The current Site program builds upon successful  activities initiated under previous awards as well as a long-  standing commitment to undergraduate education and research  opportunities by the institution. An impressive record of  publications coauthored by undergraduate researchers and of  presentations at regional and national conferences attests  to the commitment and mentoring skills of the faculty.",
