This conference is held every three years and is an update of our understanding of smooth muscle structure and function.  New developments in molecular biology, patch clamping and imaging have contributed exciting new insights into mechanisms which control myofilament interaction, ion channel activity, Ca signaling and cell-cell communication. It is important to bring together experts in these fields to ask critical questions related to smooth muscle.  In addition to lectures, there will be poster presentation, and nine young investigators selected from those submitting poster abstracts will give short presentations in each of the sessions.  This conference will review recent progress in the field and permit extensive interaction between participants.  ***",
