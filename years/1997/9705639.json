 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705639    Ni    Professor Ni plans to continue his research in investigating  various diffusion related mechanisms mathematically.  A thorough  understanding of those phenomena and effects of diffusions will  enhance our ability in modelling more complicated or realistic  situations in applied sciences.  It seems that substantial  progress has been made in the last ten years, and the stage is set  for even more exciting mathematical breakthroughs, especially in  diffusion related pattern formation.  In this project, Professor  Ni will study the following three closely related aspects:    (I) Systems of semilinear diffusion equation    (II) Systems of self-diffusion and cross-diffusion equations    (III) Spike-layers (point condensation solutions) in                     diffusion/cross-diffusion systems.    The purpose of this project is not only to separately develop  these directions further, but to synthesize the results obtained  and to build a theory to give a systematic point of view in  understanding those \"concentration\" phenomena in differential  equations.    In an attempt to understand segregation phenomena in population  dynamics, in 1979 several Japanese scientists at Kyoto University  incorporated the notions of \"self-diffusion\" and \"cross-  diffusion\" into the classical Lotka-Volterra model for the  dynamics of two competing species.  In a slightly broader  context, these \"bio-diffusions\" could also be viewed as special  cases of combinations of random diffusion and taxis (i.e.  directed movements).  Chemotaxis would be another such example.   These have greatly enriched our diffusion-related models -- from  the celebrated \"diffusion-driven instability\" of A. Turing in  1952 to recently discovered \"diffusion-induced extinction\" and  \"diffusion-induced blowup\" -- and have therefore enhanced our  ability in modelling those biological and physical phenomena.   The research in this proposal would provide a first step toward  the understanding, in a mathematically rigorous manner, of t he  concentration/segregation effect of the various types of   \"bio-diffusions\" (namely, random, repulsive, and attractive)   as well as \"taxis\" (namely, positive and negative).",
