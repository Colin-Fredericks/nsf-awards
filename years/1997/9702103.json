 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) is of fundamental  importance in geometric computing, graphics, visualization,  robotics, and other disciplines.  This project is to develop  Physics-Based CAGD, a new interdisciplinary paradigm which  marries geometric modeling with computational physics.  The  objective of this project is to dramatically enhance the CAGD  process by creating advanced parametric and implicit geometric  models with highly intuitive behaviors that are governed by  physical principles. This project takes the following three-fold  approach to achieve its goal: (1) Continue the research endeavor  on Dynamic Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (D-NURBS); (2) Explore  and devise novel physics-based modeling techniques and algorithms  based on powerful new representations, including subdivision  wavelets, manifold splines, and implicit functions; and (3)  Exploit the theoretical advances of the earlier stages of this  project to develop an extensive set of efficient algorithms and  interactive software routines of Physics-Based CAGD for a wide  range of applications. This project is further augmented by the  following educational initiatives: (1) Develop new graduate and  undergraduate courses; (2) Write a textbook on Physics-Based  CAGD; (3) Promote and participate in interdisciplinary research  and education projects; (4) Produce highly trained personnel by  supervising graduate students, directing senior projects of  undergraduate students, participating in outreach and mentoring  programs, etc; and (5) Promote the rapid dissemination of Physics-  Based CAGD technology to national enterprise through  collaboration with the CAGD industry.    The results of this project will yield highly interactive CAGD  techniques. Furthermore, these research and education advances  will demonstrate that Physics-Based CAGD can serve as a unified  basis for various traditional design techniques.",
