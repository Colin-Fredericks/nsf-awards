 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will upgrade instrumentation in the Trace  Metals Laboratory at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories.  The  Trace Metals Lab of MLML has been a world leader in studies  of the role of metals in regulating primary production in  the ocean over large spatial and temporal scales.  Moss  Landing scientists have played a major part in developing  new analytical methods for trace elements in aquatic  systems.  They have also played a key role in making  freshwater chemists aware that there are significant  methodological errors in previous measurements of metals in  freshwater systems.  As a result, MLML has served as an  important center for training and development of analytical  methods for trace chemical analysis.  In the past 5 years,6  graduate students have finished MS degrees working with  Trace Metals Lab staff and instrumentation.  In addition,  there have been a number of visitors to the lab from the US  and overseas.",
