 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Puszynski    This is a study of the fundamentals of high-pressure synthesis of silicon-    nitride-based ceramics in a self-sustaining regime.  Aspects investigated     include particle-particle-gas interactions, product morphology, and phase     composition of combustion-synthesized ceramics.  The effort focuses on the     effects of combustion conditions and various additives, factors that may alter     crystal growth and the formation mechanisms of silicon-nitride-based     ceramics.  Quantitative data are obtained on the formation and crystal growth     of silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, sialon, and silicon carbide during self-    sustaining, high-pressure nitridation of silicon powders containing amounts of     oxides, nitrides, halogens, and/or carbon.  Models are developed to describe     the complex reaction and diffusion processes on a particle level during     formation of single-phase silicon nitride and other solid solutions.      Widespread application of advanced nitride ceramics is limited by high     synthesis and processing costs.  Combustion synthesis is an attractive method     for overcoming this obstacle.  Silicon-nitride-based ceramics are attractive for    many high-technology applications because of their chemical inertness, high-    temperature stability, fracture toughness and resistance to erosion, corrosion,     and thermal shock.",
