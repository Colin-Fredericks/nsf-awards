 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prof. Kelsey D. Cook of the University of Tennessee is supported by the   Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program as the Principal Investigator   for this  Research Opportunity Award (ROA).  This award enables visiting   faculty from institutions involved primarily in undergraduate education   to come to the Tennessee campus for a summer research experience in   analytical chemistry.  Important additional components of the program   include interactions with scientists at the Oak Ridge National   Laboratory, and an interface with summer undergraduate research programs   at Tennessee which can include students from the campus of the visiting   faculty member.  Among the goals are enhanced quality of undergraduate   education in chemistry at the visitors' home institutions, enhanced   student interest in careers in analytical chemistry, exchange of ideas   concerning teaching matters, and career-enhancing opportunities for   under-represented groups.  Visitors are able to participate in a research   project available from among a dozen research programs of faculty at   Tennessee and staff at Oak Ridge all of which are focused on various   aspects of analytical chemistry.  The main thrust of this project is focused on the scientific   infrastructure.  By providing a summer research experience for visiting   faculty from undergraduate institutions that  have not had a research   experience for their students, curriculum improvements at those   institutions can be encouraged and positive changes in the environment to   encourage students to pursue careers in chemistry result.",
