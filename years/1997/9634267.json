 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9634267  Daughton    This Small Business Innovation Research  (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate the integration of Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) isolation devices with control and power electronics, which will result in a high performance integrated solid state relay (SSR).  Current SSR technology suffers from several technical drawbacks, including large relative size, slow switching speeds, and wear-out mechanisms due mainly to the technical limitations of opto-isolation technology.  Opto-isolation construction precludes integration with power electronics, due to integrated circuit (IC) process incompatibility, is relatively slow, and can wear-out through light-emitting diode (LED) failure.  In addition to demonstrating a fully integrated device, Phase II will concentrate on power electronics research with the objective of reducing the relative size of the device for a given power level.  Phase II will continue the successful hybrid demonstrations of Phase 1.  The emphasis of Phase II will be on low voltage solid state relays having blocking voltages of less than 60 volts and on-current capacities of  1 ampere or less.   In addition, various contact resistance devices under 1 ohm will be pursued.    Commercial applications are expected in SSR, opto-isolator, and reed switch replacements for the computer, telecommunications, consumer electronics, and automotive industries.The complete integration of GMR-isolation, control, and optimized power electronics will allow the design of GMR-isolated SSRs which would be smaller, faster, and more reliable than existing opto-isolated SSRs, thus allowing SSRs to function in applications presently not suitable.    ***",
