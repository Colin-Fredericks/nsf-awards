 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619456  Traditional debuggers allow stepping along the forward execution  path of a computer program and monitoring the program's state as  it executes. They are a crucial tool in the process of program  development, however they also can be frustrating in many  situations when the user wishes to see not what the program is  going to do in the future, but rather what happened in the past  to bring it to where it currently is. This research will  investigate and develop algorithms and mechanisms that can be  used in constructing a bidirectional program debugger. Efficient  backwards movement algorithms will be investigated for all  traditional forward movement operations: step, next, finish, and  location breakpoints. The underlying techniques expected to be  utilized and developed in this research are code augmentation,  transparent re-execution, I/O replay, and checkpointing. In  addition, this research will investigate efficient bidirectional  algorithms for conditional breakpoints and data breakpoints,  which are currently often inefficient operations or unavailable  even in the forward direction. Debuggers are widely used from  introductory programming students trying to understand why their  program has gone astray, to professional programmers trying to  find bugs in large and complicated systems. Development of better  debugging tools will benefit all who are involved in program  development and maintenance.  ***",
