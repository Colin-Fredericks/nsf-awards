 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project examines the impact of new technologies of  information, communication, and computerization on the home life  and home-based work life of American families. It is a follow-up  study to a 1984-1986 study performed by the same researchers, and  an investigation of new areas that have resulted from the recent  emergence of new technologies. The project is unique because of  the longitudinal opportunity to compare current circumstance with  past situations.  The project will (1) develop and test a  theoretical model that gives the best understanding of household  adoption and use of new computing technologies and their  diffusion into various aspects of home life; (2) assess the  extent to which these new technologies have become available to  American homes, the nature of their use, and the types of  adopters and users; (3) study the impact of these technologies on  family life; (4) uncover what have been the significant changes  in uses and impacts that have occurred in the last 10 years; and  (5) uncover what are the perceptions of and possibilities for  social changes wrought by new computing technologies in the home.  The study will be based on a national sample of 600 households  with computers and 400 households without.",
