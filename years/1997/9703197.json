The Alliance will   emphasize a focused effort to increase directly the recruitment,  retention, graduation and graduate school placement of Blacks,  Hispanics, and Native Americans who are enrolled in the  undergraduate SEM degree programs at the participation  institutions.  Indirectly, enhancement elements of the project will  influence the persistence of students at all Alliance member  institutions.  The Alliance's influence will span from the pre-  freshman level to the enrollment of scholars in SEM graduate  programs.  Participants will be selected from biology, chemistry,  mathematics, physic and all engineering disciplines.  The FGAMP  Project has been a major coalescing force at the institutions  involved in Phase I of the venture.  Visibility has increased for  the institutions.  Student performance in their respective areas  has improved significantly.  A significant level of support has  been received from the Florida Legislature for support of the  Florida institutions.  Phase Ii of the FGAMP operation will build  on the successes of Phase I and will include greater involvement of  community colleges.  FGAMP institutional and industry partners are  expected to continue their support of the project through summer  internships.    The success of this project will be shared with other state and  regional institutions.",
