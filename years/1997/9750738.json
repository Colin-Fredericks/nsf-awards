 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on enhancing the quality of undergraduate education for electrical engineers by incorporating the most relevant demand areas in technology into the undergraduate curriculum. The explosive growth in fiber optics and optoelectronics is expected to create a huge demand for trained engineers in that area. To make students proficient with state-of-the-art technology, the project is developing two new laboratory courses in fiber optics and optoelectronics. These two laboratories complement the courses in fiber optical communications and semiconductor optoelectronic devices that are being planned for the near future.    These laboratories are providing hands-on experiments that illustrate fiber optics and optoelectronics principles and applications. The experiments are designed in such a way that the concepts from the classroom are reinforced in the laboratory. The experiments vary in difficulty from simple operations, such as handling and measuring the numerical aperture of a multi-mode fiber, to very advanced procedures such as coherent communications.    The implementation of the new laboratory courses also includes the incorporation of innovative teaching techniques such as active learning, team learning, and corporate learning into the laboratories.  *",
