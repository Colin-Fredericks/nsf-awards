North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas,  Oklahoma, and Arkansas have formed an alliance, with each  participating state committing non-federal matching funds to help  establish the GPN as a regional virtual community and provide  researchers in those states with access to high-bandwidth  networks and high performance computing capacity.  This important  research infrastructure will enhance research in a breadth of  basic and applied areas but the initial focus of the GPN is on a  central theme of Earth System Science.  The network is expected  to foster collaborations among researchers in the central plains  states and lead to recognition of this virtual community as a  center-of-excellence in spatial data analysis technologies  applied to the biospheric sciences.  The GNP will be governed by   an Advisory Committee of nationally recognized experts who will  provide guidance for the three functional teams - a Management  Team, a Technical Team, and an Earth System Science Team.  A  conference of the members of the Earth System Science Team and  other invitees is planned for 5-7 November 1997 at the EROS Data   Center, a U.S. Geological Survey facility in South Dakota.",
