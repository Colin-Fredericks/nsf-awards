The project will  focus on several complex variables, concentrating on the  subjects of meromorphic mappings and intrinsic metrics in  geometry.  The main focus will consist of a conference and  workshop that will provide lectures for students and talks  on current research by Japanese experts and resident  experts.  They will explore the relationship between  geometry of holomorphic mappings and the theory of complex  manifolds, by concentrating on the topics of Nevanlinna  theory, complex dynamics in several variables,  hyperbolicity, moduli of holomorphic mappings, and invariant  metrics.    This project would support part of the ongoing activities of  JAMI which has annually co-sponsored conferences with  visitors from Japan.  The three day workshop and four day  conference (held the same week) are expected to include 60-  70 participants.  Many of the participants will include  young investigators, post-doctoral researchers and graduate  students.  Results of these meetings should facilitate  interaction and collaboration between mathematicians working  on these related topics in the United States and Japan.  ***",
