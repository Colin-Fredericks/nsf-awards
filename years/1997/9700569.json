 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700569  Kelley       The principal investigator will continue his research program in the numerical  solution of large systems of nonlinear equations and bound constrained  optimization problems.  In the area of nonlinear equations the PI will  expand his recent work on nonlinear equations in two directions: (1) pseudo  transient continuation, a popular method for computing steady-state solutions  of certain problems in fluid mechanics and combustion, and (2) research into  termination criteria for nonlinear iterations with applications to the  method-of-lines solution of partial differential equations. The PI will also  continue his work on multilevel methods for compact fixed point problems.  In the area of bound constrained optimization in function spaces, the principal  investigator will continue his work on methods for bound constrained parabolic  control problems, begin a new project on preconditioners for bound  constrained problems in infinite dimension, and redesign his implicit  filtering code with a view toward applications in automotive engineering  and environmental monitoring. New algorithmic features will be added  to the code, the code will be ported to a parallel computer, and  theoretical questions related to the new algorithms will be addressed.  Such questions include detection of and escape from stagnation in  Nelder-Mead and related algorithms and convergence of quasi-Newton  methods in the presence of noise.    Many processes and models in engineering and science are expressed as nonlinear  equations. Numerical simulation of these processes requires the rapid and  accurate solution of these equations and a clear understanding of the methods  and their limitations. Simulation is then used in design and optimization  for manufacturing. The optimization problems that arise in industrial design  are often noisy because of measurement or simulation error. The principal  investigator will continue his work on the computational solution of  nonlinear equations and optimization p roblems. The work will consist of  study of algorithms, needed to ensure robustness and reliability of  simulations, implementation on distributed memory computers for rapid  turn around, and testing in the context of engineering applications.  Through the principal investigator's collaborations with scientists  and engineers in industry, national laboratories, and academia,  the work will be used in (a) environmental measurement and remediation,  (b) simulation, optimal design, and control in the aerospace industry,  and (c) optimal design in automotive engineering.",
