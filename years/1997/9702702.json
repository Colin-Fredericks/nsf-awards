It is a challenge to obtain controllers for systems with significant uncertainties, that would lead to achievement of good tracking and disturbance attenuation.  A realistic attempt to resolve this challenge calls for an adaptive control design that would learn from the system output to identify the underlying system and improve the control accuracy as learning progresses.    A prominent topic in adaptive control today is robust adaptive control, which deals with the design of controllers that are robust to model uncertainties, and insensitive to exogenous disturbances.  There are three general approaches to address the design and analysis of robust adaptive control systems: certainty-equivalence based adaptive control design, nonlinear design based adaptive control design, and worst-case adaptive control design.  The third approach was introduced very recently.  The main motivation for this approach has been the need to address the transient performance and system robustness of adaptive control systems simultaneously in a unified framework.  Identifying the correspondence between the objectives of H( optimal control with those of robust adaptive control, and the close relationship between H(optimal control and zero-sum dynamic games, this approach poses the adaptive control problem as a disturbance attenuation problem for nonlinear systems with imperfect state measurements.  A game-theoretic solution methodology of cost-to-come function has been developed to cope with this general problem.    In this proposal, we propose to broaden the third approach identified above to a more general setting, which we call \"optimality-guided robust adaptive control design.\" It is motivated by the established relationships between nonlinear H( optimal control, zero-sum dynamic game, risk-sensitive optimal control, risk-neutral optimal co ntrol, and stochastic dynamic game problems, and the similarity between their respective solutions.  These relationships suggest that the two most general problems, are the risk-sensitive optimal control problem, and the stochastic dynamic game problem.  If we can develop a general theory of existence, uniqueness, and characterization of a solution to the risk-sensitive optimal control problem, then we can reconstruct the solution to the zero-sum dynamic game problem with the large deviation limit, which in turn constitutes the solution to the nonlinear H( optimal control problem.  Also, we can reconstruct the solution to the risk-neutral problem by taking the limit as the risk-sensitivity parameter goes to zero.  On the other hand, a general theory of existence, uniqueness, and characterization of a solution to the stochastic dynamic game will offer a design solution to the nonlinear H( optimal control problem, as well as a design solution to the risk-neutral problem, as special cases.  The significance and relevance of these problems can be best illustrated by the immensely popular active noise cancellation applications, where the underlying system may be deterministic, stochastic, or mixed.    These research effort will yield fundamental advancement on the theoretical front for stochastic dynamic games with imperfect state measurement.  At the same time, they will yield novel robust adaptive control designs that are capable of handling both deterministic (worst-case) and stochastic disturbances.  The direct impact of this research on the practical applications lies in the immensely popular field of active noise cancellation, by offering robust adaptive control laws that have superb transient performance, and asymptotical tracking of any number of unmeasured sinusoidal exogenous disturbance inputs of unknown frequency.  On the education side, the research development and course innovation will contribute to the graduate curriculum, in terms of providing simple but comprehensive solutions to si gnificant engineering problems ill control systems.",
