 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614228  Morrissey  Pressure and seismic records are to be studied in order to determine their usefulness for monitoring activity at explosive volcanoes such as Sakurajima in Japan and those of the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. Eruptions at these volcanoes are classic examples of discrete,  explosive events that violently eject blocks of fragmented lava and generate pressure disturbances in the atmosphere.  Many of these eruptions are accompanied by shallow earthquakes (tremor episodes) lasting several minutes.  The source of the pressure disturbances and seismic events has been hypothesized to be related to the eruption but never demonstrated successfully. The intent of this project is to formulate a computer model that simulates the movement of high pressure fluid discharging from a volcano and the response of the volcano to the discharging fluid.  The results from these simulations will demonstrate how parts of pressure and seismic waveforms may be used to estimate  eruption pressures, gas and particle concentrations in the eruption cloud, and the  geometry and physical properties of the volcanic conduit.  Applications of the computer code include modelling the pressure and seismic disturbances recorded within several kilometers from active vents at Sakurajima volcano and several Alaskan volcanoes such as Iliamna and Pavlof.",
