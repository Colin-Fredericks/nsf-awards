The Autonomous Undersea Systems Institute has organized a  series of symposia focused on unmanned untethered  submersible technology.  The first Symposium was held in  1980 and the 10th in the series will be held September 7-10,  1997.  The symposium seeks to provide a mechanism for the  exchange of information among members of the research and  user community involved in the development of autonomous  underwater systems.  Technical papers are solicited and the  submitted abstracts are reviewed by active researchers  within the community.  Accepted papers are presented in an  informal atmosphere which encourages questions from  participants.  ***",
