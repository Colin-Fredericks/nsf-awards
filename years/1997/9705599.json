We now have the ability to   generate massive amounts of data from areas as diverse as satellite   imagery and the human genome project.  Computer hardware has progressed to   the point where data sets of a scale from hundreds of gigabytes to   terabytes can be stored, and data can be retrieved from them, but the   challenge of analysis and visualization has only just begun to be met.      This workshop will bring together scientists who generate massive data   sets in astrophysics, environmental science, geophysics, and other areas   and mathematical scientists from a broad array of backgrounds who can   develop methods to attack these problems.  The invitees will include   specialists in statistics, statistical computing, statistical graphics,   smooth and combinatorial optimization, computational geometry, databases,   and visualization, as well as astrophysics, geophysics, and environmental   science.     The product of this workshop will include not just a collection of papers   but also a white paper presenting an agenda for attacking these important   and salient problems.",
