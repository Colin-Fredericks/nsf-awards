 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  trend in electronic design is toward smaller, more powerful electronic  systems composed of many VLSI chips, and their design requires new automation  capabilities. This research is on the specific problem of modeling and  synthesizing electronic system level interconnect, and developing algorithms and  techniques that will be applicable to design automation of even broader systems.  The approach is to develop a general, but approximate, capability for modeling  inductive coupling of large scale system-level interconnect that is suitable for  front-end design. For example, the representation of inductance coupling as a  function of interconnect dimensions and spacing is being determined so that  performance vs. cost trade-off analysis can be obtained. Measures of interconnect  design goodness based on controlling the response damping, coupling noise, and  delay are being explored. Moreover, a general approach, which addresses the  complex problem of coupled lines, and includes a means of exploiting extraction  capabilities is being pursued. The results of this work will also be considered  for design automation of more general problems, such as electro-mechanical system  design.",
