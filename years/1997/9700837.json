 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bennett  9700837        This award provides funds for a project on the application of effective techniques from Diophantine approximation (principally Pade approximation to hypergeometric functions and the theory of linear forms in the logarithms of algebraic numbers) to various Diophantine problems. Specifically, Bennett intends to extend previous work on solutions of simultaneous Pell equations or, more generally, intersections of quadric surfaces, combining the aforementioned methods with recent work of Schlickewei and Wirsing and of Voutier. These results have a number of interesting applications to bounding the number of integer points or rational points of bounded height on certain classes of elliptic curves. They also lead to parameterized families of elliptic curves with rank at least two and, potentially, to families with rather higher rank. The PI also plans to extend these techniques to the problem of absolutely bounding the number of solutions to certain simultaneous decomposable ternary quadratic form equations and to bound the number of common values of recurrence sequences, as considered by Schlickewei and Schmidt. In the latter situation, one would hope for rather stronger bounds than those obtained by Schlickewei and Schmidt, though perhaps in less generality. In addition to the core program of research outlined above, the PI intends to pursue three additional problems. First, the PI will apply p-adic gap principles similar to those of Bombieri and Evertse to attack a conjecture about the function g(k) in Waring's problem. Second, the PI will continue his investigations of the hypergeometric method, with reference to improving known bounds upon solutions to the Ramanujan-Nagell and related polynomial-exponential equations and to cubic and quartic Thue equations. Finally, the PI intends to extend his joint work with N.P. Dummigan and T.D. Wooley on representations of integers by binary additive forms, to more general decomposable forms.        This research falls into the g eneral mathematical field of Number Theory. It concerns the solutions to algebraic equations in whole numbers and generalizations. Number theory is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century, it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems.",
