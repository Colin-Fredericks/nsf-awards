 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the   Division of Chemistry provides partial support to enable the   participation of eight to ten assistant professors and a similar number   of ACS Division of Analytical Chemistry graduate student award winners in   the 1997 Gordon Research Conference on Analytical Chemistry.  This   conference is entitled `Measurement Problems and Tools Arising from   Combinatorial Synthesis` and it focuses on the current and emerging   problems of doing analytical chemistry on enormous numbers of small   samples produced by this new approach to chemistry.  Much of the effort   in this area is presently resident in small venture capital companies and   this conference would expose bright, young analytical chemists from   academe to the opportunities in combinatorial chemistry.  This award enables participation of young analytical faculty and graduate   students in the 1997 Gordon Research Conference on Analytical Chemistry.    The focus is on analytical problems arising in the area of combinatorial   synthesis and the consequent explosive growth in the need for fast,   sensitive, and selective analysis of many, small samples.",
