Bank Department of Mathematics       University of California at San Diego         La Jolla, CA 92093    This proposal has two main components. First, we will study algebraic  hierarchical basis multigrid algorithms (HBMG/ILU).   These methods  solve sparse sets of linear equations arising from finite difference,  finite volume and finite element discretizations of partial  differential equations.  They are differentiated from classical HBMG  and MG methods in that they do not require a coarse grid and sequence  of mesh refinements.  This allows application to problems with  geometrically complex domains that require many elements just for the  geometric definition, and problems where the adaptivity comes from  moving the mesh points rather than from refinement.  Preliminary  numerical experiments indicate that the methods are potentially very  powerful and robust. The second component of the of proposal concerns  the continuing software development of the finite element program  PLTMG. Various versions of this program have been in the public domain  since the late 1970's, and it is widely used in education and research  environments.  PLTMG solves scalar, parameter dependent, nonlinear  elliptic PDE's in  general regions of the plane.  The principle  features are adaptive mesh generation, a posteriori error estimation,  HBMG (soon to be HBMG/ILU) iteration for linear systems of equations,  Newton's method for nonlinearities, and continuation for parameter  dependencies. The code also includes an initial mesh generator, a  skeleton generator, and several graphics routines. Although the name  PLTMG has remained the same, typically 80% or more of the package is  revised with each new release.    In many systems modeled by partial differential equations, the critical  phenomena occur only in a small part of the physical domain, and may  move as a function of time ( e.g. as a flame front). Even with the great  advances in hardware, it is not adequate to address difficult  grand-challenge class problems of this type using software based on  simple uniform meshes; the demands of the problem require that  computing resources be focused on the regions of most interest.  The  motivation for adaptive mesh algorithms is that the algorithm itself  can and should identify these critical regions and respond with an  appropriate mesh with little or no human intervention.  The ``brains''  of adaptive algorithms are a posterior error indicators, which both  estimate the current error, and indicate where additional resources  should be focused. The very nonuniform and unstructured meshes  resulting from adaptive algorithms require sophisticated methods, such  as multigrid or the proposed HBMG/ILU, to efficiently and reliably  solve the resulting systems of equations. Overall, this field provides  a mosaic of important and interrelated scientific questions ranging  from difficult problems in mathematical analysis to difficult  computational challenges in implementing these procedures on modern  computer architectures.",
