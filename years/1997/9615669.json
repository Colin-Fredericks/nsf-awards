The  Holocene is an important, but often overlooked, portion of the  Antarctic paleoclimatic record because natural variability in  Holocene climate on time scales of decades to millennia can be  evaluated as a model for our present \"interglacial\" world.  This  project builds on over ten years of prior investigation into the  depositional processes, productivity patterns and climate regime  of the Antarctic Peninsula.  This previous work identified key  locations that contain ultra-high resolution records of past  climatic variation.  These data indicate that solar cycles  operating on multi-century and millennial time scales are  important regulators of meltwater production and  paleoproductivity.  These marine records can be correlated with  ice core records in Greenland and Antarctica.    This project will focus on sediment dispersal patterns across the  Palmer Deep region.  The objective is to understand the present  links between the modern climatic and oceanographic systems and  sediment distribution.  In particular, additional information is  needed regarding the influence of sea ice on the distribution of  both biogenic and terrigenous sediment distribution.  Sediment  samples will be collected with a variety of grab sampling and  coring devices.  Analytical work will include carbon-14 dating of  surface sediments using accellerator mass spectrometry and  standard sedimentologic, micropaleontologic and magnetic  granulometric analyses.  This multiparameter approach is the most  effective way to extract the paleoclimatic signals contained in  the marine sediment cores.  Two additional objectives are the  deployment of sediment traps in front of the Muller Ice  Shelf in  Lallemand Fjord and seismic reflection work in conjunction with  site augmentation funded through the Joint Oceanographic  Institute.  The goal of sediment trap work is to address whether  sand transport and deposition adjacent to the ice shelf calving  line results from meltwater or aeolian processes.  In addition,  the relationship between sea ice conditions and primary  productivity will be investigated.  The collection of a short  series of seismic lines across the Palmer Deep basins will fully  resolve the question of depth to acoustic basement.    The combination of investigators on this project, all with many  years of experience working in high latitude settings, provides  an effective team to complete the project in a timely fashion.  A  combination of undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate students  will be involved in all stages of the project so that educational  objectives will be met in-tandem with research goals of the  project.",
