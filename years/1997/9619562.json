 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619562  Horty  This is the first-year of a three-year continuing award. Research  on planning within AI has led to the development of computational  techniques for generating a plan to achieve a specified goal from  a  specified  initial state, given definitions of  the  available  actions.  Until recently, however, much of this research has been  governed  by  a number of simplifying assumptions,  notably  that  there   is  no  indeterminacy  either  in  the  planning  agent's  knowledge,  in  the effects of its actions, or in the  notion  of  goal  satisfaction, and that there are no changes either  in  the  goals  presented to the agent or in its environment.  This  award  supports  research  aimed  at  relaxing  the  latter  assumption.  Specifically,  the research investigates the issues  involved  in  extending planning technology to a dynamic setting, in which  the  agent's  goals  and environment are both subject  to  change.   A  study  is being made of both the theoretical and practical issues  presented  by  situations  that call for  integrated  generation,  maintenance, and execution of plans for multiple, changing goals.  The  project addresses these issues from two complementary points  of  view.   The  first  is designing and implementing  a  dynamic  planning  system  that  is  flexible  enough  to  allow  for  the  experimental  investigation  of  the  consequences  of   adopting  different  reasoning  strategies in  different  dynamic  planning  environments.   Secondly, but in parallel, a formal  analysis  is  being carried out of the dynamic planning problem, with a special  emphasis   on  providing  a  clean  semantic  analysis   of   the  implemented system.  The  aim of the project is more flexible and  realistic planning models and systems.",
