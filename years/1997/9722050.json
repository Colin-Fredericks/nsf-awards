 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are many examples of systems in a state of non-  equilibrium in the world around us.  Physicists study such  systems in the laboratory and observe processes that lead to  equilibration. The theoretical studies of such processes led  to the discipline of Statistical Mechanics.  Early on  (1870's) Boltzmann gave us the H-theorem and his famous  transport-equation.  Though tremendously important this  equation is unsatisfactory for some applications, especially  for quantum mechanical systems.  Using Green's function  methods Kadanoff and Baym (1962) developed a set of  equations applicable to such systems with the potential of  application to numerous technological systems.  They reduce  in a classical limit to Boltzmann's equation, but are even  more complicated.  Although frequently referred to, they  have in the past been regarded as impractical for numerical  solutions.  Numerous approximations have however been  suggested with applications in plasma-physics,  semiconductors and nuclear heavy-ion collisions.       Not until recently with the availability of high-speed  and large memory computers have exact solutions been  possible in certain cases.  I have  developed computer-  programs for the numerical solutions of these equations and  am applying them to the study of collisions between heavy  ions with emphasis on memory- and correlation- effects.  these effects are not included in the Boltzmann-like  equations previously applied to these problems.  This  proposal includes a further study of these effects as well  as pionic, relativistic and collective phenomena.  The  problem of equilibration of a quark-gluon plasma is also  included in our studies.",
