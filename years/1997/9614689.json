 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614689  Flemings     The research proposed will use observation and theory to pursue a hydrodynamic analysis of the Eugene Island 330 mini-basin of offshore Louisiana, Gulf of Mexico.  I will characterize the geology (e.g. lithostratigraphy and age of  deposition), pressure, porosity, and stress field of this system.  I will then study the individual behavior of these components.  Examples of this include porosity/stress behavior, stress/pressure behavior, and rock property/pressure behavior.  Finally, I will study the linkages between these components and develop a quantitative two-dimensional numerical (finite-element) hydrodynamic model to predict the state and evolution of fluid flow in this region.   This research is new and innovative for three reasons.  First, it is interdisciplinary (it integrates theory and observation in geology, hydrology, and rock mechanics).  Second, it proposes to study a system at a higher resolution than previous basin-scale fluid-flow studies (for example the work of Bethke or Garven).  Third, theory will be tightly constrained by observation of this system.  A critical component of the project is that I have chosen a mature oil and gas field with an extraordinary database that will allow me to characterize this system at the kilometer scale.  This includes multiple 3-D seismic surveys, hundreds of well logs, and direct measurements of pressure and permeability.     This study will directly address a number of continuing controversies in basinal fluid flow.  These include:  1)  what causes the generation of abnormal pressures?  2)  what component of fluid-flow is controlled by fracture permeability?  3)  how is the horizontal stress controlled by the evolution of the pressure field?  4)  how and when do faults behave as permeability conduits?  The very nature of these questions shows the interdependence of rock mechanics, geology and hydrology.  The inter-disciplinary or 'systems' approach that is proposed has the potential to gain insight not found with studie s of individual components of this system.",
