 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Origins of Udi Syntax  Udi is an endangered language which belongs to the North East  Caucasian language family.  It has been selected as an object of study  because (a) the structures of the languages of this family are  different in many ways from those of more familiar languages and  therefore can contribute significantly to our understanding of  language universals, (b) Udi has a complex morphology, which supplies  ready evidence of syntactic relations, and (c) Udi has undergone  significant syntactic and morphological change.  The project centers  on the development of a construction for marking the focus of  attention and on the development of moveable agreement (which occurs  on a host of any one of many types, including verbs, nouns, pronouns,  and adverbs).  The project involves study of both syntax and the  morphology that is most relevant to that syntax, including agreement  and case marking.  The objectives of the project include the  description and explanation of (a) agreement and complex verb  formation as they function in Udi today, (b) the origins of moveable  agreement in Udi, (c) origins of complex verbs in Udi and North East  Caucasian languages generally, (d) development of the focus  construction in Udi and other North East Caucasian languages, (e)  origins of changes in case marking patterns.  The significance of the  project is not limited to the explanation of phenomena particular to  Udi and other languages of the North East Caucasian family; rather,  these changes will be related to the universals of syntactic change.   It is expected that the project will provide (a) an explanation of how  word-internal agreement originates, (b) an increased understanding of  how case system undergo change, (c) testing of claims made in the  recent literature on syntactic change regarding the simplification  complex constructions and regarding changes in case marking and  agreement patterns, (d) testing of claims regarding the use in syntax  of historical methods originally design ed for use in reconstructing  phonology.",
