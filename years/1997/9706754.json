 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706754    Klainerman      One of the central issues in the theory of nonlinear  Partial Differential Equations of evolution     is that of  regularity or break-down  of solutions. The best known problems of this type, in fluid mechanics,   concern the regularity of the  three dimensional  Euler and   Navier-Stokes equations. Another well known problem is   that of finding a correct concept of global   generalized solutions, including shock discontinuities,  to compressible Euler equations.  Similar questions arise also in General Relativity. The   problem of regularity has been formulated, by Penrose,   under the code name of \"Cosmic Censorship\". It states,  roughly, that the stable solutions of the  Einstein Field Equations should exclude \"naked   singularities\", i.e. singularities not hidden by black holes.    Most of these problems are today out of reach. My objective is  to help develop tools for attacking these fundamental problems    by concentrating my attention on the simplified   situation of the Yang-Mills and Wave Maps field equations. As  is known, the Yang-Mills equations are at the heart of our  most successful particle physics theory, the so called standard  model. The Wave Maps equations appear naturally when we look  for special solutions of the Einstein equations.        The question of break-down of solutions to the Euler and Navier-Stokes  equations governing  the behavior of  fluids and  gases  and of the Einstein field equations of General Relativity is of  fundamental significance.  In the case of the former,  this problem is intimately tied to the highly unstable behavior  of fluids and has bearing on the practical problems of taming   turbulence and predicting the weather. In the case of General  Relativity, the problem has deep significance to our understanding  of the Universe, since black holes and singularities are the  most important, and least understood, predictions of General   Relativity.  While from a physical point of view these  theories seem very different,  mathematically they bear a lot of  similarities. Due to the non-linear character of these problems,  they have led, throughout this century, to the development  of new qualitative techniques in which mathematicians have  played a leading role. Some of these techniques are now  routinely used in practice. The final goals remain  distant, and the investigator would consider this    proposal a ringing success if it can help make a dint on  these difficult problems.",
