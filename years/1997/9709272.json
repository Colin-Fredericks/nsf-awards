 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences   Directorate, Professor J. Devens Gust, Jr. and Professor Thomas A. Moore,   of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Arizona State   University, are carrying out photochemical studies of multicomponent   molecular devices in solution and in organized assemblies.  Natural   photosynthetic reaction centers are photovoltaic devices of molecular   dimensions, and the principles dictating the operation of reaction   centers suggest design elements for synthetic optoelectronic switches.    New types of pigments and electron donor and acceptor moieties, including   functionalized buckminsterfullerenes, aromatic imides and amines, and   porphyrin derivatives, are being used to construct molecular-scale   photovoltaics, switches, and logic gates.  Biomimetic antenna systems   that gather light and transport excitation energy to these molecular   photovoltaics and switches will also be studied.  Incorporation of   switches into larger-scale devices will be examined both by interfacing   molecular species with microelectronic circuits and by incorporation of   molecular photovoltaics into liposomes.  Professor J. Devens Gust, Jr. and Professor Thomas A. Moore, of the   Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Arizona State University, are   supported by the Organic Dynamics Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences   Directorate for their studies of molecules and molecular assemblies   designed to harvest the energy of light.  Modeling their studies after   the structural motif designed by nature to carry out the process of   photosynthesis, Professors Gust and Moore prepare and study molecules   which absorb and use the energy of light.  By appropriate design of   molecular systems, these studies address the fundamental phenomena behind   such interactions of molecules with light while paving the way for the   preparation of molecular-scale electronic and computational devices which   offer the possibility of optical processing and extraordinarily high   density storage of information.",
