 "awd_abstract_narration": "OPP 9615254  Wannamaker    Abstract    The award supports a project to extend knowledge of the thermal  and physico-chemical state (fluids, melts) of the deep crust and  upper mantle of Antarctica with magnetotelluric (MT) profiling of  the South Pole area.  In the MT method, temporal variations in  the Earth's natural electromagnetic (EM) field are used as source  fields to probe the electrical resistivity structure in the depth  range of 1 to 100 kilometers (km), or more.  Geophysical methods  such as MT are appropriate in Antarctica because of the  predominance of thick ice cover (95% of the surface) and the  difficult operating environment.  The effort will consist of  about 16 sites over a length of 90 km, offset from South Pole  station about 5 km and oriented grid NE-SW, normal to the  Transantarctic Mountains (TAM).  The main purposes are three-  fold.  First, the method will test the cratonic character of the  lithosphere of this part of East Antarctica to depths of 100-150  km and will allow comparison of its resistivity structure with  that imaged in extensional central West Antarctica (CWA) by the  same research group.  Second, this experiment will be conducted  over the very thick and cold ice sheet extant at South Pole,  conditions that are very different those at CWA, so that this  project should make MT surveying more feasible over the entire  continent.  Third, the results will provide the crustal response  baseline for possible long-term MT monitoring to lower mantle  depths at South Pole.  This experiment should lead to important  advances in understanding of the crustal and mantle structure of  the central part of the Antarctic continent.",
