 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706840    Beals    The investigation involves the study of certain properties of  solutions to strictly hyperbolic partial differential equations  (\"waves\").  New qize and smoothness estimates in the linear case will  be derived, in order to analyze the properties of solutions to  nonlinear problems.  Estimates of time decay for appropriate measures  of the size of a solution will be obtained.  Results for the classical  wave equation on a spatial domain which is exterior to a convex  obstacle will be extended to handle more general natural conditions at  the boundary of the obstacle.  The key estimates correspond to finding  the best possible time decay subject to the weakest size and  smoothness restrictions on the data.  More general obstacles, for  which certain types of decay estimates are known but for which  explicit representations of approximations to solutions are absent,  will also be treated.  Analogous full-space problems (no obstacles)  will be analyzed.  The primary questions in these cases involve higher  order equations or systems, and the effects of interactions with  changes in the properties of the medium in which the waves are  propagating.  Nonsmooth perturbations in the medium are one source of  problems, including questions about the minimal regularity needed for  the perturbing potential.  Propagation in inhomogeneous media (for  example, nonconstant wave speeds) where bounds involving explicit time  estimates are relatively sparse, will also be considered.  (The  classical bounds involve those which measure size in terms of the  classical energy, which will not typically exhibit decay in time.)  The optimal time estimates under the best possible conditions on the  size of the data measured in terms of other natural spaces will be  considered, in model problems and in general.    Waves have been studied classically in terms of a size quantity like  energy, which is typically conserved or behaves in a fashion which is  easy to understand.  In order to go beyond the simpl est mathematical  approximations to understand the small- and large-scale properties of  true physical waves, other means of measuring the wave size must be  used.  Only the simplest model problems have been fully understood in  this context in the past - those for which the large-scale behavior is  merely a simple magnification of the small-scale behavior (such as  unperturbed waves in free space).  In true physical problems, waves  encounter obstacles and are reflected or absorbed; they travel in  media which are not uniform; they interact with themselves and with  the media in which they propagate.  The size behavior of such waves,  and in particular the decay of their amplitudes in time, will be  analyzed, in order to understand what information can be deduced about  the wave source from measurements of such size quantities made far  away (or long after the wave is generated).",
