 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the exposure of undergraduate psychology students at all levels to human psychophysiological demonstrations, exercises, and experiments.  Despite psychology's strong position in the life sciences, undergraduate students have not been exposed to a life-science orientation to the field.  When they have been, they have not been given hands-on opportunities to encourage further scientific interest in the field.  This project provided a computer-based modular instrument system for physiological data acquisition, analysis, and control in an undergraduate laboratory designed especially for this type of data collection.  In the Foundations of Psychology course, teams of five are addressing questions associated with general psychology topics such as \"polygraph\" measurement and its accuracy, biofeedback related exercises, and brain activity measurement.  In the more advanced Biopsychology course, approximately 35 percent of laboratory time is being devoted to teams of four students addressing questions in basic arousal, evoked potentials, and overnight sleep phenomena.  As part of the major requirement in Senior Methods Seminar, some majors are opting to conduct an individual research project in this area.  The impact of this project is to strengthen the student perception of psychology's contribution to neuroscience and to encourage new scientists.  *",
