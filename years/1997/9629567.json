Lake-effect events, where cold air masses  are rapidly modified over the Great Lakes, are excellent  natural laboratories for studying these exchanges. The Lake-  Induced Convection Experiment (Lake-ICE) is a multiple-  Principal Investigator project which seeks to use this  natural laboratory to determine how boundary layer growth  processes are controlled by mesoscale boundary layer  convective structures and how the modified boundary layer  effects the production of precipitation and the larger scale   meteorological conditions.         Because of strongly nonlinear multi-scale interactions,  the study of lake-induced phenomena requires a highly  collaborative team effort taking advantage of the skills of  multiple investigators and the capabilities of a range of  instruments and platforms.  Within the broader framework of  Lake-ICE the research to be performed under this award will  focus on two scientific objectives:          1.  To determine the nature, causes, and consequences of the   two-way interaction between individual km-scale convective  elements (i.e. three-dimensional thermal plumes) and the two-  dimensional mesoscale lake-effect cloud bands in which they  are embedded.    2.  To ascertain the degree to which these interactions lead   to a mesoscale modulation (i.e. cross-roll variation) in the   rate at which air is entrained across the temperature  inversion that caps the lake-induced convective boundary  layer.  ***",
