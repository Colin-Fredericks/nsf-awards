 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrochemistry, particularly voltammetry, offers many advantages in determination of analytical concentrations and physical properties.  These advantages include high sensitivity, minimal sample preparation, and simultaneous observation of multiple analyses.  The method accomplishes a high level of performance yet has a modest cost compared to other instruments with similar abilities.  In addition, voltammetry has the unique ability to reduce or oxidize the sample, observe the fate of the electrochemically generated species, and return the incipient product to its initial state.  Because of these qualities, the ACS Committee on Professional Training has recommended that a multipurpose electrochemistry instrument be adopted in undergraduate courses.  The focus of this project is the integration of a modern electrochemistry instrument into the whole undergraduate chemistry program.  The three principal areas of this project include the design of instructional modules available from webpages, procurement of a mobile, computer-controlled instrument, and development of new inquiry-based experiments for the relevant courses.  In addition, the instrument is enhancing the effectiveness of student research projects.  The efforts of this project are extending beyond the immediate department to area high school students and teachers, area community colleges, and other universities.",
