 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710301  Jaffe  This is an award to support research on and relating to the  effects that surfactants have on enhancing the movement of  bacteria suspended in water through porous media.  Experimental  investigations are planned to relate the molecular structure of  surfactants and concentration in water to their effects on  bacterial cell surface charge and hydrophobicity.  Additional  experiments will be conducted to relate movement of bacteria  through sand columns for determination of the effect that  surfactants have on the collision efficiency factor in applying  colloid filtration theory to movement of bacteria through soil.  This experimental work will provide the framework for a  mathematical formulation that may be used in engineering design  of systems for decontamination of soil and for introduction of  appropriately acclimated microorganisms into a plume of  contaminated water for its decontamination.    The introduction of surfactants to groundwater has the potential  for significantly affecting the transport of bacteria in soil.  Results of this project are expected to provide a means for  predicting characteristics of bacterial transport in soil as they  are influenced by surfactants.  This knowledge may be applied in  assessment of policies for intentional and unintentional  introduction of surfactants to groundwater, design of systems to  cope with contaminated plumes of groundwater such as wastewater  streams from septic tanks and for design of systems to  decontaminate soil using appropriately acclimated bacteria.  ***",
