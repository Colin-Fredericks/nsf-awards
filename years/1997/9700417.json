 "awd_abstract_narration": "With its exponential parallelism, molecular computing offers  the hope of solving important problems that have resisted  solution on conventional computers. Various molecular  operations have been proposed as feasible; because it is  unclear which operations will be usefully implementable,  algorithms that use the simplest operations are to be  preferred. In particular, communication between processes  may be impossible. Parallelism and running time are  resources to be exploited efficiently. It is known that  molecular computers with limited operations sets, polynomial  time, and exponential parallelism can solve any problem in  the class NP. By further limiting the parallelism, various  bounded-nondeterminism subclasses of NP are obtained. This  project investigates the relationships among molecular  computation classes and these NP subclasses. While many  molecular algorithms for important problems use 2n  parallelism, this severely limits the size of problems that  those algorithms can solve.  In the last two decades there  has been an improvement from 2n to 2cn for various c<1 in  the running time of classical serial algorithms for  important NP-complete problems like 3-SAT, graph coloring,  and independent set. Using bounded nondeterminism as an  algorithm design technique, this project will develop more  efficient molecular algorithms for important NP-complete  problems, such as 3-SAT, graph coloring, and independent  set.  ***",
