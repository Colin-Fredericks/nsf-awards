 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9702403    This is a four-year Career project. The field of materials science and chemistry has benefited tremendously from recent advances in synthesis, characterization, and processing.  Novel mocroporous materials, including zeolites clays, and porous carbons, are discovered and their properties examined at an increasing pace.  Stochastic \"diversity synthesis\" provide a new route to a tremendously increased number of solid-state, organic, and biological compounds, and associated selection schemes allow sorting of these libraries based upon physical, chemical, or biological properties of interest.  Simultaneously, among the most exciting developments in statistical mechanics over the past decade have been powerful methods for the computer simulation of materials.  To date these methods have been developed and tested mainly on model systems.  In many cases, however, formulations appear possible that allow investigation of the properties of novel materials of current interest.  Moreover,  new field-theoretic techniques in  statistical mechanics allow computation of  meso- and macroscopic material properties from such atomistic simulations.  This project relates to the Deem group's research and teaching interests in the area of structure and transport in disordered microcrystalline materials.    Diffusion is of great importance in catalytic sorptive, ion-exchange, and conducting materials.  The diffusing entity may be structural defects in the nearly-crystalline solid, catalyst particles, occluding molecules, reactants, or products.  The chemical and transport properties of the material depend crucially on the diffusion coefficients of the constituent species.  The influence of disorder on the diffusing species can be difficult or impossible to capture in a fantasize simulation.  Field theory is discussed as a possible means to mitigate finite-size effects and to account for, the effect of macroscopic disorder on transport properties.  This approach complements microscopic molecular  dynamics calculations to provide a comprehensive theory for transport.    Zeolites continue to be svnthesized at a furious pace.  Perhaps soon the techniques of diversity synthesis will be introduced to the field, with a tremendous explosion in the number of synthetic zeolites.  The derivation of  an  atomic-scale model of the framework crystal structure of a newly-synthesiz              d  zeolite is a non-trivial task: roughly one-hundred framework structures have been solved out of  the thousands of existing synthetic zeolites.  A direct method making use of ideas from importance-sampled Monte Carlo is proposed for determining the structure of  microcrocrystalline materials from powder diffraction data.",
