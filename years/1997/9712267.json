 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project conducts research in the design of efficient  algorithms, their implementation in software packages, and  in making the programs accessible to non-specialist users of  symbolic computation systems.  Packages for the black box  representation of symbolic objects and for symbolic objects  containing imprecise, that is, floating point data will be  constructed.  The packages are generically programmed as C++  template classes with abstract underlying arithmetics; they  can be compiled with a variety of fast libraries for the  basic field, floating point, and polynomial operations.  A  server/client interface seamlessly attaches the packages  to all widely-used general purpose symbolic systems such as  Maple and Mathetmatica.  Parallel execution of the  implemented algorithms will be facilitated.    Black box objects are stored as functions.  For instance: a  black box polynomial is a procedure that takes values for  the variables as input and evaluates the polynomial at that  given point; a black box matrix is a procedure that takes an  arbitrary vector as input and computes the matrix times  vector product.  The FoxBox system is a package for  computing greatest common divisors and factoring black box  polynomials.  The aim is to eliminate algorithmic  bottlenecks in FoxBox and add black box linear algebra.  For  sake of speed, the project focuses on algorithms over finite  fields.    Efficient server/client bridge code to a variety  of general purpose systems will be developed.    The project will also investigate how inexact (e.g.,  floating point) data can be handled in the course of a  symbolic computation.  The allowance of floating point  coefficients in a symbolic, i.e., parameterized model, is  crucial for a symbolic approach to problems from the  physical world.  Moreover, floating point arithmetic is  faster than exact arithmetic, especially for algebraic  numbers.  Several numerical models, such as a-posteriori  iterative improvement and sensitivity analysis for perturbed   input data, will be considered.  The problems of Toeplitz  matrix rank, polynomial complex root location, and factoring  complex polynomials in many variables will be investigated.  The design of a plug-and-play symbolic/numeric package will  be studied.",
