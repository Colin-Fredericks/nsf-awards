The objective of  their project is to generate improved measures of investment  in education and human capital in the United Kingdom from  the 1950s up to the present.  The US and UK investigators  will apply a methodology for valuing investment in education  developed by Dr. Fraumeni and her research partner Dale  Jorgenson of Harvard University.  The estimates of education  output and investment in the UK will then be compared to  estimates for the US and Sweden and used to determine the  efficiency of the education sector and the impact of  investment in human capital to economic growth.    The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise  on the theoretical approach and knowledge of the US and  Swedish systems.  This is complemented by the British  investigators' expertise on the UK economy and education  system and their access to education data in the UK.  ***",
