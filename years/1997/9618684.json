 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618684  Johnson       Organized collections of thunderstorms, known as mesoscale  convective systems (MCSs), have been identified as producers of  most of the rainfall in the tropics and mid-latitudes during the   Spring, Summer and Fall.         Under prior NSF support, the Principal Investigator has  exploited data sets from previously held field experiments to  further understanding of MCSs and their interactions with the  atmospheric boundary layer.  He will continue these investigations  using both numerical models and observational case studies.       The Principal Investigator will focus on processes which  initiate, maintain and modulate mesoscale convection as well as the  coupling between convection and the atmospheric boundary layer.   Specific objectives include:    Determine the climatology and initiation mechanisms for squall    lines over the U.S.;  1.   Extend previous research on the evolution of MCSs and their        surface pressure features to other seasons;  Continue studies of the characteristics of mesovortices.       If successful, this research will lead to better understanding  of MCSs which may lead to better predictions of timing, location  and amount of rainfall as well as severe weather.  ***",
