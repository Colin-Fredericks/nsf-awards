The research addresses a number of questions, including: What were the intentions of the reformers, i.e. what sorts of classrooms, curricula, teachers, and teaching methods did they envision?  To what degree did the intentions of the reformers succeed and which failed?   To what degree could their intentions have better succeeded had they used different strategies and to what degree was their project hopeless?  What residue was left after the reform effort ended?  Does the \"New Math\" experience have useful implications for current and future efforts at reform in mathematics education?",
