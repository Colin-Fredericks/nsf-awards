 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the development of a paperless machine design research laboratory.  The purpose of the laboratory is to introduce students to state-of-the-art machine design and manufacturing processes, and provide a venue for research in these areas.  The laboratory shall consist of a computer workstation with solid modeling and analysis software, a rapid prototyping device, a computer controlled milling machine, and a computer controlled lathe.  Students will take design concepts and model them using solid modeling software.  Solid modeling allows one to sculpt a design from a solid volume rather than draw a two-dimensional representation of a part.  Designs are also created parametrically using the parent/child relationship; these designs can be combined together to create assemblies which include many components.  Stress, kinematic, thermal, and other types of analysis can be performed by post processing the model information, and the resulting design can be quickly produced using rapid prototyping processes, such as stereo-lithography.  The prototype gives the student insight into his/her design, and actual fabrication of the machine part leads to a fundamental understanding of the overall machine design process, yet few blueprints are ever produced.  Illustrations and analysis can be directly ported into presentation software for review.  By the use of retro-active updating, a design change can be updated backward through the design chain.  In many cases, the use of such state-of-the-art equipment can identify design flaws early in the process thus reducing the need for refinement and iteration.       The development of this laboratory will enhance the student's understanding of current machine design and manufacturing processes.  Faculty members and students from many departments will use the laboratory for research and experimentation.  Students will perform research on advanced transient control strategies for tool path generation, error reduction in stereo-lithography interpolation, and optimization of the interface between machine design and manufacturing.  Knowledge gained will lead to future research in many other areas.",
