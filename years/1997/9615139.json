 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615139  Ritzwoller    Abstract  This award supports a study of the dispersion characteristics  (group and phase velocity, amplitude, and polarization) of  broadband (20 - 200 second) Rayleigh and Love waves propagating  across Antarctica and the southern oceans and to invert these  measurements for higher resolution (lateral: ~500 km) `tectonic  scale' crustal and lithospheric models of the Antarctic Plate.  For the most part this research will be built upon already  existing methodological and data resources.    In previous work, reliable frequency-time filtering methods were  developed for measuring broad band surface wave dispersion on  large data sets.  These classical methods were applied  systematically across Eurasia and are yielding high resolution  images of the Eurasian crust and lithosphere.  Second, there now  exists a large, steadily growing, and easily accessible data base  of seismograms following large magnitude high southern latitude  earthquakes observed on broad band digital instruments that have  been emplaced in Antarctica, on southern oceanic islands, and in  southern South America, Africa and Australia (e.g., GDSN, IDA,  IRIS/GSN, GTSN, GEOSCOPE, AGSO, POSEIDON, MEDNET, etc.).  The  application of these existing techniques to large volumes of high  quality broad band data promises to yield significant new  information about the crust and lithosphere underlying the  Antarctic Plate.    As a lead-in to this research, data were accumulated from IRIS's  DMC and GEOSCOPE covering the years 1977 - mid-1995.  A subset of  these data (~500 events from 1990 to mid-1995) were analyzed to  yield preliminary group velocity maps across the Antarctic Plate  from 20 second to 150 second period.  These preliminary maps  provide new information about the following issues (among  numerous others): (1) lithospheric extension and rifting in the  West Antarctic, (2) the extent and nature of the East Antarctic  Craton, and (3) the nature of the `anomalous' upper mantle  underlying the Austra lian - Antarctic discordance.    The new research supported by this award will extend these  measurements to a much larger waveform data set in order to  improve reliability and resolution.  In addition, more accurate  ray tracing methods will be developed and applied to optimize  lateral resolution.  The ultimate product will be a shear  velocity model underlying the Antarctic Plate to a depth of about  150 km.  Collaborations with Antarctic geoscientists active in  the region will facilitate the interpretation of these models  once they are constructed.",
