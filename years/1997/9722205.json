Little is understood about how these effects on gene expression result in the dramatic developmental changes associated with steroid function in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The goal of the proposed research is to answer the question of how a single hormonal signal can elicit different responses at different times during development. The proposed study will examine the regulatory hierarchies triggered by 20-hydroxyecdysone (ecdysone)during the onset of Drosophila metamorphosis.  Previously isolated as well as newly isolated loss-of-function mutations in a mutant, BFTZ-F1 will be analyzed with a focus on salivary gland histolysis, pupal cuticle formation, and head eversion. The mutations will also be characterized at the molecular level.  Non-technical  Understanding biological processes at the molecular level has led to rapid, major advances in our understanding of mechanisms underlying biological processes and that understanding has had a major impact in the everyday world. Thus it is critical for students to gain a solid understanding of molecular biology, whether they wish to become scientists, or informed citizens who are well-equipped to deal with personal and societal decisions regarding use of scientific knowledge. In this study, undergraduate students will be involved in the analysis of the mechanism(s) involved in the function of the steroid hormone in triggering developmental processes in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.  The plan to integrate molecular biology into the curriculum is an effective way of teaching scientific principles of biology.   ***",
