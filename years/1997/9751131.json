 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geographical Information System (GIS) and Image Analysis techniques have become a rapidly developing component of our technological age.  The sphere of applications for these techniques spans several disciplines.  These tools are fundamental to site characterization studies for construction projects, mapping soil types and drainage patters for optimizing crop rotations, identifying the spatial extent of old growth forests, as well as many others.  The current generation of Civil Engineers and Environmental Scientists must be adept at not only understanding the theoretical foundations for these tools, but also skilled in their practical application.  Current budgetary constraints dictate that innovative and fundamental reforms must be found in both curricula and pedagog to ensure that graduates have attained the technical skills required to meet the challenges facing our society.    A self-directed multimedia GIS/Image Analysis laboratory is proposed.  The laboratory will have sufficient computational power, data storage, and networking capability to enable a series of instructional modules in the fields of GIS/Image Analysis to be administered either on or off-site via CD-ROM or the World Wide Web, the extending the bounds of the traditional classroom.  The proposed effort includes a procedure that will enable students to gain access to both the requisite software and data independent of their location.  The proposed infrastructure will enable students to access appropriate data sets without significantly impacting the current campus networking traffic.    The project will be evaluated in terms of the number of students who enter the instructional time-line, whether or not their curricular goals were achieved, their recorded proficiency, and their ability to integrate their skills into student projects.  Results will be disseminated at both national and regional conferences.",
