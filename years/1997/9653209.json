 "awd_abstract_narration": "A regional coalition, the Beta Coalition, is being established to support two-year community colleges and small four-year engineering and science programs in transforming the innovations based on sophisticated information technology-based programs developed by NSF coalitions such as SYNTHESIS and ECSEL into a form they can use with limited resources. Furthermore, in small programs it is difficult to justify integration of content-based subjects such as math and science because requirements tend to be specific to a major. However, integration of skill-based subjects such as writing, computer applications, graphics, and design can bring students with different majors together in a common course sequence. The Watson School of Engineering at Binghamton University and Broome Community College have worked together on a variety of programs, and faculty at both institutions have experience in developing integrated course sequences. This proposal is based on their existing collaborative efforts. Funding is sought to develop and present summer workshops wherein faculty from other 2-year and small 4-year schools within a 150 mile radius can be trained and supported in developing integrated courses for their own institutions. A model will be created for the needed interdepartmental cooperation, while recognizing the special institutional problems involved in sharing faculty and resources. Ways will be evaluated in which integrated courses can be used to increase access and retention of students in engineering and science from under-represented groups, including non-traditional students commonly present in community colleges. An assessment system will be developed for measuring program effectiveness, particularly innovations springing from Beta Coalition activities. Results and materials will be disseminated via Internet as well as conferences and journals of ASEE and other appropriate professional communications.",
