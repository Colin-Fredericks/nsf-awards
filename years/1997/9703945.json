 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project to be undertaken is a program of research in set theory, investigating the axiomatic set theory Zermelo-Fraenkel with Choice (ZFC).  The topics to be investigated include the combinatorics of singular cardinals, questions about Souslin and Aronszajn trees, Woodin's theory of genepic iterations and \"canonical\" models, and the theory and applications of Radin forcing.  An expository book with Woodin  about Radin forcing and its applications will be completed. The techniques to be used in the program are those of combinatorial set theory, forcing, inner model theory and descriptive set theory. The unifying theme of the problems under consideration is that they are all connected in some way or other with large cardinals.   The aim of this proposal is to investigate some mathematical problems about infinite sets, using tools from mathematical logic. The theory of infinite sets lies at the heart of modern mathematics, in the sense that all mathematical objects can be represented as sets and all mathematical proofs can be  represented as proofs in set theory. Mathematical logic is a discipline in which mathematical techniques are applied to prove results about \"formal systems\" such as axiomatic mathematical theories or (more recently) computer programming languages. Progress on the problems should lead to new mathematics and the development of new logical tools.",
