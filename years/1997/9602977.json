This proposal seeks  to examine the \"gender climate\" in two top-ranked undergraduate engineering programs.  The project will collect data on educational process and outcomes, examine factors and relationship affecting climate, test interventions to reform classroom and department environments; and develop support systems to attract, retain, and enlarge a pool of professional women in engineering.    It focuses attention on race and gender by examining structural and individual factors that produce variations in satisfaction among minority and white women, explores the perceptions and experiences of women in engineering, and examines the connection between department and classroom climate concerns.      This project will track student's persistence in engineering to determine the extent to which climate concerns are related to dropping out or switching fields.  It will use both survey and interview techniques.  The project will involve the University of Maryland College Park, the Georgia Institute of Technology and feeder institutions to those universities.    Students, chairs, deans, and department heads will be interviewed.    ***",
