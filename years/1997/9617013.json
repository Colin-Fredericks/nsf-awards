 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program is supporting   Professor Silbey at MIT.   During the next three years theoretical models   will be developed for the study of several distinct areas.  The first   involves low temperature optical properties of molecules in condensed   phases, in particular glassy solids.  Spectral hole burning, photon   echoes, and single molecule spectroscopy have all shown that the so   called homogeneous line shape of a molecule is time dependent because of   slow fluctuations in the condensed phase. These methods have different   but often overlapping time scales, so that a complete picture of the time   dependence from picoseconds to weeks can be found.  The theoretical   interpretations of these experiments based on a quantum statistical   mechanical approach is the goal of the first area of research.  The   second involves optical and electronic properties of molecular aggregates   in solutions.  Molecular aggregates, such as the light harvesting   complexes of the photosynthetic apparatus, have been under intense   experimental study over the past decade.  The advent of femtosecond   lasers in the correct spectral range has led to new experiments studying   the time dependence of excitation energy transfer and vibrational   relaxation in these aggregates.  The theoretical understanding of the   electronic and vibronic states and the dynamics of energy flow of these   aggregates is the central problem of this phase of the supported   research.  Because of experimental advances, second harmonic light   scattering from molecules in solution has reemerged as an important tool   to measure the non-linear optical properties of molecules.  However, the   interpretation of these experiments in terms of the molecular and solvent   properties requires a modern theoretical basis, which is the goal of the   third part of this grant.  In particular, the description of the   fluctuations of the solvent field at the solute molecule is essential to   a correct interpretation of the experimental results.  The optical spectrum of a molecule is a signature of its electronic   structure and the environment in which the molecule finds itself.  The   effects of the environment can be profound and can make the   identification and understanding of the optical properties of the   molecule difficult.  Thus, a study of these effects provides information   not only on the molecular spectrum, but also on the environment.  The   purpose of this research is to understand theoretically the effects of   the environment (solvent) on the optical properties of a molecule.  The   molecules that will be studied are organic molecules that have a large   linear and non-linear optical response; these include: dye molecules used   in laser research, chlorophyll and aggregates of chlorophyl (antenna   complexes and reaction centers), and conjugated molecules that are   candidates for use in optical switching and communication devices.  The   solvents or environments that the molecules are in include normal   liquids, solids and glasses. The theoretical research will be carried out   in collaboration with experimentalists who are measuring these optical   properties.",
