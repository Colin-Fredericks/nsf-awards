These species are found  in the massive `red tides\" or blooms of cells that discolor  the water.  More commonly, the organisms are present at low  concentrations and are noticed only by the effects their  toxins have on aquatic organisms and humans.  The nature of  the toxic phytoplankton problem has changed considerably in  recent years as many areas that were previously unaffected  are now subject to recurrent outbreaks.  Therefore, it is  alarming that marine algal toxins (saxitoxins) have been  found in Antarctic molluscs.  The implications of this  discovery are profound given the low number of trophic  levels between primary producers and top predators and the  proven ability of the saxitoxins to alter the food web  structure and dynamics.  Saxitoxins can affect zooplankton,  fish larvae, whales, porpoises, seabirds, and humans.  A  concern is that the saxitoxin-producing alga, presumably the  dinoflagellates in the genus Alexandrium, has been  introduced to Antarctic waters, possibly by vessel traffic  between South America and the Antarctic Peninsula.  This  mechanism of species dispersal has been implicated in the  sudden appearance of toxic algae in other areas of the  world.  Short and frequent transport pathways do exist  between Antarctic and the high-toxicity waters of southern  Chile and Argentina.  It is also possible that the  saxitoxins-producing organism is indigenous to Antarctica  and was only recently noticed.  In either case, the  implications to the Antarctic food web are significant.  The  objectives of this proposal are to identify and characterize  the possible source(s) of saxitoxins in Antarctica to  determine whether the causative organisms are indigenous or  introduced species, and if introduced, to identify the  probable origin and transport pathway.",
