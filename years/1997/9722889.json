 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722889  McCracken    Eukaryotic cells have an intracellular protein degradation  process that removes aberrant and unassembled proteins from  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This ER-Associated protein  Degradation pathway (ERAD) is highly selective for specific  soluble and integral membrane proteins, while the majority  or ER resident and secreted proteins are quite stable.  Evidence that the ER chaperone calnexin has a role in ERAD  indicates that molecular chaperones are required for this  remarkable substrate selectivity, yet the mechanism of  chaperone action in this context is unclear.  Furthermore,  although previous studies suggested that ERAD was a novel  intracellular proteolytic process involving unidentified ER-  localized proteases, a recent and unexpected finding has  made it clear that the quality control of proteins in the ER  includes the export of aberrant and unassembled proteins to  the cytosol for degradation.  The mechanism of retrograde  protein transport across the ER membrane, and the role of  molecular chaperones in this process, are the major  questions addressed by the research proposed here.  The  specific aims are to: 1, determine which molecular  chaperones are required for ERAD and investigate the  mechanism of substrate selectivity and targeting; 2, verify  whether the protein translocation channel, Sec61p, known to  be the route through which nascent proteins enter the ER, is  indeed also responsible for the retrograde translocation of  a soluble yeast ERAD substrate; and 3, to identify new  proteins involved in ERAD through molecular cloning of the  wild-type alleles of ERAD-defective genes.  These studies  will be facilitated by a cell free system that has been  developed that allows the dissection of ERAD at the  molecular level, and by ERAD-defective yeast mutants that  have already been isolated.  Together, these advances  provide a unique opportunity to combine biochemical and  genetic approaches to elucidate the components and the  molecular mechanisms a nd regulation of ERAD.  The first two  aims will be accomplished using the reconstituted in vitro  assay and chemical crosslinking to reveal direct and  temporal associations between the ERAD substrate, the  molecular chaperones, and a protein component of the  translocation complex.  It is anticipated that these studies  will raise new questions regarding the identity an role of  yet-unidentified factors involved in ERAD.  To accomplish  the third aim, the mutants will each by studied by the in  vitro assay to determine whether a given mutant strain is  defective in substrate selectivity, transport of ERAD  substrate to the cytosol, targeting of substrate to the  cytosolic proteasome, or proteolysis.  In addition, the wild  type alleles of the defective ERAD genes will be cloned to  identify new proteins involved in ERAD.    Cells have quality-control processes in place to ensure that  newly-synthesized proteins are structurally correct so that  they will function properly.  Many proteins are synthesized  for either export (secretion) or use in specialized  intracellular compartments such as the lysosome; such  proteins are sequestered early in their synthesis into a  subcellular compartment known as the endoplasmic reticulum  (ER).  The quality control system within the ER which is  responsible for degradation of ER-associated aberrant  proteins has been given the acronym \"ERAD.\"  It has long  been assumed that when proteins in the ER are recognized as  aberrant, the degradation of those proteins takes place  within the ER. Drs. McCracken and Brodsky, the Principal and  co-Principal Investigators of this project, have recently  made the unexpected discovery that proteins recognized as  aberrant in the ER are actually translocated back into the  cytosol (possibly through the same pore in the membrane  through which they were brought in originally) and degraded  via proteolytic machinery in the cytosol known as  proteasomes.  The combined biochemical and molecular genetic  approach proposed in t his project  will lead to an  understanding of how this process actually works.  ***",
