This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project to be carried out by Surfactant Associates, Inc. proffers an enhanced process for a solution to this problem by means of the exhaustive oxidation of air contaminants.  The process involves ozonation of a fluorocarbon fluid possessing extremely high solubility for ozone.  The fluorocarbon is completely oxidation resistant and biologically inert and its high solubility for gases has allowed its use as an artificial blood substitute in thousands of surgical operations.  The fluorocarbon has demonstrated the preferential ability to extract a variety of both gaseous and liquid hydrocarbon and chlorocarbon contaminants from air streams.  It has a low viscosity and an even lower volatility while being a superior solvent for gaseous contaminants relative to all hydrocarbon solvents.  The fluid is an excellent medium for oxidation reactions and poses no contamination risk itself.  For such reasons its has been previously used with dispersions of TiO 2  particles for the ultraviolet (UV) catalyzed photooxidation of air contaminants.  Exhaustive oxidation was achieved in such UV irradiated dispersions due to the air contaminants collecting at the solid/liquid interface of the TiO 2 particles and their intermediate oxidation products being unable to escape.  The intermediate oxidation products themselves physically adsorbed at the solid/liquid interface until completely oxidized to C02. It is proposed that this effect would also be seen for ozone catalyzed oxidation in such fluorocarbon/TiO 2 dispersions.  It is also proposed that, by using a high surface area TiO 2 aerogel dispersion, the physical adsorption capacity for air contaminants would be enhanced by an order of magnitude.   The proposed process offers to significantly  improve indoor air quality.  The initial target markets for the proposed process are small confinement areas such as passenger aircraft and nuclear submarines where indoor air quality is particularly poor.  Other markets are hospitals, nursing homes, hotels, office buildings, shopping malls and restaurants to mention a few. The superior oxidation potential of the proposed system could be utilized for the treatment of indoor air of any structure occupied by humans.  ***",
