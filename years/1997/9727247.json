The research uses an  expanded definition of modularity, which incorporates the  potential of modularity based not only on disassembly but  also on grouped retirement methods.  This definition,  coupled with several important design tools will lead to an  implementable design methodology for incorporating  retirement modules into products.    Modularization, due to the functional independence it  creates, has been called the goal of good design.  Industry  has made an effort to modularize products to easily meet the  needs of end users and marketing.  This effort has led to  the creation of product families.  Occasionally, modules are  created with some aspects of product retirement in mind.  However, this modularization is done without fully  understanding the financial implications of the design  changes.  In addition, modularization is done without a  structured methodology making the process difficult to  repeat if it is successful and difficult to avoid if it is  unsuccessful.  This research will develop a methodology of  creating products that are modular with respect to product  retirement.  Doing so will decrease environmental loads,  decrease retirement processing costs, and decrease product  development time.    This research will yield a practical, applicable methodology  for identifying product retirement modules as well as  combining functional and retirement modularity into a design  methodology and modularity measure.  The adoption of modular  product design in product development practices will have a  tremendous impact on product value, environmental loads, and  life-cycle cost.  Modular products will greatly reduce  development time and help us move towards global  sustainability.  The design theory research community will  be impacted by the introduction of a new direction in the  effort to better incorporate life-cycle values into product  design.    This r esearch will progress in practical steps punctuated by  validation studies.  The result of the research in this  proposal will be a validated design methodology and measure.  The work will also be disseminated in publications at each  critical juncture and ultimately incorporated in a computer  tool.  The work will be accomplished through the work of the  faculty and graduate students of the University of Alabama  Life-cycle Engineering Laboratory with collaboration from  undergraduate researchers and students.  ***",
