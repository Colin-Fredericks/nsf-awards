 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713642  Hamouda    Description: This award is for support of a cooperative  project by Dr. Hechmi Hamouda, Department of  Textile  Engineering, Chemistry, and Science at North Carolina State  University in Raleigh, NC, and Dr. Mohamed El-Rafie, Head of  the Textile Research Division at the National Research  Center (NRC) in Cairo, Egypt.  The objective of this joint  research is to study the feasibility of combining  pretreatment processes of cellulosic textiles with the goal  of reducing the energy and chemicals used in pretreatment,  and of reducing the large amounts of water used in the  repeated washing operations, thus reducing the industrial  water pollution.  Two categories of textile fibers would be  considered, cotton and cotton-blends, and flax.  The first  of these requires three pretreatments of desizing, scouring  and bleaching, while flax fibers require scouring followed  by three bleaching steps of hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide  and sodium chlorite.  Each of these steps must be followed  by washing, thus the huge requirements for water, chemicals,  and energy, as well as the resulting pollution load.    Scope:  This research project will involve two experienced  researchers from well respected institutes for textile  research with complementary expertise and facilities.  Solution of the problem they will address would have  significant benefits to a major industry in both countries,  and would have special environmental impact on countries  where water use and polluted water discharge are problems.  Egypt and several other developing countries rely  extensively on their textile industries, and yet these are  some of the most polluting industries for the water  available for human use.  The collaborating scientists plan  to conduct laboratory tests, and to scale the studies to  actual manufacturing scale.  This proposal meets the INT  objective of supporting US-foreign collaboration in areas  that have benefits for both sides.  This project is being  supported under the US-Egy pt Joint Fund Program, which  provides grants to scientists and engineers in both  countries to carry out these cooperative activities.  *  *  *",
