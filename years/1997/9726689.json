 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made to Dr. Russell S. Drago of the Chemistry Department,   University of Florida, for investigation of a new method to measure and   control the acidity of solid acid catalysts.  The award is in the   Technology for Sustainable Environment component of the EPA/NSF   Partnership for Environmental Research, and support is provided by the   Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program and the   Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  Solid acid catalysts substituted   for strong acid solvents and reagents can reduce toxic wastes associated   with many industrial processes, such as alkylation, that require sulfuric   acid or hydrofluoric acid to promote reaction.  Results of calorimetric   titrations and adsorption isotherms will be used to determine equilibrium   constants and enthalpies for various reaction sites on the solids.  When   coupled with spectroscopic and reactivity data, reaction thresholds and   optimum solid acidities will be determined for reactions of interest.    Sol-gel methods will be used to prepare a series of solid acids that   incorporate different high oxidation state elements into the silica   structure.  The effect of element changes and systematic changes in the   synthesis variables on acidity will be determined and correlated with   selectivity of various solid acid catalysts for isomerization of alkanes.    Non-porous and microporous solids with similar acid strengths will be   compared.  The petroleum industry uses hydrofluoric and sulfuric acids to initiate   many reactions that alter the arrangement or length of molecular carbon   chains.  Solid acids that can replace these aqueous acids provide   inexpensive and reusable substitutes in many areas of refining.  In this   study, a systematic approach to assessing the effectiveness of solid   acids in various reactions will be developed.",
