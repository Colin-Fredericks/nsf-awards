This protein was discovered a few years ago in Dr.  Bernstein's laboratory.  The N-terminal quarter of this  protein is unique, while the remainder is identical to the C-  terminal half of the  thick filament core protein  paramyosin.  From the work of others, miniparamyosin is now  known to be a component of many invertebrate muscles, and  its presence in a number of phyla suggests that it serves an  important role in myofibril assembly and/or function.  In  situ hybridization studies showed that miniparamyosin mRNA  is expressed in only a subset of adult Drosophila muscle  cell types.  Antibody studies from other laboratories have  shown that miniparamyosin is a component of the thick  filament and that it has a different localization pattern in  indirect flight muscles and tubular muscles of the adult.  The overall aim of this project is to directly test the role  of miniparamyosin in muscle structure and function and its  interplay with other elements of the thick filament in vivo.  The project will employ transgenic, ultrastructural, and  physiological approaches designed to directly test the  function of this protein in vivo in Drosophila melanogaster.  The specific objectives for the grant period are as follows:  1, to isolate and/or construct Drosophila strains which are  mutant for miniparamyosin and analyze their genetic,  ultrastructural and physiological defects; 2, produce  transgenic flies that express greatly increased levels of  miniparamyosin in their indirect flight muscles.  By  analyzing the ultrastructure of such muscles, it will be  determined whether thick filament length, diameter or  electron density are affected as a result of changing the  ratio of this protein to that of myosin heavy chain and  paramyosin.  Antibodies against miniparamyosin will be used  to define whethe r over-expression results in protein  relocalization within the thick filament.  It will also be  determined how over-expression of miniparamyosin in flight  muscles affects the biophysical properties of these muscles;  3, determine whether the amount of paramyosin influences the  accumulation and localization of miniparamyosin within thick  filaments.  This will be accomplished by over-expression of  paramyosin in the indirect flight muscles in lines producing  normal and elevated levels of miniparamyosin.  This goal is  based on observations that the amount of paramyosin  correlates with the level and pattern of miniparamyosin  accumulation.    The subcellular machinery of muscle cells that allows them  to carry out their contractile function consists of two sets  of complex filaments, termed thick and thin filaments, which  are arranged in parallel arrays within a larger structure  termed the myofibril.  In fully \"relaxed\" muscles, these  parallel arrays only partially overlap each other  Contraction occurs when the thick and thin filaments slide  over each other in a coordinated manner to increase the  extent of overlap, thereby shortening the myofibrils (and  thus shortening the cell), a process which requires  hydrolysis of ATP.  The \"motor\" which transduces the energy  of hydrolysis of ATP into movement is myosin, the major  component of the thick filaments.  In order to fully  understand how muscle cells function, it is necessary to  understand the fine molecular structure of the myofibril.  Recently, a new protein, termed miniparamyosin, has been  discovered as a component of thick filaments in a model  invertebrate, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.   This  project will explore the role that this newly-discovered  thick filament protein plays in the assembly and function of  myofibrils, and will undoubtedly lead to new insights into  those processes.  ***",
