 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618936  Molloy    This  36 month project will provide pedagogical and content enhancement for 240 different secondary teachers in a three county area of New York,Dutchess, Orange and Ulster counties.  There are a total of 53 secondary schools in these three districts.  The teachers will be teachers of chemistry, biology, physics, environmental science and computer science.    An average of slightly more than four teachers per school will be involved in the project over the three year period.  Each of the teachers will participate in two-two week workshops on the Marist College campus which will be content enrichment and pedagogical transformation.  They will work with the actual materials and instruments which will be delivered to their classrooms as well as  the 'van' drivers who will service their school.  A total of three vans will be operating from year two on with equipment to provide laboratories in chemistry, biology, physics, environmental science, and computer science.   The Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) have committed to providing increasing support in years two and three of the project and assuming full support in subsequent years.  Significant monetary and gifts in kind have been received and are promised which will make the cost share approximately 87% of the total reqested from the Foundation.  The project has an actual cost to the Foundation of less than $5,000 per teacher.",
