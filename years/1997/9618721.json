 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do leaders lead?  Why do followers follow?  Why are some leaders successful in some situations but unsuccessful in others?  Although scholars have long recognized the importance of leadership in social interaction, a solid conceptual hold on these basic and important questions has proven elusive.  This weakness has not precluded, however, a renewed scholarly interest in leadership.  Leaders are central to many current  and prominent accounts of economic firms, social and political groups, policy outputs, and political institutions, yet our understanding of the dynamics of the leader-follower relationship remains incomplete.  This Doctoral Dissertation research will addresses a basic question>  how and when can leaders strategically employ information to induce a Pareto-enhancing norm among a set of rational followers?  Specifically, it develops and tests a series of models that explicitly map leadership signals onto follower strategies, and examines how this mapping changes as one systematically alter the environmental context in which leaders and followers interact.  The research consists of two components.  In the first, a series of simple game-theoretic models are developed of leaders, followers, and the leadership process. These  models offer a distinct conceptualization of leadership:  Leaders `lead` because they are able and motivated to disseminate information that affects the strategy selection of followers. Leadership, then, is the act and process by which leaders disseminate information in order to crate a series of socially beneficial norms.  From these models, hypotheses are derived to address how and when leaders will successfully employ information to affect outcomes.  The models highlight both the strategic context in which leader sand followers interact as well as the informational conditions surrounding their interaction.  The second component consists of testing these models under laboratory conditions.  Game-theoretic models, critically dependent on such concepts as `beliefs` and `information,` are extraordinarily difficult to test in the natural world.  Experimental designs, through their tremendous levels of control, offer the potential of a direct test with a high level of internal validity.  This investigation promises to provide insight into the nature of leadership in social and political interaction.  It will shed light on the circumstances under which leaders can productively employ information as a tool of their trade, and will increase our understanding of why individuals follow some leaders but not others.",
