 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will be used to partially support the renovation of research and research training laboratories in the Eric Johnston Science Center on the campus of Whitworth College.  Constructed in 1966 and never renovated, the building houses the departments of Biology, Chemistry and Physics.  Primarily configured as a classroom facility, the science center can no longer support current or future research programs due to the poor design of and the limited amount of adequate space.  In view of this, the College has embarked upon a long range plan that encompasses the construction of a new addition to the existing structure in conjunction to renovating the building.  ARI funds will be used to renovate space currently used for research and research training activities in Johnston.  Renovations will consist of:  reconfiguring space, upgrading HVAC, plumbing, and electrical systems, and installing new fume hoods, casework and safety systems. The project will aid biology faculty and their students as they investigate problems in the areas of cell and molecular biology, freshwater microbial biology, plant genetics and plant ecology.  Improvements to chemical research space will allow faculty to conduct research in organic, physical and biochemistry in a safer environment.  Renovating physics laboratory space will not only provide dedicated space for research investigations, but will also provide space for two student projects: night airglow and postural stability studies. It is anticipated that the improved infrastructure will  increase faculty productivity and training opportunities for students to  partner with faculty in scientific research.",
