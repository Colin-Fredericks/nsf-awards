 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Virginia Tech Summer Experience for Undergraduates in Mathematical  Models of Elastic Materials will concentrate on mathematical problems in  material science.  A broad segment of Virginia Tech's mathematics faculty  is involved in research on this subject and that involvement has generated  strong research ties to other departments and to industry.  The subject is  ideal for  introducing undergraduates to mathematical research because it  applies a wide range of mathematical disciplines to a readily  understandable physical setting.  Furthermore, it uses foundational  undergraduate mathematical techniques in new and challenging ways while  pointing to more advanced techniques needed for a deeper understanding.    The program will introduce undergraduate students to the mathematical  fundamentals of materials science,  expose them to a broad variety of  mathematical techniques and applications, and guide them in individual and  group  projects. The following are key components of the program.    1. The program will feature a broad mathematical approach that will expose  students to applications of partial differential equations, group theory,  and scientific computing.    2. The program will have a strong interdisciplinary component that will  expose the students to ideas and language of engineers, geologists, and  computer scientists.    3. The program will have a strong industrial component that will expose  students to the applications of mathematics in industry and government  labs.    4. The program will use its interdisciplinary nature to help students focus  on careers in mathematics and the sciences.    5. The program will use distance learning via the internet and  teleconferencing to build a team environment among the undergraduate  researchers and to help build the foundational skills needed for success in  the intensive six-week on-campus session.",
