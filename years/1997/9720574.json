 "awd_abstract_narration": "9720574  Logar     In this project, artificial intelligence techniques, specifically neural networks and fuzzy logic, will be applied to the problem of generating a global cloud mask. This system will be able to distinguish cloud from non-cloud pixels in satellite imagery and will be used by the EOS project located in Huntsville, Alabama. The presence of clouds, which is an important factor in studying global climate shifts, must be correlated over time, for the entire earth, on a daily basis. The amount of data which must be analyzed precludes the use of a human expert to determine the percentage of cloud cover in these scenes. The method for accomplishing this task will be to improve upon and extend previous work in four areas: feature selection, the use of thresholds, the impact of adding layers to the structure, and pixel unmixing.    Initial efforts have been made to incorporate a fuzzy logic component into the selection criteria, but a larger data set is needed to adequately test the effectiveness of the method. One of the difficulties faced when classifying satellite data is that of mixed pixels, that is, a single pixel which contains multiple classes. The possibility of using a neural network for this type of problem has recently been suggested and will be investigated both for the cloud classification project and on data supplied by remote sensing groups working on the ocean color problem.    This project is supported by the POWRE program, which will allow the PI to spend a sabbatical at the University of Alabama, Huntsville, where she will be able to interact with experts in the area of remote sensing and will have easy access to satellite data. This will provide a new research direction for the PI and her students, and increase the visibility of women at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.",
