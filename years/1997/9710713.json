 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project EFFECT is a technology and curriculum based project  promoting the recruitment, retention and success of  undergraduate women in the academic and professional fields  of science, engineering and mathematics. Project EFFECT will  use a multi-faceted approach, building upon existing work at  Washington State University.  The project will empower women  as they strive to succeed in the existing university  structure and will facilitate the process of effecting  permanent change toward equitable pedagogical techniques in  SEM courses.  Empowerment will be achieved through a dual  effort consisting of a Bridge Program designed to give women  a fast-start in their academic careers complemented by  either a concentrated series of technology seminars, or a  course specifically designed to equip students with critical  survival skills, including technological skills, self  awareness and self-confidence.  University faculty  and  graduate students will be involved in Innovation Workshops  designed around pedagogically sound practices that create  equitable learning environments for all constituents.  Research projects will be conducted in conjunction will all  facets of the project.  All materials developed should be  replicable at other institutions.",
