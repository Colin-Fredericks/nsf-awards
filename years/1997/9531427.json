 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9531427  Kowbel       This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is devoted to demonstrating the uniqueness of corrosion protection of silicon carbide ceramics (SiC-SiC composites).  The SiC-SiC composites used as the substrate contain high temperature creep resistant chemical vapor reaction (CVR) SiC fibers developed by the firm. These fibers are expected to greatly enhanced market penetrations of chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) SiC-SiC composites in energy-related markets by providing high benefit to cost ratios.  However, the use of these composites in corrosive environments at temperatures above 1200 degrees C calls for corrosion protection coatings.  The alumina (SiCw - A12O3) coatings produced in Phase I offer a great potential in this area.  The successful completion of Phase I demonstrated dense, adherent, crack-free, thermal shock resistant coatings deposited on a SiC substrate.  In the Phase II this technology will be extended to include SiC-SiC tubular substrates with the goal of achieving excellent corrosion protection at temperatures up to 1400 degrees C.  In addition, efforts will be made to obtain high fracture toughness SiCw-Al2O3 coatings on SiC substrates.  The success of the Phase II effort will ensure several commercial applications of this technology in energy-related, cutting tools as well as other areas.     The potential applications include heat exchanger tubes, gas turbine engines, advanced aircraft engines, heat engine, filter applications and cutting tools.   ***",
