 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER Award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry Program supports the research and education plans of Charles R.   Cornman of the North Carolina State University.  The goal of the proposed   research is to develop metal-based complexes that can mediate biological   signal transduction.  An aim is to define the details of vanadate   inhibition of protein tyrosine  phosphatases (PTPs), which are components   of signal cascades that regulate growth and cell differentiation, and to   use this knowledge to prepare vanadium-polypeptides that should act as   inhibitors of specific PTPs.       Vanadium complexes will be designed in an attempt to control   specific intracellular signals pertaining to cell growth and disease.  An   introductory chemistry course will be developed that allows for exploring   shared interests between instructors and students, with electronic   communications enhancing this interaction.  In a second educational   project, student groups will propose a project to reproduce a published   result with real-world constraints of time, cost and instrument   availability.",
