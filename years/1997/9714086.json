 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carroll College established the Greene Field Station in 1069  as an outdoor laboratory for teaching and research by the  students and faculty at Carroll College.  The 60-acre  Station is part of a primary environmental corridor in  Waukesha County. Significant ecological resources  include a calcareous fen, a class I trout stream, native wet  prairie, and a large cattail marsh.  The diversity of  aquatic habitats the Greene Field Station particularly  important for studies of wetland ecology.  The Greene Field  Station Advisory Committee is engaged in a strategic  planning process to produce a management plan for the Field  Station.  The goal is to enhance the effectiveness  of the Field Station as a resource for researches and  educators from Carroll and throughout the region.  Carroll  College wishes to ensure that this process will maximize  input from both current and prospective of the Field  Station.  The two strategies to accomplish this goal are: 1)  to convene a conference on Natural Areas Management  Planning, and 2) to solicit critical analysis of the  strategic plan through a focus group of current and  potential Field Station users.    The Natural Areas Management Planning Conference will bring  together students, faculty, and professionals from  throughout the upper Midwest.  At the conference,  participants will share results of research relevant to the  management of natural areas.  Proceedings from the  conference will be distributed to all conference  participants and other interested parties.  Participants  will also be engaged in discussions of the critical elements  of natural areas management planning, using the  Green Field Station as a case study.  This will provide the  Greene Field Station Advisory Committee with input from a  wide variety of experts to ensure a comprehensive strategic  plan for the Field Station.  The conference will also  increase exposure of potential users to the Field Station as  asignificant regional resource for education and research.    The Fie ld Station Advisory Committee will use input from the  Conference to develop the strategic plan for the Field  Station.  The Committee will then circulate the plan to  twelve critical readers selected from current and  prospective users of the Field Station.  These readers will  meet with the Committee to discuss specific recommendations.  Suggested revisions will be incorporated into the final  management plan, which is expected to be completed by the  spring of 2000.",
