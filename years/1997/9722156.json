 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of nonlinear dynamics and chaos has had  significant applications to a large variety of disciplines  in science and engineering.  The research component of this  proposal focuses on one problem: nonlinear digital  communication with chaos, which is of fundamental importance  in science, and has significant applications to digital  communication that plays an extremely important role in a  modern economy and in national security.  Specifically, we  plan to investigate the fundamental theory of utilizing  chaos to transmit digital information for communication and  to develop practical algorithms for designing chaotic  information sources.  The potential advantages of nonlinear  digital communication devices include greater efficiency,  light weight, compactness, greater information-bearing  capacity, greater number of communication channels, low-cost  manufacturing, low probability of interception and  detection.  The education component emphasizes on vigorous  and innovative methods of undergraduate and graduate  teaching, and solid training of graduate students on  research.  This NSF Career Award, which is supported by the Division of  Physics and the Experimental Program to Simulate Competitive  Research (EPSCoR) Program in Kansas, will provide a  supporting base for initiating an important new area in  frontier interdisciplinary science.  The PI's long-term  career goal is to establish a strong research and education  program on nonlinear science at the University of Kansas.",
