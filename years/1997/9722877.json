The study will benefit  from data on the more than 100 construction-related  excavations currently underway in Seoul.    Excavations and tunnels are constructed adjacent to and  beneath thousands of buildings each year, and with each  instance, there is the possibility of damage to structures.  With ever increasing demands being placed on limited urban  space, subsurface construction projects will continue to  increase.  This research effort will combine the expertise,  facilities and data of the American and Korean research  groups to assess how best to deal with potential damage to  structures due to nearby subsurface construction.  ***",
