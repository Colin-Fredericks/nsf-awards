 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer networks are an important technology that contributes to collaborative   work among engineers, which is one type of `knowledge networking'.  This exploratory   study investigates an important assumption frequently made by both technical developers   of software tools, and by researchers interested in the conditions and consequences of   using computer-based systems: that knowledge networking in design and other fields will   reduce the need for co-location.  This research aims to develop a framework that will   provide insight into how co-location requirements_and hence requirements for   information technology mediation---vary across design tasks. The results of his project   will help us to better understand the information-technology-related and task oriented   factors that underlay co-location requirements. This will help researchers and practitioners   to target large technology investments where they will do the most good, and will help to   avoid encouraging the use of ineffective and even productivity-decreasing organizational   information technology structures where co-location is essential. The research will be   based on intensive interviews with mechanical and electrical engineering designers and   software developers in five to ten firms.",
