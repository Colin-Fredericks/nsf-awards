This will be only the second large conference devoted exclusively to this topic.  The first, held in 1993, was also a Keystone Symposium that we organized.  The excitement generated by this well-attended first meting led us to conclude that it is the same as those for this second meeting.  We continue in our attempt to join two fields that have just begun to collaborate.  The first field is molecular genetics of plant development where the most exciting work is currently focusing on (i) identifying the regulatory genes directing patterns of cell differentiation and (ii) understanding how genomic plasticity contributes to generating the vast morphological diversity observed in the plant kingdom.  The second field is morphological and molecular plant evolution, with exciting work both in the use of molecular methods to establish evolutionary history of higher plants, and on new ideas of how plant morphology has evolved. There have been profound discoveries in plant biology since 1993 including the isolation of the first plant resistance genes, the demonstration that floral induction is evolutionarily conserved in diverse species, the synteny of plant genomes, and the isolation of genes responsible for major morphological differences in closely related plants.  By concentrating on these and other recent advances in plant developmental biology that shed light on evolutionary history or mechanisms, our program is able to focus on an intellectually coherent and challenging set of topics.  Students and postdoctorals should benefit tremendously from the multidisciplinary tone of the talks and the discussions since they have a tendency to focus intensely on narrow research projects.  This meeting should be a well-spring of new research directions that can be integrated into their plans for the future.",
