The first, which is updated annually, relies exclusively on the published Reports of the Court's decisions.  The second includes unpublished conference votes and opinion assignments of the justices who served during the Vinson (1946-1952) and Warren (1953-1968) Courts.  This project will update and extend the previous work to encompass the Burger Court (1969-1986).  Inclusion of the Burger Court conference vote data will provide investigators with the complete voting record of each justice in every case in which a conference vote was cast during a 40-term period,. 1945-1986.  Analysts will have access to a standardized, highly reliable data file with which they may compare individual and Court voting across vote types, as well as voting changes of individual justices from one type of vote to another.  Because a raft of background, chronological, substantive, outcome, and opinion variables are associated with these votes, the richness of the resulting data will enhance the formulation of theory and the testing of hypotheses.    %%%  Since 1989, the investigator has produced two major data bases on the U.S. Supreme Court.
