 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603611  Sejnowski    MCell is a general purpose software tool that allows users  to accurately simulate a wide variety of the signaling  processes carried out by living cells.  Many cells secrete  signal molecules that are detected by receptor molecules on  the surfaces of other cells.  Since this involves diffusion  of the signal molecule over a distance between the cells, it  is necessary to take into account the shapes of the cells  and the locations of the molecules to accurately predict the  speed and strength of signaling. MCell is unique in its  generality and in the way it simulates cellular signaling  using random numbers and probabilities, a so-called \"Monte  Carlo\" method. MCell has already been used to simulate  synapses, which are specialized microscopic structures where  communication takes place between nerve cells, called  neurons.  It can also be used for more general cellular  signaling between and within cells, not just neurons, so it  will be useful to a wide range of scientists who are  interested in problems such as how cells divide and how this  process may be subverted in the case of cancer.  MCell will  be tested initially by a group of scientists who want to use  it to answer questions that arise in their research into  signaling between neurons.  This will help in making the  program easier to use and more flexible in its application  to an even wider range of biological and chemical problems.  Two educational workshops will be held to teach scientists  how to use MCell and to exchange ideas and results obtained  with MCell.",
