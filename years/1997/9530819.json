 "awd_abstract_narration": "95-30819  DAGG  This research project is part of the US Joint Global Ocean  Flux Study (JGOFS) Southern Ocean Program aimed at (1 ) a  better understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both organic  and inorganic, in the Southern Ocean, (2) identifying the  physical, ecological and biogeochemical factors and processes  which regulate the magnitude and variability of these fluxes,  and (3) placing these fluxes into the context of the  contemporary global carbon cycle.    Large phytoplankton, especially diatoms, typically grow  slowly in the permanently ice-free regions of the Southern  Ocean, including the Antarctic Polar Front Zone (APFZ),  because of micronutrient (Fe) limitation or light limitation  or limitation associated with deep mixing. It is hypothesized  that under these conditions the growth of large phytoplankton  is approximately balanced by grazing from the copepod  community. When growth of large phytoplankton is enhanced by  Fe inputs or improved light conditions, it is hypothesized  that the additional growth is mostly absorbed by the  functional response of the copepod community. Larger  enhancements of phytoplankton growth however, will saturate  the grazing on diatoms increases the Si:C ratio of sinking  matter because approximately 70% of ingested carbon is  assimilated across the copepod gut wall but Si is digestively  inert. These relationships will be addressed by shipboard  experiments designed to measure the feeding rates of large  copepods on large phytoplankton of the APFZ, and by  measurements of the ratio of carbon to biogenic silica in  copepod fecal pellets and in sediment trap materials.",
