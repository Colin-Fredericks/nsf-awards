Theofanous, UCSB    Partial support for travel expenses will be provided to selected participants to an university-industry Workshop on Multifluid Science and Technology, to be held in Santa Barbara on February 28 to March 1, 1997.   The main objective is to evaluate the research, education and organizational needs, and on this basis to initiate an organization for fostering synergism between fundamental research and industrial needs and supporting the multidisciplinary multifluid community.  The multifluid/multiphase community has been fragmented among various disciplines and areas of relevance, without sufficient benefit of cross-fertilization of the methods of investigation and research results.  The proposed meeting will explore ways to promote interdisciplinary and industry-university synergism, group activities and representation with other organizations.  The second part of the meeting will be dedicated to technical presentations and scientific exchanges.  This workshop aims to generate an organizational framework in order to better advance multifluid sciences and technological developments in the U.S. by promoting on a continuous basis better communication, synergism, high quality research and education in the field.",
