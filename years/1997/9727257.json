The ten day conference will provide an opportunity for academic and industrial researcher of the united States and Mexico, other invited guests, and graduate students, to exchange ideas and research results with the aim of enhancing the overall research effort reducing duplication, and encouraging cooperation among the participants.  Sian Ka'an 97 will follow the general plan of the very successful Sian Ka'an 95, which was held in September, 1995.  the conference is comprised of three main stands: keynote addresses and panel discussions by leader sin the field, poster sessions for contributed papers, and practical experience with interesting neural network and neurocontrol applications.  Approximately twenty speaker have been invited to present keynote talks describing the state of the art  of topics related to the development of the theoretical and applied aspects of neural networks and neurocontrol.  Groups of several related talks will be followed by an informal discussion in the form of panel chaired by one of the keynote speakers.  Invited and contributed papers will be presented in poster sessions to allow for discussion of particular research results.  The conference will also include a hands-on workshop for students and beginners interested in having some practice and more basic information about the topics addressed in the conference presentations and poster sessions.",
