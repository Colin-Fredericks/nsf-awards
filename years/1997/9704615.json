 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704615  Hunter    The principal investigator is proposing to investigate two classes of   phenomena that are relevant to the dynamics of galaxies. One is that of   instabilities and modes, and the other is that of bifurcations of orbits. The   work is analytical and is based on the approximation that galaxies are   collisionless stellar systems. That approximation is based on the belief that   most of the mass of galaxies is in the form of stars and dark matter, which   move, without mutual collisions, on orbits whose form is determined by the   total gravity field of the galaxy. N-body simulations of galaxies have shown   that both instabilities and large-scale modes of oscillation do occur, and that   their occurrence depends on the orbital  population of the galaxy. Modes   occur when all the orbits pulsate in a coherent manner, while instability   occurs when the collective response of the orbital population to a   disturbance is to reinforce it and make it grow. The principal investigator   will seek detailed descriptions of these possibilities to help explain the   underlying dynamics.  He has developed a new technique for the accurate   location and tracking of modes and instabilities. The bifurcations to be   investigated are those at which the form and stability of orbits change. The   nature of the orbits is crucial to the structure of a galaxy. Though the two   classes of phenomena are to be investigated separately, they are likely    interrelated.    Galaxies are of interest because they are the fundamental building blocks of   the Universe. A typical galaxy is composed of hundreds of billions of stars,   each of which moves on its own individual orbit according to well-known   physical laws of dynamics. The primary interest of the principal investigator   is in the stability of such systems, and a secondary interest is in the nature of   the orbits and the ways in which they can change. One determines whether   or not a system is stable by studying how it responds when it is pertur bed.   The response may be a mode in which all the orbits manage to pulsate   regularly in unison. Alternatively, disturbances dissipate and decay when   there is stability, or reinforce and grow when there is instability. Each type   of behavior has been observed in computer experiments. What this work   seeks is theoretical understanding of underlying causes. It will be carried   out using mathematical models, which are of necessity statistical because of   the large number of stars to be represented, and a combination of   mathematical analysis and computation. Galaxies are known to have existed   over a large fraction of the age of the Universe, and hence should be free of   all but the mildest instabilities. Hence any findings concerning the   requirements for stability is in principle testable against observations of the   present day dynamical structure of galaxies.",
