The objectives of the center are (1) performance of research of direct benefit to producers and users of steel, (2) eduaation of graduate students by involvement in research programs of theoretical and practical interest to the steel-producing and steel-using industries, (3) enhancement of undergraduate education related to steel, and (4) development of a national forum for steel producers, steel users, government, and academe to stimulate advances in the science and technology of the processing, quality, and application of steel.  Efficient transfer of technology is a major goal of the center, and it was among the top three centers in the   Industry/University Cooperative Research Center Program last year in technology transfer.  More than 60 students have graduated with the M.S. or Ph.D degrees resulting from Center support, and there are 23 graduate students currently supported by the Center.",
