 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701125  Wallace   Graduate student Wendy Applequist, under the guidance of Dr. Robert Wallace at Iowa State University, is studying the phylogenetic or genealogical relationships of plants in the four caryophyllalean families of Basellaceae, Cactaceae, Didiereaceae, and Portulacaceae, making use of botanical garden materials and field collections amassed over the years at Iowa State. The morphological features of flowers and fruits used traditionally in the classification of these plants, especially the c. 500 species of purslanes (Portulacaceae), are suspected to be unreliable in marking evolutionary groups, perhaps due to repeated, convergent adaptations in arid or desert habitats. New evidence from DNA sequences of the chloroplast genome is being sought to provide a large number of variable yet informative characters (mutations or nucleotide substitutions) that can be used to measure genetic divergences among these plants. In turn, a reliable phylogenetic framework for these plants will enable the study of their historical biogeography and patterns of adaptation to various desert regions of the world.   The plants traditionally treated in the four caryophyllalean families listed above present interesting problems of evolution, biogeography, and adaptation, mostly in arid or desert habitats of the world, and primarily on the southern continents of South America, Africa, and Australia. Disentangling patterns caused by ancient continental drift from more recent dispersals and migrations has been impossible without a reliable phylogeny for the group, based on genetic features not directly affected by habitat conditions. This project is a focused effort to construct a phylogenetic framework for these plants from DNA sequence information, augmented by the morphological, chromosomal, and anatomical data in hand.",
