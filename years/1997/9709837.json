 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atomic level studies of structure and reactivity of bimetallic  surfaces are carried out in this research project supported by  the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities.  Professor Koel and his coworkers  at the University of Southern California have developed ultra  high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope instrumentation which  allows the identification of adsorption sites and molecular  adsorbates on metallic surfaces.  Correlations between reactivity  of model bimetallic surfaces and the atomic level structure and  occupation of step and defect sites on these surfaces will be  made.  Pt-Sn alloy surfaces, and Pd thin films on refractory  metal substrates are being examined, and various hydrocarbon  reactions on these surfaces, including acetylene trimerization to  form benzene, are being probed.  Insights gained from these  studies will be valuable in developing our understanding of  important catalytic processes.    Correlations between atomic level structure of bimetallic  surfaces and the reaction chemistry of these surfaces are being  made in this research project.  Hydrocarbon reactions relevant to  heterogeneous catalysis are examined on well characterized Pt-Sn  and Pd-Mo substrates, in order to probe the effect of metal atom  ensembles and defect sites on these surfaces.  Atomic level  characterization using scanning probe microscopy forms the basis  of these studies which will provide insight into the operation of  important catalytic systems.",
