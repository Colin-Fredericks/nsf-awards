These are nanocomposite materials in  which there exists a continuous meal matrix with inclusions  of an immiscible nonmagnetic phase (e.g., Al2 O3).  Using  the language of percolation theory, they may be described as  well above the critical concentration, with a percolating  magnetic phase.  While recent years have seen an upsurge in  granular metals research, metal-rich materials have been  largely ignored due to the absence of the giant  magnetoresistance effect.  Although natural in the course of  research, this state of affairs should not persist; metal  rich systems offer several promising avenues of  research,  both in applied and fundamental science.  Compared with  granular metals below the percolation transition, these  materials are both easier to study and more technologically  promising.  There are two principle reasons for this:  There is no difficulty evaluating the effects of a particle  size distribution, and The net magnetization is much  greater, and Tc may be well above room temperature.  This proposal will detail two studies of these materials.  The first deals with the fundamental nature of magnetism in  disordered systems, while the second addresses a possible  application.  Respectively the projects are:  A study of the  magnetic phase transition as the nonmagnetic impurities  reduce the magnetic correlation length, and An evaluation of  potential magnetic recording characteristics of hard  magnetic alloys with nonmagnetic impurities.  %%%  This vibrating sample magnetometer will be used to perform  research on the magnetic properties of metal-rich granular  ferromagnetic solids.
