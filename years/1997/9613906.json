The objective of this research program is to develop a  mathematical model for analyzing the problem of lateral flow  and liquefaction-induced large ground movement during and  following an earthquake. The model is based on a two-phase  mixture theory, and involves the development of a finite  element code capable of representing the behavior of  saturated soils prior to and during liquefaction. Prior to  liquefaction, the soil is represented by an already-  validated effective-stress phenomenological constitutive  model based on an elastoplastic formulation with nonlinear  kinematic hardening. During liquefaction, the liquefied soil  is represented by a total-stress viscoplastic model whose  viscosity is determined from extensive numerical simulations  with random suspensions of spheres. The two constitutive  models are developed within the framework of a finite  deformation theory based on multiplicative plasticity. The  resulting finite element model is used to study the  mechanism of liquefaction-related large ground displacement,  including the lateral flow and prediction of the free ground  surface resulting from such flow.    Two case studies are considered in order to validate the  model. The first involves a loose saturated sample of  Toyoura sand submerged in water and sloped inside a test  subjected to dynamic excitation, causing the soil to liquefy  and flow like a viscous fluid. The second study involves a  re-analysis of the nonlinear ground response recorded by a  downhole array in Port Island (reclaimed ground near  downtown Kobe City, Japan) during the earthquake of January  17, 1995, focusing on the impact of this changed soil  behavior during liquefaction. The ground response is  simulated assuming a condition of vertically propagating  seismic waves, with a full kinematical coupling of the three  components of motion.",
