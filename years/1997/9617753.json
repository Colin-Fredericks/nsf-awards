This award will allow the  acquisition of a Europa 20/20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer with  an ANCAautosampler to analyze 15N and 13C enrichments in samples  from aquatic and marine systems. It will be housed in the  laboratory of Dr. Deborah Bronk at the University of Georgia's  Department of Marine Sciences; she will oversee its maintenance,  and supervise and coordinate the processing of samples. This  instrument will serve as a valuable resource for other researchers  at the University of Georgia, the Marine Institute on Sapelo  Island, and the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography. Faculty and  researchers at these institutions have research projects in a  number of different areas which desperately need or would benefit  from access to the mass spectrometer. These projects include  studies on the relationship between inorganic and organic nitrogen  uptake, contrasting the composition and utilization of dissolved  organic nitrogen at two Land Margin Ecosystem Research sites in  Chesapeake Bay and two coastal rivers of Georgia, refining  estimates of new and regenerated phytoplankton production in the  Ross Sea  as part of U.S. JGOFS, defining the nitrogen and carbon  content of riverine dissolved organic matter and the transport and  chemical transformations of this material as it moves to the  coastal zone, developing methods to quantify fungal productivity  with 13C tracers, determining rates of denitrification and benthic  photosynthesis, and defining nitrogen budgets on the Southeastern  continental shelf. This instrument will also be used in a  semiannual course under development at the University of Georgia  on tracer theories and stable isotope techniques. The University  of Georgia is providing an equal match to the federal support.",
