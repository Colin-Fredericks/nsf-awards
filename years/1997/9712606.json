 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712606  Rohrer    Systems based on solar activated titania photocatalysts have the  potential to effectively and economically remove or degrade toxic  impurities in air and water.  Recent research conducted by the  principal investigator of this proposal has recently demonstrated  that some surfaces of titania, TiO2, are better at catalyzing the  relevant reactions than others.  If the anisotropy of this  catalytic property were understood more completely, it might be  possible to improve the reactivity of titania photocatalysts  through structural or microstructural modifications.  Therefore,  the objective of this project is to define this  orientation-reactivity relationship and to identify the mechanism  responsible for this phenomenon.  The photocatalytic activity of  surfaces with known orientations will be determined using direct  microscopic analysis.  Electron back scattered diffraction  patterns will be used to determine the surface orientations of  many grains in a titania polycrystal and Auger electron  spectroscopy will be used to assess the surface chemical  compositions of the same grains.  After using atomic force  microscopy (AFM) to determine the morphological structure of each  surface, they will be used to photocatalyze the reduction of Ag+  from aqueous solution.  The amount of silver deposited on each  grain will be estimated on the basis of AFM images and taken as a  measure of the relative reactivity of each surface.  Parallel  experiments will be conducted on low index, homogeneous, high  purity titania epi-layers grown on sapphire. Based on such  measurements, we will determine the orientation dependence of the  relative photocatalytic activity.  %%%  The outcome from this GOALI project will be a surface  orientation-surface property relationship for the photocatalytic  activity of titania.  Defining this relationship will not only  advance our inowledge of titania photochemistry, it will also  demonstrate methods that can be used to systematically determine  the full  orientation dependence of other surface phenomena such  as corrosion and wear.  ***",
