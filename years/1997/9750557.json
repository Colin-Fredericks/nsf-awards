 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to modernize the laboratory curriculum, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) is being introduced into several chemistry labs.  The principles of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry have been taught in organic and analytical chemistry courses, but experience with a GC-MS instrument is introducing students to this technique and expanding and complementing other spectroscopic methods of structure determination including UV/vis, infrared and NMR used in organic chemistry laboratories.  In instrumental analysis labs in the analytical chemistry course, GC-MS is providing students with a method for quantitative and definitive analysis of complex mixtures. GC-MS is being introduced into the first-year general college chemistry course where it is being used to demonstrate the existence of isotopes and determine natural abundance of chemical elements. Experiments are being developed to take advantage of the unique power of GC-MS to both separate and identify mixtures of chemical compounds.  All students in organic, analytical and general chemistry (300400 per year) are benefiting from this project.  Students in the chemical technology program especially need profit from this experience with GC-MS, an analytical technique that is widely used and in demand by local industries and laboratories. This project helps prepare students for employment and meets the needs of local employers for this critical skill.   *",
