 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL) is sponsoring a series of workshops that continues the current focus on programs that work, and incorporates a more intentional focus on institutions that work. Our intent is to build networks of individuals and institutions, regionally and nationally, that are committed to working together to transform science, mathematics, engineering, and technology programs in institutions of all kinds, in all parts of the country.    Building on the similar prior activities, the project will host workshops during 1997 - 1998. Each workshop will involve 10 - 14 presenters who are recognized within their disciplinary and educational community as reflective practitioners in the field of educational reform. Teams of approximately three people, from 20 - 24 different institutions, will participate in each workshop; host sites for each of the workshops will be institutions that are demonstrably seeking to transform their undergraduate SME&T programs. Topics to be covered by the series of workshops include the wide range of issues that must be addressed by faculty and administrators in the process of achieving institutional and programmatic reform that succeeds over the long-term.    These workshops fit into the larger goals of PKAL: to facilitate comprehensive reform at over 500 colleges and universities across the country, by equipping institutional teams for their leadership role; to provide leadership opportunities for the PKAL Faculty for the 21st Century network; and to encourage national action supportive of local efforts to enhance and improve undergraduate SME&T. Extensive activities have been planned to disseminate materials from the workshop (particularly through the World Wide Web) and to evaluate the impact of PKAL activities on participating campuses.",
