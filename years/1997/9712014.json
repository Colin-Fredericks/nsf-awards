Worth Museum of Science and History will plan activities  related to their proposed exhibit \"Texas Pre-History: How Do We  Know?\"  This will be a 10,000 sq. ft. permanent exhibit along with  a traveling exhibit and education program menu and will feature a  constructivist approach to inquiry-based learning focusing on  archaeological and paleontological fieldwork being carried out in  Texas today.  Research sites prominently featured in the exhibit  will be several early Cretaceous dinosaur sites excavated by  paleontologists Louis Jacobs, and Dale Winkler, Southern Methodist  University, and archaeological sites from early Clovis and Dalton  Periods being excavated under the direction of archeologist Reid  Ferring, University of North Texas.  The exhibits and complementary  activities will explore the questions a) what is being learned  about the prehistory of Texas b) how do scientists interpret their  findings and c) what don't we know?    With this planning grant, they will conduct extensive front end  studies to identify key questions that visitors will have when they  come to the exhibit.  Meetings with advisors to develop a  conceptual plan for the exhibit and educational materials.  During  these sessions such questions as the following will be explored.   A) \"How can the Museum pre-design multiple mysteries and outcomes  to satisfy the interest of diverse visitors...\", b) can the museum  combine paleontology and archaeology without perpetuating the naive  notion that dinosaurs and people lived at the same time, c) what  materials and policies will be developed to handle the creationism  vs evolution that might arise, and d) how will the challenges of  circulating the traveling exhibit be addressed?  Museum staff will  travel to other museums to examine model exhibits, and project  staff will work with teachers to develop project-related formal  education programs.",
