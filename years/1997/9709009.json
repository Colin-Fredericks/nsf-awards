 "awd_abstract_narration": "9709009  Nadler  The University of Califomia Davis Nematode Collection (UCDNC) is known world-wide as having one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of plant parasitic, free-living soil, freshwater, and marine nematodes. The type slide collection includes more than 11,000 specimens, including 3,454 primary types representing 930 species and 14 of the 18 recognized orders. The general slide collection includes more than 53,000 specimens representing 2,221 species and 16 orders. Thus, the collection conserves original specimens from descriptions of new species, voucher specimens associated with nematology research, and specimens from surveys throughout the world. These specimens are used by scientists studying nematodes for research in comparative morphology, taxonomy, evolution, ecology, biological control, and agriculture. Efficient collection resources are essential for nematology research, not only because nematodes are among the most diverse and abundant multicellular groups of organisms, but because they have significant impact on human activities (e.g., plant parasites and agriculture, vertebrate parasites and animal husbandry, human health). As a large reference source of identified specimens, the UCDNC is extremely useful for precise identifications in nematology-related research. This project will provide a new system for storing slides to decrease the frequency of specimen damage, facilitate monitoring of slides for deterioration, and increase access to specimens for research purposes. The storage system to be employed has proved to be very efficient (in other nematode collections), and is necessary to ensure the long-term conservation of the specimens.",
