 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many sensory organs receive information back from the brain by a nerve   supply called efferent innervation, which can modulate the sensory signals   carried to the brain by the incoming, or afferent, innervation.  The statocyst   organs of cephalopod invertebrates (cuttlefish, squid, octopus) are sensors used   for control of balance and posture, and have many features remarkably similar to   the vestibular parts of the vertebrate inner ear, also used for balance.  These   statocyst organs receive extensive efferent innervation, and one of the   compounds found here is nitric oxide (NO), which is currently of great interest in   mammalian nervous systems as a potential neurotransmitter or neuromodulator.    This project uses a multidisciplinary approach of physiology, pharmacology, and   anatomy to localize and characterize the activity of the enzyme nitric oxide   synthase (NOS), its product, NO, and interactions of NO with second messenger   systems such as cyclic GMP and cyclic AMP.  Results from this model   invertebrate system will be important beyond clarifying cephalopod statocyst   function, because they will provide a better understanding of evolutionary   convergence of equilibrium sense organs, and understanding of mechanisms of   action of NO, with broad implications for neuroscience in general.",
