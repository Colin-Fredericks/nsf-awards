 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enables chemistry and physics faculty to develop a comprehensive program of instruction in the theory and practice of modern nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  The new NMR spectrometer provides the first-ever NMR instrumentation for the college, and the resulting hands-on availability dramatically enhances the Chemistry Department's capabilities for conducting sophisticated experiments in the area of chemical structure determination.    Instruction in NMR is a joint venture of the chemistry and physics faculty.  Physics faculty concentrate primarily on teaching the theory and practical aspects of NMR hardware, and chemistry faculty concentrate on teaching chemical applications of NMR.  Chemistry and biology majors are introduced to the instrument in the first-year general chemistry course, and various aspects of NMR are taught in five subsequent chemistry/physics courses.  A multinuclear spectrometer has been selected in order to expand the NMR experience beyond the traditional organic chemistry applications.    This instrument allows students to gain continual hands-on experience with a modern NMR spectrometer.  This experience provides the laboratory background needed to clarify the abstract theoretical concepts that underlie modern NMR spectroscopy.  The instrument is well suited to function as both a teaching and research instrument.  Its modular construction allows its capabilities to be expanded to meet future teaching and research needs.  The diversity of new NMR experiments prepares students for future creative work with NMR instrumentation, and the NMR can significantly stimulate student interest in undergraduate research projects.  *",
