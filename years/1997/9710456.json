 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences   Directorate, Professor Hilkka I. Kenttamaa, of the Department of   Chemistry at Purdue University, carries out gas-phase studies of   substituted aromatic radicals, biradicals, and polyradicals.  By   generating aromatic radicals which incorporate a positively charged   group, Professor Kenttamaa is able to employ Fourier-transform ion   cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to examine their intrinsic or   solvent-free reactivity under clean conditions, permitting the assessment   of reaction rate constants, product branching ratios, and thermochemical   parameters such as bond dissociation energies.  Substituent effects are   explored for phenyl, benzyl, and other aromatic mono- and polyradicals   carrying neutral substituents in addition to the remote charged groups,   and radical traps are employed to probe the importance of polar effects   in different types of radical reactions.  For biradicals, the   relationship between reactivity and predicted ground state multiplicity   is examined, and this information is used to search for spin-selective   gas-phase reactions.  Professor Hilkka I. Kenttamaa, of the Department of Chemistry at Purdue   University, with the support of the Organic Dynamics Program and the   Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical   Sciences Directorate, studies the chemistry of molecules containing one   or more unpaired electrons (`radicals`).  By appropriate choice of   radicals, Professor Kenttamaa is able to employ gas-phase techniques to   study their formation and reactivity, permitting an assessment of their   intrinsic properties in the absence of the complicating influences of   solvents or other potentially reactive species.  Through these studies is   gained fundamental knowledge regarding the chemistry of   electron-deficient molecules, advancing the understanding of the roles of   substituent effects and polar effects in governing their reactivity and   offering potential advances in the areas of radical-based organic   synthesis and organic materials research.",
