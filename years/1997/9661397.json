The innovation in this project stems from the proposed modular design of the system components and the integration of these with off-the-shelf GIS.  While existing transit information system products are designed for single modes, such as mass transit, they generally have poor graphics and spatial intelligence for routing or trip planning.  None are presently GIS based, a major weakness given the emergence of use and power of this technology.  The project will research the necessary GIS spatial intelligence for a comprehensive CTIS and analyze the network integration and multimodal network representation problems that have constrained product development to date in this field.  The project will review current user needs by conducting an information systems analysis of a range of community transit services (e.g., rideshare, shuttle bus, dial-a-ride, paratransit).  Following the identification of the system components, these will be modeled to produce a concept design and functional specification.  The data modeling will employ established software engineering methodologies and techniques.  It is anticipated that the design will include recommendations on how to tie the transit related attributes to multiple network representations and display these on maps for travel information or trip planning purposes.  The research will investigate the feasibility of designing a system that can work with real-time data and provide the needed routing and scheduling information on-line.  Linkage to technologies such as Global Positioning by Satellite (GPS) and Automated Vehicle Location (AVL), and the potential for access to the CTIS on the Internet will also be researched.  The proposed design for a Community T ransit Information System is a timely response to the Transportation Demand Management program supported by the US Department of Transportation to combat traffic congestion and environmental pollution.  The technology will assist planners and users to meet transportation mobility needs in a more efficient and environmentally conscious manner.   The proposed product will be useful to all public transportation providers, including transit agencies, metropolitan planning organizations, local governments, cities and towns.  It will be compatible with leading GIS vendor products in order to take advantage of the spatial analysis tools and network analysis programs that these provide.  It will also be compatible with industry standard database technology.  Another feature of the approach taken by GIS/Trans, Ltd. is the integration with the firm's existing GIS and transportation products, so that users will be able to select their specific requirements from a suite of programs.  ***",
