This work has shown that thermal and  electromigration induced strains can be successfully  measured with 10 micron spatial resolution and with strain  sensitivities on the order of  0.0002 by X-ray  microdiffraction.  The past work has confirmed that linear  strain gradients develop during electromigration in  conductor lines with no reservoirs and that abrupt strain  relaxation occurs during the later stages of  electromigration under the conditions used in the studies.  The new project extends the work on a limited number of 10  micron-wide, 200 micron-long pure Al conductor lines to  narrower line widths with bamboo and near-bamboo  microstructures, to shorter lines which should be able to  sustain larger strain gradients, to A1(Cu) lines where  electromigration of Cu and of A1 can be separately followed  by X-ray microfluorescence, and finally to Cu and Cu(Sn)  lines, which should be more resistant to electromigration  than A1(Cu).  The work utilizes higher spatial resolution X-  ray instrumentation to extend composition, microstructure  and strain mapping to the submicron scale and to permit  measurements on single grains within polycrystalline  conductor lines.  The study includes transmission electron  microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and SEM-  based grain orientation mapping  observations as complements  to the X-ray microbeam microstructure, composition, and  strain mapping.  Finite element modeling is employed with  realistic microstructures and misorientation dependent grain-  boundary diffusivities.  The study will be extended to short  range, microstructure related strain gradients, and to  effects of pulsed and reversal current on electromigration  strains.  %%%  The expected significance of the research is that it  provides a better experimental base for underst anding  electromigration.   Successful direct measurements of strain  distributions during electromigration will provide tests and  focus for further theoretical work in this area.  ***",
