 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603028  Idriss    This award supports the participation of American scientists  in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Soil Behavior and Ground Response  for Hazard Assessment During Earthquakes to be held in  Hokkaido, Japan from July 1-2, 1997.  The co-organizers are  Professors I. M. Idriss of the University of California at  Davis and Kenji Ishihara of the Science University of Tokyo  in Japan.  This seminar will provide a forum for bringing  together up-to-date information on 1) liquefaction in  cohesionless soils, 2) the failure of cohesive soils, and 3)  the response of soil sites underlain by layers of soft  cohesive soils or layers that  tend to liquefy when subjected  to shaking.    Ground failure during earthquakes, as caused by liquefaction  in cohesionless soils and over-stressing of cohesive soils,  results in major damage to ports and harbors, buildings,  bridges, and other civil infrastructure facilities.  Gaining  an understanding of liquefaction in sandy soils and failure  in cohesive soils subjected to earthquakes is an important  first step in developing design guidelines to mitigate the  damages of earthquakes.  Natural disaster reduction is a  priority area for U.S.-Japan Cooperation.  The exchange of  ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will  enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will  set the stage for future collaborative projects.  ***",
