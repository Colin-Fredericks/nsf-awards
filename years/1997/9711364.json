 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs plan to develop Active Harmony, a software architecture that supports distributed execution of computational objects heterogeneous environments.  Principal features include: Dynamic execution environment: Active Harmony will attempt to maximize data affinity and load balancing through intelligent resource allocation and object migration.  Harmony will support an extensible metric interface to permit the sharing of resource capacity and utilization information among components in a distributed system.  Automatic application adaptation:  Active Harmony will export a detailed metric interface to applications, allowing them to access processor, network and operating system parameters.  Applications export tuning options to the system, which can then automatically optimize resource allocation.  Measurement and tuning can therefore become first class objects in the programming model.  Programmers can write applications that include ways to adapt computation to observed performance and changing conditions.  Shared-data interfaces:  Active Harmony will support shared-memory semantics among computational objects regardless of location, allowing both peer-to peer and client-server computations to exploit the simplified programming model and fine-grained sharing permitted by traditional shared-memory environments.  The unique aspect of the Active Harmony work is the emphasis on adapting to heterogeneous and changing environments and on inter-relationships between objects in the system. The primary result of this research will be an infrastructure and a set of algorithms that permit global resource optimization under changing conditions.",
