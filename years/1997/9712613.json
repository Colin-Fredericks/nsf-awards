 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Scott Creel  #9712613    This small grant for exploratory research (SGER) concerns  the development and application of microsatellite DNA  methods for genetic typing of African wild dogs from field  samples.  The PI's ongoing research has allowed a rare  opportunity to develop a new set of techniques that may have  far-reaching applicability.  Previous efforts in this study  to obtain blood and tissue samples have caused injury to the  animals, which cannot be tolerated in an endangered species.  Alternative means of analysis of DNA extracted from wasted  material of carnivores has been especially difficult, as the  quality if the DNA material is degraded.  However, new  techniques recently developed in this study have shown  promise in providing reliable and efficient means of genetic  analysis from samples collected in the field.  The project  is a novel, completely non-invasive approach to collection  of DNA from field populations.  This advanced could enable  the development and application of new techniques for many  animal species, which would be especially valuable in field  research and conservation of endangered species.",
