 "awd_abstract_narration": "Edward Grant of Purdue University is supported by the Experimental   Physical Chemistry Program to continue his research on state-to-state   photoionization and dynamics of intramolecular relaxation in highly   excited states of small molecules.  The main objective of this work is to   accumulate, for a number of polyatomic systems, state-detailed   spectroscopic information of sufficient resolution to support full-scale   Multichannel Quantum Defect Theory calculations.  Systems to be studied   include hydrocarbon and metal-centered free radicals that form   closed-shell cations.  The PI will use multiresonant excitation   techniques to make high-resolution spectroscopic measurements of resonant   lineshapes and energies associated with transitions to states which are   coupled to ionization and dissociation continua, and photoselection with   specialized detection methods to study rovibrational structure in the   electronic ground states of cations and precursor free radicals.    The effort to describe energy flow in isolated molecules has added   considerably to our understanding of chemical reactivity, and served for   many years as an important focus of research in chemical physics.  The   study of intramolecular relaxation remains today a vital point of contact   between experimental and theoretical molecular dynamics.  Particularly   important is the transfer of energy between electronic and internuclear   degrees of freedom.  The detailed dynamics of such processes can give   rise to significant chemical consequences.  For example, issues   associated with the dynamics of energy transfer between electronic   coordinates and internuclear ones underlie contemporary efforts to direct   the outcomes of chemical transformations.",
