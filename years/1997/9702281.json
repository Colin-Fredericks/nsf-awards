 "awd_abstract_narration": "Networks of workstations have been proposed for parallel computation, but slow  and unpredictable communication has made performance worse than expected.  This  project is developing a network interface that reduces the cost of sending  messages, to guarantee fast, fair, and predictable performance.  The essential  idea is to provide a virtual network interface for each user process, with  registers for message buffering and with a simplified process to process  communication path.  The project is investigating several design issues within  such an interface, including efficient user-level access to the interface, lazy  swapping of interface state, access control, interactions with the operating  system kernel, and network fairness.    The educational portion of this project updates the computer engineering  curriculum.  At the undergraduate level this includes course material on  processor architecture and pipelining.  At the graduate level a course in  advanced computer architecture is being developed, to span computer architecture  from technological constraints through operating systems requirements.  In  addition to course work, students will be involved in hands-on digital design.",
