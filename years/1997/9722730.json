This is the fifth in this newly established conference in the   subfield of computational biology, application of intelligent systems to problems in   molecular biology.  The 1997 conference is the second of these conferences held at an   international site.  Its goals include convening a critical mass of researchers applying   advanced computational techniques to problems in molecular biology, creating cross-  disciplinary educational opportunities, and fostering the involvement of women and   minorities.    This award will support the participation in the conference of up to 20 graduate students   or postdoctoral fellows, who are co-authors of papers submitted to the conference.  The   European site of the meeting will provide international opportunities for US researchers at   an early stage in their careers.",
