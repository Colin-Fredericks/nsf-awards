The collaborators are R.S. Katiyar, University  of Puerto Rico, S.B. Desu, Virginia Polytechnic  Institute, and D.C. Agrawal, Indian Institute  of Technology, Kanpur.  The researchers will  study thin films of novel optoelectronics and  ferroelectrics with the aim of enhancing  understanding of synthesis and processing,  materials characterization and modelling of  thin film growth and properties.  Various  techniques will be used to probe the micro-to  nano-scale compositions, structure and  characterization in order to establish  structure-property relationships in these novel   materials.  Fundamental research on  ferroelectric thin films holds great potential  for eventual application in electro-optical  devices, microwave electronics, micro sensors,  and high density packaging.    Scope: This project supports a new  collaboration between two U.S. research  institutions and the Indian Institute of  Technology, Kanpur.  All facilities are  equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentation  for the proposed synthesis, characterization  and modelling work.  The research is expected  to stimulate a long-term science and  engineering link among three centers-of  excellence.  The project is mutually beneficial  and meets INT criteria for support.      ***",
