Kiger  University of Maryland    The research objective is to advance the state of knowledge concerning particle-turbulence interaction in dilute, disperse, two-phase flows, through progress in understanding how mass, momentum and energy is exchanged in dispersed systems by detail experimentation, analysis, and simulation.  New instrumentation which will enable the simultaneous measurement of particle concentration, particle velocity and fluid velocity within a three-dimensional volume will be developed.  A scanning particle image velocimeter will be constructed using a high-speed copper-vapor laser, scanning optics, and a drum camera to measure two velocity components of both phases and the particulate concentration on multiple planes within the measurement volume.  The measurements will provide detailed information about the organization of particulates in relation to the turbulent fluid structure, as characterized by cross-correlations of the particle and fluid velocity and particle concentration.  Experiments will be conducted to study the coupling influence of heavy particulates within homogeneous turbulence to provide experimental validation currently unavailable in the literature that details the nature of the particle/fluid coupling within an unorganized turbulent flow.  The experiments will be conducted under conditions that will allow direct comparison with previous numerical simulations and the conditions will be extended to those regimes currently inaccessible to computational solution.  Results from this research will have impact upon many engineering fields which utilize two-phase dispersed systems such as spray combustion, particulate precipitators, spray drying, sediment transport, and cloud physics.    The educational objective is to develop an integrated approach to engineering instruction that will provide connectivity to elements of design processes in conjunction with fundamental instruction. As an example of a commitment toward this goal, i t is proposed that a design component be added to the current undergraduate fluid and thermal sciences curriculum, to enhance the students' exposure to open-ended problem-solving and increase their understanding and interest in the topic through connection with relevant applications.",
