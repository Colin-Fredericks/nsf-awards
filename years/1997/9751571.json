 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating an interactive teaching laboratory for students in elementary statistics which is improving the curriculum by increasing data-analysis potential, proving access to resources on the World Wide Web, enhancing possibilities for cooperative learning, and encouraging the development of communication skills.  Gateway computers are being networked using the V-Net Interactive Training system which allows the instructor to monitor, interact with, or display the work on any individual station from a control station.  The course also taps into resources available on the World Wide Web, for example Chance News, and a variety of real-world data sets.  The course emphasizes problem-solving and critical thinking skills by making extensive use of a professional quality statistical software package.  Students are being required to communicate the results of their statistical inquiries using both written and oral formats.    This data-driven course emphasis and the variety of classroom experiences made possible by V-Net is providing better preparation for students in statistics-intensive majors and exposing students in teacher education programs to a wide variety of learning experiences.  Student laboratory exercises and project results are being made available on the project's we` page.  *",
