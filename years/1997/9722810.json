Stoitsov of the Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy.  The researchers propose to focus on three problems of contemporary importance in nuclear structure physics.  One concerns a description of the structure of nuclear matter directly in terms of quark degrees of freedom through the use of baryon mapping techniques.  A second involves an improved calculation of the response of a new iodine detector to be 7Be solar neutrinos.  Both of these projects build naturally on earlier collaborative efforts between the PI and his Bulgarian colleagues.  The third, a study of the possible use of a simple analytic shell-model potential for the treatment of nuclei far from stability represents a new direction of research.    This research in physics fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Bulgaria to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.    ***  ??",
