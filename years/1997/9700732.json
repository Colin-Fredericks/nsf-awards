Diane  Wey ,Chin-Long   Cheng, Betty     Michigan State    Combined  Research-Curriculum Development Program (CRCD)  VESL:  Visions for Embedded Systems Laboratories    The VESL (Vision for Embedded Systems Laboratories)  project addresses three needs in undergraduate computer engineering education:  (1) providing students  with hands-on,  real-world experiences in embedded computer system development in an active, collaborative learning environment; (2) increasing accessibility of specialized laboratories to students to allow different learning paces and approaches and to support different contexts and types of interaction; and (3) sharing costly laboratory resources with other universities.    The focus for the curriculum development is embedded computing systems.  Research results in real-time computing, software engineering, and wireless systems, including such topics as ubiquitous computing, scheduling, monitoring and debugging, codesign, testing, and software prototyping, will be transferred to the instructional domain.  Instructional modules will be developed according to the \"Open You I's\" paradigm, which views learning as a process of Introduction, Instruction, Illustration, Investigation, and Implementation.  Laboratory development will impact introductory courses through senior design project courses via an array of laboratory experiences, including a radio-controlled cars project and industry-sponsored projects.  Realistic design experiences will provide students with greater insight about the functionality, reliability, and other properties of an embedded system.",
