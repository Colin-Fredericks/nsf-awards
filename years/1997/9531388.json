 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9531388  Adler   Ion implantation can change the properties of a surface without changing the underlying substrate.  This technology has growing applications in wear reduction and corrosion reduction of metal surfaces.  Many of these applications have been limited by the fact that implantation is usually a \"line of sight process.  Plasma source ion implantation (PSII) has the potential to overcome this limitation as long as the plasma can be made to   \"conform\" to the surface throughout the implant's duration.  Limitations in plasma density and power system drive conditions often limit the degree to which the implant conforms to the surface.  By increasing the plasma density and power system peak power, those limitations can be overcome, leading to a significant improvement in the uniformity of the implant and a subsequent increase in implant utility as a surface modification technique.  In phase I we demonstrated through experiments that we could produce a system in which the plasma conformed to the object being implanted to within 1-2 cm.  This was accomplished through improvements in the plasma source, and in the pulsed power system which powers the implantation.  In our proposed phase II program, we will upgrade existing pulsed power equipment at NSRC and build a new high density plasma source in order to perform conformal implants of this type at high power.   The proposed technology will make it possible to apply implantation to surfaces which are \"bumpy\" such as dies and molds.  This will increase the range of applications over which this technique can be used and improve tool die lifetime.",
