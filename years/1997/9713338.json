 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with a new method, called the  short-time Gaussian cell mapping method for solving  nonlinear stochastic optimal control problems.  Stochastic  nonlinear optimal control problems can be found in civil  engineering structures subject to earthquake, ocean waves,  and wind loading excitations, in precision machines,  manufacturing processes and robots, and in armed vehicles  (land or air), target tracking systems and guidance systems  operated in combat or rough environments.  Few effective  methods exist for obtaining optimal control solutions of  complex nonlinear systems to random excitations. The method  has been applied to some very challenging nonlinear  oscillators under Gaussian white noise excitations and has  been proven to be effective and accurate in analyzing  complex nonlinear stochastic systems. This project develops  this method further for nonlinear stochastic optimal control  problems. The results of this research provide the  capability to more efficiently and accurately predict and  control the response of nonlinear systems subject to  stochastic excitations, to better assess the reliability of  the system under harsh random environments, and to develop  new strategies for controlling the state-constrained  stochastic system.",
