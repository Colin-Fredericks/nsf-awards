 "awd_abstract_narration": "We request funds to replace our aging scanning electron microscope (SEM)  facility with new instrumentation that has the capabilities to meet the  evolving research and educational requirements at the American Museum of  Natural History (AMNH). The high magnification, great detail, depth of  field, and analytical capabilities inherent to scanning electron  microscopy are crucial to the investigation of systematics, mineralogy,  and other research foci at the AMNH.    The current SEM/EDS system, a Zeiss DSM 950 and Link AN10000, is in  continuous use by a varied population of researchers.  It was an  innovative digital design at the time, but is now worn, outdated, and  not upgradeable. This system does not meet research and educational  requirements including: 1) imaging uncoated biological specimens, 2)  high magnification imaging in both secondary and backscattered electron  modes, 3) production and storage of high resolution digital image files,  4) separation of light elements, 5) ease of operation for a diverse user  population, 6) industry-standard computing platforms that can be  upgraded and have third party application support, 7) network and  Internet operation for collaboration and education, and 8) publication  quality printing. A new isolation system will suppress of vibrations at  magnifications above 20,000x.    Secondary electron imaging of uncoated biological specimens,  particularly taxonomic types, is important in a museum setting because  these specimens are unique and cannot be coated. Backscattered imaging  at high magnification and high accelerating voltage operation are  critical for mineralogical research. These diverse requirements can now  be met by field emission FE) instruments. The ability to greatly  increase magnification (FE scopes are rated to 600,00'0~ will extend the  frontiers of scientific research at the AMNH. FE instruments have  chamber sizes adequate for large specimens and are easy to operate.  Current SEM and EDS systems are now migrating to standa rd computing  platforms that are easy to use, produce high-resolution digital images,  and operate with other instruments over networks and the Internet.    The new facility will provide state-of-the-art instrumentation that will  meet both new and longstanding research and educational requirements for  a very large user population associated with some of the most important  natural history collections in the world (in excess of 37 million  specimens). The AMNH has committed, and will continue to commit, staff  and resources to the operation of the SEM facility. The SEM will be  available to all affiliated personnel who undertake research, research  training, or education.    3",
