 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide continued support of core programs  of the organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) as it takes  on an increasing role in global efforts to train students in  rain forest ecology and to understand, sustainably manage,  and conserve ecosystems in the wet tropics. In the last 17  years training and research opportunities have increased  dramatically through OTS.  Spectacular biodiversity, diverse  habitats for observation and experimentation, classroom  space, availability of well-trained field technicians and  natural history guides,advanced laboratory facilitates, a  state-of-the-art Geographic Information/Database Management  System, and a welcoming sociopolitical environment have all  contributed to OTS's continuing growth. The National Park  adjacent to the La Selva site increases long-term ecological  security, and a comprehensive Master Plan and independent  advisory committee guide management and facilities  development.  More than 60 graduate and undergraduate  courses and over 250 researchers use the La Selva station  each year.    La Selva serves an unusually broad segment of the US  academic community and is playing an increasingly important  role in the development of science in Latin America and  beyond.  In so doing OTS merits long-term support.  For  economic reasons there will be only a handful of sites in  the humid tropics where fully equipped field stations can be  developed adjacent to very large protected areas with intact  ecosystems. Very few other continental tropical areas have  such a long, continuing history of easy access by US  students and scientists. La Selva--with its exceptional  facilities and protected habitats, location within the  democratic Republic of Costa Rica, and intense activity by  the US scientific academic community--is a world center for  the study of tropical rain forests and their associated  altered ecosystems. As such,the station is a valuable  element of the nation's programs for undergraduate and  graduate education,  biodiversity, and global change, and  serves a constituency that extends far beyond OTS member  institutions.",
