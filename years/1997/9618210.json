 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Investigation of Judgmental Reliability          The proposal deals with the effects of the reliability of judgment  (conceptualized as consisting of two parts--reliability of information  acquisition and reliability of information processing) on judgment accuracy.  The PI proposes a study of experts (radiologists reading mammograms) and a  lab study that is a loose analog of radiographic diagnosis.  The conceptual  framework is an expanded version of Brunswik's lens model.  The review of  the literature shows that the topic of reliability has been neglected in the  study of expert judgment, although it is known that there are individual  differences in judgment reliability.  The first study proposed would have 10 radiologists read a set of 100  mammograms twice.  They would also judge a set of features of each mammogram  twice to provide evidence about reliability of information acquisition.   The second study is an experimental analog in which subjects are given  visual cues or visual and numerical cues (such as age, etc.) which are  probabilistically related to an outcome.  Baseline and feedback trials will  be given.  Subjects will judge the outcome in some blocks of trials and will  judge the cues in other blocks of trials.  The criterion will be linearly  related to the cues in all cases.",
