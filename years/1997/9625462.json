 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project investigates the tight integration of  program generation facilities into typed languages. Present  program generation technology can be classified as either  integrated with the language environment, as are macros in  Lisp, or external to the language, as are yacc and lex for  C. Within language-integrated generators, the taxonomy can  be further refined into tightly-integrated generators,  exemplified by reflective systems, and loosely-integrated  generators, such as macro preprocessors. Tight integration  of generators into typed languages gives rise to a number of  problems to which solutions must be found.  However, the  benefits of increased expressiveness, efficiency,  productivity, reusability, reliability, and quality makes  research into solving these problems worthwhile. If the  project is successful, it will provide a clearer semantics  to a reflective ML-like language tailored for building  generator systems, illustrate how such a reflective language  can be restricted to maintain the invariants of strong  typing, design a meta-programming system to prevent variable  capture or design hiding, and build a programming  environment where generated code can be seamlessly  integrated with code produced in more traditional ways.",
