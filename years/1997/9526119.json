 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9526119  Piegl     This GOALI grant provides funding for the development of a new geometrical framework and algorithms for the representation, design and processing of Non-Uniform Rational B-splineS (NURBS) geometry. The developed algorithms will provide tools for the robust and accurate design and processing of engineering parts covered by free-form geometry. The emphasis is on utilizing the extra degrees of freedom of the rational form to develop new techniques for interpolation and approximation, shape modification, fairing, and various fundamental algorithms such as symbolic operators, and degree elevation and reduction. A B-spline-to-Bezier-to-B-spline approach is also proposed to take advantage of Bezier methods and to reduce the complexity of B-splines. The algorithms will be implemented in the context of an existing NURBS framework that has tools for all supporting computational work. Experiments involving the efficiency and usefulness of the developed algorithms will be performed by the industrial partner within the framework of its modeling system. An experimental system will also be built and evaluated according to specifications found in most CAD/CAM systems.      Upon completion, the results of this research will lead to improvements in both NURBS theory and advanced algorithm development. It is anticipated that new theoretical results will be obtained in spline theory and associated tools such as symbolic operators, interpolation and approximation with rational splines, data reduction, curve and surface fairing, and in the theory of knots and weights as related to the proposed algorithms. New advanced geometric algorithms will also emerge either as direct implementations of new theoretical results or as direct algorithmic solutions of problems such as optimal knot placement. A decomposition-Bezier-recomposition paradigm will also be introduced to more efficiently solve a large set of problems such as degree elevation and reduction, reparametrization, and various approximations . The primary goal of this work is to gain a deeper insight into the power of the rational form to obtain more efficient algorithms in terms of data storage, flexibility and speed. Efficient algorithms will cut lead time, enhance the robustness, reliability and efficiency of existing systems, and will ultimately improve the quality of products such as engines and turbine blades. The Bezier paradigm of NURBS will help in understanding many complicated algorithms and hence will contribute to standardizing NURBS across various engineering disciplines.    ***",
