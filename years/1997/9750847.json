 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study molecular structure and dynamics is now an essential element of an effective undergraduate chemistry education.    Students without access to a modern NMR spectrometer cannot gain experience in multinuclear, Fourier transform, and multidimensional NMR.  Moreover, even with access to a modern instrument, students all too often learn only about structural elucidation with NMR spectroscopy in Organic Chemistry and never about NMR as a tool for studying dynamics.  In this project, NMR spectroscopy is implemented vertically throughout the curriculum.  The new spectrometer is incorporated into nearly every chemistry laboratory beginning in the first year with Organic Chemistry, where students familiarize themselves with the instrument and learn basic spectral interpretation.  As students progress to Analytical, Physical, and Advanced Inorganic courses, the sophistication of the experiments and the number of parameters the student controls are increased.  By the time a student participates in senior research, he or she has the skills to design a two-dimensional experiment without assistance.  The spectrometer is used to reinforce concepts taught in the classroom, including stereochemistry, fluxionality, Fourier transform, equilibria, thermodynamics, and kinetics.  An important aim of the project is to provide students with a perspective of the broad utility of NMR spectroscopy.  In addition, the research program benefits from the extended capabilities of the spectrometer, and more of it can result in publication.  The curriculum is also affected as new courses are added and multinuclear and solid-state experiments are developed and disseminated.  Finally, students are better prepared for graduate school and industry.  *",
