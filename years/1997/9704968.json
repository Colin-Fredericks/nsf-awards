 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Costin    Costin will work on constructing a theory of analyzable functions.   Obtained by taking a closure of analytic functions with respect to   function operations (algebraic operations, including division,   composition, differentiation, integration, etc.) they preserve many   analytic function properties, including unique representation by   expansions (formalizability) and permanence of relations. In addition  to the intrinsic interest in exploring the limits of formalizability,   there is a major practical interest in reconstructing actual   solutions from formal expansions for a wide class of equations.   A complete theory of analyzable functions is likely to have an   impact in many branches of pure and applied analysis.    Costin has carried out this construction rigorously for functions   arising as solutions to linear or nonlinear differential systems   near generic singularities. Costin will use new techniques in the   classification of nonlinear differential systems near irregular   singularities, up to analytic equivalence, in providing sharp   information on the nature and location of singularities of nonlinear   systems, in the study of solvability in closed form of equations,  in solving connection problems and in justifying and improving   hyper-asymptotic numerical methods.  The technique will also be   extended to cover PDE's and difference equations.    Asymptotic analysis is an important method of  investigation in complex systems. In many important cases however,   the quantities of interest are influenced by parameters too small   to be controlled by classical asymptotics. The field of exponential  asymptotics has been introduced as a successful theoretical and  computational framework to deal with these situations and applied in  problems ranging from number theory to optics and quantum  mechanics. The present project is aimed at a rigorous foundation of  the field, at applying its techniques to the study of differential or  difference systems, as well as  at extending and improving the  computational methods of this new theory.",
