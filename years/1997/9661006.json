The ability to culture stem cells in vitro over prolonged periods is paramount to many areas of basic research and clinical medicine,  yet current culture systems have proven ineffective in sustaining HSCs for extended periods, perhaps because traditional monolayer cultures lack the natural three-dimensional topography found in vivo.  Thus, there is urgent need for the development of novel culture systems capable of sustaining HSCs.  Preliminary results have shown that Cellfoam is capable of enhancing short- term stem cell survival in vitro compared to conventional systems without compromising HSC survival or pluripotency.  This project will evaluate the ability of Cellfoam to sustain HSCs in vitro over extended periods and will assess the impact of long-term culture on stem cell biology.  Specifically, the survival, phenotype, and multipotency of HSCs cultured for six weeks in Cellfoam will be measured and compared to conventional systems.  Based on previous successes  with short-term Cellfoam cultures, it is anticipated that Cellfoam will improve the long-term maintenance of stem cell viability.  The Phase I research results will be instrumental in developing advanced culture systems for the maintenance and manipulation of HSCs.   Cellfoam TM systems will enable, for the first time, the maintenance, analysis, and manipulation of hematopoietic stem cells over extended periods.  Commercial applications of Cellfoam devices will take advantage of existing markets in basic science and clinical medicine in which such systems are required but unavailable.  Applications foster fundamental advances in research and clinical fields, including gene therapy, bone marrow transplantation, and transfusion medicine, and thus have the potential for sign ificant impact on basic as well as clinical disciplines.  ***",
