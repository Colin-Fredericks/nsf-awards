Carlson     ABSTRACT (Moving Node Finite Element Methods)    The gradient-weighted moving finite element method (GWMFE) is an adaptive  method well-suited to problems which develop sharp moving fronts, especially  those problems where one must resolve the fine-scale structure of the front.  Three works related to the method are planned.  First, development of GWMFE  in 3-D will continue.  The recently completed scalar code will be extended  to systems of equations and the direct linear solver will be replaced by  iterative techniques based on the work of Miller and Xaba.  The code will be  applied to a variety of difficult PDEs and PDE systems: Stefan-type problems,  drift-diffusion equations from semiconductor device modeling, the time  dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation, are some possible examples.  A parallel  version of the code will also be developed.  Second, a new moving mixed finite  element method will be implemented in 2-D and 3-D.  Here, in the spirit of  the mixed finite element method, the diffusive flux is approximated in an  independent finite element space (BDM or RT) and a coupled system of ODEs  is then obtained via the same variational argument used in the moving finite  element method.  This new method gives a more rigorous treatment of diffusion  terms, and in 1-D gives superior grid adaptivity.  Third, in collaboration  with Miller (Berkeley), global adaptivity will be added to GWMFE in 2-D.  This global adaptivity will be achieved through the periodic addition,  deletion, and reconnection of nodes based upon geometric criteria, which  are easily identifiable through simple eigenvalue analysis, and upon local  projection error estimates.  This complements the very fine local adaptivity  GWMFE achieves through the continuous motion of its nodes, and is essential  for a robust method.    Many physical processes are modeled by partial differential equations.  A solution of such an equation might give, for example, the concentration of  of arsenic in a semicon ductor substrate at each instant of time and each  point in one, two, or three dimensional space.  Because it is generally  impossible to find the exact solution of such an equation, approximate  solutions must be sought using some computer-based technique.  For a large  class of difficult problems standard techniques are extremely wasteful and  inefficient, making computations in two, and especially three, dimensions  very difficult if not altogether impossible.  More sophisticated adaptive  techniques seek to overcome this difficulty.  The gradient-weighted moving  finite element method (GWMFE) is one such technique, and it offers some  significant advantages over more conventional adaptive methods.  This project  seeks to advance GWMFE and related methods in several directions.  First,  a full implementation of GWMFE in the computationally challenging three  dimensional case will be completed, and applied to a variety of challenging  problems.  Second, a variant of the method which gives a more accurate  treatment of some problems will be investigated.  And last, a complementary  global adaptivity will be added to GWMFE in two dimensions which will  substantially enhance the robustness of the method.  GWMFE has been applied  to a variety of difficult problems with great success, including problems  from semiconductor device manufacture and device simulation, groundwater  transport and oil reservoir engineering, and time dependent models of  superconductors.  Being able to computationally model problems like these  is becoming ever more important to scientists and engineers.  GWMFE shows  great promise in making some of these difficult problems efficiently  computable in two and three dimensions, some of which are currently  inaccessible with existing techniques.",
