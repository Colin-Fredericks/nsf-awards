 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this study is to increase our understanding of the connection between attitudes and behaviors in social dyads.  The behaviors to be examined are judgments about sexual intercourse and condom use.  A methodology called `policy capturing` will be used that allows an assessment of the relative influence of partners' attitudes on decision-making.  Preliminary data suggest a model in which behavior is determined by the relative strength of `self` and `other` attitude components.  The experiments seek to test and expand this model.  Experiment 1 examines the effect on the relative influence of the self and the other of two variables: the importance of the other and the importance of the behavior.  Experiment 2 explores the relative influence on behavior of the cognitive and affective attitudes of the self and the other.  The experiment also asks whether relative influence is moderated by time constraints on decision-making.  Disparities between attitudes toward condoms and their use are frequently noted for heterosexual young adults, the population that will be studied.  As a group young adults appreciate the importance of condoms in preventing HIV but continue to engage in unprotected sex.  The study tests the hypothesis that some apparent discrepancies between attitudes and behavior occur when the attitudes of the partner, rather than one's own feelings and beliefs, guide decision-making.  In such instances, the impact of the partner on behavior may be unaccompanied by any change in attitude.  Thus the study diverges from traditional work in persuasion by examining the ability of others to influence behavior independent of any attitude change.  This research represents a profound shift in research for the investigator.  She was trained as a sensory psychologist and from 1976 through 1995 worked in the area of visual psychophysics.  The POWRE award will have a major impact on her ability to conduct research and to develop related courses in social psychology.  She will also be able to begin training undergraduate and graduate students in this area.  Thus support will enhance her value both to her department and to her newly-chosen field.",
