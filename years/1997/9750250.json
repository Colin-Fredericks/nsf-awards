This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled \"Effects of  ecological history on zooplankton community responses to  fish predation.\"  The effect of historical legacies on  community dynamics are poorly-understood.  Ecological  history may play a critical role in the dynamics of  freshwater zooplankton communities because a live sample of  past communities is stored in lake sediments as diapausing  eggs which remain viable for decades.  Zooplankton community  responses to fish predation is being contrasted in  experimental ponds which have historically contained or  lacked fish.",
