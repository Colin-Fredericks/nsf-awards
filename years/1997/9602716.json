 "awd_abstract_narration": "Founded in 1905, Miles College, located in Birmingham, AL, is one of the nation's Historically Black institution of higher learning.  The College, in partnership with the National Science Foundation,  is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation of research laboratories in the Taggart Science Building.  Constructed in 1965, the building houses the Division of Natural Science and Mathematics.  Except for minor modifications to the HVAC system, and making provisions for ADA compliance, no major renovations have been made to the facility.  Currently research activities are contained in inadequate facilities dispersed over two floors. The lack of adequate plumbing and electrical wiring, and the shortage of sink, hood, and bench space has proven to be a deterrent to research productivity.  Several projects are performed at neighboring institutions due to outdated research space. Specifically funds will be used to upgrade the HVAC, electrical, plumbing and lighting systems, install new fume hoods and cold rooms, and provide suspended ceilings in each laboratory.  Infrastructure improvements will advance biological and chemical research and training programs by strengthening the quality of research conducted at the College, and improving collaborative efforts with the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Because of its historical mission, the project will assist Miles College in its endeavors to increase the number of African American students who desire to pursue graduate degrees in science, and therefore increasing the nation's competitiveness in the science and engineering enterprise.",
