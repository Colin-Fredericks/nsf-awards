 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, which is supported by the Analytical and  Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities, focuses on the development of a toroid cavity probe for  use as an NMR detector for electrophoresis.  Professor Johnson and  his student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will  construct a toroid cavity probe, characterize its performance as an  electrophoresis detector, and write programs necessary for the  handling of data.  This instrument will be able to detect all  components in a mixture and the analysis time will be less than 100  msec.  These measurements will provide information about the  chemical interactions that occur in ordered media, such a micelles.   This information will be useful in understanding the behavior of  these materials as pseudo-stationary phases in many separation  processes.  In this project toroid cavity detectors will constructed and  designed for use in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to  permit studies of electrophoretic processes.  In addition to the  construction of this new detector for nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy, programs will be written to acquire and handle the  data produced in these experiments.  Analysis of all components in  a mixture will be possible and the analysis time will be less than  100 milliseconds.  This new instrumental capability will have  applications ranging from microscopic imaging to the study of the  interactions that occur in high pressure fluids.",
