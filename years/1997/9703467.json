The research will focus on embedding the circuit physics of nonlinear circuit devices in the full electromagnetic field physics of Maxwell's equations as solved by the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method.  A significant problem with the traditional FDTD technique is numerical dispersion. In this research the conventional 2-2 FDTD modeling will be interfaced to a modified 2-4 algorithm which mitigates numerical dispersion in the grid. Problems that are currently computationally inaccessible because of numerical dispersion will be significantly impacted by this research.  This includes many circuit problems in wireless and optical applications.    A significant part of the educational plan involves a design  oriented freshmen projects course focused on the area of assistive technology.  The students will design and fabricate devices for use as aids to handicapped individuals within the local community/specialty educational system.  In addition to the design of novel and successful devices, the students also learn problem formulation and team participation skills. Additionally, emphasis is placed on careful analysis and re-working of designs which failed to meet criteria for successful use, as defined by the handicapped client.  This work is a significant contribution to the building of a strong interface between the University of Colorado Integrative Teaching Laboratory and the local community.",
