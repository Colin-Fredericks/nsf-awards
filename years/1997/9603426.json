 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603426  Barbara    This award supports the participation of American scientists  in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Photophysics and Photoconversion  in Small Domains by Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscopy  to be held in Palm Springs, California from January 6-9,  l998.  The seminar will address how near-field optical  methods, and related confocal microscopic approaches can be  used to address many of the key issues in mesoscopic  photochemistry and photophysics.  The meeting will include  experts in areas broadly ranging from near-field optical  microscopy, photochemistry of nonoparticles, spectroscopy of  aggregates, scanning probe methods, photosynthesis, and  quantum confinement of electronic wavefunctions.    The most efficient and most promising man-made and natural  photosynthetic/photoconversion media take advantage of  mesoscopic structural organization to optimize key  structural and dynamic processes.  One of the most exciting  new tools for the study of photoconversion and photophysics  in mesostructures is Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscopy.  This technique combines various spectroscopies and  photochemical techniques with scanning probe methodology,  offering unprecedented mesosocopic scale data on various  materials.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese  experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to  advance their own work, and will set the stage for future  collaborative projects.  Participants' papers will be  published in a journal and abstracts will be made available  on the World Wide Web.  ***",
