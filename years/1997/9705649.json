Linked directly with school curricula and  the new National Science Education Standards, the program will  bridge the gap between parents and schools, and position the Zoo as  a partner and intermediary to help parents and teachers improve the  quality and quantity of science education.  The program consists of  four interrelated components:         1)   A series of workshops that will prepare the 420 parents            and 210 teachers to work in teams for better and more            widely available science education;       2)   A series of education projects that will enable workshop            participants to teach thousands of other parents and            educators about the importance of science literacy, the            need for active parental engagement in children's            education, and the crucial role that informal science            institutions play in augmenting formal science            instruction;       3)   A series of four Science Advocacy Fairs at the Zoo that            are expected to raise the visitor's consciousness on a            large scale about the above issues; and       4)   A symposium for educators from schools and informal            science centers in the region to disseminate successful            methods for involving parents in science education.",
