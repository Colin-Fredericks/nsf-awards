 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stanley Bruckenstein, professor of chemistry at SUNY-Buffalo,  is   supported by this renewal grant from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry   Program for theoretical and experimental studies of electroactive polymer   thin-films.  Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM)   experiments and dynamic impedance measurements will be used in   conjunction with theoretical considerations based on a scheme of cubes   which will yield the rates of the elementary kinetic steps that occur   during a redox switching process in the polymer films.  The approach will   permit the identification and separation of processes involving   counterion transfer, co-ion transfer, neutral species transfer and   polymer configuration changes.   Polyvinylferrocene is included among the   redox polymers to be studied and  polypyrrole is among the conducting   polymers to be used.  The investigations will produce structure-function   correlations within and among various classes of  polymers.   Such   relationships permit rational design of polymers for specific purposes.  A fundamental understanding of the nature and processes occuring in   electroactive  polymers continues to be a major objective of studies on   these materials because of their importance in technological areas such   as batteries and membranes.  This research provides a theoretical   framework upon which to design experiments to examine these processes.    From the experiments, information is obtained which will allow   technological development of  polymers for well-defined purposes.",
