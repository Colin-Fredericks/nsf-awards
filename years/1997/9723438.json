 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peter Anderson   Subject: Re: IBN-9723438    ABSTRACT  Voltage gated calcium channels are a family of proteins that  are essential for many cell functions, including excitation,  contraction, secretion, enzyme activity and gene regulation.  They exist in living cells as  multisubunit complexes, usually consisting of an alpha1  subunit and associated beta, gamma and alpha2/delta  subunits.  The pore forming alpha1 subunits, which are  primarily responsible for many of the physiological and  pharmacological properties of the channels, can be divided  on their basis  of their structure, into 6 separate classes.  A full length  calcium channel cDNA was recently cloned from the jellyfish  Cyanea capillata, by our lab.  The deduced amino acid  sequence of this protein suggests that it is a member of the  L-type family of calcium channels, and this is supported by  much of its physiology and pharmacology.  However, there are  some significant deviations from the overall properties of  calcium channels, in particular the ionic selectivity of the  channel and its sensitivity to dihydropyridines, a class of  calcium channel blockers that are diagnostics of L-type  calcium channels. The aim of the proposed work is to  complete the characterization of the jellyfish calcium  channel with a view to using the physiological and  pharmacological abnormalities of this channel as a means of  identifying the structural correlates of L-type channel  function.",
