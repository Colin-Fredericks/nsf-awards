 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724632  Bonner  This is an award to provide support for instrumentation to  conduct collaborative research on decontamination of soil that  has been contaminated by crude oil, products resulting from the  refining of oil and residues from production of explosives.  The  research to be conducted in this project involves identification  of transformation pathways by which microbial degradation of  these contaminants occurs especially concentrating on the  identification of intermediates.  The proposal leading to this  award was submitted in accord with the NSF Instrument Development  and Acquisition Solicitation, NSF 97-24, Major Research  Instrumentation (MRI) Program.    The availability of the equipment provided through this award is  expected to enhance the ability of environmental engineers and  others to detect and monitor intermediate products of microbial  action on petroleum and petroleum products.  This knowledge is  expected to have applications in the engineering design of  systems for decontamination of soil contaminated by the category  of pollutants being studied in this project.  ***",
