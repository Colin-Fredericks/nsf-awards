 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704225  Meisel         This award provides support to develop a new variable  temperature, high-frequency Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)  instrument that will be housed in the new physics building that  is being constructed on the Gainesville campus at the University  of Florida.  The device will have the capability of providing a  wide range of magnetic field (up to 8.5 T with 10-6 homogeneity)  in a 50 mm clear bore at room temperature.  A broadband high  frequency  (5 to 350 MHz) spectrometer will be an integral part  of the instrument.  A variety of probes will be developed to  allow NMR to span temperatures from 25 mK to 400 K.  %%%       This new instrument will serve as a tool to probe the  microscopic electromagnetic interactions that are fundamental to  our understanding of new low dimensional magnets (e.g. Haldane  gap and spin-ladder materials) and novel magnetic systems (e.g.  Kondo insulators and magnetic/nonmagnetic multilayers).  In  particular, the data provided by this instrument may not be  obtainable by any other known experimental probe.  In addition,  when new extremes of magnetic field, temperature, and pressure  seem to be natural extensions of the research, the experiments  may be continued at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory  (NHMFL).  The system (especially the spectrometer) is being  designed in a manner which will make it compatible with the  instrumentation used at the NHMFL at higher frequencies and  magnetic fields.       An important component of the proposed program is the  education and training of postdoctoral fellows, graduate  students, and undergraduate students.  Members of the researcher  team are trained in a variety of modern cross-disciplinary  fields, including (but not limited to) cryogenics, electronics,  ultra-high vacuum technology, NMR, macroscopic and microscopic  surface science techniques, and new chemical synthesis protocols.  When the junior researchers leave the group, they are prepared to  tackle the heretofore unknown technic al and scientific questions  of the future.  ***",
