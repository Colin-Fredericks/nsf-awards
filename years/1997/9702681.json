 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702681  Many practical problems such as compile-time analysis of  programs, verification of concurrent systems, planning by  intelligent agents, and diagnosis of physical systems have  in common the fact that they can be easily specified using  logic. However, attempts to execute such specifications  using traditional logic programming techniques usually do  not terminate, and are thus impractical.  This project seeks  to create a logic programming system which can solve such  problems and draws on recent research in tabled and  constraint logic programming. Tabled logic programming,  particularly the XSB system, terminates for large classes of  programs, and permits reasoning in the presence of  inconsistent information through its semantics for default  negation. Constraint logic programming allows problems in  theories such as the real numbers to be expressed  declaratively and solved automatically. The project will  create a unified computational basis for the two paradigms  using XSB as a starting point. For certain problems in the  verification of concurrent systems and in program analysis,  large programs based on C already have been replaced with a  few hundred XSB rules with no loss in efficiency. The  project will increase the number of such problems for which  a logic-based specification leads to an efficient, practical  system.  ***",
