 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723437  Lima  This research is directed at a new understanding of a  widespread  behavioral phenomenon: the vigilance group size effect, in  which  socially-feeding animals engage in less vigilance  (alertness) with  an increase in group size.  Despite the fact that this is  one of the most well  established results in the study of animal behavior, many  important issues remain unaddressed and even unrecognized.  The  proposed experiments are designed to help remedy this  situation, and in doing so, will shed light on the reasons  why so  many types of animals are social in the first place.  The  proposed  research focuses first on an assumption fundamental to all  explanations  of the group size effect: that an animal cannot detect  predators  while it is actively feeding with its head down.  Recent  work  suggests that apparently non-vigilant (feeding) birds can  detect  approaching predator attacks at a considerable distance.  A  main goal is thus to characterize this ability in birds (as  represented by the dark-eyed junco, Junco hyemalis) under  realistic situations, and then explore its consequences for  the  group size effect itself.  This proposed work will determine  whether the group size effect represents a previously  unrecognized interaction between poor quality vigilance  (while  actually feeding), and high quality vigilance (while overtly  alert).  The proposed research also explores two unorthodox  explanations for the group size effect.  The first is based  on  theoretical developments which suggest that the group size  effect  occurs only because group sizes change frequently over time  (as  animals come and go from the group).  This idea will be  tested by  allowing captive juncos to feed in constant group sizes or  in  groups that vary over time.  If the new theory is correct,  only  those birds experiencing the variable group sizes should  exhibit  the basic group size effect.  The second unorthodox  explanation  for the group size effect concerns the effect of competition   for  food on vigilance.  This view does not deny that animals are  vigilant for predators, but maintains that they decrease  their  vigilance in larger groups because competition for food is  more  intense as group size increases.  If this view is correct,  then  the group size effect should be much more pronounced when  animals  are feeding on a limited food supply; this prediction will  be  tested in flocks of house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus).  Results  from this research will allow a better understanding of  group behavior  and the evolution of sociality.",
