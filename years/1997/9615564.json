 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program will assist the  Department of Chemistry at Brandeis University to acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This  equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1) rational  design of enzyme inhibitors and studies of enzyme mechanisms, (2) synthesis and mechanistic  studies of biologically active natural products, (3) structure/function studies of trypsin and  mechanistic studies of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, (4) short syntheses of major  natural products and development of new synthetic reactions, (5) protein dynamics by NMR and  ion pair structure and dynamics, and (6) total synthesis of biologically active natural products.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to  chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown  substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the  dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from  these NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.",
