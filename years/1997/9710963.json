The first stage of the project focused on collection, coding, and analyzing data; developing a theory of legal integration; and testing a set of hypotheses, derived from the theory, against the data.  The new work involves intensive analysis of litigation, judicial decisionmaking, and the impact of this decisionmaking on national and supranational policy outcomes in three domains of EC law:  the free movement of goods, gender  equality, and environmental protection.  Analyses of data are focusing on how and with what effect individuals, companies  and national and transnational interest groups are able to use national courts to obtain policy change, and the extent to which intra-judicial interaction and decisionmaking shape policy making  at the national and supranational levels.  This research addresses important concerns of international relations theory and redirects attention from ECJ's case law which has been amply studied to the impact of that case law on policymaking and adjudication processes.      %%%    This project is a competitive renewal of an ongoing investigation that seeks to account for the dynamics and mechanics of European legal integration, the process by which the European Community has constructed a transnational rule of law polity.
