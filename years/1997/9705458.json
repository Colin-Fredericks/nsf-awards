 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705458  McConnell    Museum of Science will develop a 4500 sq. ft. exhibit \"Finding the  Pattern\".  The primary objective is to develop activities and  programs that encourage visitors to practice scientific thinking  skills in settings that have interdisciplinary science content.   The main component is an activity area that will encourage visitors  to observe, compare, and sort objects and phenomena in meaningful  ways; help visitors recognize that systems of organizing and  classifying objects and phenomena reveal underlying meaning;  provide visitors with opportunities to practice answering questions  and solving problems based on museums collections; and encourage  visitors to search for the \"hidden\" meaning in things around them.   The exhibit will be composed of three overlapping areas: 1) the  sorting area, 2) the mystery area, and 3) the open collections  area.  This project is one of the six science activity centers that  have been described in the museum's long-range plan; two activity  centers/exhibits have been completed.  The impact of \"Finding the  Pattern\" will be extended via the museum's web site.   Activities  that employ the kinds of scientific thinking skills targeted in the  exhibit will be developed to engage informal learners at home.   Complementary programming linking the exhibit with formal education  will include the development of teacher workshops and programs for  school groups.  Teacher workshops will be developed in consultation  with groups of Project PALMS teachers.  The activities will be  accessible to individuals with disabilities.  They plan to open the  exhibit in the fall of 2000.",
