 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made to Dr. Chao-Jun Li of the Chemistry Department, Tulane   University, for investigation of carbon-carbon bond formation in water.    The award is in the Technology for Sustainable Environment component of   the EPA/NSF Parnership for Environmental Research, and support is   provided by the Organic Synthesis Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities.  Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions are   typically carried out using metal catalysts in anhydrous organic   solvents.  In this study, the synthesis of various biologically important   compounds and fine chemicals will be carried out in  aqueous medium.  The   new method will be more efficient since the number of synthetic steps   will be reduced.  Additional research to attempt to make the reaction   catalytic is also planned.  Metal recovery and recycling from the aqueous   stream will be used to ensure that the new process is environmentally   beneficial.  The specific reactions to be investigated include indium-promoted   allylations, propargylation-allenylations, and aldol reactions.  Large volumes of organic solvents are used in fine chemical and   pharmaceutical industries for both reactions and product isolation.    These solvents must be recycled or treated by costly methods rather than   being expelled into the environment.  By developing alternative synthetic   methods using water as a solvent, the disposal problem for organic   solvents can be reduced.",
