 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is developing a new approach to testing of the next generation  Multichip Module (MCM) substrates.  The next generation MCM substrates will  contain high density interconnects and integrated passives.  There are numerous  techniques that are being pursued in the packaging industry for MCM interconnect  testing.  These techniques are limited in the resolution of defect detection and  are expensive in terms of test equipment or cumbersome due to test methodology  to improve resolution of defect detection and to reduce the cost of testing MCMs.   A novel low-cost text technique has been discovered by this investigator for  interconnect testing.  Based on this discovery, the objectives of this research  are:  (1) development of electrical models of thin film interconnects and  integrated passives; (2) discovery and investigation of a low-cost test technique  for integrated passives; (3) develogpement of a parallel membrane probe technique  for testing high density interconnects; (4) development of test software tools  to locate process defects, and, (5) fabrication of a test vehicle with a thin  film MCM substrate to demonstrate and evaluate the success of the research goals.",
