 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research deals with various aspects of interactions between the analysis of the Laplace operator on differential forms (including the case of functions) and its discrete analogs with the geometry and topology of underlying spaces. In particular, the principal investigator will work on the following specific topics:  L^2 Betti numbers and related spectral invariants;  spectral theory of degenerating hyperbolic manifolds;  L^2 torsion of finite volume hyperbolic manifolds;  the principle of not feeling the boundary and nonlocal boundary conditions;  spectrum for metrics of modest regularity;  upper bounds for the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian on functions on a compact Riemannian manifold.  The differential and difference operators that are the subject of the proposed research appear in such diverse areas of mathematics as combinatorics, communication networks, differential geometry, mathematical physics, numerical analysis, probability, and topology. Intuitions and ideas coming from one of these fields can (and do) provide powerful and unexpected insight for problems in other seemingly unrelated fields.  Because of this, the Laplace operators are a fundamental object of study. One aspect of the proposed project is the application of ideas from analysis in a continuous setting to a combinatorial problem which ultimately leads to a topological result.",
