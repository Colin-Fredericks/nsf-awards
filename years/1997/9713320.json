Once effective techniques are developed, they should be made available to a wider audience than just one university.  Indeed, since the field of chemical engineering has been changing, with distillation towers being augmented by membrane separation units, and packed bed reactors being augmented by CVD reactors, for example, the diffusion of new techniques and materials is even more important.  The Summer School for Chemical Engineering Faculty is organized by the Chemical Engineering Division of the American Society for Engineering Education and is held every five years.  The 1997 Summer School will be the twelfth in the series begun in 1931.    The objective of the Summer School is primarily to share course materials already developed.  The method to achieve the objectives will be to meet in a conference center, with activities planned from morning to night.  Workshops in specific subject areas will enable faculty to share, and demonstrate, their contributions while interacting with many participants.  Special workshops will be oriented towards Assistant Professors, while plenary lectures will be given that are applicable to all participants.  Workshops are planned in areas that NSF supports, including biotech, electronic materials, fluid-particle systems, environmental areas, and the use of computers.  In many schools undergraduate research projects are undertaken in these areas, so that the knowledge and experience gained in research can be transmitted to undergraduates.    It is hoped that one faculty member will attend from every school in the United States that awards chemical engineering B.S. degrees.  The home institution will supply travel funds, and the proposal is to pay for on-site expenses for some of the participants.  It is entirely possible that the Summer School will have an impact on every single B.S. graduate in Chemical Engineering in the Sp ring, 1998, plus of course all those that come after.",
