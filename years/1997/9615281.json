The project will determine the Cenozoic tectonic history of the  region and whether Neogene structures that localized outlet  glacier flow developed within the context of Cenozoic rifting on  the eastern Ross Embayment margin, or within the volcanic  province in MBL.    The geological structure at the boundary between the Ross  Embayment and western MBL may be a result of: 1) Cenozoic  extension on the eastern shoulder of the Ross Sea rift; 2) uplift  and crustal extension related to Neogene mantle plume activity in  western MBL; or a combination of the two.  Faulting and  volcanism, mountain uplift, and glacier downcutting appear to now  be active in western MBL, where generally East-to-West-flowing  outlet glaciers incise Paleozoic and Mesozoic bedrock, and  deglaciated summits indicate a previous North-South glacial flow  direction.    This study requires data collection using SOAR (Support Office  for Aerogeophysical Research, a facility supported by Office of  Polar Programs which utilizes high precision differential GPS to  support a laser altimeter, ice-penetrating radar, a towed proton  magnetometer, and a Bell BGM-3 gravimeter).  This survey requires  data for 37,000 square kilometers using 5.3 kilometer line  spacing with 15.6 kilometer tie lines, and 86,000 square  kilometers using a grid of 10.6 by 10.6 kilometer spacing.  Data  will be acquired over several key features in the region  including, among other, the eastern edge of the Ross Sea rift,  over ice stream OEO, the transition from the Edward VII Peninsula  plateau to the Ford Ranges, the continuation to the east of a  gravity high known from previous reconnaissance mapping over the  Fosdick Metamorphic Complex, an d the extent of the high-amplitude  magnetic anomalies (volcanic centers?) detected southeast of the  northern Ford Ranges by other investigators.  SOAR products will  include glaciology data useful for studying driving stresses,  glacial flow and mass balance in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  (WAIS).    The ground program is centered on the southern Ford Ranges.  Geologic field mapping will focus on small scale brittle  structures for regional kinematic interpretation, on glaciated  surfaces and deposits, and on datable volcanic rocks for  geochronologic control.  The relative significance of fault and  joint sets, the timing relationships between them, and the  probable context of their formation will also be determined.  Exposure ages will be determined for erosion surfaces and  moraines.  Interpretation of potential field data will be aided  by on ground sampling for magnetic properties and density as well  as ground based gravity measurements.  Oriented samples will be  taken for paleomagnetic studies.    Combined airborne and ground investigations will obtain basic  data for describing the geology and structure at the eastern  boundary of the Ross Embayment both in outcrop and ice covered  areas, and may be used to distinguish between Ross Sea rift-  related structural activity from uplift and faulting on the  perimeter of the MBL dome and volcanic province.  Outcrop geology  and structure will be extrapolated with the aerogeophysical data  to infer the geology that resides beneath the WAIS.  The new  knowledge of Neogene tectonics in western MBL will contribute to  a  comprehensive model for the Cenozoic Ross rift and to  understanding of the extent of plume activity in MBL.  Both are  important for determining the influence of Neogene tectonics on  the ice streams and WAIS.",
