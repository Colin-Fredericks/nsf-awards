 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700906  Dawson  The goal of this research is to characterize the dynamics of windbreak colonization by tropical forest trees and to examine how the positioning of windbreaks within the landscape influences the colonization process. In particular, the effects of windbreak connectivity and remnant trees within the windbreaks will be evaluated. Preliminary research indicates that windbreak connectivity and remnant trees increase the abundance and richness of forest trees in windbreaks. It is hypothesized that these factors enhance forest regeneration by increasing seed dispersal into the windbreaks. To understand the dynamics of forest regeneration, a combination of vegetation surveys, seed trapping, soil seed bank studies, and seed predation trials will be conducted in windbreaks and pastures in Monteverde, Costa Rica. The seed rain entering different windbreak types (connected, non-connected, and with remnant trees) and pastures will be characterized for a one-year period using seed traps. The soil seed banks of windbreaks and pastures will be assessed using the seedling emergence technique. Seed predation in windbreaks and pastures will be evaluated through seed removal experiments. This research will enhance our understanding of the dynamics of forest regeneration in agroecosystems and also provide useful information for reforestation and conservation programs in the tropics.",
