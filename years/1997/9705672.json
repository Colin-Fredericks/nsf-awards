Developing  software, which will take into account the special structure of  unconstrained optimization problems typical for the NR approach is our  second goal.  Solving real world large scale nonlinear optimization  problems is our third main target.      The ability to solve large scale nonlinear optimization problems is  critical in mechanics, structural engineering, optimal control,  tomography, image recognition, power system optimization, and  economics, to mention a few.  Recently the NR type methods have been  used with great success for solving very complex Truss Topology Design  (TTD) problems.  The TTD problems arise in structural optimization, in  particular, in creating bridges, cantilevers, and inner skeletons of  airplane wings capable of carrying external loads under different  loading scenarios.  Funding a structure, which is able to withstand  external forces, have certain characteristics of rigidity and at the  same time to have minimal cost is a typical large scale nonlinear  constrained optimization problem.  Our research is aimed to find  efficient methods for solving such problems.",
