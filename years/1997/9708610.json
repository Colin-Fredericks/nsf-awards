 "awd_abstract_narration": "For many years archaeologists have been aware of a category of sites termed `cerros de trincheras.` Located in southern Arizona and northern  Sonora Mexico they date to sometime after 1,100 AD and are characterized by complexes of walls and terraces constructed on the slopes and tops of steep volcanic and granitic hills near major streams. Investigators have proposed that they served defensive, habitational, agricultural and other functions although definitive explanations have been difficult because very few sites have been excavated. The amount of effort invested in their construction strongly suggests a sedentary society which relied on agriculture to meet subsistence needs. Within the broader context of archaeology in the region, such occurrences are not surprising since evidence clearly indicates the presence of settled agriculturists at that time in neighboring areas. Recently Dr. Hard and colleagues have discovered three cerros de trincheras sites which, based on associated stone tools appear to be Archaic in age and thus significantly older than their well known counterparts. They have been tentatively dated to the time period between 1,500 BC and 200 AD. Were such the case they would be unique and strongly challenge conventional theories of how and when sedentism emerged in the region. Almost all available evidence indicates that Archaic peoples subsisted by hunting and gathering, lived in small groups and changed residence frequently.  With NSF support Dr. Hard and his colleagues will further evaluate these Archaic cerros de trincheras sites. They will conduct limited survey, map surface features and conduct controlled stratigraphic excavations. A primary goal is to collect in situ organic materials such as wood charcoal for radiocarbon dating. Understanding what plants were being exploited is critical to the basic evaluation of the site and its potential for further investigation. Through floation of soil the investigators will search for charred seeds and other plant parts. They will also situate their excavations to obtain information which will shed light on the functions of the terraces and enigmatic rock rings which are abundant. Aerial photographs in conjunction with geological fieldwork will permit reconstruction on the environment within which this culture functioned.  The process of sedentism, the domestication of plants and animals and the development of large scale complex society has occurred independently in many parts of the world. Given the similarities among regions scientists believe that this has not happened through historic chance but rather reflects an orderly set of underlying rules. Much effort has been expended in the attempt to elucidate them. The Cerros de Trincheras sites are, in this context, particularly interesting because they are so unusual and unexpected. It is often situations which break the rules which provide the opportunity to achieve deeper levels of understanding.",
