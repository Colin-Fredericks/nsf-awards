Rutgers University is a center of excellence in ion beam and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and IBM and Lucent  Technologies add expertise in characterization of device performance.  The Engineering Research Center has succeeded in producing thin film nitrided stacked gate electronic device structures that have the potential for application in commercial markets.  This collaborative effort will provide understanding of the chemical and physical structure of these structures at the mono-atomic layer level.  This understanding is necessary if the devices are to be accepted by the industry.  The research consists of three tasks:  1) materials synthesis (NC State),  2) ion beam and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Rutgers University), and  3) definition of materials specifications at the monolayer level for advanced device structures (IBM and Lucent).  One of the main goals is to transfer knowledge gained in this research to industry.",
