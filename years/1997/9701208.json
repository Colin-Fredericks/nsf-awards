Ms. Kearney's dissertation research involves a higher-level phylogenetic analysis of the Order Amphisbaenia, a group of highly specialized, limbless, burrowing reptiles that spend their entire life in underground tunnels.  Osteological characters will be examined from fossil and Recent forms primarily to: (i) identify monophyletic taxa within Amphisbaenia; and (ii) ascertain patterns and directions of divergence in morphological characters.  The research also seeks to identify effects of different character-coding approaches on phylogenetics analysis and explore theoretical issues associated with missing data in phylogenetic reconstruction.   Ultimately, the study will lead to a phylogenetic hypothesis of Amphisnaenia that will test previous taxonomies (leading to an improved classification), elucidate patterns of structural diversification, and contribute to systematic theory and methodology.  Support for training of graduate students in modern technologies is critical to maintain the workforce of scientists capable of addressing questions and issues in global biology.",
