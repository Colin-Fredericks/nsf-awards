 "awd_abstract_narration": "9613738  Petzel  Antarctic fish have the highest serum osmolality of any  seawater teleost.  Maintenance of fluid balance is crucial  for survival.  Upon warm acclimation from -1.5o to 4oC the  fish lmse 20% of their serum osmolality through extrusion of  NaC1 across the gill.  NaC1 extrusion in fish is primarily  performed by chloride-secreting cells located on the gill  arches and gill opercula.  The driving force for NaC1  transport is the Na/K-ATPase.  To date, no information is  available concerning role and regulation of the elevated  serum osmolarity in Antarctic fish.  Questions which arise  include:  What role does the chloride cell play in mediating  salt extrusion?  Which hormones regulate chloride cell  activity?  The chloride cell physiology and regulation in  Antarctic fish will be compared with a New Zealand fish  which is eurythermal.    The goals of the proposed research are to determine the  plasticity of Antarctic and New Zealand fish gill function  at the physiological level (through studies of ion transport  activity) and molecular level (through studies of the  Na/K-ATPase enzyme), specifically this research will: 1)  determine the gill extrusion mechanisms underlying the  increase in gill Na/K-ATPase activity upon warm acclimation  in Antarctic fish and 2) determine the hormonal regulation  of the gill extrusion mechanisms. Previously it was shown  that upon warming of Antarctic fish there is an increase in  NaC1 extrusion as a result of increases in gill total  Na/K-ATPase enzyme levels.    The proposed experiments will measure chloride cell  morphology, metabolism, physiolmgy and regulation in  parallel with effects of warming and cooling on the whole  fish.  Measurements of chloride cell morphology will include  changes in diameter and number of cells at different  temperatures.  In order to ascertain the role of Na/K-ATPase  in mediating the enhanced salt extrusion upon warming, we  will measure total enzyme activity and total number of  enzymes.  The role of the chlor ide cell in transport of C1  and Na will assayed by placing the gill opercula sheet  epithelia in Using chambers to determine the influence of  fish warming on short-circuit current, which is a direct  measurement of chloride transport through chloride cells.  Finally, regulation of chloride cell function will be  determined by altering palsma levels cortisol, prolactin and  endogenous endocrines.    The results from the proposed experiments will, for the  first time, describe in detail the underlying mechanism(s)  mediating the enhance hypo-osmoregulation observed in  Antarctic fish and will allow the comparison of these  results to those observed in a eurythermal New Zealand fish.",
