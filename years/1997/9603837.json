 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603837  Denson    Electrical activity in the central nervous system (CNS)  results from the transmembrane movement of charged ions  through special openings in the neuron membrane called ion  channels. One important ion channel within the CNS is a  special type of potassium channel (called big potassium or  BK-channels) which allows potassium ions to move from the  inside to the outside of the cell . This movement is  essential to maintain normal rhythmic activity of  repetitively firing brain cells such as those involved in  regulation of the heart rate and rhythm and sleep.  Because  of the importance of these channels, the mechanisms  responsible for controlling their activity are interesting.  Although some regulation of these channels depends upon  changes in intracellular ions, regulation of  these channels  also involves chemicals which are normally produced in the  cell membrane. Most of these chemicals are derived via the  breakdown of fatty molecules called phospholipids.    One  major chemical reaction involves the production of a  chemical called arachidonic acid from these phospholipids.  Arachidonic acid has been shown to activate this special  type of potassium channel  either directly or by the  regulation of other intracellular chemicals.  To understand  this regulation  requires an examination of the both  arachidonic acid  and the other chemicals which may be  affected by arachidonic acid.  Since arachidonic acid is  such an important regulatory chemical in terms of producing  electrophysiologic responses, the experiments in this  proposal will focus on the several possible pathways which  govern arachidonic acid production.  The objectives of the  proposal are: (1) determine the  characteristics of arachidonic acid activation of BK  channels; (2) determine if arachidonic acid production is  regulated by other chemicals to control the normal activity  of BK channels, and; (3)  determine whether the activity of these BK-channels is  influenced by other chemicals produced norma lly by chemical  reactions in the cell membrane.  The results of this  research will increase the understanding of BK-channel  regulation, in particular, but also central nervous system  ion channels, in general.  In addition, the work could  provide a new description of the interaction between product  molecules resulting from membrane-associated chemical  reactions which could be important in regulating rhythmic  electrical activity in the central nervous system.",
