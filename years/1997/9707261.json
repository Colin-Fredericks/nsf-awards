There are nine invited principle speakers.  These are:  Walter Allegretto, University of Alberta, Canada, Microsensor Analysis and Simulation  Jerry L. Bona,University of Texas, Stability and Instability of Solitary Waves and Associated Singularity Formation  Djairo de Figueiredo, University of Campinas, Brazil, Decay, Symmetry and Existence of Positive Solutions of Semilinear Elliptic Systems  S. Godunov, Sobolev Institute of Mathematics, Russia, Spectral Stratification in Models of Finite Elements for Elliptic Problems  Anthony Jameson, Princeton University, Title to be announced  Jean Mawhin, Universite de Louvain, Belgium, Floquet Boundary Value Problems for Nonlinear Differential Equations: A Blend of Topology and Symmetry     Stanley Osher, University of California, The Level Set Method: What's In It For You?  Klaus Schmitt, University of Utah, Bifurcation Problems for Variational Inequalities  Joseph Shang, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, High Resolution Schemes  for Computational Electromagnetics in the Time Domain  This interdisciplinary conference will provide a joint forum where mathematicians, scientists, and engineers from academia and industry can exchange research ideas involving theoretical and applied developments in differential equations and computational   simulations.  In addition to the nine principal lecturers, there will be sessions of contributed talks.  This conference is held bi-annually.  Reviewed manuscripts will be published as a special issue of the  Electronic Journal of Differential Equations.  Information on the conference is available on the conference home web page: http://www.msstate.edu/Dept/Math/conf.html",
