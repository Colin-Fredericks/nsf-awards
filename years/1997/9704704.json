One important lesson learned from application performance analysis is that it is important to expose and utilize all available input/output concurrency.  A traditional sequential file model does not allow applications to express the parallel nature of their resource demands, or to exploit the full parallel file system bandwidth.   This research proposes new application-level input/output interfaces to express parallelism that cannot be automatically detected.  Interfaces to access parallel files with partially ordered or unordered records will be created and evaluated on a variety of parallel platforms, quantifying the performance improvements achieved at various levels within the file system. The demonstrated benefits of application supplies access pattern information; while file system policy control drive attempts to standardize system and application-level programming interfaces.   However, the division between system and application-level file system functionality is poorly understood.  This research helps to define this boundary for a large and important class of parallel scientific applications.",
