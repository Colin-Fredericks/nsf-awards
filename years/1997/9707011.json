 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Ash-Wang      Ash and Wang first major goal is to generalized theorems of Victor   Shapiro and Jean Bourgain concerning uniqueness of representation   by spherically convergent multiple trigonometric series.  Shapiro   proved that if a multiple trigonometric series is everywhere Abel   spherically summable to an integrable function and if Shapiro's   condition holds, then it is the Fourier series of that function.    Shapiro's condition states that the ratio of the sum of the absolute   values of the coefficients lying in an annulus of unit thickness   to the radius tends to zero as the radius tends to infinity. A  more natural condition is Connes' condition: that the sum of the   squares of the coefficients lying on the surface of a sphere tends   to zero as the radius tends to infinity. Since Connes' condition   is a consequence of everywhere convergence, Bourgain was able to   avoid any coefficient growth assumptions when he proved that a   multiple trigonometric series everywhere spherically convergent to   zero is the zero function. Ash and Wang will try to prove Shapiro's   result with  Connes' condition replacing Shapiro's condition in the   hypothesis. A corollary of this theorem would be spherical uniqueness   for trigonometric series that converge everywhere to an integrable   function. Furthermore, Ash and Wang would like to lighten the   hypothesis of everywhere convergence, by allowing an exceptional set   on which convergence is not assumed.  Such a set is called a set of   uniqueness. Ash and Wang would like to show that all countable sets   and certain uncountable  sets are sets of uniqueness.      Almost any surface is composed of simpler ones by a process called  multiple Fourier analysis. A major long standing problem in pure   mathematics is to show that this construction can be accomplished   in only one way. This is called the problem of uniqueness. There are   about a half dozen main varieties of this problem depending on just   how the simpler surfaces are c ombined to make the general surface.   In particular, Ash and Wang will try to determine if uniqueness   holds for square convergent double trigonometric series.  Ash and Wang will also try to  show that certain thin sets may be   ignored when considering the question of uniqueness for spherically   convergent multiple trigonometric series.  Since we live in a four   dimensional world of space and time, it is also necessary to study   a higher dimensional version of a surface.  Such an object is called   a manifold.  Just as surfaces are associated with double   trigonometric series, manifolds are associated with  multiple trigonometric series. Thus, Ash and Wang will also try to   determine if uniqueness holds for spherically convergent   multiple trigonometric series.",
