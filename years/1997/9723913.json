 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evans  9723913      Anthropogenic activity is having a dramatic impact on  ecosystem nitrogen dynamics. Nitrogen is the element that  most often limits growth, and species-specific responses to  changes in nitrogen dynamics can alter species composition  and decrease biodiversity. Natural variation of stable  isotopes of nitrogen ('5N; IN) can provide new insights  into dynamics of plant nitrogen use. The forms of nitrogen  absorbed by plants have very different isotopic  compositions (FIN), so plant of N may be a powerful tool to  quantify acquisition of nitrogen from different sources. A  common assumption is that foliar oven depends solely on the  own of the nitrogen source, but it is now apparent that  variation in foliar 6~sN can also result from physiological  processes within the plant. This study will provide a  mechanistic understanding of the factors that control plant  own and outlines a physiologically-based model that can be  used to quantify absorption of nitrogen from different  sources. The significance of the proposed research is that  a mechanistic understanding of the factors controlling  plant 6~sN in combination with a physiologicallybased model  will provide a tool to quantify acquisition of nitrogen  from different sources within the environment, enabling us  to increase our fundamental understanding of plant nitrogen  dynamics.",
