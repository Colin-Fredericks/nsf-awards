It  builds upon earlier successful studies of the inflow of  intermediate water masses into the Eastern Weddell Sea, their  modification within the Weddell Gyre, and their interaction with  bottom water formation processes in the western Weddell Sea.  The  study is called Deep Ocean Ventilation Through Antarctic  Intermediate Layers (DOVETAIL) and includes six components  involving hydrographic measurements, natural tracer experiments,  and modeling studies.  The study will be centered east of the  Drake Passage where water masses from the Weddell Sea and the  Scotia Sea come together in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence, and  will be carried out in cooperation with the national antarctic  programs of Germany and Spain.       The study has four related objectives.  The first is to  assess the quantity and the physical and chemical characteristics  of  Weddell Sea source waters for the confluence.  The second is  to describe the dominant processes associated with spreading and  sinking of dense antarctic waters within the Weddell-Scotia  Confluence.  The third is to estimate the ventilation rate of the  world ocean, and the fourth is to estimate seasonal fluctuations  in the regional ocean transport and hydrographic structure and to  assess the likely influence of seasonal to interannual  variability on rates of ventilation by Weddell Sea waters.       Ventilation of the deep ocean -- the rising of sub-surface  water masses to the surface to be recharged with atmospheric  gases and to give up heat to the atmosphere -- is a uniquely  antarctic phenomenon that has significant consequences for global  change by affecting the global reservoir of carbon dioxide, and  by modulating the amount and extent of seasonal sea ice in the  southern hemisphere.       This component of DOVETAIL will make measurem ents on both  transient and steady-state tracers to examine the sources,  pathways, and average residence times of the various water masses  in the confluence region.  Tritium (an isotope of hydrogen),  helium-3, helium-4, carbon-14, oxygen-18, and various  chlorofluorocarbons will be used to differentiate the sources of  confluence water (e.g. precipitation, glacial melt water, deep  water of Atlantic origin), to determine their average residence  times at the surface, and to use the tracer distributions as  input to model simulations of the bottom water formation process  ***",
