 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective  The objective of this project is to integrate Geographic Information Systems (GIS) into the undergraduate curriculum.  Currently, only advanced undergraduate and graduate students have access to GIS.  This project will expand access through three initiatives:         > Exposure of general education students in World Regional Geography to           the power of computerized geographic information technologies,         > Conversion of an upper division urban geography course from lecture           based learning to GIS technology based learning,         > Expanded access to computing resources for advanced geography majors          in cartography, GIS, and land use analysis courses.      Methods  The objectives of this proposal will achieved through the conversion of the existing GIS/Cartography lab to a modern, networked learning environment with 25 student workstations connected to a dedicated Windows NT server.  Three curriculum innovations, which have already been initiated on a limited basis using the existing facility, will be fully implemented once expanded access to GIS has been achieved.      Significance  GIS is exerting a revolutionary impact on the nature of modern geography and geographic education.  For non-majors, GIS offers a graphics-rich, programmable learning environment for accessing information about the world and for developing spatial reasoning skills.  for geography majors, GIS represents an advanced information technology that can facilitate the learning of important geographic concepts.  For advanced undergraduates, GIS provides a wide range of challenging high-technology career and research opportunities.  Finally, it is noteworthy that this lab will make use of network management software to facilitate instructional support.  If this approach proves useful in monitoring and responding to the demands of the students, this would be additional valuable information developed in this project.    *",
