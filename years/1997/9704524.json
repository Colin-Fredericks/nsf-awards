 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704524  STRAWDERMAN    This research project is devoted to the development of improved estimators in problems where several parameters are to be estimated.  Attention will be primarily focused on estimation of location parameters.  The types of improved estimators to be studied fall under the general category of shrinkage estimators and will typically be hierarchical bayes, empirical bayes or Stein-type estimators.  Attention will be focused on deriving improved estimators when the normality assumption is removed or the loss function is other than quadratic.  Conditions on prior distributions which lead to improved procedures will also be emphasized.    One of the most important problems in science involves the estimation of unknown quantities based on data obtained via experimentation and sampling.  It is typically the case that several parameters are to be estimated.  A standard method of estimating such  quantities ( called  parameters by statisticians) is to take the averages of several observations based on a series of experiments.  In certain circumstances, when several such parameters are to be estimated, it has been shown that one may obtain improved estimators by combining data across (seemingly) unrelated experiments.  We study this phenomenon, extend the class of problems where such improved estimators exist, and study the extent  of improvement possible over standard procedures.  This research is applicable  in virtually all areas of physical, biological and social science science.  In particular the author has been involved in a number of studies in environmental sciences where these techniques have been successfully employed.",
