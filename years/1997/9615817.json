 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is supporting a   Satellite Symposium on Density Functional Theory and Applications which   will be held from June 3-9, 1997 on the campus of Duke University in   Durham, North Carolina.  It is to be followed immediately by the 9th   International Congress of Quantum Chemistry in Atlanta, Georgia.  Density   Functional Theory has become a major theoretical method for electronic   structure calculations of molecules and condensed matter.  The symposium   will bring together theoretical and computational chemists, physicists   from around the world who are on the frontier of the development of the   basic formalism and applications of density functional theory.  It is   anticipated that approximately 200 scientists will participate in this   conference including 50 speakers.  What is particularly significant for   US Science is the large size of the symposium and the fact that it is   going to be the first one accessible to a relatively large number of US   graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  This symposium is organized   by Prof. W. Yang of Duke University and Prof. M. Levy of Tulane.",
