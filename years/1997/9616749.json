 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616749  Garg  This grant consists of a theoretical study of quantum  phenomena in complex systems.  The specific projects include  (1) macroscopic quantum tunneling or resonance in ferro and  antiferromagnetic particles of size 50-75 A, domain walls in  magnetic wires and in SQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum  Interference Devices) and (2) decoherence effects in quantum  computers.  The PI has earlier proposed that nuclear spin  dissipation is critical to understanding both the coherence  effects as well as tunneling in magnetic particles.  This  grant continues further exploration of possible dissipation  sources and their consequences in the experiments.  Quantum  computers are devices which aim to exploit the linearity of  the superposition principle to achieve computational  parallelism.  The operation of these computers, however,  requires strict coherence between all their elements.  Using  the techniques developed in the first project, it may be  possible to analyze whether an interaction with environment  is too deleterious for the desirable properties of a quantum  computer.  %%%  This is a mid career PI who has emerged as an acknowledged  expert on applications of quantum mechanics to complex  systems, in particular on the effect of environment on  quantum phenomena.  The proposed research has both  fundamental and somewhat more applied aspects. In the first  category, he is proposing to study quantum phenomena that  are commonly seen at the microscopic level, but rarely at  the macroscopic level, because they are masked by  environmental noise. Specifically, he is proposing to study  these quantum effects in small magnetic particles and narrow  wires, where the chances for experimental observation are  believed to be highest. In the second category he proposes  to consider the limitations of recently proposed quantum  computers as they are influenced by the environment. This  influence is widely accepted as being detrimental to the  operation of quantum computers, but the current  under standing in the field is largely qualitative. The PI  proposes to make quantitative assessments of its severity  using methods developed in the course of studying  macroscopic quantum phenomena.",
