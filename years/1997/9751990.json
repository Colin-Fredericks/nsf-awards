 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the unprecedented technological advances experienced in the telecommunications industry over the past decade, the challenge to provide that industry with adequately trained and proficient individuals is crucial if American industry is to maintain its competitive edge in the increasingly competitive global marketplace.  The ultimate goals and objectives of the Northeast Center for Telecommunications Technology are aimed at increasing the number of trained persons equipped to ensure such a competitive posture.  This is being done by monitoring trends, developing and disseminating relevant curricula and materials, exploring and promoting the best educational methods, ensuring the continuing competency of faculty who teach telecommunications-related programs, and recruiting and educating a diverse student population.  By developing model curricula in conjunction with telecommunications industry partners, the project is serving as a national model.  To this end, an intense effort is also being made to develop a diverse telecommunications workforce, including non-traditional workers.  The target audience are the faculty and students at two-year colleges, universities and secondary schools.  Both traditional and newly emerging teaching methods (such as virtual classroom and laboratories) are being employed.  Given the rising importance of the field of telecommunications, following evaluation of the project, its outcomes are being disseminated nationally.      Led by Springfield Technical Community College in Massachusetts and Hudson Valley Community College in New York, a consortium of six senior institutions, ten community technical colleges, numerous secondary schools, several business/industry partners, government agencies, and the New England Board of Higher Education are participants in the project. The major areas of telecommunications are networking, wireless/RF, Microwave/Millimeterwave and Lightwave technologies.  The program articulates with BSET degrees at four regional universities a nd with the NYNEX \"Next Step\" program.",
