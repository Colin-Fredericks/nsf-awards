(NMR) diffusion measurements on an existing NMR spectrometer at Northwestern.  The equipment con-  sists of a diffusion package, including an amplifier and spectrometer software, as well    as a custom-built pulsed field gradient NMR diffusion probe.  The equipment will be dedicated to support research in engineering.  It will be used for several research projects,  including 1) and investigation of mass transfer effects in zeolite catalysis, 2) studies of multicomponent diffusion in zeolites, 3) research on small-molecule diffusion in polymer solutions, 4) studies of polymer diffusion in polymer situations and 5) investigations of small-molecule diffusion in bulk polymers.  As part of the general user facility that maintains the NMR spectrometer, the new equipment will be made available to researchers working on other projects as well.",
