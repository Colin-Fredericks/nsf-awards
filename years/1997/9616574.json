 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616574  Singh  This mid-career PI has been successful in rejuvenating the  technique of high temperature series expansion in  statistical mechanics and has applied it to a wide variety  of problems in quantum magnetism. The new magnetic materials  in this study include, apart from the technologically  important high-temperature superconductors and colossal  magnetoresistance Perovskites; the inorganic spin-Peierls  CuGeO3  and quasi two dimensional spin gap materials CaV4O9.  In this grant the high temperature series expansion is  supplemented by zero temperature high order perturbation  expansion and exact diagonalization (especially the Kernel  Polynomial method) for finite lattices.  The focus will be  to calculate the temperature dependent spectral properties  of the various quantum spin models, e.g. Heisenberg-Ising,  and their parent models of strongly correlated electrons  such as, Hubbard, t-J, Kondo-lattice and double exchange  models.  %%%  This mid-career PI has been applauded for revitalizing the  technique of high temperature series expansion in  statistical mechanics.  He has successfully applied this  technique to gather critical insight in the properties of  several novel magnets.  This grant is to support a  continuing growth of his research program which includes  consideration of additional, more complex techniques.  The  results will be compared to a variety of experiments.",
