 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the  purchase of a nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) spectrometer (Varian Unity INOVA 300 NB) and a software package designed for the analysis of data obtained from the spectrometer.  This equipment enables a large number of undergraduate students to obtain spectra for their own individual samples.  The students can then analyze the data on the computer, interpret the spectra, and, when necessary, return to the computer to refine some feature of the spectra.  In the organic chemistry laboratory, five experiments involve this instrument being used to answer structural questions.  In addition, alternating organic laboratory sections are using the spectrometer on a weekly basis to characterize the other compounds that are synthesized.  This continuing use strongly reinforces the learning process.  The spectrometer is being similarly used in the inorganic chemistry laboratory to answer structural questions and to characterize products that are synthesized.  In the higher level laboratories, the spectrometer is being employed in experiments that illustrate more advanced techniques.  The biochemistry laboratory is using the instrumentation to study protein dynamics.  The advanced laboratory is using the machine's variable temperature capabilities to measure equilibrium constants. INOVA 300 NB is capable of performing all the modern NMR experiments at a reasonably high field of 300 MHz, which is sufficient for undergraduate experiments.  This project is part of a larger program to introduce computers and instruments into lectures and laboratories to further the development of the students' skills in device-computer interfacing, handling and manipulating information, and communicating the results of their experiments.   *",
