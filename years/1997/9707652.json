 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707652  Brown  This is a promising new investigator in the field of  biomaterials and tissue engineering.  She has great  potential to become a fine scientist.  Funding of this  proposal is expected to advance the PI's career and meet the  goals of this program.    The proposed research investigates novel polymers that swell  and collapse in response to electrical stimuli.  These  materials may be useful for modulated drug delivery.  The PI  has already constructed a prototype of the electrorelease  chamber used in these studies and has an appropriate  background to conduct the proposed studies.  In addition to  potential drug delivery applications, the proposed  technology may be useful for in vitro evaluation of cellular  responses to various substances.    As technical notes, LDH is a crude measure of cytotoxicity  and biocompatibility, as it detects rupture of cell  membranes.  Changes in insulin production, cell metabolism,  etc. will be observed long before membrane rupture.  Inclusion of a diagram of the electrorelease chamber would  have been helpful, in that the photograph provided was not  very clear.  ***",
