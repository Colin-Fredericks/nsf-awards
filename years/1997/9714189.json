 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714189  Lawrenz    This project proposes to fill the gap in long-term enhancement evaluation by conducting a multiple method, longitudinal study of a science teacher enhancement project.  This evaluation will examine both the long term effects of teacher enhancement on an existing cohort of students, and the subsequent effects of teacher enhancement on new cohorts of students.  Specifically, the project will examine the persistence of a teacher enhancement project by comparing groups of students whose teachers did and did not participate in the enhancement project.  Two investigations are proposed: 1) follow cohorts of 9th grade students into 12th grade to compare science achievement; 2) compare the learning environment and science achievement of subsequent cohorts of 9th grade students.  These two investigations will allow us to determine the extent to which the teacher enhancement project persisted into the future.  The proposed evaluation will be conducted at five high schools that participated in the teacher enhancement project.  We will collect a comprehensive variety of data including classroom observations of teachers twice a year, interviews with teachers and students, interviews with principals, student written questionnaires, and both hands-on and written assessments of students' achievement of the NRC science standards.  The results of this evaluation will be used to examine the extent to which NSF funded teacher enhancement can affect teacher performance and subsequently affect outcomes in science.",
