 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603336  Lenk    The rapidly expanding use of the Internet coupled with an explosive growth of diverse, quality resources available on the Internet, can provide learners with hitherto unparalleled access to current scientific data and information. In fact, the ability of K-12 students and teachers to participate in the creation and use of scientific databases is a core educational application of the Internet, and central to a number of NSF-funded projects in K-12 science education. The openness of these Internet resources means that large numbers of learners in schools, homes, or other out-of-school settings with Internet access have the potential to participate in these database projects. However, most funded projects have the financial and human resources to involve only a relatively small number of participants. If such Internet database projects are to have the widest possible dissemination, finding ways to broaden participation and scale-up these resources to reach a diverse and large group of users is essential.    The Internet Database Access project will develop, evaluate, and disseminate database models and strategies that promote the scaling up of Internet science education database resources so that they are widely accessible to K-12 classrooms, as well as, to a diverse group of children and adults in homes and other out-of -school settings. The project builds on three database projects currently being developed for K-12 science education and funded by NSF and other federal agencies: WhaleNet (whale observation data), EnviroNet (environmental monitoring data), and Hands-On Universe (astronomical images). In designing new database models and approaches, this project will take advantage of both the capabilities of the web and new database tools for web-based applications. Concurrently the project will disseminate the ongoing results of its work through web-based mechanisms. The proposed project will undertake activities in three major areas:    * Design, develop, and evaluate new web-ba sed database prototypes that facilitate the scaling-up of these science education databases to increase participation by K-12 students and teachers who are currently not involved in these NSF-funded projects.  * Concurrently, design and assess strategies that increase participation and collaboration in these database resources by a broad range of participants, including children and adult learners in homes and other out-of -school settings.  * Disseminate information about our database models and scaleability strategies through the Internet and other media to assist other web-based educational projects in designing, implementing, and scaling-up their resources.  * ***",
