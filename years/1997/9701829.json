 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9701829  Cole    Clark Atlanta University, in cooperation with its sister United  Negro College Fund (UNCF) institutions in Georgia (Morehouse,  Morris Brown, Paine and Spelman Colleges), proposes to establish an  Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) program.  The junior  college partner is Atlanta Metropolitan College and the Atlanta  Public Schools is the junior precollege partner.  The combined  undergraduate enrollment of the Georgia-UNCF AMP exceeds 15,000  with more than 55,000 precollege students.  The enrollment in the  sciences, engineering and mathematics (SEM) is 2,640.  The goal of  the program is to double the number of SEM graduates by the year  2002 based on the 1996 rate and to improve the quality of  instruction to insure that increased numbers of baccalaureate  recipients go on to graduate study.  Building on the strengths of  each partner, this AMP will (1) increase the recruitment efforts of  potential SEM majors from Georgia; (2) establish or enhance  prefreshmen summer bridge programs for 125 students; (3) provide  financial support through scholarships and research assistantships;  (4) provide students with research experiences; (5) improve the SEM  curricula with a special emphasis on entry level courses; (6)  improve the instruction in entry level SEM courses; and (7) conduct  workshops on mentoring and peer tutoring, and establish  relationships with 10 graduate programs.  Dr. Thomas W. Cole, Jr.  President of Clark Atlanta University is Principal Investigator,  Dr. Melvin R. Webb is Project Director and Dr. Denise Stephenson-  Hawk is Project Co-Director.  Dr. Thomas W. Cole, Jr. will Chair  the AMP's Governing Board.  The National Advisory Committee will be  chaired by Dr. David C. Turner of the Naval Research Laboratory.   Each AMP institution will have a campus coordinator and an  interdisciplinary faculty team to work with the program.  UNCF will  provide staff resources as well as fund-raising and publicity  assistance.",
