 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708581  Percec    This research will design libraries of monodendritic building  blocks with well defined flat tapered and conical shapes which  self-assemble into cylindrical and respectively spherical shapes.  These supermolecules will generate columnar hexagonal and  spherical thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystalline (LC)  phases.  These LC phases will warrant a thermodynamic control of  their assembly and will allow the determination of their shape by  X-ray diffraction.  Libraries of flat tapered and conical  monodendritic building blocks functionalized with polymerizable  groups will be polymerized via living methods to generate the  first examples of giant polymers with cylindrical and spherical  shapes with diameter and length and respectively diameter  controlled at the nanoscale level.  The organization of these  giant dendritic monomers in a LC assembly will also be used to  aggregate their polymerizable groups in a reactor of artificially  enhanced concentration and restricted geometry during the  polymerization process and therefore, will generate a new  approach to the control of polymerization.  This research will  provide an entry into the design of polymeric materials with  predictable and dramatically different properties which are  determined by their shape.  Cylindrical and spherical giant  polymers obtained from flexible backbones jacketed with dendritic  coats will access new mechanisms to control the conformation and  rigidity of their flexible chain regardless of their tacticity.  Mechanisms to change in a reversible and controlled way the shape  of the polymer from rod-like to spherical will be elaborated.  It  is expected that these cylindrical 3-D polymers will produce more  rigid structures than the currently known 1-D linear rigid-rods.  %%%  This research will transplant concepts from Nature into the field  of   complex  synthetic  polymeric  materials.   Natural  systems  provide  the  most  efficient  mechanisms  for  the  storage  and  transfer  of  energy  and information and for  the  production  of  structural  materials.  The polymeric systems developed  by  this  program  will provide new technologic concepts which  will  allow  for  the  first  time the development of new  materials  such  as  functional   fibers,  films,  membranes,  viscosity  controllers,  electronic,   photonic  and  controlled  release   systems   with  externally   regulated   physical   properties   via   principles  elaborated by Nature during the long process of evolution.  ***",
