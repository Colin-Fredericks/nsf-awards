 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT       Tao will study geometrical analysis conjectures and results,   and relate them to oscillatory integral statements such as  the restriction conjecture.  A typical example of the former is the  Kakeya conjecture, that a set which contains a line segment in every   direction in R^n must have dimension n.  A typical example of the   latter is the generalized Strichartz estimate for various PDE (the   wave equation, the Schrodinger equation, etc.).  It has been known   since the 1970s that there is an intimate relationship between the   two types of statements, but no systematic approach exists, and the   few concrete connections that are known are not very satisfactory.    We hope to collect, simplify, unify, and extend previous results in   this direction. Tao will also attack some of these conjectures (notably   the Kakeya conjecture) directly, using some new and promising   techniques; for example, Tao will exploit the affine invariance of   the Kakeya conjecture.    One of the aims of this work is to deepen our understanding   of oscillatory integrals, which are a type of mathematical expression   which occur in many places in physics (optics, quantum mechanics,   acoustics, and any other field of physics dealing with waves), as well   as having theoretical importance in other fields of mathematics.    Understanding these integrals, and in particular knowing how large   they can get, may ultimately lead to new designs for physical   applications (e.g. tennis rackets that maximize the area of the   \"sweet spot\", or curved reflectors that have a large number of focus   points for a wide range of frequencies), or at least place theoretical   limits on such designs.  There are also numerical applications when   modeling certain physical systems (e.g. the seismic behavior of the   Earth); if one knows that a certain oscillatory integral will never   become very \"large\" in a certain technical sense, then this will   provide a theoretical guarantee to the accuracy of the computer   sim ulation of the physical system. Tao will study these   oscillatory integrals with the aid of geometry; a connection between   these two fields of mathematics is known (being somewhat similar to   the relationship between geometrical optics and the wave theory of   light), but is not understood completely.  If this connection is   developed thoroughly enough, we may be able to reduce difficult   questions in oscillatory integrals to simpler problems in geometry,   or at least use geometrical techniques to obtain partial progress on   the oscillatory integral problems.",
