 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large data sets are a given in modern industry, technology and  science, and demand statistical attention to treat such central  issues as detecting new patterns and relationships in a reliable  and computationally feasible way.  While the need is apparent,  paths to bringing statistical science to bear on large data sets  are not clearly mapped, in part because the sheer volume of the  data prevents direct use of standard techniques.      This proposal comprises a pair of interconnected pilot projects  targeted to stimulate statistical science entree to this rapidly  changing terrain.  Each has a major industria;l partner, which  has committed substantial resources.  The projects and partners  are Drug Discovery (Glaxo Wellcome, Research Traingle Park, NC)  and Telecommunications Fraud (AT&T Laboratories, Murray Hill,  NJ).  In both instances there are specific scientific isues with  high-stakes implications for the industry at large; each is  speculative, in the sense that the path from data to information  to knowledge is not known in advance.    In drug discovery, the critical problem is to find new potent,  non-toxic compounds.  New statistical methods will be developed  to search substantial data sets generated by recent advances in  robotic synthesis and screening in order to identify key features  of compounds, leading to better ones, in the presence of highly  complex (and very high-dimensional) descriptions of the  molecules.    Within the hundreds of millions of long distance calls per day a  small fraction are illegal or unauthorized, but result in costs  of hundreds of millions of dollars annually.  The problem is to  detect and characterize, as rapidly as possible, patterns of  transactions that are unusual, and potentially fraudulent, with  special attention to controlling error rates (false alarms,  failures to detect), an issue exacerbated by the enormous  multiplicity of decisions made on a continual basis.    The two problem areas have common features: sequential  statistical  search for important or unusual patters in the data;  data that are highly complex in sheer quantity, in high-dimensional description of each data point, or in the diversity  of their sources.  Approaching these issues will be done by teams  of cross-disciplinary researchers at distributed sites and  closely managed by NISS.    This GOALI project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
