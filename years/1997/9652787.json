 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate science and engineering students nationwide need the opportunity to incorporate state-of-the-art research into their educational experiences. This project presents a new initiative in response to a national goal of linking science and engineering education with research. The objective is to develop a novel center for undergraduate research and instruction at MIT's Haystack Observatory, operated by the Northeast Radio Observatory Corporation (NEROC)--a consortium of non-profit educational institutions.         The recent growth in Internet connectivity offers a new opportunity: to provide remote access to the 37-meter Haystack radio telescope, one of the largest in the world, and to give students the educational background, support, and instrumentation necessary to pursue challenging and exciting experiments in astrophysics. These experiments will allow students to utilize diverse concepts from physics, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, and  engineering, and learn to solve multidisciplinary problems.         A low-cost 3m-radio-telescope kit is also being developed as a complement to observations with the 37m-telescope. Construction and operation of this small telescope will provide students with valuable hands-on experience with microwave and computer technology.         This project provides support for the development and implementation of an educational program that includes the preparation of educational material, tutorials, and tools to provide students the necessary background in radio astronomy. Support for the planning and conduct of research projects is included. Workshops will be held for both faculty and students.         This educational program will be implemented through a phased approach, starting with a pilot project between MIT and University of Massachusetts, Lowell. The program will then extend to regional colleges to further test the developed materials and techniques prior to the ultimate goal: national access to the telescope. This program will  expand research and undergraduate education nationwide.         This activity is jointly supported by the Division of Undergraduate Education, the Division of Astronomical Sciences, and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.",
