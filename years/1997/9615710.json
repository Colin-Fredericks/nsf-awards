The principal investigator is Dr. Charles Pidgeon of the Illinois Institute of Technology.  The investigator proposes to develop immobilized artificial membranes (IAMs) as solid phase analogues to fluid membranes, in particular phospholipid based biomembranes.  The objective is to quantify the environment a solute experiences in a lipid biomembrane, by using an accurate structural mimic that is less fragile.  The IAM can therefore be used in a chromatographic mode, with technological implications to biomolecule separations.    Lipid membranes are fragile and this makes it hard to study the partitioning and transport of molecules into and through the membrane.  By preparing a more structurally stable analog of lipid membranes, it becomes possible to characterize the environment of biomolecules that partition into these biologically very important, self-assembling systems.  Furthermore, these partitioning characteristics can be utilized in developing new chromatographic separation techniques.  Additionally, the IAMs can be used as drug delivery vehicles.  The project therefore, has the potential to contribute to both fundamental science, and to technology advancement.",
