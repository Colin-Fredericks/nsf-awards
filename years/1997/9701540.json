Baker Kearfott      During the past two decades, understanding of singularities, bifurcations  and related phenomena, and relevance to the physical world have increased.  At the same time, tools for bounding discretization and roundoff error have  improved, to allow automatic result verification based on classical  fixed point theory.  Traditionally, such verification proceeds by   linearization, then bounding with interval arithmetic.  However, in  methods developed to date, existence and uniqueness verification   necessarily must fail when the system is singular at solutions.  Goals  of this project are to (1) develop new, simple and natural modifications  to existing verification techniques, to prove existence and uniqueness  when the nonlinear system is singular; (2) investigate the power of  the resulting tools, first for finite-dimensional problems (algebraic  systems), then for infinite-dimensional problems (differential and  integral equations); (3) increase understanding of singularities.      Many complex systems throughout the sciences and engineering, ranging from  load-bearing civil engineering structures to ecological systems to  human heart rythms,  are modeled by sets of nonlinear equations that   exhibit singularities and bifurcations.  Such bifurcations correspond   to changes in behavior  as conditions (the load, a temperature, etc.) change.  Understanding of such phenomena has blossomed in recent years, but analytical  problems remain.  This study will provide tools to enable an efficient and  automated, yet mathematically airtight analysis.  This in turn will  lead to more predictability in the physical world.",
