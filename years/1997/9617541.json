In addition to the research projects themselves, it is planned to compare the effectiveness of the algorithms and methods on Fibre Channel to that on an ATM network.    The project on path following, visualization and steering of liquid crystal calculations involves the development of efficient algorithms to solve large scale liquid crystal problems in a distributed network environment and the tools to visualize and steer the resulting calculations.  The project on large scalable parallel quantum Monte Carlo methods involves investigation of communication and load balancing  in highly scalable implementations of electronic structure calculations.  The algorithms and performance will be compared on high-bandwidth networks and parallel machines. The project on distributed operating  systems is designed to enable the effective use of ensembles of workstations. This involves microkernel-based operating systems for networks of heterogeneous machines and heterogeneous distributed scheduling systems for WANs and LANs.",
