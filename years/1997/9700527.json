 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the development of new statistical methods for analyzing common cause failure data for complex systems, such as nuclear power plant component groups.  For the purpose of modeling common cause failures, the research can lead to the development of a binomial failure rate mixture model, based on a parametric shock model developed for power plant risk assessment.  Beyond this mixture model estimator, various results will be pursued, including both non-parametric and parametric estimators; confidence bands and other measures of uncertainty; general solutions for systems of non identical components; and, pertinent limit properties. The mixture model will serve as a point of departure to further research into statistical analyses based on dependent failure models. This research also investigates techniques of mapping that replace missing data with estimated data in the risk assessment, and will help to characterize the uncertainty involved with various models used for the mapping procedure using statistical theory in addition to Monte Carlo simulation.   The original binomial failure rate model has been criticized due to the many existing databases for which the model fit is poor.  The realistic generalization  in this investigation is more complex than the original model or its non-parametric alternatives, but model fit can be greatly improved. There exists a strong foundation of qualitative analysis in the engineering literature (screening analysis, fault tree analysis, etc.), but little guidance with respect to some quantitative aspects common cause failure research.  If successful, this research will contribute to   quantitative risk analyses in the nuclear safety field.",
