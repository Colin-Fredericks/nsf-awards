This  work  will   employ   both  polarized  and unpolarized neutron scattering techniques  to  study  the  magnetic and crystal structures, nature  of  the  coupling  between  these  two, and  the  sping  and  lattice  dynamical excitations.  The second area concerns the  nature  of  the  vortex state in superconductors, when  the  lattice  becomes   disordered,  and  when  the  rare  earth  magnetic  ordering  occurs.  The final area of interest  involves  the  study  of  the  spin  dynamics of isotropic  ferromagnetics.  Polarized  beam  techniques will be  used  to  separate  the  longitudinal  and transverse spin dynamics of  materials  in  anomalous  systems  such  as Invar  alloys.   We  will  also  continue   our   investigations  of  the  longitudinal   and  transverse   fluctuation  spectra  just  below   the   Curie  temperature,  and  their behavior as a function  of  applied  field.  %%%  This project will explore three general avenues of materials  research  using  neutron scattering techniques.   The  first  involves  the fundamental structural and magnetic properties  of  the  colossal magnetoresistive oxides, in an  effort  to  establish  the origins of the metal insulator transition  in  these   novel   systems.   The  second  aspect  concerns   a  determination and understanding of the materials  properties  which  control  the  superconducting parameters  of  central  importanceto commercial applications, such as vortex pinning  to  produce high critical current materials.  The final area  concerns  the fundamental and practical properties  of  soft  magnetic  materials, which are of commercial importance  for  transformer  cores,  magnetic  shielding,  etc.   Particular  emphasis  will be placed on the Invar class of soft magnets,  as  these are of  technical importance because their density  does   not  chan ge  with temperature, in  contrast  to  most  metals which expand upon heating.  ***",
