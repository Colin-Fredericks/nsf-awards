Three  areas  are  to  be  studied: (1) Novel  and  universal  dynamical  states,  including a fully frustrated array with junctions  along  every  branch,  where  the  dynamics  can  be  reduced  to  three  dynamical variables. (2) Inductively coupled arrays, which form a  model    system    for   coupled   layers   of   high-temperature  superconductors and for coupled systems of nonlinear oscillators.  (3)  Flux-flow  in  2-d arrays will provide a  model  system  for  investigating  the similar vortex dynamics that  occurs  in  thin  films  of  high temperature superconductors. The study of  vortex  motion  in  this  system  will clarify  aspects  of  pendula-like  whirling  modes  in  discrete  systems.  Other  dynamical  states  corresponding  to local and global phase-locking mechanisms  will  be  also be studied. The research is characterized by integration  of  experiment, numerical simulation, and mathematical  analysis,  and   will  exploit  existing  commercial  foundry  service   for  fabrication of arrays of Josephson junctions.  %%%  This  experimental research project is in the types of  \"motions\"  or  excitations that can exist in a two-dimensional array of non-  linearly  interacting systems (Josephson junctions). One  example  of  an  excitation  is a magnetic flux quantum  (vortex)  trapped  within  a  closed loop through which a supercurrent  flows.  Such  vortices  can move about the lattice, and can also interact  with  other  vortices  which  simultaneously  exist.  The  mathematical  equations  describing such systems are non-linear  and  can  have  singular   solutions  called  solitons,  in  which   considerable  interest  exists in other areas of science. In fact, the  project  to  be  carried   out  in major parts will attempt  to  model  the  behavior of other systems of interest, including aspects  of  the  motion of magnetic flux in high temperature superconductors.  The  researchers will combine experimental measurements with numerical  simulations and with more conventional analytical mathematics  to  understand the observed behavior, which may have implications  on  additional systems than the systems specifically at hand. In  one  of  its  aspects  the  array  of  Josephson  junctions  may  have  applications in detecting and in generating  microwave radiation,  which will also be of interest in this project. Results from this  research  may  include unusual new effects or devices  which  may  find  new  application in technology. This  research  project  is  interdisciplinary  in nature and involves graduate  students  who  will  be  excellently  trained to enter  positions  in  industry,  government  or education. The project will also foster  inclusion  of   women   and  under-represented  groups  into  the   national  scientific work force.  ***",
