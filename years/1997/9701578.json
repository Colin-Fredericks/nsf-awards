 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smith, 9701578      Abstract.    The proposed research lies at the junction of non-commutative ring  theory and algebraic geometry. The most abstract  setting for the subject is to view a pair, consisting of an abelian  category and a distinguished object in it, as the category of  sheaves on some imaginary non-commutative space and the structure  sheaf of the space. Such a pair is called a scheme.  The category of modules over a ring together  with the ring itself is a basic example.    Much of the project involves the examination of special examples  with the goal of getting a better understanding of the appropriate  analogues of standard geometric notions such as subschemes, open,  closed, singular, etc. Particular  attention will be paid to non-commutative analogues of projective  spaces; included in this are the Sklyanin algebras, which first  arose from some problems in physics. It is also proposed to examine  several homological properties of non-commutative rings, such as  Auslander regularity, the Koszul property, and the Cohen-Macaulay  property.    The basic problem addressed by  non-commutative ring theory is to understand the solutions in  (possibly infinite) matrices to systems of polynomial equations in  non-commuting variables.   Non-commutative algebraic geometry aims to  develop a more geometric approach to such a problem, essentially by  viewing the solutions as geometric objects.",
