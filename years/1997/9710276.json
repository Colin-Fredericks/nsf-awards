 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710276  The objective of this research project is to gain additional  knowledge on flexural behavior of steel-reinforced-concrete (SRC)  structural elements.  There is currently a lack of understanding  of seismic shear behavior to support the rational design for  composite or hybrid structures.    Specifically, the following issues related to seismic shear  design will be addressed.         i.   Shear resisting mechanisms in SRC elements       ii.  Shear strength decay upon the increase of displacement               ductility as considered in design; and       iii. Shear strength of SRC elements of high-strength or high             performance materials    The research program undertaken will focus on experimental and  analytical investigations of the cyclic shear behavior of high-  strength composite steel and concrete (HS-SRC) structural  elements.  Both the experimental and analytical phases of the  research will be conducted on fundamental behavior of high  strength SRC elements with applications to moment-resisting frame  structures.  The emphasis is on the evaluation of different shear  resisting mechanisms and the influence of ductility, as well as  calibration and development of models to best assess  contributions of various shear resisting mechanisms.    Results from this research will be used to develop   acceptable seismic design guidelines.  The research will not only  enhance our understanding of HSC structures, but also lead to  practical and reliable design of SRC structures and well as  development of HSC systems using high strength materials.    This is a project supported under NSF initiative No. 94-154  \"Composite and Hybrid Structures\".  ***",
