 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723521  Bradbury  The adaptive design of many animal sound production systems  is strongly  influenced by selection for increased call amplitude and  efficient  projection of those sounds in the direction of intended  recipients. In some  systems, specific structures have profound effects on both  volume and  directionality.  One such structure which appears as an  accessory organ in  the sound production systems of many diverse vertebrate  groups is an  inflatable air sac. While this adaptation is clearly an  important feature  of these systems, very little is known about how air sacs  affect sound  volume and directionality.  Using newly developed multitrack  recording  techniques, this study will focus on several species of  lekking grouse to  clarify the relationship between display call amplitude, the  directionality  of the call, and the shape and number of vocal sacs. We have  chosen grouse  because of the degree of interesting variations in air sac  position and  operation in the different species.  Some grouse have paired  external air  sacs. Preliminary evidence suggests that sage grouse males  may use their  two-sac system to beam certain components of their mating  displays toward  females regardless of the males' relative orientation.  These data will  also be used to re-examine the role of amplitude in mate  choice of female  sage grouse.  Sage grouse leks are one of the best studied  systems in which  females choose mates solely on the basis of male phenotype;  call amplitude  is the only parameter which has remained resistant to proper  measurement.  We now have the means to make these measurements and  complete the analysis.  Our hope is that this comparative study will generate models  that can be  applied to vocal sac function in other groups and, more  broadly, contribute  to our understanding of the importance of amplitude and  directionality in  female choice biased mating systems.",
