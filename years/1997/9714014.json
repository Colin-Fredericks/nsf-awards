 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Mars-Rock Special Research Opportunity activity   supports investigation of mineralogical effects of microbial activity by   Drs. William W. Barker and Jillian F. Banfield of the Geology Department,   University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The project is funded by the Office of   Polar Programs, the Chemistry Division, and the MPS Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities.  Martian meteorite ALH84001 will be   examined for mineralogical and textural evidence of biogeochemical   silicate mineral alteration.  The specific goals of the research are (1)   to search for evidence of long-term interaction between low-temperature   hydrous fluids and mineral surfaces by careful examination of surfaces   for submicroscopic quantities of hydration products, such as clays; and   (2) to examine the structure of the interface between the `nanofossils`   and underlying minerals for evidence of polymer-mediated clay formation,   dissolution features due to exposure to metabolic byproducts, and   chemical signatures due to elemental concentrations associated with the   presence of biopolymers.  High resolution transmission electron   microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy   (EFTEM) of ion milled and ultramicrotomed meteorite samples will be used   to examine the minerals at the crack surface for evidence of   low-temperature alteration.  Additional information will be gathered   using high-resolution scaning electron microscopy (HRSEM) and other   modern microscopy techniques capable of resolution to the atomic level.    These methods will enable examination of the structure, composition, and   mineralogy of the zone at the interface between the `microfossils` and   underlying substrate.  If ALH84001 contained microbes that lived in proximity to mineral   surfaces, fine scale evidence for their interactions may be preserved at   the microbe-mineral interface.  Advanced physical and chemical methods   will be used to detect alteration of the mineral surface.  Terrestrial   models for mineral-organism interaction will be used to distinguish   biologically from inorganically-mediated alteration as a means of   evaluating evidence of early Martian life.",
