The Bose glass is  a  system  of  superconducting vortices localized in a disordered  columnar  defect lattice, is described by the same Hamiltonian as  the  Coulomb  glass, a system of localized charge carriers  in  a  doped.   The ground state of these systems, which determines  whether  they  are conducting or insulating,  depends  in  a  complicated manner on the relative strengths of the particle-  particle  and particle-potential interactions.  In the  Bose  glass,  disorder can be controlled by creating the  columnar  defects  in  thin superconducting films using  electron-beam  lithography,  and  particle interactions can  be  controlled  simply  by changing the applied magnetic field.  Using  this  model  Bose  glass  system, this proposed research  aims  to  elucidate  the effects of independent variation of  particle  interactions  and disorder on both the static  configuration  and the dynamic motion of the particles.  Since such control  over disorder and interaction is not possible in the Coulomb  glass,  the  results of this research will provide  valuable  feedback for the theoretical understanding of these systems.  Furthermore,  the results of this research will  deepen  our  understanding  of  vortex pinning in those high  temperature  superconductors   that  have  disordered   columnar   defect  lattices produced by heavy-ion bombardment.  %%%  Although  physicists have been successful  in  developing  a  detailed understanding of electronic and magnetic properties  of   a   wide  range  of  materials,  disorder  and   strong  interparticle interactions in some materials has  encumbered  such  a  detailed understanding.  The present research  will  focus   on   the   role   of   disorder  and   interparticle  interactions  in  a  system of magnetic flux  tubes,  called  vortices,  in  superconducting thin films with intentionally  fabricated  defects.   The  defects   will  be  created   and  controlled  using  electron-beam  lithography,  and   vortex  interactions  will  be  controlled simply  by  changing  the  applied  magnetic  field.   The  effects  of  disorder   and  interparticle interactions on the vortex configurations  and  vortex motion will be measured.  Sincince such control  over  disorder   and  interactions  is  not  possible   in   other  disordered,  interacting  systems,  the  results   of   this  research  will provide valuable feedback for the theoretical  understanding of these systems.  Furthermore, the results of  this research will deepen our understanding of vortex motion  in   high  temperature  superconductors.   This  a  Research  Planning Grant.  ***",
