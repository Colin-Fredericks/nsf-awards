For example, small noise   can eliminate chaotic behavior in slow-fast dynamics. Recently the principal   investigator has developed a new approach for studying these systems in   terms of probability densities. These techniques will be adapted to   investigate small noise effects in delay phenomena in excitable systems and   chemical reactions. Comparison of these problems will provide a basis for   characterizing a variety of noisy phenomena. The second objective is to   discover conditions for spatially localized oscillations in systems of coupled   oscillators. In particular, the principal investigator will consider bistability   of localized and nonlocalized dynamics in laser arrays and structural   dynamics. Numerical simulations and singular perturbation methods are   combined to  explore competing influences of the system parameters, initial   conditions, and resonance. The third objective is to explore pattern   dynamics in reaction-diffusion systems.  Complementary analytical   numerical methods are used to derive evolution equations and study the   dynamics and stability of modulated patterns. These techniques will be   applied in general reaction-diffusion problems and a specific application of   burner-stabilized flames. They will also be applied to investigate modulated   nonequilateral hexagonal patterns and transitions of two- dimensional   patterns in spatially inhomogeneous systems.    The first objective of this project is motivated by the dramatic effects of   small fluctuations in systems with interacting components. In some   examples of chaotic interactions, such as convection, waves in plasma,   turbulence and laser dynamics, small noise causes nearly periodic behavior   to replace large fluctuations and chaos. Noise can also change the transition   from a flat state to an oscillatory state in the propagation of nerve impulses   an d in laser intensities. When a time variation in a system parameter   controls the transition, there can be a delay or lag in the transition. The   introduction of small, rapid fluctuations in the control parameter reduces   this delay, as observed experimentally. Realizing the first objective will   facilitate the development of mathematical models which account for   system noise and describe realistic physical behavior. The second goal is   motivated by the effects of localized behavior in several examples of   interacting oscillations. Oscillating quantities include chemical   concentrations and  electrical currents which act as timing or reaction   mechanisms in biological and chemical systems. Localization of these   oscillations can limit the propagation of an electrical impulse or chemical   reaction. Coupled oscillators also model fluctuations in laser arrays, used   for applications which require a high optical power output, such as space   communications and high speed optical recording. The power of coupled   lasers is influenced by variations in intensities and synchronization, which   occur in localized oscillations about a steady intensity. Vibrations in   repetitive engineering structures are also coupled oscillations, such as in   large space structures and bladed disk and beam assemblies. Irregularities in   engineering structures can cause vibrations to be spatially localized.   Localization can result in increased local stresses and cracking or serve as a   desirable damping of energy. Understanding the causes of localization   allows the control of the phenomena by adjusting the physical system. The   third objective of this project focuses on the dynamics of two dimensional   patterns which occur away from equilibrium in many physical or chemical   systems, including convection, chemical reactions, and sedimentation in   rivers. Patterns occur as superpositions of periodic waves of components   such as temperature, concentration or velocity.  Spatial variation of   geometry  or physical control parameters can cause spatial intermittency of   the patterns. For example, in a meandering river, rippled sediment deposits   are found in certain regions and not in others. In reaction-diffusion systems,   slight spatial variation of control species causes periodic variation of   chemical concentration in limited regions of the reaction. Since the   equations describing pattern evolution appear in a variety of applications,   understanding these patterns in one application leads to the understanding   of patterns in others.",
