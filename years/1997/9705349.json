 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multirate digital systems have important applications in communication and signal  processing including resampling, interpolation, narrow band filtering, fax  systems, subband coding, transmultiplexing, multiresolution analysis, and  waveletts.  This research is developing algorithms for the systematic design of  multirate signal processing systems based on a model-matching approach where an  ideal system (model) is approximated by a practical multirate system consisting  of components such as digital filters, modulators, and upsamplers/downsamplers.   The problem is to choose the parameters of the practical system so that the  performance of the system is as close as possible to the ideal system.  The  measurement of the difference between systems used in this research is based on  the difference in outputs of the two systems for all possible inputs.  System  parameters are chosen to minimize the maximum energy of the difference between  output signals for all bounded energy input signals.  This error measure gives  systems where the quality of the approximation is insensitive to the particular  type of input to the system.  The most significant improvements over conventional  designs are expected in complicated systems where intuitive design methods are  limited, such as in the design of cascaded multirate systems.",
