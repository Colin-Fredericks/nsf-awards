 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to devise new methods for  automating reasoning via understanding and exploiting  computationally tractable classes of reasoning tasks.  Fundamental to the approach is the hypothesis that  intelligent behavior is accomplished through utilization of  idealized models of the task's environment. To explain how  people perform so well on tasks that are theoretically  intractable, we must assume that approximation methods based  on idealized tractable models cover a significant portion of  intelligent activity, and hence such methods should serve as  the basis for automated reasoning systems.  A language that  has been found useful for modeling and solving  compuationally intensive tasks in artificial intelligence is  constraint networks, and use of these networks.  By using  idealized tractable models, constraint networks, and other  techniques found useful in this area, it is hoped that real-  life problemq can be solved automatically in reasonable time  as well as humans solve them.",
