 "awd_abstract_narration": "Badura  9603780    Prolactin, a protein hormone secreted by the anterior  pituitary gland, is involved in modulating a large variety  of physiological and behavioral states in mammals, including  lactation, estrous cyclicity, maternal behavior, and immune  system function.  While prolactin is clearly involved in  many different physiological processes, the precise  mechanism of action and the ways in which prolactin  secretion is controlled under various conditions is not well  understood.  The primary approach has been to examine how  various factors affect the surges of prolactin that occur  during stress, lactation, or during the estrous cycle.  The  problem is that surges of prolactin involve the activation  of multiple systems and, therefore, the results from this  approach can be very difficult to interpret.  Dr. Badura  seeks to enhance our understanding of the role of individual  modulatory systems to the prolactin response by examining  changes in basal prolactin levels that fluctuate throughout  the year.  She is taking advantage of the fact that  prolactin shows a marked annual fluctuation that corresponds  with changes in photoperiod, most likely daylength.  Indeed  Dr. Badura has demonstrated that nonstimulatory daylengths  will induce naturally occurring declines in circulating  prolactin.   Using this model, she will characterize the  neurotransmitters within the paraventricular nucleus of the  hypothalamus, a major neuroendocrine brain region that  regulates pituitary function.  Using in vivo microdialysis  and HPLC-EC techniques, Dr. Badura will correlate the  release and metabolism of neurotransmitters with alterations  that are seen in basal prolactin release under different  photoperiod conditions.  She will also use this model and  protocol to untangle some of the potential effects of  gonadal steroid hormones on this system in both  males and  females.  In addition, Dr. Badura will examine how these  regulatory factors influence pituitary function directly  under different  environmental conditions.  The results from  these studies will provide new knowledge in our  understanding of neuroendocrine processes.  Dissecting the  mechanisms by which prolactin regulates apparently unrelated  physiological systems will enhance our understanding of the  adaptive significance of evolving hormonal systems that  possess multiple targets and function.",
