The  goal  of these experiments is to study the important problems  of  protein shape (conformation) and protein folding, the process by which  a  linear  chain  of amino acids assumes the shape  which  allows  the  protein  to  perform its specific function. Folding  intermediates  of  proteins   will  be  studied  with  different  techniques,   such   as  measurements  of the dielectric constant  of a protein  solution.  The  dielectric constant is a measure of the distribution of charge  within  the  macromolecule and changes as the protein folds. Membrane proteins  will also be studied.  %%%  This  is  a  Woman  Career Advancement Award to study  the  dielectric  properties of proteins.  Proteins  are  large molecules that consist of a long chain  of  amino  acids. The molecule  'folds' itself  into  a  specific shape that dictates its function. The goal of  these  experiments is to gain insight into the important problems of  protein  shape  (conformation) and protein folding. Different techniques,  such  as  a  detailed  measurements  of the  distribution  of  positive  and  negative charges in the molecule,  can  yield new information about the forces that cause the protein  to  fold in a unique way.  Different  types of proteins will be studied, including  the important  class of proteins that cross membranes.  ***",
