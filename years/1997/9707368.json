 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707368  Maddison    The proposed work is a reconstruction of the phylogenetic history of jumping spiders of the genus Habronattus, a primarily North American group of 95 described species. DNA sequence data from about 70 species will be gathered for at least three genes, which together with morphological data will be analyzed to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of the species.  Then, using the phylogeny, patterns of character change in chromosomes and behaviors will be studied.  Available data indicate that an XXXY chromosome system has arisen several times independently.  One question to be studied is whether shifts in chiasma localization released a constraint to allow repeated derivations of the XXXY system.  Another focus is courtship behavior.  While females are cryptically colored, males of many species have elaborate and colorful markings and structures, and engage in complex behaviors during courtship.  Behavioral data will be analyzed on the phylogeny to seek patterns in the character changes by which one complex style of courtship is derived from another, and in distributions of colors and motions in male behavior.  These studies will advance our understanding of chromosomal and behavioral change, and hence of the forces and constraints underlying diversification.",
