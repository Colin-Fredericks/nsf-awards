 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Ramirez, Graciela    Together, Educating All in Mathematics and Science (TEAMS)  is  a  project  of  the Laredo Independent School District supported  by  the   community's  two  institutions  of  higher   education,   a  professional organization and two local businesses to restructure  the  district's  Pre-K-12 mathematics, science and communications  program  aimed at significantly increasing minority participation  in  the  college-bound SEM pipeline.  TEAMS will restructure  the  district's elementary organization, the K-12 mathematics, science  and  communications curriculum, instruction and staff development  to produce a totally aligned educational system.    The  Laredo  Independent School District is  a  minority-majority  urban  system  in  South Texas.  About 98% of  the  students  are  minority,  98%  Hispanic and 0.1 Asian.  TEAMS will  address  the  current  low levels of Hispanic student participation and success  on  the SEM pipeline.  Hispanic students, on average, score  well  below   white  students  on  college  entrance  exams,   Advanced  Placement  exams and are much less likely to participate  and  be  successful  in  advanced level mathematics and  science  courses.  TEAMS  is a system-wide initiative which will involve the  23,200  students in the district's 21 elementary, four middle, three high  schools, and the Magnet School for Communications and Fine  Arts.  Consistent with the CPMSA goals, all the students in the district  will  benefit  from  an  enriched  curriculum,  upgraded  teacher  skills, and student enhancement activities.    This  comprehensive project will systematically reform Pre-K-1  2  mathematics,  science  and  communications  programs  to  upgrade  significantly  the  quality of education  in  order  to  increase  successful  minority (especially Hispanic) participation  in  the  SEM pipeline.",
