Located at approximately  12oN in the heart of the northeast trade wind belt, Lake Nicaragua  appears to offer a very promising target for paleoclimate studies.    It is the largest single lake in the Americas between Lake  Titicaca at about 16oS and the Great Salt Lake at about 41oN.   Rainfall in the area is highly seasonal and the climate of the area  is  strongly affected by the ENSO cycle.  The location and size of  the lake is ideal for recording regional variations in climate  driven by changes in the ENSO tropical cycle in temperature and  rainfall.  Paleoclimate records from this lake could form an  important tie point along the PEP I transect (The Americas)  proposed by PAGES (the international Past Global Changes Program,  a core project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program).   Little work has been done on the sediments from Lake Nicaragua and  it is possible that the stratigraphic record may be disturbed by  tectonic activity or strongly reworked and mixed in the shallower  areas by storms.  However, the high organic content of the surface  sediments and the presence of at least some deeps reaching 40 m  offer substantial hope that a very useful paleoclimate record can  be recovered.",
