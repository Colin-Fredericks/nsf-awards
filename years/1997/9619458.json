University of Arizona  Title: Development of an REU Site for Tropical Limnology Associated  With the International Decade of the Eastern African Lakes (IDEAL)  Program    This award supports the development of an REU Site summer program  in tropical lake studies for American undergraduate students.  Ten  to twelve students will spend six weeks per year learning the  fundamentals of physicochemical, biological and geological  processes in tropical lakes through intensive training and  independent research projects.  The Program will be located in  Kigoma, Tanzania, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, Africa, a  world-class natural laboratory for investigating a wide variety of  scientifically significant questions about how tropical lakes work.   This site takes advantage of the faculty's record of research on  the lake and familiarity with local and regional logistics.   Additionally the program will reap unique benefits from a planned  association with a simultaneous and identical program for African  undergraduates, to be funded separately by the United Nations  Global Environmental Facility (GEF) program for Lake Tanganyika.   The program will also take advantage of facilities and capital  equipment on site from the GEF program and the Tanzania Fisheries  Research Institute, Kigoma Station.  The program faculty  collectively span a board range of research expertise in aquatic  biology, physical and chemical limnology, climatology and  geolimnology.  All are currently engaged in active research  programs on the lake and will offer students the opportunity to  become involved in research on scientifically significant  questions.  This program aims to become a central focus activity  for highly motivated students from around the country who are  planning a research career in tropical limnology and  paleoclimatology.  More broadly, it is intended to stimulate  interest in the importance of tropical lake studies in  understanding global change processes and  as an early-warning study  area for understanding freshwater ecologic changes that have not  yet occurred in the U.S.  This effort is coordinated through the  International Decade for the East African Lakes (IDEAL).",
