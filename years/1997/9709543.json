 "awd_abstract_narration": "9709543  Robinson  The Paleobiology Section of the University of Colorado Museum (UCM) is focused on the Paleogene fossil record of the Rocky Mountain region, and includes significant collections of vertebrate fossils from most of the Larsmide basins of the Rocky Mountains. The Wasatch, Willwood, Huerfano, Bridger, and White River Formations are especially well represented. In this project, the UCM will curate and house backlog collections and rehouse portions of curated collections so they will be more available for research and education. In order to effect the goals of the project, 1) 44 archival cabinets and 438 drawers of three different sizes will be acquired; 2) 1,355 archival boxes to hold existing osteology collection specimens will be purchased; 3) backlog collections will be curated; 4) cumulative curatorial problems within the existing collections will be corrected; and 5) a collections manager will be employed to work with curators, and supervise GRAs, work-study students, and volunteers in order to complete the proposed project in a professional and timely manner. In partnership with the NSF, the University of Colorado is providing  partial support for the collections manager position during the project, and will make permanent and fully support the position after the completion of the project.",
