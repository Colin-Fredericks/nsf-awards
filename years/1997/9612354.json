 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this research is to develop efficient codes for noisy  modulation channels such as those encountered in magnetic and optical  recording devices.  In these channels, it is often required to map the data  to a sequence with special modulation properties;  since most devices are  noisy, the recorded sequence should have some error control capability as  well. Coding techniques are used to transform arbitrary data to sequences  that satisfy the modulation and error control requirements. Coding  technology is one of the critical factors that has contributed to the  astounding capacity of today's magnetic recording devices.   The most commonly used coding scheme is based on  concatenating an outer  code for error control with an inner code for modulation. Although each of  the two component codes may be optimal with respect to its function, the  overall concatenated scheme may  not be optimal. It is recognized now in  industry that the coding gain achieved using this approach is close to  reaching a saturation point. This research aims at optimizing the overall  concatenated coding  scheme rather than optimizing the component codes. It  is expected that  this approach will significantly improve the overall  coding gain. To accomplish this task, the two component codes should not be   independently designed and implemented. Instead, any error control  capability in the inner code should be optimally exploited by the  outer  code for better performance.   Funding for this project will be used to support graduate students in an  area with many applications in data storage and communications, which are  interdisciplinary in nature. There is a need for more researchers in the  coding aspects of these applications.",
