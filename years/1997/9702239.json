Karl Johnson  Affiliation:   University of  Pittsburgh       This CAREER grant is awarded through the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The objective of the proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of using novel carbon nanotubules for advanced hydrogen storage systems. The calculations proposed will answer the question of whether carbon nanotubules are better suited for hydrogen storage than the best currently available commercial adsorbents. Phase diagrams, adsorption and desorption isotherms for hydrogen adsorbed in single tubules and in a honeycomb array of tubules, including the effect of adsorption in the tubule interstitial regions (where three tubules meet) will be computed. The amount of hydrogen adsorbed will be maximized as a function of tubule diameter over the range of operational temperatures and pressures.    Hydrogen storage could be the first commercial application for carbon nanotubules. Possible applications of nanotuble based hydrogen storage systems include hydrogen powered vehicles, hydrogen transportation, gas separation, etc. Three main educational projects are also identified in the proposal (1) Development of web-based interactive instructional modules (2) Internet based learning and research for high school students (3) Participation in the Research Experience for Undergraduates program.",
