The objective of the work is to allow these functionalized magnetic particles to contact target molecules (or cells) without the significant sustained.  The novelty of the research is the reactor design involving tunable magnetic fields allowing magnetic gradients in the radial and /or axial directions.     The use of functionalized magnetic/superparamagnetic particles to remove specific molecules/cells etc. is of vital importance.  For example, if cancerous cells can be removed from bone marrow, the patient's own bone marrow can be re-implanted (after chemotherpy) thereby eliminating the need for a transplant.  There are several small startup companies that have succeeded in making functionalized magnetic particles and the PI will use the particles from one of them (Bioquest).   But simply using mechanical agitation to contact cells with the functionalized particles leads to shear induced cell death.  Hence the problem the PI is attacking is an ideal case of applying chemical engineering fundamentals of diffusion and convective transport to a novel problem in separator design.   The novelty is the problem and the separator design .  If successful, this scheme could revolutionize the field of cell separations, by allowing greater throughput by using a continuous system, and  additionally sustaining cell viability.  This is truly a high payoff project.  What is also exciting is that the seperator prototype can be built with the minimal investment of the SGER.",
