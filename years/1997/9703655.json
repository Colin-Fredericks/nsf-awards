These are functors from spaces (or spectra) to spaces (or spectra) and  they must preserve homotopy equivalences.  The tower is an inverse  limit of functors with the fibers between stages being equivariant  homology theories.  The tower does not necessarily recover the  original functor for all spaces or spectra but does for suitably  connected objects.  One way in which the investigator will study this  tower is by studying another tower that agrees with the Taylor tower  within the radius of convergence for a given functor but whose  defining characteristic at the n-th level is the universal degree n  construction as compared to the universal n-excisive construction  given by the Taylor tower.  He will also continue to study algebraic  K-theory by use of linearizing functors of exact categories to  spectra.  A functor F from exact categories to spaces or spectra is  said to satisfy ``additivity'' if F applied to the exact category of  short exact sequences of a category is naturally equivalent to the  two-fold product of F applied to the category given by the exact  functors that take kernel and cokernel of a short exact sequence.  There is a universal construction, called ``linearizing,'' which takes  an arbitrary functor from exact categories to spectra and produces a  new functor of exact categories that satisfies additivity.  This is  completely analogous to taking the ``derivative'' in the sense of  Goodwillie when reinterpreted with these new towers.  Algebraic  K-theory itself is the linearization of a free functor from exact  categories to spectra.  Topological Hochschild homology and  topological cyclic homology are also examples of linearizing a  functor, and the trace maps that connect these theories may be studied  from this point of view.  The investigator will be examining different  constructions for the study of algebraic K-theory obtained by  linearizing various types of functors.  The hope  is to obtain new  theories that one can use to study algebraic K-theory effectively.       An important tool for studying functions from the complex numbers  to itself is the Taylor series expansion of the function about a  point.  For a functor -- a kind of generalized function -- from spaces  to spaces, Tom Goodwillie has similarly defined a Taylor series  expansion of the functor about a space.  In standard analysis one must  assume a function has all its derivatives about a point to ensure that  the Taylor tower exists, and then one can be sure that this  approximation to the original function is accurate only within a  radius of convergence about the point.  Similarly, for functors of  spaces, one must make assumptions about the functor to ensure its  Taylor tower exists, and even when these are satisfied, one obtains  accurate estimates of the original functor only for spaces  sufficiently close to the space of expansion.  The investigator will  be examining a modification of Goodwillie's original definition for  the Taylor tower of functors from spaces to spaces that tends to agree  with his definition for spaces within the radius of convergence of a  point but differs in general.  Two advantages of this new tower are  that it is easier to define and that it can be applied to an even  greater variety of interesting situations.  One area to be explored  with this new technology is algebraic K-theory, which from this point  of view is simply the derivative of a particularly easy functor.  ***",
