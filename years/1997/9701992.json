 "awd_abstract_narration": "This   research   explores  inductive  machine   learning   using  mathematical   optimization   as   a   foundation.   Optimization  techniques  such  as linear and nonlinear programming  have  been  shown  to  be  effective  in solving error-minimization  problems  inherent  in  inductive learning.  This work builds upon  such  a  system,  MSM-T,  that  constructs multivariate  oblique  decision  trees.  This  system  is  used as a platform  for  research  into  learning  issues such as overtraining avoidance.  In  particular,  new  methods for feature selection, node splitting, and  overflow  avoidance  are  being  incorporated into MSM-T. These  techniques  are  intended to optimize the generalization performance  of  the  system in high-variance learning situations such as feature noise  and  sparse, high-dimensional feature sets.  The results of  this  work  will  be  used  in  applications in medical  diagnosis  and  prognosis that require efficient programs for learning from large  volumes  of data.  In addition, research in machine learning  and  medical  decision making will be incorporated into  the  computer  science curriculum at Oklahoma State University, as part  of  the  CAREER activity.",
