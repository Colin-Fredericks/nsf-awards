Of these systems, the nuclear genome controls mitochondrial structure and replication, and it contributes over ninety percent of the organellar proteins. It is therefore essential to understand the processes whereby nuclear-encoded proteins are synthesized in the cytosol, targeted to mitochondria, translocated across the membranes, and assembled into functional oligomeric complexes. These processes are best understood in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is the model of choice for the study of mitochondrial biogenesis. This project focuses on the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme, NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD-IDH). NAD-IDH has several special features that reveal unique functions for this protein beyond its catalytic role in the TCA cycle. First, NAD - IDH binds to mitochondrially-encoded mRNAs in vitro and appears to regulate mitochondrial protein translation. Second, the loss of NAD-IDH can be partially overcome by genetic defects in TCA cycle and other oxidative functions. Finally, distinct alterations in TCA cycle proteins are observed in mutants lacking NAD-IDH, suggesting a role for this enzyme in regulating TCA cycle function or organization. This project will test the hypothesis that NAD-IDH plays a unique role in regulating TCA cycle function and assembly and that NAD-IDH exerts these extra-catalytic functions through physical interactions with other components of the TCA cycle metabolic complex. The experimental system will utilize yeast strains with defined alterations in TCA cycle genes to study the extra-catalytic functions of NAD-IDH. Modulation of NAD-IDH function, assembly and localization will be used to assay several critical features of TCA cycle function, such as gene expression, protein stability, and organization within the mitochondrion.    One of the main functions of mitochondria is to provide chemical energ y for the rest of the cell. The TCA cycle, which is a complex of eight interdependent enzymes, plays an essential role in this process. It is therefore important to understand how the TCA cycle functions and how it is regulated.  Because of insights gained through yeast genetic manipulations, it has been proposed that one of these enzymes, isocitrate dehydrogenase, plays a unique role in regulating the function, assembly and organization of the TCA cycle.  This project will utilize several approaches to define these new roles for isocitrate dehydrogenase within mitochondria.  These studies will yield new insight into how enzyme complexes are organized and how they function in living cells.",
