 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723606  Ackers  Hemoglobin (Hb) has long served as a prototype for understanding mechanisms of allosteric regulation.  However, the great majority of structural and functional data has been limited to the fully-oxygenated or deoxygenated end-states, and to the functional properties that are averaged among the 8 intermediates along the ligation pathway.  Cooperativity contributions by these intermediates using three O2 analogs that were known to drive the quaternary structural transition (T ( R) which accompanies oxygenation have been determined.  For each analog system, the free energy contributions to cooperativity by the 8 intermediates followed a common thermodynamic partition function that was also consistent with global O2 binding properties of the native molecule. A molecular code was deduced from other analog systems, and strongly reinforced the findings: (a) the Hb tetramer functions as a three-state molecular switch to control O2 affinity; (b) cooperativity follows the specific combinations of ligated vs. unligated subunits and not solely the number of sites occupied.  A combination of techniques, including quantitative low-temperature isoelectric focusing, analytical gel permeation chromatography, stopped-flow kinetics, haptoglobin kinetics and high-precision O2 binding will be employed.  Mutational mapping of the dimer-dimer interface will be conducted to assign quaternary structures of key species.    This new stage of the research will provide the first unequivocal delineation of the roles played by the intermediates of all reaction sequences in the binding cascade of native HbO2 under conditions where they are simultaneously regulated by native heterotropic effectors.  The new understanding of allosteric behavior that is being developed under this program will provide a framework for the more detailed structural and dynamic analyses that will eventually comprise an ultimate understanding of the hemoglobin mechanism.  Moreover, the general strategy developed for this problem should  also be applicable to the 'functional codes\" of other protein assemblies that are regulated by mulltiple states of ligand binding.  ***",
