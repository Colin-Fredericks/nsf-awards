 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for support of US scientists' participation in a `US-Pakistan Workshop on Motion-Based recognition`, to be held in January 1998, in Karachi, Pakistan.  The US team leader is Dr. Mubarak Shah, Department of Computer Science at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.   The Pakistani co-organizer is Dr. Javaid Laghari, of the Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology in Karachi, Pakistan.  The areas to be emphasized in the workshop include: cyclic motion detection, activity recognition, event recognition, lip-reading, gesture recognition, and facial expression recognition.  The proceedings, including the technical presentations and the recommendations, will be published.  The workshop is to be held just before the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) planned in January 1998, in Bombay, India.  The proximity of the two sites should help increase the participation in the Karachi workshop by US scientists.  Scope:  This project is to bring US and Pakistani scientists to discuss recent developments in a relatively new and important area of computer graphics, namely the area of motion-based recognition.  The applications of this technology are wide, such as in manufacturing (industrial automation and robotics), in surveillance and monitoring, in traffic control, in object tracking, in measurement of cloud and wind motions, and in biomedical imaging.  It is planned to focus attention during the workshop on the scientific questions that can be addressed through US-Pakistan collaboration.  There is a relatively inexpensive, skilled, scientific manpower in Pakistan, which can effectively carry part of the research work in the field of computer imaging and software development.  This project should help establish the infrastructure necessary for developments in industry in Pakistan, and for Western companies wishing to invest in manufacturing in this growing market.   The invited US participants are eminent researchers from universities, industry and government laboratories, and they include one woman who is an expert on artificial intelligence and signal processing, and at least two junior scientists.  The proposal meets INT criteria for supporting activities likely to enhance collaboration between US and foreign scientists in areas of mutual interest, and for encouraging the participation of women scientists and junior scientists in international activities .",
