 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616784  Clarke    A systematic study of the electrical characteristics of grain  boundaries in both a covalent semiconductor (silicon) and an  ionic semiconductor (zinc oxide) is proposed in order to  establish relationships between grain boundary crystallography,  dopant concentration and electronic states, intrinsic and  extrinsic.  Such basic relationships are lacking in large part  because of the difficulty in preparing large, flat areas of grain  boundary of controlled misorientation that can be characterized  both electrically and structurally.  To overcome this limitation,  as well as to control the concentration and type of grain  boundary doping, it is proposed to use the rapidly developing  technology of \"wafer bonding\" to prepare well-defined grain  boundaries.  Amongst the specific objectives of the proposed  research are: the functional dependence of the number and energy  of defect states with angular misorientation for twist boundaries  in silicon; the demonstration that ZnO epitaxial films can be  wafer bonded to form grain boundaries, and the subsequent  extension to identifying the defect states produced by individual  and combined dopants of ZnO grain boundaries as a function of  crystallographic misorientation; and the development of a  simulation scheme for describing the electrical characteristics  of polycrystalline semiconductors in terms of the grain boundary  defect states.  %%%  The proposed research will study the electrical properties of  grain boundaries in polycrystalline semiconductors of importance  in advanced electronic systems, such as zinc oxide-based varistor  ceramics (used in electrical surge protection systems) and solar  cells made from polycrystalline silicon.  Understanding these  properties will enable materials scientists to design improved  materials that meet the requirements of  tomorrow's high  performance applications.  %%%",
