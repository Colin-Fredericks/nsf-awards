 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729389  Rittmann  This is an award to provide support for conduct of a specialized  international conference sponsored by the International  Association on Water Quality on the ecology of biofilms.  Cosponsors include the Societe Lyonnaise des Eaux, the Waterways  Experiment Station of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  The conference will  address the structure and function of biofilms in processes of  significance in environmental engineering practice.  These  include aerobic and anaerobic fixed film and suspended growth  reactors, water treatment processes, water distribution systems,  wastewater transport conduits, contaminated soil, surfaces fouled  by contact with water and corrosion of materials in contact with  water.  This award will be used to support travel and other costs  for participation of three internationally distinguished experts  in biofilms in the conduct of this conference.    Results of this conference are expected to provide insights into  the structure and function of biofilms that will improve the  engineering design and operation of processes using biologically  active films adhering to solid surfaces or formed in suspended  growth bioreactors.  Results are also expected to provide  knowledge that can be used in dealing with biofouling of water  conduction systems, cooling towers and other surfaces that are in  contact with water.  ***",
