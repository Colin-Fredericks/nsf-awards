 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the grand challenges in biophysics is the prediction  of protein folding from the amino acid sequence.  The  investigator and coworkers have determined an empirical  mathematical function that can recognize the native  conformation for many proteins compared to many thousands of  decoy conformation constructed from pieces of other protein  crystal structures.  They are now improving this function by  testing different functional forms, training against more  natives, and challenging it with wider classes of nonnative  folds.  If the function can be made smooth enough, it could  quide a search toward the native structure as part of a  structure prediction algorithm.    In the current excitement over the human genome project, it  is easy to forget that gene sequences are like blueprints  for a house, and we are more concerned with the house than  the blueprints.  At the moment, we have no idea about the  biological and medical role that about a third of the  sequences play once they are translated into proteins, the  three-dimensional molecular machines that make cells work.  How proteins function depends critically on how these long  chains fold up into particular shapes.  This project is  concerned with making sense of those thousands of mysterious  sequences by trying to predict their three-dimensional  structures.  Workers in this laboratory have developed  computer methods to choose the correct structure for a given  sequence out of a lineup of many incorrect ones, as in a  huge multiple choice exam.  They are now moving toward  answering an essay exam, where the sequence is given, and  the structure must not merely be recognized, but  constructed.  Until this can be done, much of the value of  the massive sequencing projects cannot be realized.",
