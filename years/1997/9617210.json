 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, Jonas will study the elementary steps of   chemical reactions in solution.  Two new types of multiple-pulse   femtosecond nonlinear spectroscopy will be developed in order to resolve   the dynamics beneath the featureless spectra of molecules in liquids.    One technique will use a three-pulse sequence to prepare and study   transition states for thermally activated chemical reactions with a time   resolution on the order of 20 femtoseconds.  The second method will   obtain the complete electric field information from four-wave mixing   signals such as the photon echo by heterodyne detection using spectral   interferometry.  Experiments will study the role of the solvent in the   unimolecular ionic dissociation of alkyl iodides with the aim of   determining whether unimolecular ionic dissociation is activated by   solvent fluctuations or intramolecular vibrational excitation.  Solvents have dramatic effects on the rates of chemical reactions.  They   do this by altering the internal energy structure of solute molecules,   changing the reaction mechanisms, or allowing new reaction paths.  In   this project two new experimental techniques will be used in experiments   which are designed to probe the effect of solvents on a few different   types of reactions, such as those which are expedited by increasing   temperature.  The results of these studies should help us understand how   important solvent effects are in these different reactions.  Such   knowledge can help determine the conditions under which reactions in   solution should be run for optimal desired results.",
