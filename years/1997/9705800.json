 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705800  Hayden    Nonlinear optical (NLO) organic and polymeric materials have been  proposed for use in a variety of photonic systems.  Successful  implementation for frequency doubling, electrooptic (EO)  modulation, and photorefractive (PR) applications requires a  detailed knowledge of the connection between the structures of  these materials and their linear and nonlinear optical  properties.  This work is focused on determining the mechanisms  involved in relaxations in polymers and their effects on the  stability of the nonlinear optical properties of these polymers.  This work will utilize a new method to measure the pressure  dependence of the decay of the NLO coefficients at various  temperatures in poled NLO polymers by in-situ second harmonic  generation (SHG) and dielectric relaxation measurements on poled  and unpoled materials.  Previous studies found that the  relaxation of the second order NLO susceptibility in a guest-host  system is a function of the relative size of the dopant compared  to the sizes of the substituents or \"beads\" of the host.  It was  also found that below the glass transition temperature, Tg,  chromophore reorientation is coupled to secondary relaxations in  guest-host systems.  The coupling varies according to the  relative size of the chromophore and the side groups of the host.  This study will test the generality of these earlier results in  side-chain and main-chain NLO polymers.  The most technologically  promising types will be studied: syndioregic polymers,  crosslinkable polymers, and high Tg guest-host systems based on  polyimides and polyquinolines.  In addition, the pressure studies  will be used to investigate new processing techniques useful for  achieving better stability.  In addition, detailed molecular  dynamics simulations of dopant and pendant chromophore  orientational kinetics will be performed.  The molecular modeling  will complement the experimental measurements in an attempt to  determine what the activation volume means on the mol ecular level  and hence solidify its usefulness as a parameter in the design of  more stable systems.  %%%  As the information age evolves, faster communication and  computing resources will be needed. Increasingly, these needs are  being and will continue to be met through the use and development  of optical device technologies.  The results of this work will be  useful in helping to design better materials for use in future  optical based communication, computing, and sensor systems.  ***",
