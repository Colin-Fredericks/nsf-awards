 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603073  Capson    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative  research project between Dr. Todd Capson, University of Utah  and Drs. Mahabir Gupta and Pablo Solis, University of  Panama. They will conduct a search of biologically-active  compounds from plants in the rainforest of Panama.  The  scientific goals of the project are to examine the efficacy  of ecological insight for finding novel natural products  with biological activities.    Rainforest plants are subject to greater levels of attack by  insects and pathogens than are plants from any other region  of the world.  As a consequence, they have evolved both  higher levels of chemical defenses as well as a greater  diversity of compounds.  Mmst studies on the chemical  defenses in rainforest plants have been done in easily  collected mature leaves, but recent studies show that  expanding leaves are better defended chemically than mature  leaves.  To optimize the discovery of biologically-active  compounds, the researcher will be using leaf collections  that have been guided by ecological insight into plant  defenses, rather than by random collections of plants.  Extracts from freshly collected leaves will be subjected to  a broad panel of biological screens, and those showing  significant biological activity will be subjected to  bioassays to determine their individual components and  structure.  To assess the efficacy of the ecologically-  directed collections, random collections will also be made,  and their extracts  will be subjected to the same bioassays  as the targeted collections, to allow for a direct  comparison.    Although some of these biologically active natural products  could be medicinally-relevant compounds, most are likely to  be invaluable tools for researchers in disciplines such as  neurobiology, cell biology, biochemistry and physiology.  Results from this work will provide information that will  guide future studies directed towards the discovery of these  products. The knowledge of the Panamanian scie ntists about  the rainforest flora of the country,  and their expertise in  the use of modern techniques for vegetative identification  of plants, will be an important contribution to this study.  ***",
