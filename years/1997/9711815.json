In order to explore this question, the research will emphasize the gender and ethnic dimensions of emerging citizenship discourses in Mexico, through in-depth analysis of how political identities develop and become embedded within political practice at the community level.  The empirical analysis of the relationship between citizenship and political practice are approached through a comparative investigation of community development politics in the Meseta Purhepecha, Michoacan.  The two objectives are to examine the emergence of citizenship discourses in the context of personal experiences with political activism and to explain how community members translate narratives of citizenship into particular practices that engage local state officials.  Fieldwork in two communities will emphasize in-depth interviews of life history and participant interviews and observations.",
