The goals of this plan are to significantly strengthen the research and educational programs in microsensors at South Dakota State University.  This will be done by expanding current research into new and interdisciplinary areas, integrating this research into undergraduate and graduate curriculums, and significantly increasing the design component of courses being taught in the microelectronic devices and materials areas.  Four areas that are important to chemical sensor development will be the primary focus: The development of a novel technique for measuring the effects of surface properties on sensor response and sensing film adhesion; The development of novel bio-sensors for the detection of airborne endotoxins; The optimization of hazardous gas sensors; and The characterization of electronic polymer films.  The novel technique for measuring surface properties is of high importance in the sensor area and also has wide applicatiols in the fields of biomaterials, microelectronics and adhesives, therefore it will be the prime focus area of the scientific part of this plan.  The three remaining areas involve the application of sensing science and form the engineering design part of this plan.    The activities described in this proposal are expected to advance sensing science, engineering, and education.  The science will be advanced by providing a new method for surface characterization that has high sensitivity to surface free energy, wettability, and contamination, and high degrees of correlation with biological interactions.  This work is also expected to provide a better understanding of the gas sorption processes in chemical sensing and aid in the optimization of thin films used as chemical sensing elements.  Other important applications in microelectronics include the analysis of surface treatments  designed to improve film adhesion and the attachment of analities to a sensor surface and measurements of surface cleanliness prior to encapsulation.  Important applications in biomaterials include: insuring surface reproducibility in biomaterial investigations and commercial medical devices, establishing correlations between surface tension of materials and biocompatability, and bioadhesion.  Engineering design will be advanced by new chemical sensor designs and applications that will be investigated.  The proposed educational activities will advance engineering education by providing instructional and research opportunities in microsensors.  In addition, a comprehensive program which is designed to better prepare students for the workplace, reduce student attrition, and encourage students to pursue graduate studies is proposed.  The activities include incorporating significant engineering design components in all courses with an emphasis on microsensors; integration of industrial, cross disciplinary, and research activities into the curriculum; laboratory development; the incorporation of new ideas in learning styles and assessment in the classroom; and by outreach activities directed toward underrepresented groups.  ***",
