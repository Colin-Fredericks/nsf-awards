 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carrot cells in culture can be induced to form somatic embryos (no fertilization involved) by pre-treatment with auxin.  When somatic embryogenesis occurs, cellular levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) drop at least 10-fold and IAA synthesis switches to the non-tryptophan pathway.  The amount of IAA in older embryos, its form (free or bound), its location in the embryo, and how these changes occur during development, are unknown.  Understanding somatic embryogenesis is important for the propagation of rare plants and for genetic manipulation of plants for crop improvement.    The aims of Dr. Shea's research project are to measure the levels of auxin in late stages of somatic embryo development, to examine the pathway of IAA biosynthesis in late stages of somatic embryo development, and to study the influence of exogenous auxin sources on embryogenesis.    Dr. Shea is returning to active research after a long absence and is currently in a non-tenure-track teaching position while doing research voluntarily off-campus.  Her goal is to obtain a tenure-track position with research opportunities.  This POWRE grant will allow her to establish an active research program on campus that will include students, provide opportunities to attend scientific meetings and network with other scientists, and show potential employers that such plant research can attract extramural funding.",
