Ant lions are larval insects common throughout the eastern and southern United States. They live for 1 to 3 years as larvae, and are effective sit-and-wait predators on arthropods.  Collections of larvae from 37 populations, ranging from Oklahoma to New York, revealed that M. immaculatus body size increased with latitude: northern ant lions were larger than southern ant lionq.  This research addresses whether this pattern is due to nature versus nurture.  In other words, is ant lion body size variation due to genetic or environmental influences?  This question will be answered by raising first-instar larvae in environmentally controlled growth chambers.  This experiment removes environmental influences and reveals genetic determinants of growth.  To complement this study, larvae will be reared in the field in a reciprocal transplant experiment between sites in Oklahoma and Connecticut. The results from these two experiments will reveal whether growth rates and adult  body size of ant lions are determined primarily by individuals genes or by the environment in which they are raised.   Other factors that may influence insect body size at different latitudes are temperature and prey abundance and distribution.  The effects of food and temperature on growth rate will be tested by raising larvae from northern and southern populations at different temperatures and food levels.  Prey body sizes will be determined by pitfall-trapping at 25 different sites between Georgia and Vermont.  These data will reveal whether there is a correlation between ant lion body size and prey body size and abundance.   This study will enhance our understanding of the environmental and genetic components of body size, and reveal the nature of life history variation on a large geographic scale.",
