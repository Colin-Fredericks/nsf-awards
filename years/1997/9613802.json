 "awd_abstract_narration": "9613802    Hynes         In this project, quantum chemical electronic structure methods and molecular  dynamics computer simulations will be carried out to study the rates and mechanisms  of a number of reactions of chlorine and bromine species on the surface of  atmospherically relevant particles. These range from pure water ice to more complex  surfaces which include nitrate and/or sulfate ions. Heterogeneous reactions involving  chlorine and bromine have been strongly implicated in the catalytic destruction of  ozone in the Antarctic stratosphere and in the Arctic troposphee. Specific examples  include the one-step reaction of chlorine nitrate with hydrochloric acid and the two-  step version involving chlorine nitrate hydrolysis forming hypochlorous acid which  then reacts with hydrochloric acid to form molecular chlorine. The bromine analogs  of these reactions as well as the mixed bromine/chlorine cases will also be  considered.       This study will provide reaction mechanisms and reaction rates which are  needed as input for global chemistry and climate models. It is hypothesized that the  ice lattice plays an essential catalytic role in these reactions via proton transfers. It is  often difficult to determine experimentally whether a process occurs in one or several  steps, and whether reactions are ionic in character or not.",
