The  PI  has  been  a  key  contributor to studies in this  area,  and  he  proposes to continue his research on the forms, distributions and  preservation of organic matter in marine sediments.  A major  aim  of  this  proposal is to identify shifts in the major biochemical  compositions of sedimentary organic mixtures subjected to varying  extents  of  degradation.   New analytical  techniques  would  be  brought  to  bear  on existing sediment samples  which  would  be  selectively  extracted for organic carbon.  Thus in  addition  to  bulk  characterizations, analyses by 13C NMR would  be  added  to  provide  more detailed organic compositional data.  Results  from  this  study  would  be  expected to unravel the  two  fundamental  issues in the preservation of organic matter in marine sediments,  namely  1) how oxygen-sensitivity relates to protective  sorption  of  organic  matter  in sediments and 2) to what  extent  oxygen-  sensitive   organic  matter  might  be  directly   derived   from  hydrolysis-resistant biomacromolecues.",
