 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Ariel D. Anbar and Kenneth H. Nealson, of the Department of   Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Rochester, are   supported by the Division of Chemistry, the Office of Multidisciplinary   Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, the   Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Division of Earth Sciences   for their studies of the biogenic fractionation of transition metal   isotopes.  These studies test the hypothesis that fractionation of stable   isotopes of key metabolic metals occurs during uptake and metabolism of   these metals by microorganisms and that such isotope fractionation will   leave a recognizable signature that will be useful for the study of life   in environments where extreme conditions preclude the application of   other biomarkers.  Professors Anbar and Nealson use multiple-collector   inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry to characterize the isotopic   compositions of metals isolated from microorganisms sampled in the field   and from microbes cultured under controlled laboratory conditions.  Their   studies are focused on the kinetic fractionation of the isotopes of   copper and zinc, expected during the enzyme-catalyzed uptake of these   metals, and of iron, expected during microbially-mediated redox   reactions.  These biogenic isotope fractionations are expected to provide   information about the presence or absence of biological activity in   general and about specific metabolic processes in particular.  Fractionation of stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur due to   the different reaction rates of compounds containing different isotopes   of these elements have been used for years to obtain information about   metabolic processes in environments not accessible to direct observation.    With the support of the Division of Chemistry, the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences   Directorate, the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Division of   Earth Sciences, Professors Ariel D. Anbar and Kenneth H. Nealson, of the   Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of   Rochester, are developing techniques to explore the biogenic   fractionation of isotopes of metals which play key roles in metabolic   processes.  By analyzing the fractionation of isotopes of copper, zinc,   and iron, Professors Anbar and Nealson obtain information about the   presence or absence of biological activity in general and about specific   metabolic processes in particular.  These studies are of particular   utility for the study of life in extreme environments, where extreme   conditions preclude the application of other `biomarkers.`  Such   environments include modern settings which are physically remote or   subject to extreme environmental conditions and ancient environments   which can be studied only through the geological record.",
