 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jennifer L.Mandel  Ohio State University   The doctoral dissertation research will examine the ways in which African women cope with economic stress through a multiple enterprise economic strategy (MEES).  Multiple jobs will be undertaken to meet the individual's own needs and those of her family.  The main question to be addressed is: under what conditions and what configuration of economic activities will MEES be used for accumulation rather than survival?  It is hypothesized that this depends on opportunity structures, access to resources, and the degree of mobility.  The methodology includes an initial gathering of secondary materials in Paris and Cotonou, Benin.  In addition a census of small traders in the main and daily markets in Porto Novo, Benin will be undertaken to obtain economic characteristics and demographic information.  Focus groups and in depth interviews will be gathered from a smaller sample of the population of traders to gather economic and life history data.  The results will shed new light on the way in which women cope in difficult economic environments and situations.",
