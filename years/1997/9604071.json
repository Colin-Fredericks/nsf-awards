 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9604071  Roberts         Normal function of the gonads in mammals requires feedback  regulation by the brain and the pituitary gland.  During the past  10 years, it has been shown that a protein called activin is  produced in the ovaries, testes, and pituitary and that this  protein is required for the normal functioning of these  reproductive organs.  Dr. Roberts recently demonstrated that  activin is also produced in the brain and is localized in neural  regions known to be involved in the feedback regulation of the  hormonal system involved in reproductive functioning.   She will  now determine whether this activin protein plays a pivotal role in  the regulation of the reproductive axis at the level  of the  brain.  Utilizing anatomical techniques, Dr. Roberts will trace  activin producing neurons and to determine whether these activin  neurons connect and communicate with gonadotropin releasing  hormone neurons (GnRH), an important peptide hormone that  regulates the release of estrogen and progesterone by the ovary.  She will also use isolated GnRH neurons in culture to directly  test the effects of activin on these reproductive neurons.  The  results from these studies will determine whether activin  modulates GnRH synthesis and release to help maintain its  homeostatic regulation. The new knowledge obtained from these  studies will form the basis for understanding the neuroendocrine  role of activin in the human reproductive system.  This  information is crucial for dissecting  the basic mechanisms by  which the  brain-pituitary-gonads work together to regulate the  timing of ovulation and thus, could be lead to a better  understanding of infertility and its treatment.",
