 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Judith Perlinger, Department of Chemistry, Michigan   Technological University, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular   Program of the Chemistry Division under a Research Planning Grant to   study the reduction of halogenated alkenes under environmental   conditions.   The goal of this project is to establish one-electron   reduction as the rate determining step in the reduction of halogenated   alkanes by naphthoquinone, mercaptojuglone and iron porphyrins.     Electron transfer rates of these model systems will be analyzed in terms   of Marcus theory to develop a more global reactivity model applicable to   natural systems.   Naturally occuring organic and iron-sulfur containing   species will be identified and their rates of reduction of   polyhalogenated alkanes compared to those of the model systems to assess   their usefulness in detoxifying polyhalogenated alkanes.   Given the   timely nature of the problem, a Research Planning Grant at this point in   Professor Perlinger's career will facilitate completion of the   preliminary studies needed for a competitive proposal.  The release of halogenated compounds into the environment creates the   need to detoxify these reagents under natural conditions.   Reduction to   more benign products occurs under laboratory conditions, but the   chemistry under environmental conditions is not known.   Systematic   studies of model electron transfer systems will be performed to identify   the rate controlling reaction step, and the data used to develop a more   global reactivity model.   Naturally occurring reductants will be   identified, and their usefulness as reductants of polyhalogenated   compounds under environmental conditions assessed by means of the   developed reactivity model.",
