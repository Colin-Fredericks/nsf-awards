Kass                   Carnegie Mellon University         A symposium entitled ``Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics 4''  will be held at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,   on Friday September 26 and Saturday September 27, 1997.  The symposium   will include four extended presentations of applications of Bayesian   methods to a range of medical and industrial applications. More   specifically, topics of the selected presentations inalude: modeling   for risk of breast cancer, pharmacokinetic modeling in drug   development, problems of customer value analysis, and statistical   aspects of functional MRI. In these applications the statistician  was an integral member of the research team. A contributed poster   session will also be held.  The objectives of the symposium are to:   (i) identify and focus attention on specific implementation and        theoretical problems that hinder applications of Bayesian         methods, and to identify candidate solutions;  (ii) provide a forum in which the interplay between statistical        theory and practice will be explored in the context of concrete         research projects;   (iii) provide a small-meeting atmosphere within which junior investigators        and graduate students can explore substantial Bayesian applications         with experienced researchers;  and  (iv) produce a  volume containing well-documented case studies and data        sets suitable for use by researchers, practitioners, educators         and students of applied statistics and other quantitative fields.        As increasingly much background information becomes available to   scientists undertaking an investigation, it is important to utilize   previous knowledge effectively in designing studies and analyzing   data. Bayesian statistical methods are tailored to this purpose.   There have been many recent advances in Bayesian statistical theory   and computation, b ut scientific meetings rarely spend substantial   time discussing applications. The purpose of this symposium is to   concentrate attention solely on applications of Bayesian statistics.   The goal is to elucidate the interplay between theory and practice   and thereby identify successful methods and indicate important   directions for future research.",
