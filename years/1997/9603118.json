 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603118  Knapp    Attempts  to  restore ecosystems to a more or less  \"natural  state\" following agricultural use have usually fallen  short  of   their  goals.   Although  some  attributes  of  natural  ecosystems  can  be restored quickly, often  times  critical  differences  in  the structure or function  of  natural  and  restored  ecosystems persist for long periods.  For example,  native  plant  species  richness and diversity  in  restored  ecosystems   is  usually  much  lower  than  in   comparable  undisturbed  ecosystems, and may take decades or  longer  to  approach undisturbed ecosystem levels.  This is particularly  true    for    tallgrass   prairie   ecosystem.     Although  establishment  of the dominant grasses in tallgrass  prairie  restoration efforts usually has been successful, it has been  more  difficult to restore the less common grasses and forbs  that  provide much of the species richness and diversity  in  these  grasslands.  Our research focuses on  the  role  that  heterogeneity  of  soil  resources  may  play  in  grassland  restoration  efforts.   Most grassland  restoration  efforts  occur  on  former agricultural fields, where soil  resources  have   been   homogenized.    In  contrast,   most   natural  communities  are characterized by a high degree  of  spatial  heterogeneity  in  resources, which is  assumed  to  enhance  plant species diversity.  We contend that the problem of low  plant species diversity that plagues most restoration effort  is  due to the slow conversion of an ecosystem from a  state  of  relatively uniform  resource availability to one with  a  more    spatially   heterogeneous   pattern   of    resource  availability.   Our research will test the  hypotheses  that  recovery  of plant species richness, diversity and community  heterogeneity will occur more rapidly during the restoration  process if greater resource heterogeneity is impose  on  the  system from the beginning.",
