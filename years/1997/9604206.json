 "awd_abstract_narration": "The retina of the eye in many mammals has what is known as a 'duplex'   property, with photoreceptor cells for color vision, called cones, as well as   photoreceptor cells for night vision called rods.  The cones only work in fairly   bright light, while the rods work well in dim light.  These photoreceptor cells send   information via an intermediate group of retinal cells, called bipolar cells, then   the signal passes eventually to the retinal ganglion cells, which are the neurons   that give rise to the optic nerve to the brain.  It is thought that there are two   distinct pathways for the signal of light intensity from the rods to be transmitted   within the retina to the ganglion cells.  In one pathway the rod signal travels   directly to rod bipolar cells; in the other pathway the rod signal is believed to   cross a junction between rods and cones, then enters the cone pathway.  This   project uses a unique approach combining physiological recording of retinal   activity with specific pharmacological blockers of certain kinds of   neurotransmitters to isolate the contribution of these two pathways to vision. The   results will further our understanding of the complex visual processing that   occurs in the retina.     Results will be important not only to retinal physiology, but to understanding   visual perception and perhaps to artificial vision devices.",
