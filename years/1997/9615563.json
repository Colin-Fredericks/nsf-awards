The aim of this research is to improve the  understanding of how carbon/nutrient interactions in soils  might affect the responses of arctic tundra ecosystems to  global environmental change. The research centers on the  question, \"What controls the amount of C lost from tundra soils  per unit N made available for plant uptake?\" This question is  important because plant C gain in tundra ecosystems is often  strongly N-limited, and virtually all of the N made available  to vascular plants in tundra ecosystems comes from microbial  mineralization of soil organic matter. Thus the overall C  balance of the ecosystem is largely determined by the balance  of plant C gains associated with N uptake versus C losses due  to soil respiration.    The design of the research is guided by a simple conceptual  model, in which the large amount of soil organic matter in tundra  ecosystems is viewed as being composed of three interacting  organic matter pools with different turnover times and  characteristic C:N ratios (microbes are a fourth pool that  mediates turnover of the other three, but which is also much  smaller than the other three). The overall hypothesis is that the  balance of  C lost: N made available  in tundra soils is  controlled by interactions between the chemical quality of soil  organic matter (including fresh litter) and environmental factors  that determine the relative rates of decomposition and  interconversion of the various organic matter pools. Additional  hypotheses deal with the individual effects of (1) soil organic  matter quality, (2) drainage and associated aerobic/anaerobic  conditions, and (3) temperature.    These hypotheses will be tested by measuring C losses and N  made available in soils from contrasting tundra ecosystem types  that are already known to differ in initial organic matter   quality. A field experiment will compare wet, moist, and dry  heath tundras, and two laboratory experiments will compare wet  and moist tundras. One laboratory experiment will be on whole  plant-soil monoliths transported from the field, and the other  laboratory experiment will be on soils only; treatments will  include manipulations of temperature, drainage, and N and P  availability. Isotopic tracers and natural abundances of  C & N  isotopes in various soil organic matter fractions will be used  to help estimate interactions and turnover rates of the major  organic matter pools. Because the experiments are long-term  (the laboratory experiment will simulate 4 full growing seasons  over the 3 years of the research, and the field measurements  will be made in the 10th through the 12th years of an  experiment begun in 1988), it may be possible to document  changes in characteristics of organic matter pools themselves,  as well as the fluxes into and out of them. In addition to  direct tests of the hypotheses with data, a simulation model  (MBL-GEM) will be used as a synthesis tool and for longer-term  prediction and integration with past research on vegetation C-N  interactions.",
