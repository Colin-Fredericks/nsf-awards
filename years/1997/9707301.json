The main budget item is support for  a graduate student, Richard Igau, who will work under the guidance  of Drs. Ed Zipser of Texas A&M University and W. A. Cooper of the  National Center or Atmospheric Research.         The primary data source will be the Small Cumulus Microphysics  Study (SCMS), a field program in Florida that used the NCAR CP2  dual-wavelength radar and three instrumented research aircraft.   Many small cumulus clouds developed witin 10-20 km of this rdar  during the project, and a good sample of these were studied by the  three instrumented research aircraft.  Conventional Forward  Scattering Spectrometer Probes (FSSPs) and King liquid water probes  were present on all aircraft, and in addition the Fast FSSP (FFSSP)  of Brenguier et al.  (1996), the Cloud Droplet Spectrometer (CDS)  of Lawson and Cormack (1995), the Droplet Spaceing Monitor (DSM) of  Baumgardner et al. (1993), and the PVM-100 liquid water content  probe of Gerber et al.  (1994) were all used in the SCMS.  These  new instruments provide much improved resolution in droplet size  and in space, and so should help overcome the limitations of the  standard FSSP which have compromised many past studies, and so  should help overcome the limitatins of the standard FSSP which have  compromised many past studies of droplet size distributions.         In the course of this resesarch, we will assess ofthe  characteristics and value of the new instruments for measuring  droplet size distributions, will characterize typical droplet size  distribuions in unmixed and mixed regions of cloud, and will  compare the widths of these size distributions to theoretical  predicitions.  We will also study the entrainment and mixing  process, as a topic in itself as well as for its  influence on  droplet size distributions.  The new instruments should provide  better characterization of droplet sizes than has been available to  similiar  studies in the past, and the goood simultaneous  observations by a very sensitive radar should support better  interpretation of the microphysical observations in terms of the  life history and dynamics of the clouds.  It should therefore be  possible to test theoretical predictions critically, and so to  develop an improveed understanding of how droplet size  distributions develop in cumulus clouds.",
