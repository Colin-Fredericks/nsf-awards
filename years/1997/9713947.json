 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award has two central objectives:  (1) Development of a thermodynamic characterization of degradation dynamics employing entropy (thermodynamic disorder) as the fundamental measure of degradation, and (2) Development of methods of measurement of state variables that are functionally related to entropy.  The research tasks include: application of thermodynamic principles to characterize component degradation and lifetime, characterization of initial component lifetime, development of a mathematical framework for study of stochastic degradation dynamics, and development of methods for measurement of entropy related state variables.  Through a theoretical and experimental investigation of degradation in machinery components, the project hopes to advance a scientific understanding of degradation dynamics, leading to improved engineering maintenance practice.   This research could build a strong foundation for maintenance science that can potentially impact many manufacturing industries such as the semiconductor and aerospace industries.",
