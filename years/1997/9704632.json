 "awd_abstract_narration": "Titi  9704632       The investigator and his colleague study the validity of  approximations to complex geophysical fluid problems.  The basic  problem faced in geophysical fluid dynamics is that a  mathematical description based only on fundamental physical  principles, which will be called the ``Primitive Equations,'' is  often prohibitively expensive computationally, and hard to study  analytically.  More manageable approximate models, which should  represent the behavior of the physical system on time and length  scales of interest, are therefore used for making predictions  about the real world.  Naturally, the question of validity of  such simpler models arises.  The first theme of this project is  the justification of two prototypical models of shallow water,  called the \"Lake\" and the \"Great Lake\" equations, which describe  the long-time motion of an inviscid, incompressible fluid  contained in a shallow basin with a slowly spatially varying  bottom, a free upper surface and vertical side walls, under the  influence of gravity and in the limit of small characteristic  velocities and very small surface amplitude.  It is expected that  the shallow water approximation can be justified only for limited  intervals of time, the length of which can be estimated.  In  order to validate the long time behavior of fluid dynamical  models, one has to compare the statistical properties of their  attracting invariant sets, rather than compare individual  solutions.  To do so, it is necessary to focus on models that  include some mechanism of dissipation.  The second theme of this  project concerns damping as a possible ``smoothing''  mechanism---a mechanism that is weaker than the viscosity  normally considered.  Technically, the question is whether linear  damping is sufficient to assert existence of a smooth or even  analytic global attractor.  This is first investigated for the  nonlinear Schrodinger equation.  Although not a geophysical  model, it is an important prototype for which partial result s are  already available.  Next, the Stommel-Charney model for the Gulf  stream is considered, where the Coriolis force is expected to  play an important role as a second regularization mechanism.  Lastly, a model for Benard convection in a porous medium is  investigated.  Here the temperature is diffusive while the fluid  velocity is only linearly damped.       Computer predictions of phenomena on large or global scales,  for example weather or climate forecasts, need to compromise  between accuracy of the predictions and available computing  resources.  It is therefore a major scientific concern to devise  approximation schemes and models that are efficient as well as  trustworthy.  The first aspect of this project concerns the  validity of models of shallow water.  Oceans, for example, are  shallow in the sense that they are much wider than they are deep.  The shallowness is one of the features that are usually  exploited to obtain less complex models.  The project aims at the  justification of this procedure in the context of two examples  that are simple enough to allow detailed study, and yet contain  most of the difficulties found in more generic situations.  The  second aspect of the project concerns the long time behavior of  models in the presence of weak damping.  When a physical system is  modeled for long periods of time, the balance of energy input  (``driving'') and energy loss (``damping'') becomes very  important.  The project focuses on a particular mathematical  manifestation of damping, the so-called weak damping, and in  particular on how it influences the model for large times.",
