 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tabor  9704421       Motivated by a range of problems and, in particular, the  observed iterated, stretching and writhing motions of certain  bacterial filaments, the investigator and his collaborator Isaac  Klapper at Montana State University develop new techniques to  study the linear and nonlinear stability of the time-dependent  equations governing elastic filament dynamics (the Kirchhoff  equations) and, in parallel, computational approaches to provide  efficient numerical simulations.  Overall, the investigators  develop (i) new analytic techniques to study both the linear and  nonlinear stability of elastic filaments, (ii) quantitative  models of writhing instabilities and buckling phenomena in  mechanical filaments, (iii) mathematical models of  self-assembling bacterial fibers, lipid bi-layer roll-up and  various aspects of DNA dynamics, (iv) efficient and flexible  algorithms to simulate the described physical and biological  processes and to test the validity of the (continuum) models, (v)  discrete elastic models for simulating DNA conformations, (vi)  theoretical and numerical models of solar magnetic fields with  twist.       A host of practical problems in the biological, physical and  engineering sciences involve filamentary structures on scales  varying from the microscopic to the macroscopic.  These include,  in progression of scales: molecular structures including DNA and  lipid tubules and helices, bacterial fibers, vorticity filaments,  ropes and cables, braided magnetic flux tubes as seen in solar  flares, etc.  The motion of these structures has a crucial impact  on their structure and function.  The investigators develop  general computational methods to model these filaments and their  uses, including the structure and function of DNA, and the  self-assembly of advanced biomaterials.",
