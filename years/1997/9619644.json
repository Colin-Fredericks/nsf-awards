 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619644  Kamin  The goal of this project is to promote technology transfer from  the functional programming community into the wider programming  community, by concentrating on special-purpose functional  languages. The proposed work focuses on the design and  implementation of a functional language for ASCII file  processing, tentatively called FPERL. This addresses the goal in  two mutually-reinforcing ways. First, FPERL is to be a functional  alternative to languages like AWK and PERL;  its development will  shed light on this domain and will, it is hoped, garner a user  community of new functional programmers. Second, the construction  of the FPERL processor will be based on a unique class of special-  purpose languages: meta-programming languages (also called  program generators). The components of the processor - lexical  analyzer, parser, de-sugarer, and so on - will each be written in  a functional meta-programming language specially designed for  that type of component. These meta-programming languages will be  developed as extensions to FPERL, resulting in an unusual boot-  strapping process. This research will produce new knowledge about  a variety of special-purpose language domains - file processing,  parsing, and so on; about meta-programming as a generally  applicable programming methodology; and about the design of  languages to support meta-programming.  ***",
