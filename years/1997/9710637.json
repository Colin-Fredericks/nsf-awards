 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9710637  Dunn     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the problems associated with current microelectronic lithography systems which utilize masking technology.  These problems include:  the need for multiple masks required for subsequent layers of an electronic module;  the difficulties associated with generating large-area masks;  and the dependence on foreign suppliers for mask substrates.  The only available technology which does not require masks is laser direct-write imaging which suffers from an inherently slow speed due to it's bit-by-bit, serial mode of addressing.  This project would eliminate those short-comings through the development of a maskless, large-area, high-throughput, high-resolution, lithography system which combines a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) with patterning technology.  The DMD is a micro-mechanical, spatial light modulator with high parallel-processing power which replaces the conventional mask seamless scanning technology.  It can generate any possible pattern with high resolution over an unlimited area.   The proposed program will fill a critical need in the microelectronics manufacturing industry, and also significantly increase U.S. competitiveness in an enabling technology area.  The composite market for maskless lithography systems  comprise four major application segments; flat-panel displays, (FPD's), multi-chip modules (MCM's), printed circuit boards (PCB's), and semiconductor integrated circuits (IC's). The total sales for these products exceeded $750 million in 1996 and is project to grow to over $1.5 billion in the 2002.  ***",
