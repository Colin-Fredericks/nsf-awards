Specifically, these funds will be used to purchase  equipment necessary to upgrade their current triaxial press for  high temperature duty, including a new gas medium servo  controlled confining pressure system and construction of a fluid  separator system so that hot fluids are kept independently  contained from cold fluids and at constant temperature.  This  system will be used for short term studies (4 days) of rock  deformation under hydrothermal conditions.  For longer term  (several month) deformation experiments, five inexpensive  triaxial presses systems will be built that are relatively  insensitive to power outages and will be used for studies of  chemical/mechanical induced pressure solution.  This equipment  will allow the PI to continue cutting edge research on the impact  of solution transport deformation on fault zone rheology and to  document the effects of diagenetic precipitation and dissolution  in the presence of reactive fluids under deviatoric stress on  permeability in sedimentary and fractured igneous and metamorphic  rocks.  ***",
