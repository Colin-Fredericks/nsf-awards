A 6-year survey has  shown 247 cases involving inverted troughs in the Central U.S. between the lee of  the Rockies and the Mississippi River. This relatively frequent phenomenon is not  accounted for in current polar front models.        The goal of this project is to build upon prior research by determining the  dynamic support for the precipitation distribution during inverted trough cases.  The   preliminary survey of inverted trough cases has determined that there are two  primary precipitation distributions in cases involving an inverted trough: 1) most of  the precipitation falls downstream of the trough in the older, modified polar air mass  (Ahead cases) and 2) most of the precipitation falls upstream of the trough in the  fresh supply of arctic air (Behind cases).  In the 6-year survey of inverted troughs,  42% of the cases fell into the Ahead category, while only 9% fell into the Behind  category, but several of the Behind cases were major blizzards.  The remaining cases  were a combination of the two categories.        This project will involve compositing the Ahead and Behind cases for  comparison of forcing mechanisms.  Calculations of lifting mechanisms such as  warm advection, frontogenesis, and quasi-geostrophic forcing will be performed for  each composite in order to identify the relative importance of these processes in the  two categories and to enable comparisons between the two precipitation signals.  It  is hoped that the results of this project will provide a conceptual model for  forecasters to use in real time to improve rain and snow forecasting during inverted  trough cases.  ***",
