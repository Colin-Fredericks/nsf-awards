 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708991  Judd    Is a typical American \"undereducated\"?  This issue has been analyzed before, but in a fashion that ignored the risky aspects of educational investments.  The return to education is uncertain, but the proper response to this uncertainty depends on the nature of the uncertainty.  This project applies standard investment ideas from financial economics to human capital and educational problems.  It then integrates the human capital and financial investment decisions, and analyzes the current tax system and proposed reforms.  The current system is, due to tax-favored savings provisions, partially a consumption and partially an income tax system.  Also, the current system allows for some expensing of educational expenses through the deduction of state and local taxes for taxpayers who itemize.  True consumption tax reform would allow expensing of all forms of savings, whether it be in the form of financial instruments or human capital investments.  Many so-called consumption tax reforms would not allow expensing out-of-pocket education costs, and thereby favor physical capital investments.  This project explores the importance of these facts in life-cycle models of education and savings.  To accomplish these objectives, this project also develops new computational methods of solving such economic problems.  These new methods will also prove useful in many other economic problems.",
