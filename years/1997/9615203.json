Dr. Matt Lavin of Montana State University is continuing his studies of the large legume family, focusing on the tribe Aeschynomeneae that includes well known food crops (like peanut, genus Arachis) and forage crops (like the genus Stylosanthes). A phylogenetic analysis using both morphological evidence and new molecular characters from DNA sequencing of nuclear ribosomal genes is proposed to construct a framework of genealogical relationships for the many genera currently placed in this papilionoid group, and to test several genera suspected of belonging within the tribe but currently placed in others. These likely include Adesmia, a genus of plants that dominate the landscape in drier regions of the Andean cordillera of Argentina and Chile, and also Dalbergia, the genus that includes species of valuable rosewood. For five selected genera within the group, Belairia, Pictetia, Chaetocalyx, Fiebrigiella, and Nissolia, estimated to encompass 40 or so species collectively, taxonomic monographs will be produced, to summarize biological knowledge of all the species in these genera, with accompanying data on habitats, geographic ranges, synonymy of scientific names, local names and uses, and identification keys.    The significance of the study includes facilitating higher level phylogenetic analyses of the entire legume family by clarifying phylogenetic relationships among the Aeschynomeneae, which likely includes about 10% of the papilionoid legumes. Also, traditionally important taxonomic characters of these legumes, like free stamens and lomented pods, may be shown to be prone to higher rates of independent (parallel) evolution and secondary loss than previously thought. More accurate assessment of species diversity and geographic distribution will be possible for many of the genera in the tribe, plants of which are common components of neotropical dry forest s. The species-level monographic studies will provide data for tests of biogeographic patterns in the history of vegetation changes in Central and South America and the Caribbean.",
