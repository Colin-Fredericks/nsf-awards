Parallel research efforts will  address means of removing printed inks from plastic films used in  packaging along with development of alternative and more readily   removable inks (both research thrusts relate to production of  clear, recyclable plastic film).  Other industries have evidenced  interest in this developing technology.  The Advisory Board of  the University of Oklahoma s Institute for Applied Surfactant  Research will be asked to provide technology transfer advice in  this new area, at present, and the investigators are  contemplating establishment of a new Center for Deinking Studies   that would pursue both federal and industrial support to sustain   research leading to commercialization of environmentally safe  processes/products. Development of environmentally benign  processes for reducing environmental degradation (i.e. plastics  in landfills) is timely, of national and international interest,   and highly relevant for the packaging industry.  Prospects exist   for technology transfer and contributions to economic growth and   development in Oklahoma.",
