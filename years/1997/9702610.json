 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702610  Bullard    The objective of the Faculty Early Career Development project is  to investigate the energetics and kinetics of the evolution of  thin film clusters and multiphase polycrystals.   This objective  will be accomplished by using the new technology of microcontact  printing to study the dissipative interface motion of ceramic  \"microfeatures\" on solid substrates.  The unique capabilities of  the proposed methods can avoid the chemical and geometrical  complexities of typical systems.  Specifically, the project will  address the following issues:  1) development of a new and  straightforward procedure for estimating the interphase boundary  energy density between two solids, 2) the influence of  film/substrate coherency, and thus the interphase boundary energy  density, on the equilibrium shapes of oxide thin film islands, 3)  identification of those aspects of interfacial energy densities  (relative magnitudes, anisotropy) that can significantly  influence the kinetics of coalescence and coarsening of oxide  film clusters, and 4) the role of geometrical factors, like  proximity correlations between growing and shrinking domains,  that can cause coarsening dynamics to depart significantly from  existing theories of Ostwald ripening.  In addition, the  principal investigator will restructure and modernize the  undergraduate ceramics processing laboratory course.  This  includes acquiring modern equipment and designing new lab  exercises on powder synthesis from alkoxides, reaction sintering,  etc.  Additionally, new computer simulation methods, developed  through the PI's research, will be integrated to reinforce  theoretical concepts and their practical applications.  A lab  manual, including brief descriptions of the scientific principles  underlying each experiment, will be produced and made available  on the World Wide Web, along with instructional video modules of  each experiment.  %%%  Characterization of the equilibrium shapes and coarsening of thin  film islands, using adv anced high-resolution spatial and chemical  analysis, will be used to study the energetics and kinetics of  the evolution of thin film clusters and multiphase polycrystals.  The approaches will yield fundamental new information about the  dynamics of interface motion.  Educational innovations at the  University of Illinois will focus on restructuring and  modernizing the undergraduate ceramics processing laboratory  course.  ***",
