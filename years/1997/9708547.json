 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is widely held that scientific method involves attempts to disconfirm prevailing hypotheses -- and experiments conducted in fields like physics are usually designed to do exactly this.  On the other hand, a large body of psychological literature suggests that people instead seek evidence confirming hypotheses.  In this proposal, the PI suggests that this difference may have to do with the state of knowledge associated with a given hypothesis - when the state of knowledge is advanced, we seek disconfirmation of a hypothesis but when the state of knowledge is primitive, seeking confirmation may be more effective because it is more likely to result in further evidence from which to induce generalizations, rules and principles.  This conjecture will be tested in a series of experiments, some involving individuals and some involving small groups to allow for testing of the additional hypothesis that groups will perform better in induction tasks than individuals.",
