 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706981    Ruskai       This research is concerned with problems in the mathematical analysis  of multi-particle systems.  The main focus is on bound states of atomic  and molecular Hamiltonians with a new emphasis on systems in magnetic fields.  In particular, one-dimensional models will be used to study the maximum  negative ionization of atoms in strong magnetic fields.  The contraction  of relative entropy for general quantum systems will also be studied  using monotone Riemannian metrics on non-commutative probability spaces,  and some related operator inequalities will be considered.       Because real atoms and molecules exist in ordinary 3-dimensional  space with well established integer values for the nuclear charges,  models of systems in one or two dimensions with fractional, or  asymptotically infinite, nuclear charge may seem somewhat artificial  and esoteric.  However, real atoms do not exist in isolation, but  within various kinds of materials ranging in size from microscopic  computer chips to stars.  The behavior of electrons within such  complex materials may be accurately modelled by using a fractional nuclear  charge or by supposing that they are confined to one or two dimensions.  For example, semiconductor scientists have recently manufactured  microscopic materials called \"quantum dots\" which behave like  two-dimensional atoms with fractional nuclear charge.   At the other  extreme, one finds that atoms in extremely strong magnetic  fields, such as those found on the surface of a neutron star, behave  as if the electrons were confined to one dimension.  Thus, the  systems proposed for study have a wide range of applicability.  The other part of this proposal is concerned with the generalization  of an important class of entropy inequalities to quantum systems.    Entropy and the related functionals have significant applications  in such diverse fields as economics, statistics, population biology,  information theory, and physics.  In view of recent advances in   quantum co mputing, the work on quantum mechanical entropy proposed  here is expected to have an impact on information theory as well as  physics.",
