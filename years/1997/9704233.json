The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Camille M. Steber to work with Dr. Peter D.  McCourt at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario.    Dr. Steber will investigate the role of the plant hormone  gibberellic acid (GA) in the control of seed dormancy and  germination.  To ensure that plant embryos survive the  interval between release from the mother plant and  germination, seeds accumulate nutrient reserves and become  dormant and desiccation tolerant.  There are mechanisms that  ensure that seeds germinate only under \"dormancy breaking\"  conditions that provide a beneficial environment for growth  of the seedling.  In studying the Arabidopsis thaliana, the  plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is needed to establish  dormancy while the GA is needed to end dormancy and induce  seed germination.  Little is known about the mechanisms by  which GA induces germination.  This project will focus on  understanding those mechanisms governing GA receptivity in  the seed using two genetic approaches: the first will  identify GA-insensitive mutations using a screen for  suppressors of an ABA-insensitive mutation; the second will  identify genes which when overexpressed, suppress the  inability of the GA auxotroph gal-3 to germinate in the  absence of exogenous GA.  Gaining this understanding of GA  response will have important applications in the area of  agriculture.        Dr. McCourt is one of relatively few North American  researchers who has investigated the role of both ABA and GA  in the control of seed dormancy and germination.  His  laboratory at the University of Toronto will provide an  opportunity for interaction with a wide- range of experts in  plant biology including plant physiology, biochemistry, and  development.        ***",
