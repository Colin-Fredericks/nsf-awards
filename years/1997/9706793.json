 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT DMS-9706793    Wang       Wang proposes research in self-affine tiles and tiling by   inflation, dilation equations in several variables, and certain   problems concerning mathematical quasicrystals. Two scale dilation   equations arise in a wide variety of applications, including   orthonormal wavelet bases and subdivision schemes for computer   generation of curves and surfaces. Self-affine tiles are closely  related to two scale dilation equations in the sense that the  characteristic function of any self-affine tile satisfies a two scale  dilation equation. While the study of two scale dilation equations in   higher  dimensions has always attracted attention, the study of   selfaffine tiling has gained considerable momentum recently due to   its applications in constructing orthonormal wavelets and the growing   interests in aperiodic tiling and quasicrystals. Wang intends to study   non separable wavelet bases in higher dimensions, self-affine tiles,   and mathematical quasicrystals.    Orthonormal wavelets in dimension two or more are extremely   important for numerous applications, especially in signal processing   and image compression.  In the later case, for instance, a wavelet   transform is applied to a  given image and compression is then carried  on the transform. The  wavelet used will be two dimensional, as an   image. Up to now, we have not had a good method  to construct these   wavelet other than by multiplying  two one dimensional wavelets.  These wavelets lead to subtle  artifacts in the decompressed   images such as jagged diagonal lines and slight blackness. It is   believed that those artifacts can be reduced by using genuinely two   dimensional wavelets. Wang has outlined certain approach which may   potentially lead to the construction of this kind of wavelet.  Recently Schechtman and others have formed metal alloys that have  aperiodic atomic structures, generating great interests among   chemists, physicists, and mathematicians in the study of   quasicrystal . Wang proposes to study this quasicrystals from the   mathematical point of view.",
