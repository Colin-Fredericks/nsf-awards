It was carried out from the RVIB Nathaniel B.  Palmer in the austral winter of 1994.  This component of the  integrated program was an effort to measure high frequency  vertical profiles of velocity and temperature using a Rapid  Sampling Vertical Profiler, a tethered sensor system developed by  the principal investigator that free falls through the upper 250  meters of the ocean.       The overall objective of this project is to study the  dynamics of momentum and energy fluxes in the upper mixed layer,  and to investigate the processes that determine the stability of  the pycnocline.  Particular emphasis is placed on the response of  the pycnocline to the mesoscale velocity field, internal waves,  and other coherent turbulence features.  The specific goal of  this extension is to model the fluxes of heat and buoyancy  associated with double-diffusive convection, and the impact of  tidal currents on mixing in the upper layers of the Weddell Sea.       These measurements, in conjunction with other concurrent  experiments to quantify the energy brought to the underside of  the ice, will form the basis of a regional study of the processes  responsible for the relatively thick upper mixed layer and thin  ice cover.  It is believed that these conditions are only  marginally stable, and are maintained by a relatively high upward  heat flux, which, if interrupted, could lead to deep vertical  convection, and a significant change in the oceanic climate.  ***",
