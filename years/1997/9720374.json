 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is being funded through the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS) Initiative, with funds partially provided by the MPS/OMA office.  Scientific and engineering data now come in large amounts and in new forms. Although the problem of analyzing and learning from purely numerical data has been heavily studied, we currently lack principled methods for analyzing the multiple-media data sets that form the basis of many modern empirical studies. These modern data sets contain a mixture of numerical features, symbolic logic descriptions, images, text, sound, and other media. This project offers an interdisciplinary research effort to create the statistical foundations and practical machine learning algorithms needed to take advantage of the growing number of such multiple-media data sets. The research plan is to develop new approaches to this problem by working with several large-scale multiple-media databases of significant scientific and societal importance.  This research will provide the theoretical foundations and practical algorithms for analyzing multiple-media data in a broad range of application domains. For example, many medical institutions now collect detailed patient records that can be analyzed to predict treatment outcomes for future patients. These medical records are typically multiple-media records consisting of numerical features (e.g., temperature), symbolic features (e.g., gender), images (e.g., x-rays), other instrument data (e.g., EKG), text (e.g., physicians' notes), and other data. Current data analysis algorithms simply ignore most of these available features, because we lack well-understood methods for analyzing such multiple-media data. The current research seeks to develop new approaches that will be able to utilize the full information collected in such data sets. The goal is to extend the foundations of data interpretation that form the basis for many experimental sciences and engineering disciplines.",
