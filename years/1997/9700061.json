 "awd_abstract_narration": "Finite-model theory is the study of first-order logic and  its extensions on classes of finite structures.  In recent  years, several extensions of first-order logic have been  investigated in the context of finite-model theory.  Fixpoint logic and the finite-variable infinitary logic IL  have turned out to be of particular importance.  The study  of fixpoint logic generated interactions with both database  theory and complexity theory, while the finite-variable  infinitary logic IL proved to be a useful tool for analyzing  the expressive power of fixpoint logic.  In addition to  being a proper extension of fixpoint logic, IL enjoys a game-  theoretic characterization and possesses interesting  structural properties, such as the 0-1 law.  This project  studies variable-confined logics, that is, logics with a  fixed finite number of variables.  This is motivated by the  fact that the number of variables is considered a logical  resource in descriptive complexity theory and has  computational implications also in the evaluation of  database queries and in program verification.  Various  aspects of variable-confined first-order, fixpoint, and  infinitary logics, ranging from expressive power, algorithms  for deciding truth and validity, and asymptotic  probabilities, are studied.***",
