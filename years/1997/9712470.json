 "awd_abstract_narration": "Packet switching, as exemplified by the Internet and Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks, has grown to tremendous proportions in the short space of 30 years of research and development.  However, many of the concepts in networking and communications were developed in the context of metallic or optical-fiber links to which network nodes are permanently attached. Several of the basic tenets of networking are being challenged by the introduction of wireless links that rely on atmospheric propagation of radio-frequency signals and mobile nodes that are connected to wireless (or even wired) links for only a short period of time.  This workshop will identify the major research issues in wireless and mobile communications.      The workshop, to be held March 24-16, 1997, will identify major research issues in wireless and mobile communications. By assembling leading researchers in the field the workshop will provide a forum for intense discussion and debate about the essential problems to be solved and about how best to approach these problems.    The workshop will feature active participation by researcher with well established contributions in the field.  Two basic tracks of researchers are being assembled: 1) communications, link, and hardware technology experts; and 2) networking, middleware, and advanced applications experts. The workshop will consist of joint and two-track sessions, allowing the exchange of ideas among different specialists and focusing discussion among related specialists.     A final report of the workshop will be a group-authored report entitled, \"Research Priorities in Wireless and Mobile Communications\".",
