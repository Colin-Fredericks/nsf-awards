 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Mitchio Okumura of   California Institute of Technology in his continuing studies on anionic   cluster solvation.  Specifically, he uses vibrational predissociation   spectroscopy to study the structure of various anions hydrated with `n`   molecules of water, as a function of n.  Apparently, experimental studies   on cationic hydrate clusters and anions clustered with rare gases   indicate that solvation shells form and the ion is in the interior.    Theoretical work on halide anionic hydrate clusters suggest, on the other   hand, that the ion is bound to the surface of clustered water molecules,   and as the cluster size increases, a transition from surface- to   interior-solvation occurs.  Okumura will focus on the hydrogen stretching   region; the frequency shifts and linewidths in this region should yield   insight on hydrogen bonding both between ion and solvent molecules and   among solvent molecules.  In addition, two photon (infrared-infrared   double resonance predissociation or infrared-ultraviolet vibrationally   assisted photodetachment) spectroscopy will be brought to bear on those   clusters that are more strongly bound.  Finally, cluster solvation of   acids implicated in stratospheric aerosol chemistry will be investigated.    An ab initio theoretical effort will be carried out to aid in   determining cluster geometries.    While the aim of this work is to investigate ion-solvent interactions at   a fundamental level, a second motivation is to elucidate solvation   processes and ionic reaction mechanisms of relevance to atmospheric   chemistry.  Many of the systems that will be investigated play central   roles in heterogeneous reactions occuring in the stratosphere and   troposphere.  Adducts of these ionic hydrates with atmospheric species   such as nitric acid and hydrochloric acid may serve as models of   intermediates in the adsorption and ionic dissociation on atmospheric   aerosols.",
