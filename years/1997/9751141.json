 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to thoroughly integrate computer technology into the teaching of mathematics so that it supplements traditional pencil-and-paper calculations.  The technology-based curricular reform began in 1989 with experimental sections of calculus using Mathematics.  Today, Mathematics is being used in almost all of the departmental offerings, as well as in other courses on campus, and has become an indispensable tool for many students.  It has helped students to recognize mathematics as a discipline which requires thought, experimentation, and creativity. The department has many student computer laboratories, a campus-wide network, and a site license to Mathematics. However, many college- and student-owned computers cannot run Mathematics effectively because of the memory resources it demands.  Therefore, this project is  purchasing a network kernel server which can handle the computational requirements of Mathematics and leave the client machines to simply display the results.  This system is providing the essential next step in the curricular reform program by making Mathematics available to almost all computers on campus, enhancing its instructional impact.",
