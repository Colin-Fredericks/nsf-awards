Specifically, the focus will be on studying  topological transitions in fluids and the diffusional evolution of  microstructure in solids. These areas involve fundamental physical  processes whose phenomenology is basic to understanding the behavior of  real fluids and the material properties of solids. Both are  characterized by the presence of multiple constitutive components,  complex pattern formation and/or singularities (i.e. spatial  complexity).  Although these processes arise in very different physical  phenomena (fluids versus solids), both involve free boundary problems  where the motion of a bounding interface, separating the different  components, is driven by a competition between surface energy and  either an instability or multi-body interactions.  As such, they can be  treated using a common set of analytical and computational tools. The  highly nonlinear nature of these problems makes fast, accurate and  robust numerical methods essential to their study.    In this proposal, we bring together mathematical and numerical  analysis, modelling, and large-scale scientific computation to study  certain fundamental problems in fluid dynamics and materials science.  For instance, one problem we will consider concerns changes in the  topology of interfaces between different fluids. Such changes occur,  for example, when liquid jets pinch off into droplets and when droplets  of one fluid reconnect with another. These topological transitions  occur in many practical applications involving transport, mixing, and  separation of petroleum, chemical, and food products as well as in  environmental applications such as oil spills. Often, reaction and  mixing rates within  these systems are controlled directly by the  detailed dynamics of the transition processes.  Thus, there is a need  to understand these dynamics in order to develop accurate engineering  models for mixing and reaction rate prediction. We will use analysis,  modelling and large scale scientific computation to investigate the  detailed dynamics of break-up and reconnection of fluid interfaces.  Another problem we will consider involves solid-state diffusional phase  transformations. These transformations are an important method of  processing multicomponent metallic alloys such such as steels. The  result of this process is the formation of a multiphase microstructure,  which is a key variable in setting the macroscopic mechanical  properties (i.e. stiffness, strength and toughness) of the alloy. The  microstructure is characterized by regions of different metallic  components separated from one another by interfaces. The goal of our  research is to accurately model and simulate the formation of  microstructure in alloys in order to provide metallurgists with a  recipe for generating new alloys with desirable material properties.  Although the two problems described above arise from very different  physical processes (fluids versus solids), they are similar in the  sense that the relevant phenomena is strongly influenced by surface  tension at the respective interfaces.  Consequently, they can be  studied using common analytical and computational tools.  The highly  complex nature of these problems makes fast, accurate and robust  numerical methods essential to their study.",
