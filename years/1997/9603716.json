Chlamydomonas exhibits two dramatically different behaviors that involve increases in  Ca2+ i: (1) pH-triggered shedding of the two flagella and (2) light-triggered changes in swimming behavior. The ultimate objective is to understand the mechanisms whereby pH shock leads to flagellar shedding, while a light stimulus results in a change in swimming behavior and not in deflagellation, even though both of these pathways involve Ca2+ signaling. The approach is to begin with a complete dissection of the Ca2+ signaling pathway of pH shock-induced deflagellation. From work under the NSF award which currently supports this project, it is known that a brief pH shock activates the ilflux of Ca2+ which triggers deflagellation. Mutants with 2 phenotypes have been characterized: (1) The adf strains are defective in pH-regulated Ca2+ influx and (2) the fa strains are defective in responding to the Ca2+ signal of deflagellation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the Ca2+-binding properties and localization of the protein which senses the Ca2+ signal of deflagellation are such that this protein responds selectively to the deflagellation Ca2+ signal and does not detect phototactic Ca2+ signals.  This hypothesis provides an excellent framework to test the idea that the temporal properties of a Ca2+ signal determine the cellular response.  The first aim is to characterize a gene from the Ca2+ sensing pathway which is defective in the fa strains. A molecularly tagged allele has already been isolated and the location of the gene determined. The fa clone will be expressed in E. coli in order to generate antibodies and to produce protein for biochemical characterization. Ca2+ binding studies will test the prediction that this protein binds Ca2+ slowly and with low affinity. The second aim is to screen for new deflagellation mutants in order to determine how many d ifferent proteins are involved in (a) responding to the increase in  H+ i and gating the Ca2+ channel, and (b) binding the influxed Ca2+ and severing the flagella. From ongoing work under this award, it is known that the Ca2+ channel of deflagellation is distinct from the channels involved in phototaxis. The third aim is to clone a gene from the adf pathway and generate antibodies in order to directly test the idea that the Ca2+ channel involved in deflagellation is located in the flagellar transition region. The discrimination of Ca2+ signals within a single cell is a fundamental problem in cell biology. Chlamydomonas provides a unique experimental system to determine how the cell can distinguish the Ca2+ signals which result in distinct physiological responses because the behaviors, such as phototaxis and deflagellation, are easily observed by microscopy and mutations in the pathways are easily identified. Chlamydomonas is haploid and produces meiotic spores amenable to tetrad analysis. Techniques are available for transformation and for cloning. The fundamental mechanisms of Ca2+ mediated signal transduction have been conserved throughout evolution, therefore, it is reasonably hoped that information acquired in this study will provide new concepts of Ca2+ signaling.    Non-technical  Calcium ions play a central role in transmitting the signals perceived by a wide variety of environmental and hormonal receptors to induce cellular reactions. Understanding the role of calcium in transmitting signal information can be efficiently analyzed by using simple model organisms of which the unicellular algae Chlamydomonas is among the favorite systems of biologists. Acid pH induces Chlamydomonas to shed its flagella which involves a calcium mediated signaling pathway to cellular components that mediate the flagellar shedding. Dr. Quarmby will use a multidisciplinary approach to elucidate the role and interactions of calcium in flagellar shedding. This project is important because it will elucidate fundam ental processes involved in calcium mediated signaling that are likely to be evolutionarily conserved in animals and plants.   ***",
