 "awd_abstract_narration": "9610232  Boster  Despite a vast amount of research, little is known  concerning the effect of group structure, and individuals'  understanding of that structure, on conflict and  psychological well-being in Antarctic groups.  The first  segment of our research endeavor has addressed three  specific questions:  1) What are the characteristics of the  social relations among individuals working and living  together in extreme and isolated environments?; 2) What do  individuals understand about their group, how does that  understanding develop, and how is it socially distributed?;  and 3) What is the relationship between that understanding  and both individual and group performance?  In the proposed  second segment, we wish to determine whether there is  significant variation from one cultural setting to another  in terms of the role the above factors play in the  functioning of these groups.  Answers to these questions are  important if we are to advance our knowledge of how  individuals and groups adapt to extreme environments,  particularly with respect to cross-cultural similarities and  differences.    The overall objective of the proposed new segment of this  research program is to compare and contrast the group  dynamics at the United States Amundsen-Scott South Pole  Station with four culturally distinct Antarctic groups:  India's Maitri Station, China's Great Wall Station, Russia's  Vostok Station, and Poland's Arctowski Station.    Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected on  the formation of group structure, status and role consensus,  perceived social conflict, group morale, and individual  psychological well-being for three consecutive years at the  four stations.  Quantitative models on the formation of  group structure will be developed.  In addition, recent  methodological developments in the study of social networks  and intracultural variation will allow for the testing of a  number of related hypotheses concerning aspects of  cognition, social structure, and group  functioning in a  cross-cultural context.    This study will:  1) contribute significantly to the  theoretical understanding of the role of social structure  and cognition in the functioning of groups in isolation, 2)  complement current work on health and adaptation in polar  environments, 3) provide for models of the formation of  group structure that will aid in the development of improved      procedures for assembling groups for the Antarctic and other  isolated environments (e.g. space stations), and 4) allow  for the valid comparison of intercultural variation in human  group dynamics in isolated and extreme environments.",
