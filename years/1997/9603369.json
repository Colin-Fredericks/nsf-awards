 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603369  Berkman    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Professor Paul Berkman of the Ohio State  University and Professor Kazuomi Hirakawa of Hokkaido  University in Sapporo, Japan.  This project will undertake a  study of Cenozoic environmental variability in Antarctic  coastal areas. The relevance of Antarctic coastal areas is  that they contain integrated environmental records of the  glaciological, geological, chemical and biological  variability around the continent - in the transition zone  which reflects the most immediate interaction between the  ice sheets, sea level and climate.  The major goals of this  project are:  1) develop interdisciplinary approaches which  integrate the biology and chemistry of marine macrofossils  in a glacial geomorphological context for the purpose of  interpreting Cenozoic ice-sheet, sea-level and climate  impacts; and  2) facilitate interactions among Japanese and  American scientists along with members of the international  scientific community who are investigating the Cenozoic  dynamics between the Antarctic ice sheets, sea level and  climate.    To facilitate distribution of the results of this research,  several workshops will be held involving researchers from  the United States (Ohio State University, the University of  California), and Japan (Hokkaido University, Rissho  University, Shimane University, Nagoya University, Shizuoka  University and the National Institute of Polar Research).  Understanding the environmental dynamics around Antarctica,  which currently contains 90% of the ice on Earth, is  necessary for accurately predicting global environmental  changes which may occur in the future. The analyses and  cooperation between the Japanese and American researchers  will contribute  to our understanding of the role of  Antarctica in global change.  ***",
