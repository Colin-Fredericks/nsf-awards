The research is: The Effect of Light Quantity  and Quality on the Developmental Ecology of  Indian Tropical Forest Trees.  The researchers  will study seedlings of 16 native South Asian  tropical forest trees to determine how they  respond to changes in light quantity and  quality  as they grow in spectrally neutral and altered  shade conditions.  Plants will be examined for  growth rate, morphology, leaf anatomy, and  physiological response over a 10-15 month  period.   Results will improve understanding of the  ecological  responses of the species in natural conditions,  their sylviculture, and their establishment in  nurseries.  The research will increase  fundamental  knowledge about the effect of light quality and  quantity to the development of trees in natural  light conditions.   Scope:  This study will be conducted almost  entirely at the Madurai Kamaraj University by  Indian researchers in close collaboration with  US PI David Lee who will spend part of his  sabbatical there.  The approach is novel and  should lead to significant advances in  fundamental  knowledge about tree regeneration in tropical  forests.   The research is basic and applied.  It will  greatly  strengthen US science by focusing on a region  little  studied by US researchers.  As a new  collaboration  that will involve young scientists, this  project  supports INT objectives.  The project will  strengthen  research links between the US and India.  The  interaction is mutually beneficial.    ***",
