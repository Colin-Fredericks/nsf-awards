This proposal involves research on two topics:  (a) the study of   interfaces, and (b) the use of renormalization and scaling methods to   study systems of parabolic differential equations.  The study of   interfaces proceeds along the lines of previous work that utilizes the   phase field model.  The study of alloys is particularly important in   terms of the ''freezing in'' of solute into the solid.  This is an area   in which mathematics can make a substantial contribution since the   models necessarily involve differential equations that are degenerate,   as the diffusivity is close to zero in the solid phase.  In the second   part of the study, the PI will utilize renormalization and scaling   methods to obtaing results on systems of parabolic differential   equations in which an asymptotic self-similarity can be expected.    The work involves an extension of the PI's work that used these   methods to compute anomalous exponents in nonlinear diffusion   equations.  The objective is to extend these results to systems of   parabolic differential equations, thereby adding a powerful tool to the   methodology of these systems.  Finally, the study will apply these   methods to reaction-diffusion systems such as the phase field   equations in order to extract key features of global behavior.      This study will provide a formalism for studying complicated   problems involving materials science. In particular, interface   problems arise in many industrial applications and pose important   challenges in terms of theory and large scale computation. The   development of a consistent set of equations and methodology for   high speed computation is valuable as a starting point for many   industrial applications such as casting of alloys. The study will also   utilize renormalization techniques that have been so successful in   understanding subtle behavior in  thermodynamics. With the   development of these   techniques in this dynamical context, an extremely complicated   engineering problem can potentially be understood in terms of   manageable parts with particular characteristic behavior.",
