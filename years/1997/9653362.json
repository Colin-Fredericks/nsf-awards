 "awd_abstract_narration": "Summer Institute in Demography    The College of Arts and Sciences at Fayetteville State University requests support for a week-long Summer Institute in Population Studies with a focus on African American demographics. The Institute is intended to enhance the teaching of selected sociology faculty from undergraduate colleges and universities particularly those from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). The Summer Institute offers intensive seminars and programs to improve faculty participants knowledge on social demography with special emphasis on African Americans. Faculty members in sociology and related fields in the social sciences who teach in undergraduate programs will be selected to participate in the summer Institute.      The major objective of the Institute is to encourage the participants to incorporate demographic methods and data into the undergraduate curricula. This will enhance the teaching effectiveness of demographic and population studies courses, and introduce a multi-cultural framework to the curricula by using a comparative perspective with focus on African Americans.  An earlier workshop conducted in the summer of 1992, with a 2-day follow-up in the summer of 1993 was very effective in achieving this objective.",
