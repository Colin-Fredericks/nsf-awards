Initiated by NSF in 1994, NNUN is serving as a useful model for linking expensive facilities to gain synergy and minimize duplication.    NNUN proposes establishment of a network-wide REU program.  The intent is to capitalize on the extensive, interrelated infrastructure of NNUN to provide a much broader and richer REU experience than any one site could provide.  The proposed program will build upon several existing enrichment programs existing at various NNUN sites.    By expanding the program, we expect to strengthen and enrich the REU experience in several ways:    * With the geographical spread embodied with NNUN, we will be able to contact and attract a broader range of minority/female students.    * The pool of faculty will increase by a factor of 3-4.  This should enable a better match between student and faculty interests.    * The REUs will be exposed to various aspects of \"networking\" across large geographical distances, an experience likely to be important in their careers.    * We will offer a convocation at the end of the program which will provide a majority of the students with a \"2 site\" experience.    ***",
