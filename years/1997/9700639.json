 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700639  Pinder  This is an award to provide support for research on an  approach to engineering design of systems for addressing  groundwater pollution problems by a mathematical procedure  that takes into consideration subjective information in  applying mathematical models describing groundwater models  movement in aquifers to design of systems for  decontamination of groundwater aquifers.  The investigator  plans on defining and formulating a set of rules that  improves the description of the relationship between  exposure to low doses of contaminated groundwater and  potential health-based risk-issues.  These rules will be  used in identifying engineering design constraints that must  be taken into consideration in generating least-cost  solutions to restoration of the quality of contaminated  groundwater aquifers.  Implementation of the rules to define  the subjective constraints will be followed by their  introduction into groundwater flow and transport models that  can be used to formulate optimal procedures for restoration  of aquifers.    This research is expected to advance the state of knowledge  by which perceptions of qualitative concepts such as risk,  danger and importance can be incorporated into the process  by which engineers design procedures for restoration of the  quality of groundwater in aquifers.  Results of this project  are also expected to contribute toward potential use of the  procedures developed in addressing groundwater quality  restoration problems to solution of other environmental  engineering design problems.  ***",
