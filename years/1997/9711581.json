Although digital video is mature enough to generate and deliver digital video,  a lot of research is necessary to enhance and broaden the current capability.    This award provides funding for a planning meeting at the New Jersey Institute of Technology to determine if there is sufficient industrial support to establish an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Digital Video.  In a recent award to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute it was noted that the envisioned research interests of industry would require the involvement of other university researchers.    This award provides funding for an additional planning meeting to determine if there is sufficient industrial interest to establish a multi-university I/UCRC for Digital Video and Media utilizing the resources of Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and Princeton University.",
