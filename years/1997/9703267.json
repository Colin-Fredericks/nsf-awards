 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER)  project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, is the characterization of the surface chemistry,  structure, and defects of transition metal oxide surfaces that  have broad scientific and technological application.  Professor  Diebold and her undergraduate and graduate students at Tulane  University will use a range of surface characterization  techniques in this work including scanning tunneling microscopy,  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ion scattering spectroscopy,  and thermal desorption spectroscopy.  The aim of this CAREER  research project is to probe the formation of defects and the  reactivity of these oxide surfaces at the atomic level to  establish a foundation for understanding the chemistry that  occurs at these surfaces.  Educational thrusts beyond involvement  of students in this research involve the development of a new  surface science course to complement the laboratory experience  and an outreach and mentoring program centered around the  establishment of a mobile scanning tunneling microscopy  laboratory.   Transition metal oxide surfaces are used in the fabrication of  gas sensors, catalysts, coatings for corrosion protection, and  environmental degradation systems.  Professor Diebold and her  students at Tulane University will apply several surface  spectroscopic methods that provide atomic scale spatial  resolution to the study of the chemistry, structure, and defects  of transition metal oxide surfaces with support of this CAREER  research project.  The chemistry that occurs at the surfaces of  these oxides is highly dependent on the structures that exist  there.  Knowledge of how these structures control these chemical  reactions will be produced by this work.  This hands-on  experimental program will have a positive educational impact on  the undergraduate and graduate students working on this project.   Portable scanning tunneling microscopy experiments and other  surface science experiments will be developed to bring the  excitement of this work to high school students in the New  Orleans and Mississippi Delta areas.  This activity will raise  these students' awareness of the excitement that can be  experienced in a scientific career.",
