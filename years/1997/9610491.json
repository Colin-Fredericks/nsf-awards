 "awd_abstract_narration": "9610491  Huang  Efficiency   and   effectiveness  of  numerous   engineering  applications   (typically  macroscale)   are   significantly  influenced   by   the   underlying   microscale   phenomena.  Consequently,    macroscale   design    considerations    of  engineering  products  and manufacturing  processes  require  detailed microscale insights.  Texture formation in bulk and  sheet forming, shear banding (that essentially governs  chip  formation   characteristics  in  machining),  strength   and  toughness  of particle/fiber reinforced composite materials,  and  mechanical  properties  of  thin  film  interfaces  are  examples   of   this  class  of  problems,   A   multi-scale  representation capable of capturing the micro-scale  effects  and  synthesizing  its  essence within  the  context  of  an  otherwise   macroscale  model  is  necessary  for  effective  consideration  of  such  engineering  problems.    Moreover,  interests in several microscale engineering problems,  e.g.,  MEMS,   nano-  and  sub-micron  scale  surface  modification  techniques in electronic packaging and failure of fine  line  interconnects   in  microelectronic  circuits,   have   also  increased significantly in recent years.       Experimental   observations  (e.g.,  micro-indentation,  torsion  of  thin wires, strength of thin films)  show  that  material   behavior  at  the  microscale  is   significantly  different  from  that at the macroscale.   These  microscale  experiments also exhibit considerable influence of geometric  parameters on material properties.       Predictions  based on conventional constitutive  models  fail  to account for such microscale phenomena that may have  profound implications in design and manufacturing of a  wide  spectrum   of   engineering  devices.   For   example,   the  conventional plasticity theory cannot explain the  increased  hardness  in micro-indentation tests as compared  to  macro-  indentation   of   the  same  material.   Material   removal  characteristic s  in  machining  of  metals   are   crucially  dependent  on  the  thickness of the generated  shear  band;  conventional  plasticity  provides  no  direct   avenue   to  estimate such parameters.       The  strain  gradient plasticity recently  proposed  by  Fleck  and  Hutchinson (1993) satisfies  the  Clausius-Duhem  thermodynamic  restrictions  on  the  constitutive  law  for  second deformation gradients, and is potentially capable  of  effectively  probing  micron and sub-micron  scale  material  behavior.   It can also provide an effective transition  for  incorporating  the microscale effects within  a  generalized  framework of plasticity. However, a material length scale is  introduced in the strain gradient plasticity, and  needs  to  be   determined   from  a  set  of  independent   microscale  experiments.       Accordingly,  the  proposed  work  first   focuses   on  developing- two independent sets of experiments:      (1) bending  of  micron-thick Cu beams  and  plates  using        Atomic Force Microscopy, and    (2) measurement of shear band thickness and sub-structures        (in  compression tests) using optical-, electron-  and        atomic force microscopy.  Observations  from  these experiments, in  conjunction  with  suitable   modeling   efforts,  will   provide   independent  estimates  of  the \"material length scale\".   Comparison  of  these results with others will facilitate investigations  of  the  validity of the \"material length scale\" as  a  material  parameter.   The  experiments  will  also  be  used  to  (i)  quantitatively  estimate  the  material  length  scale   for  individual  materials,  and (ii)  establish  the  region  of  interest of strain gradient theory for particular materials.  We will then utilize the strain gradient plasticity theory  to probe different engineering applications where microscale  phenomena play important roles.  In machining, we will  directly estimate the shear band thickness for different  FCC, BCC and HCP materials under va rious cutting conditions,  and (i) validate predictions against observations from  proposed machining- experiments; (ii) quantitatively  investigate the influence of shear band thickness on quality  and integrity of the finished surface.  For composites, we  will investigate the influence of particle/fiber size on  effective strength.  Micro-mechanical sensors, actuators and  transducers commonly use thin film bi-layers (thin film on  thin film).  We will carry out modeling- and experimentation  on such systems.",
