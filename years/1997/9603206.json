 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603206  Bucksbaum    This award supports the participation of American scientists  in a U.S.-Japan seminar on the Manipulation of Matter by  Coherent Light to be held in Gunma, Japan from September 1-  5, 1997.  The co-organizers are Professors Philip H.  Bucksbaum of the University of Michigan and Kohzo Hakuta of  the University of Electro-Communications in Japan.  This  seminar will bring together leading researchers in the areas  of laser-atom cooling, atom optics, atomic coherent control,  and ultrafast laser-atom processes, to study emerging  connections between these fields.  Topics to be discussed  include Bose-Einstein condensation of cold atoms, quantum  computing, microlasers, and entangled wavepackets.  %%%  The manipulation of matter by coherent light is one of the  leading fields of activity in laser-matter studies, and new  advances are being stimulated by new technologies.  The  recent success in observing Bose-Einstein condensation in a  weakly interacting gas confirmed for the first time  predictions made by Einstein and Bose almost a century ago.  With a U.S. concentration on gas phase studies and a  Japanese focus on condensed matter and quantum optics, the  exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this  field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own  work, and will set the stage for future collaborative  projects.  ***",
