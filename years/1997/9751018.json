 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students in physics and environmental technology courses previously gained little understanding of basic physical concepts from lectures. Furthermore, the artificial separation of lecture and laboratory in these courses has prevented the laboratory from rectifying the conceptual shortcomings of lecture. The department has purchased a single computer and instrumental interfacing equipment and has begun to redesign the physics courses by melding lecture and laboratory into an activity-based instructional approach. Equipment is being purchased to enable the department to set up a number of computerized student learning stations. Specifically, it is setting up six learning stations that can be used to teach a two-semester, calculus-based physics course and a one-semester, technical physics course during the first year of the project. In the second year, three more stations can be added and activity-based instruction can be introduced into two environmental technology courses Principles of Environmental Engineering and Advanced Water and Wastewater Operations.  *",
