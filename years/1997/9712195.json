Growth of the field of image-related computation, including particularly computer vision and pattern recognition, has created a significant need for additional educational opportunities in these areas and this project provides a highly leveraged approach toward meeting a part of that need.  The workshop provides well-documented examples of courses, course modules, case studies, laboratory resources and other teaching materials to help faculty design high-quality image-related undergraduate courses.",
