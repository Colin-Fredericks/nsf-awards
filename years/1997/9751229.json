 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on equipment being used to set up advanced undergraduate laser experiments to be integrated into a preexisting senior physics laboratory and research program.  The project addresses the need of the department to provide senior-level students with a solid background in lasers in a hands-on laboratory setting.  A two track sequence of coordinated experiments, of increasing degrees of difficulty, is being created to familiarize senior-level students in physics with advanced laser technology and applications.  Well tested laser experiments are being integrated into an innovative sequence that enhances student learning.  These experiments are providing an in-depth experience with lasers, and giving advanced students the confidence and knowledge to develop research projects using lasers.  The first track of experiments examines the properties of infrared laser diodes and uses them to perform two advanced spectroscopy experiments.  The second track of experiments concentrates on the properties and applications of tunable-dye lasers and includes six different experiments of increasing degrees of sophistication.  *",
