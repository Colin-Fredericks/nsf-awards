 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  96-61232  Srinivas      This Project will develop a novel class of catalysts to remove (Carbon Monoxide) CO from automobile exhaust during cold start. TDA Research has identified a novel class of catalysts that effectively remove CO at temperatures as low as 25 C. In addition to removing the CO, the heat generated during the oxidation of CO to CO2 is used to heat the three-way catalyst faster, leading to hydrocarbon oxidation. In Phase I, TDA will synthesize, characterize and test the activity of the catalysts for the removal of CO under cold start conditions. In Phase II, the catalyst will be supported on an inert carrier (ceramic monolith) and tested on a car to determine the efficiency under actual cold start conditions to bring the temperature of the catalyst up to operating temperature.                More than 40 million people, in 80 different cities, live in areas with CO levels that exceed EPA standards. Automobiles are by far the largest outdoor source of CO, and are also major sources of unburned hydrocarbons (HCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOX). Since the advent of automotive emissions regulations in the United States in 1973, the allowable emissions of all three major pollutants have been continually reduced. Current three-way catalysts are not effective in reducing emissions at temperatures below 200 C (during cold start). Electrically heated catalyst, while effective, are large energy consumers, heavy, expensive and inconvenient. This new approach offers a cost effective alternative.     ***",
