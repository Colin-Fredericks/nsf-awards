 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the problem created by the lack of geometric computing in the curriculum. The lack of interdisciplinary foundation courses in geometric computing affects student success in subsequent graphics, engineering design, or mathematics courses, as well as student retention and employability in product design and manufacturing related software development.   The primary objective of the project is to design a comprehensive geometric computing course to address interdisciplinary issues for second-year students in computer science, engineering, and mathematics. Furthermore, this project is developing the courseware (textbook, lab manual, videos, and web-site applications) and interactive animation software systems to explore aspects of geometric computing.   The impact of this project is to provide students with the basic skill for handling geometric problems, understanding the limitations of finite precision on geometric problem solvers, and to prepare students for geometric applications in science and engineering. The impact of this project is also expected improve the retention rate of students and the employability of graduates in product design and manufacturing related software development.",
