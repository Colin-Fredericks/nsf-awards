Loyola College shall be wholly responsible for the management   and operation of the International Technology Research Institute (ITRI), which operates the World Technology Evaluation Center (WTEC).  ITRI will plan, organize, conduct, and manage technology assessments, using the methodology and procedures described in proposal ENG-9707092, dated December 9, 1996, submitted by Loyola College to NSF.    b.  The mission of WTEC is to provide U.S. government, industry,   and academia with technical studies of the best research and development abroad.  In addition to conducting new studies under this cooperative agreement, center operations will provide information to the public concerning past studies, World Wide Web service of studies concluded under previous grants and agreements with NSF, and liaison with parties interested in transferring technology gained since the establishment of the centers at Loyola.    c.  WTEC will conduct up to 16 studies to benchmark technologies   in foreign counties.  The studies will be divided among three types that differ in the breadth of their objectives, the extensiveness of the final report, and the methodologies for selecting the targeted technology and an expert panel.  The proposal forecasts six standard studies, five mission-directed (agency) studies, and five CISAR studies.  The actual blend of studies will be determined by the interest of NSF and the sponsoring agencies, and may differ to the extent that funding resources permit.",
