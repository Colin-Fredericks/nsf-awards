The  research program consists of a theoretical study of  nonlinear magnetism and excitations in finite media, i.e.  devices.  The specific projects in this grant are: (1) Two  dimensional nonlinear diffraction of finite aperture SW  beams and pulses in magnetic films leading to self  channeling, self focusing  and wave collapse; (2) Formation  and propagation of one dimensional \"bright\" and \"dark\" spin-  wave envelope solitons in weakly dissipative magnetic films  and (3)  parametric amplification of \"bright\" envelope  solitons in magnetic films by external microwave pumping.  Results of this research will be useful for the development  of microwave signal processing devices based on nonlinear  spin wave processes in magnetic films.  %%%  This grant supports theoretical research at a predominantly  undergraduate institution on a problem in device magnetism.  The research is expected to advance our understanding of  nonlinear wave dynamics in a magnetic medium and has  applications to a better understanding of the properties of  high quality garnet films as used in microwave technology.  The project involves undergraduate students within the  framework of an internationally acknowledged active research  program.  ***",
