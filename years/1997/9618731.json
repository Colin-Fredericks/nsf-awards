 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  majority of current computer speech recognition systems  model the speech signal with homogeneous observation frames,  represent words by a string of phonemes, and rely heavily on  statistical  word-based  language  models  to   decode   the  underlying  word sequence.  This project aims to investigate  an  alternative approach that incorporates many more  levels  of  linguistic information into a parsimonious  hierarchical  framework  for  speech recognition and understanding.   This  approach  will  provide  new perspectives  on  incorporating  constraints   from   the  distinctive   feature,   phonetic,  phonological,  syllabic, morphological, lexical,  syntactic,  and  semantic  levels  into  a probabilistic  framework  for  speech recognition and understanding.  Structure sharing  of  sub-word   levels   across  words   will   allow   for   the  generalization   of  phonological  effects  across   similar  environments   and   increased   flexibility   for   dynamic  vocabularies and language models.  Structure sharing  should  also  produce a more efficient search with a smaller  number  of parameters.  The proposed hierarchical framework also has  the  potential of serving as a recognition kernel,  with the  speech  signal  as  input  and a set of  morpho-phonological  units  as  output. This kernel would have a finite inventory  of  units  for  a  given language, whose internals  will  be  vocabulary  and  task  independent.   To  ensure  that   the  proposed framework is language independent, its utility will  also be investigated for languages other than English.",
