 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schatz Abstract:     We propose to investigate various aspects of the finite element  method for elliptic and parabolic problems including, (1) A posteriori  error estimation. Conditions were recently given by the proposer, W.  Hoffman and G.  Wittum under which a class of averaging operators are  asymptotically exact error estimators for the max norm of the gradient  on each element in a model smooth Neumann problem. The class includes  the Z-Z estimator. Preliminary estimates indicate that these methods do  not work for problems on polygonal domains where pollution effects  dominate. We propose cures which we shall analyze.(2) We propose to  investigate a unifying theory for superconvergence which includes  several previously developed by the proposer and co-authors.  We shall  focus on a theory which is applicable to smooth and nonsmooth  problems.(3) We will investigate an a priori \"universal\" mesh grading  algorithm which can be used to provide  optimal relative error for  problems with power type singularities.These meshes should be  particularly useful for elliptic problems on three dimensional  polyhedral domains where the optimal meshes are highly anisotropic. (4)  Problems with highly anisotropic diffusion will be investigated which  are singularly perturbed elliptic problems which degenerate to  parabolic problems. These problems often exhibit boundary layer  behavior and the standard finite element method does not perform well  when this occurs. These problems are not convection dominated.       The investigation and solution of the many complex problems  which arise in science and the manufacturing industry have increasingly  benefited from mathematical and numerical studies of their underlying  mathematical models. The successs of this approach is due to advances  both in the developement and unders tanding of new numerical algorithms  and in advances in high performance computing. In this proposal we  study various aspects of the finite element method for solving a large  variety  of problems which arise in practice and which are modeled by  partial differential equations. As just a very few examples we mention  problems in elasticity to determine the strength of complex structures  a nd problems in fluid dynamics. The latter includes such diverse  problems as the determination of ground water flows for pollution  studies to the study of the ab sorbtion of medicinal ointment through  the skin. This project is oriented toward suggesting and analyzing new  methods for the efficient and accurate solution of such problems.We  shall seek better approximations by enlarging the theory of sup  erconvergence and investigate a means of universally grading meshes for  problems on domains with corners which arise very often in industry.  Among other things we shall study means for obtaining an estimate for  the error between the compute d solution and the unknown true solution  to determine a posteriori the quality of the approximation.",
