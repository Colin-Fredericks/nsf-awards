 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economists at the University of Pittsburgh play a major role in the newly developing area of experimental economics. Experiments place participants in carefully designed market situations, provide real financial incentives and allow subjects to interact via a computer network. Such research allows human motivation and actual behavior to be directly observed and thus factored into theoretical models. To proceed effectively, such research requires up to date computer networks. The current system employed by the Pittsburgh Economics Department is configured around two Novell Netware network file servers and is, unfortunately, old and no longer adequate for experimental purposes. With NSF support the system will be upgraded. Purchases will include PittNet Ethernet Ports, 31 Gateway 2000 workstations, and related hard and software. Installation of the new system wille stablish a `star` configuration for the network, providing each network device with a dedicated cable run to the network hub.  Areas of research focus include learning in games, behavior in auctions where bidders demand multiple-units, public goods exchange and industrial organization theory. The instrumentation will have a major infrastructural effect in the training of graduate students and the development of software of general use.",
