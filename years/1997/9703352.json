 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research  explores sensor management in intelligent  motion  control  systems  with  the  main  objective  of  describing  and  evaluating a mathematical model of what it means to pay attention  to  a  sensor. A system model and control topology that  reflects  properties  of  the  hardware, such  as  computation  delays  and  communication  limitations,  is used.  The  amount  of  attention  devoted to a device can be interpretated through the selection of  feedback  gains  and  the  degree  of  communication  bus  access  allocated to the device.  Control synthesis with this model  will  address  questions such as which sensors should  be  used  for  a  task,  what  degree of coordination between devices is  required,  and is the system stable? The control design methodology will  be  applied  to robotic applications. Successful completion  of  this  research  will  enable designers of complex  robotic  systems  to  utilize   a  formal  procedure  in  selecting  sensors   and   in  determining  the  required, or sufficient,  coordination  between  motor subsystems, while still ensuring system stability.    The  other objective of this project is to develop curriculum  in  the  area of intelligent machines, providing mechanical engineers  with interdisciplinary skills and improving students' engineering  problem  solving skills.  Both goals will be addressed through  a  hands-on  undergraduate course in Robotics using a problem  based  learning   (PBL)  teaching  methodology.   Using  PBL,   students  identify  the  theory  required to solve  a  problem,  learn  the  theory,  and  apply  it.   Thus  students  explore  the  relevant  subjects  as they see the need for them. A robotics course,  with  material  from multiple disciplines, is suited to this  approach.  A   graduate  level  Intelligent  Systems  course  will  also  be  developed.",
