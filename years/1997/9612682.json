 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project is developing a novel approach to natural  language  generation,  applying  it  to  computer-aided  text  and   speech  generation  for people with physical disabilities.   Many  people  who  cannot speak because of physical disability utilize text-to-  speech  generators  as  prosthetic devices.   However,  users  of  speech  prostheses often have more general loss of motor control,  and  despite aids such as word prediction, text entry is slow and  difficult.   For  typical users, current speech  prostheses  have  output  rates  less than a tenth of the speed of  normal  speech.  This  prevents  natural social conversation, since it  completely  disrupts  the  usual processes of turn-taking, and  can  lead  to  negative  effects  on the listener's attitude to  the  prosthesis  user.   The  main focus of this research is the investigation  of  techniques which can improve rates sufficiently for more  natural  conversation  to be possible, without sacrificing flexibility  of  content.  This  new  approach employs a combination  of  a  wide-  coverage   grammar,   corpus-based  word  frequency   data,   and  conversational  templates.   Applied  to  speech  prosthesis,  it  enables the production of full sentences from minimal user  input  in  a  context-sensitive way.  The approach can also  be  applied  more  generally for efficient production of formulaic  text  like  the structured reports used widely in business and government.",
