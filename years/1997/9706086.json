 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706086  Davidson  A comprehensive petrogenetic study of Damavand Volcano, a young, large-volume alkaline edifice located 50 km to the N.E. of Tehran, is proposed.  The volcano has developed subsequent to closure of the Tethyan ocean, and is now located in a region of active compression.  Isotope and trace element studies will enable the extent of interaction of magmas with the lithosphere to be determined.  When the effects of crustal modification have been accounted for, we hope to constrain the composition of primitive magmas, which may elucidate the nature of the mantle source (asthenosphere vs lithosphere).  This information will be needed to explain how and why magmatism occurs in some regions after subduction has ceased. The volcanological characteristics of  Damavand will also be studied, with a view to evaluating volcanic hazard potential - a goal that is of particular interest to our Iranian colleagues. This study is intended as a pilot.  It will facilitate the development of collaborative academic and logistical ties with scientists in Iran and will hopefully be followed by a broader investigation of magmatism associated  with the Tethyan closure in Iran.",
