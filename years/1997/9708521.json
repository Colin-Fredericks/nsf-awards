Alternatives include (1) increased respiration relative to photosynthesis with tree age, (2) accumulation of nutrients in organic matter pools with slow rates of  turnover, (3) changes in allocation away from biomass accumulation, and (4) changes in hydraulic conductivity of trees, leading to decreased stomatal conductance and thus decreased photosynthesis.  Tests of these alternative hypotheses are important from a wide range of perspectives, from understanding the ability of forests to store C in response to global climate change to improving our ability to manage forests for timber and other products. The location of the study is a Eucalyptus plantation in Hawaii that has been manipulated for several years by varying tree density and by fertilizer application. Results thus may be useful to management of plantation forests as well to understanding of more general successional changes in  forest productivity.",
