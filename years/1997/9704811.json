They were developed as a  result of an attempt to generalize simultaneously two such classical  objects; the incompressible surface and the taut foliation.  This  project involves studying the structure of essential laminations and  how they sit inside of a 3-manifold, to extract information about the  `laminar' 3-manifold.  The main goals that the investigator will  pursue are to show that every irreducible 3-manifold  homotopy-equivalent to a laminar manifold is homeomorphic to it, and  to show that laminar manifolds are finitely covered by Haken  manifolds.  He will also study taut foliations from the laminar point  of view, using this new point of view to study these older objects.  The goal is to find examples of manifolds that admit essential  laminations but which do not contain either of the two `parent'  objects.  An associated goal is to find a hyperbolic 3-manifold which  does not admit an essential lamination.       A 3-dimensional manifold is an object which looks like our  ordinary 3-dimensional space, if you don't look too far away from  where you are standing.  Such objects can behave very differently over  large distances, though; walking in a straight line, for example, can  bring you right back to where you started from (much like walking on  the surface of the spherical Earth).  3-manifold topology attempts to  describe this global structure.  In doing so, ideas are drawn from,  and applied to, many other branches of science; they have been applied  to chemistry, where they have helped to unlock some of the secrets of  DNA recombination, and they have been both drawn from and applied to  physics, in work aimed at understanding the basic building blocks of  the universe.  One technique that has proved fruitful in studying  3-manifolds is to think of the 3-manifold as a collection of surfaces  (called a foliation) stacked together (like the  pages of a book); then  one can use what is known about surfaces to explore the structure of  the 3-manifold.  The investigator plans to continue work aimed at  developing this approach.  ***",
