 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is to study and optimize the fatigue life for surfaces machined by superfinish hard turning.  This will be accomplished by:  (1) modeling the relationship between machining conditions, tool wear, surface integrity, and fatigue life of the superfinish hard turned surface, and (2) developing a methodology enabling optimal pre-stressing, through the optimal residual stress distribution generated by the best cutting conditions for fatigue life.  The research results could lead to the replacement of grinding and superfinishing by single-point machining, benefiting the manufacturing industries that make bearings, gears, cams, shafts, tools, dies, etc.   The research is fundamental and could lead to a significant improvement in the fatigue life of superfinish hard turned surfaces.  A major strength of the project is its strong industry participation and support.",
