Alexandratos  Affiliation:                            Gordon Research Center      This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The principal investigator is Spiro D. Alexandratos.  The grant is to be used for travel support to the 1997 Gordon Conference on Reactive Polymers, Ion Exchangers and Adsorbents.  This Gordon Conference will address the theme of polymer supported reagents, their synthesis and use in a number of separations technologies.  The design of polymer supported reagents for molecular recognition systems is a central theme of the conference.    The conference is very pertinent to emerging areas of separations technology.  The precise design of molecular recognition ligands, their attachment onto polymer backbones for use in environmental remediation, chromatography, biochemical separations, adsorption etc. are new interdisciplinary forefront areas for separations.  The conference will bring together academic and industrial participants, engineers and physical scientists, and a mix of mature researchers and new researchers including students.  The focus in discussions, an integral part of the Gordon Conference format will aid information dissemination and enhance the educational component of the conference.",
