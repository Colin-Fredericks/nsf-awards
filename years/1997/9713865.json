 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713865  Chandrasekar   Based on the results of preliminary experiments on drilling with low-frequency vibrations, this project will fully explore the underlying phenomena that occur when vibratory motion is superimposed on drilling.  The effect of this vibratory motion will be explored for hard metallic materials including hardened steel, stainless steel, and titanium, as well as for soft materials including aluminum and lead.  Experiments will be conducted with drills having various geometries and made of different materials, and with lubricants of both oil and water soluble types.  The investigation will include torque and thrust, hole quality, friction at the drill-chip interface, and the morphological characteristics of the chips produced.   The study of vibration superimposed drilling could generate fundamental knowledge about this process and lead to substantial improvement in the quality and productivity of drilling.  The research results could also help understand other vibration superimposed manufacturing processes.",
