Specifically  there are two related components of this  project:  One  involves further development of a variational formalism to  study the chain structure of a polyelectrolyte solution at  arbitrary concentrations.  This is in contrast to past work  on the polyelectrolyte chain structure which has been  limited to a single chain, in the infinite dilution limit.  The second part  is an application of this formalism to  study counterion condensation.  The principal advantage of  this theory is that  it can treat fluctuating, intrinsically  flexible chains and it does not require restriction to fixed  model geometries such as line charges and cylinders.  This  work is expected to resolve some of the most controversial  questions in the field of polyelectrolyte solutions and also  pave the way for similar studies of even more complex  systems such as charged self-assembled surfactant systems,  polyelectrolyte complexes, and polyelectrolyte/membrane  complexes.  %%%  In this grant to a young female researcher in theoretical  polymer science, there is support to study properties of  polyelectrolytes.  These are the polymers that are soluble  in water, generally found everywhere and especially relevant  to environmentally-benign processing.  The work in this  project addresses some long standing questions in the  structure of charged polymers and their response to further  charging at fairly high levels.  This work uses  sophisticated, state-of-the-art, theoretical machinery and  proposes to further build on the PI's recent development of  necessary mathematical techniques.  ***",
