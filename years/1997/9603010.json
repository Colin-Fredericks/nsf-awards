The co-  organizers are Professor Edgar Bering of the University of  Houston and Dr. Akira Kadokura of the National Institute of  Polar Research in Tokyo, Japan.  This seminar will identify  the current major scientific questions in the areas of  ionospheric and magnetospheric physics that can best be  addressed using stratospheric balloon flights of several  weeks duration.  The Polar Patrol Balloon (PPB) program is  one of long duration balloon flights that the National  Institute of Polar Research of Japan has conducted for  nearly a decade.  Three of these flights have carried an  experiment supplied by the U.S. investigator.    Results of the workshop will include a detailed review of  possible scientific objectives, instrumentation options and  future launch sites.  Coordinated proposals for further  research will be initiated and developed. One such priority  might be the preparation and review of a list of intervals  of interesting ULF wave activity observed during these  flights.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese  experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to  advance their own work, and will set the stage for future  collaborative projects.  ***",
