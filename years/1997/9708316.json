 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the investigation of fungicolous and   mycoparasitic fungi that colonize sclerotia.  Antifungal agents isolated   from colonists of Aspergillus flavus are  especially  likely to exert   effects on Aspergillus, an important opportunistic pathogen and mycotoxin   producer.  Studies of fungi that colonize Aspergillus sclerotia as   sources of novel metabolites that inhibit the growth of the fungal host   are thought to be unprecedented.  With this renewal award, the Synthetic   Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. James B. Gloer of the   Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa.   Dr. Gloer, in   collaboration with Drs. Donald T. Wicklow and Patrick F. Dowd of the U.S.   Department of Agriculture, will focus his work on investigating the   fungal invasion of long-lived fungal bodies such as sclerotia and   stromata.  This process may frequently involve antibiosis and, therefore   sclerotial colonists are potentially useful as a source of antifungal   agents.",
