 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701471  Lee  The Center for Advanced Technologies in Earthquake Loss-  Reduction (ATEL) is a nine-institution consortium, closely  linked under an integrated research and management framework  using modern communication networks. The thrust of this  center will be the development and application of advanced  and emerging technologies for design, construction, and  intelligent engineering renewal of buildings and civil  infrastructure in reducing earthquake losses.  An integral  part of the research is associated with loss-reduction:  removal of socio-economic barriers; and development of  incentives for new knowledge and technology.  This EERC will  carry out an integrated research, education and outreach  program that will be built on three major elements:  (a)  performance assessment of the built environment;  (b)  rehabilitation of critical facilities; and (c) response and  recovery  using new loss estimation methodologies and  advanced technologies. The technological foci of the  research are:  high-performance computing; site remediation;  structural control and monitoring; smart and high-  performance materials; condition assessment;  robotics  systems; and decision-making systems. A comprehensive  education plan for graduate and undergraduate students, K-  12, professionals and the public sector is integrated with  the research plan and is supported by two user networks  focused upon:  (a)  advanced computation; and (b)  experimental  facilities.  An innovative outreach program  will be implemented to promote and develop:  public  awareness; professional training and re-education; and  partnerships for knowledge/technology transfer and  utilization.   The Center for ATEL is one of three EERC's  networked with an overarching governing board to provide  synergism in creating new knowledge and technology,  educating the next generation of earthquake engineers and  scientists, and providing outreach to industry, government,  pre-college schools and potential user groups.",
