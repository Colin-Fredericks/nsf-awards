 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9610382  White  Warpage is the manifestation of residual stresses in composite structures. For the automotive industry warpage leads to problems with the fit and finish of body panel components.  Dimensional accuracy is critical when mating two body panels together at the joints.  Extreme surface tolerances are also critical in order to produce panels with smooth, glossy finishes. Residual stresses will also ultimately lead to reduction in durability. Strength issues associated with durability will become more important as composites are gradually incorporated into the primary load bearing components of the car.  This research project is focused on process-induced residual stresses in composite parts and their effect on the dimensional stability of the manufactured component.  The fundamental objectives of the proposal are: (1) to develop a fundamental, mechanics-based understanding of the factors that control dimensional accuracy and residual stresses in polymer-matrix composite parts; (2) to create analytical and computational tools that will allow engineers to predict the final dimensions and stresses in composite parts, and to anticipate the effect of processing variables; and (3) to combine these analytical and numerical tools with recent developments in optimization techniques to achieve optimal manufacturing processes that minimize warpage and residual stress. This collaborative research project addresses fundamental issues on the understanding of factors that control dimensional accuracy and residual stresses in polymer-matrix parts. The research project has a balance between theory and experiment, and will provide valuable findings for the composite manufacturing industry.",
