 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617392  Glaeser    An experimental technique for determining the equilibrium  shape of pores in alumina has been developed and applied to  both undoped and Ti-doped sapphire.  Ti doping changes the  Wulff shape of alumina.  Concurrently, the use of pre-  perturbed pore channels has elevated studies of the Rayleigh  instabilities to a new level, allowing quantitative  measurement of key thermodynamic and kinetic parameters; a  framework for correcting for anisotropy effects in assessing  the surface diffusivity has been developed.  Ti doping  affects the morphological stability, but appears to have  only a mild effect on the surface diffusivity. Finally, Ti  doping has been shown to promote highly anisotropic grain  growth, leading to the formation of elongated grains, and to  substantially change the grain boundary mobility.  The  proposed work builds on and extends the first two components  of this prior work.  Specifically, by using lithographically  introduced pores and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to assess  the equilibrium pore shape, we propose to determine the  effect of Ti, Cr, Ca and Mg additions on the relative  energies and thermodynamic stabilities of a range of low  index surfaces in sapphire.  In addition, the instability of  lithographically introduced pore channels with pre-existent  finite perturbations of known but systematically varied  amplitude and wavelength will be examined.  The independent  effects of dopants and crystallographic orientation on the  thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of perturbation  evolution will be determined.  This method of determining  the surface diffusivity, and more conventional scratch  smoothing methods will be used in tandem to compare apparent  surface diffusivities obtained under conditions where the  amplitude of the surface perturbation is increasing with  time, and decreasing with time, respectively. The  diffusivities determined using these two complementary  approaches will be compared to the diffusivities that can be  obtaine d from an analysis of pore-boundary separation  conditions.  The comparison may help to identify which (if  any) of the two approaches used to determine the surface  diffusivity provides data that is useful in predicting and  describing microstructural evolution in ceramics.  %%%  The proposed research will help improve our understanding of  surface diffusion in ceramics.   By studying the effect of  dopants and crystallographic orientation, the energetics of  surface diffusion can be determined, and thus, how the  changes in energetics and kinetic properties impact  microstructural evolution in ceramics.  These processes are  important in designing optimum microstructures for  properties.  ***",
