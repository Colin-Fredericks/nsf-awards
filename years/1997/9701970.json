 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Hawkins, James    The GARY INITIATIVE is a plan to improve the quality and  quantity of science and mathematics education received by  all students in Gary.  It brings together the Gary Community  School Corporation, five higher education institutions, the  business community, parents, and the Gary Accord.    The  Gary  Community  School Corporation is  a  minority-  majority urban system located in Gary, Indiana, a city of  116,500 persons. Gary  is  located  at the southern tip of  Lake  Michigan  and  is surrounded   by   resources  from  the  Indiana  Dunes   National Lakeshore,  steel mills, and  those of the greater  Chicago  area. Three  aspects of Gary  community demographics which are important in  this project  are ethnic composition of the community, the out migration  of  people, and the economics of the  Gary  community. The  population of Lake County is 32 percent African-American;  the school  population of Gary is approximately 96  percent  AfricanAmerican.    Gary  graduates  have  low SAT scores and test  below  state  and national norms in science and  mathematics.  This project is specifically intended  to  increase performances in science and mathematics.    This  comprehensive and systemic plan is a system-wide  initiative that  will impact all students.  The school  system currently  has 20,600  students  in 22 elementary  schools, 6 middle  schools,  6 high  schools,  an  alternative middle school, an adult  education center,  and  a  career center.  The plan supports  the  district  objectives to increase the number of minority students  enrolling in  and  successfully completing pre-college  courses  which  will lead   them   to  pursue  undergraduate  programs   in   Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and  Technology (SMET).    The objectives are:  1 .   To  align the PreK-12 science and mathematics     curricula  to national standards, state proficiencies and     competencies.  2. To   enhance  PreK-12  teachers'  knowledge  of  science     and mathematics and e nhance their use of instructional     strategies which insure student success.  3. To  increase to 30% the proportion of students who     enroll  in and successfully complete Algebra I by grade     B.  4. To  increase  to 50% the proportion of students who     currently enroll  in  and successfully complete three or     more  years  in both science and mathematics starting     with the gateway courses of Algebra I and Biology 1.  5. To increase the proportion of students who meet the     standards of the state proficiency tests.  6. To increase the proportion of students who meet national     norms on citywide subject specific tests in science and     mathematics.  7. To provide opportunities for student enrichment in     science and mathematics within and outside of the school     environment.  8. To establish a parent network which will facilitate a     partnership of parents, teachers, and students.  9.  To extend and enhance partnerships with community,  business, and educational agencies.    We will meet these objectives by:     Revising  the  PreK-1 2 science and mathematics     curricula  to meet  the  National Council of Teachers of     Mathematics  (NCTM) Standards,  National Science     Education Standards  (NSES),  and state proficiencies and     competencies.          Providing staff development to align instruction with  national  standards for teaching science and mathematics.  Implementing  instructional models in science and  mathematics that  incorporate unit planning, performance-based activities, assessment,  and cooperative learning.    Upgrading  PreK-12  science and mathematics  departments  with  equipment, materials, supplies, and other resources needed for  inquiry-based science and mathematics teaching.    Expanding  student enrichment activities, for  grades  PreK-12 for  after-school, weekend and summer programs such as science and  mathematics  clubs,  Family  Science/Math  Nights,   and academic  competitions.    Providing and strengthening partnerships and mentorsh ips  with  community, business, and education.    Providing  parent  and community networks  to  facilitate  the  objectives of this proposal.",
