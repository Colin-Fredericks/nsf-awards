 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9710297  Bai     The blind system identification is a variant of the ordinary system identification, in which the input signal to the system is unknown.  Despite its wide use in a host of communication and signal processing applications, there is a lack of understanding and efficient schemes .  Existing methods of blind system identification can be devided into two categories.   The first one assumes some statistical information, usually a whiteness condition, on the unknown input signal, and infeasible approach in many applications since inputs are unknown.  The second method is to use training signals and thus reduce the blind system identification to the ordinary system identification.  Although simple, this method significantly reduces the efficiency because training signals have sent again and again. For example, in the GSM standard for mobile communication, more than one quarter of the communication capability is used to send training signals instead of sending message signals.  This project intends to conduct a thorough study of the blind system identification problem based on our preliminary study in which a new scheme was developed.  To the best knowledge of the author, the scheme we propose is the first and in fact the only blind system identification scheme without requiring any a priori information on the unknown input.  The proposed research will build on our preliminary results and focus on some fundamental issues as well as on developing algorithms.  The expected strategies for conducting such a study are outlined in the proposal.",
