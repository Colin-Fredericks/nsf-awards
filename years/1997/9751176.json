 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enhances the plant biology curriculum by utilizing instruction that increases critical thinking skills.  The objectives of the project are to increase student quantitative skill levels, provide students with exposure to the process of science, increase the level of interest in plant biology, and allow more opportunities for student research projects.  These objectives can be met by utilizing modern scientific methodology and computer-assisted data analysis in Botany, Advanced Plant Biology, and Research Project courses.  The Plant Biology course enrolls a significant number of K-12 prospective teachers.       An ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometer with computer analysis software allows for examining absorption spectra of isolated plant pigment, direct measurement of enzymatic rates, and measurement of protein during column chromatography.  A photosynthesis package that includes a leaf chamber, oxygen sensor, data logger, and software allows for measurement of photosynthetic rate, light compensation point, light saturation curves, and photosynthetic action spectrum.  Mini SDSPAGE equipment allows for an examination of protein changes during stages of plant development.  A notebook computer allows for data collection from multiple instruments and use of the photosynthesis package in the greenhouse.  The scanner allows electrophoresis gels to be imaged so that protein bands can be quantified using public domain software.  The success of the project is based primarily on measurements of student performance and by student evaluations.   *",
