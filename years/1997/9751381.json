 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project implements a molecular genetics laboratory course.  A course addition of this type enriches the laboratory offerings in the Biology Department.  There are three primary goals to the project.  The first goal is to teach students the basic biological and biochemical principles underlying molecular genetic techniques.  The second goal is to give students practical experience in a variety of up-to-date molecular genetic techniques.  These techniques can be used to examine the genetics of Arabidopsis thaliana, a model research organism for the study of the molecular genetics of plant growth and development.  The third goal is to introduce the students to a sample of research programs that utilize molecular genetics and familiarize the students with careers in molecular genetics.  The first two goals can be accomplished through the use of lecture and laboratory sections.  The third goal of exposing students to graduate and career options can be accomplished through the current departmental seminar series, through which researchers in the field of molecular genetics are invited to campus to discuss their work.",
