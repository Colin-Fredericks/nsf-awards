 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701958  Goldberg    This experimental research project focuses on conducting systems  formed by the \"edge states\" that lie near the perimeter of quasi-  two dimensional electron gases in the quantum Hall effect (QHE).  Fundamentally new transport behavior is predicted for sample  geometries that bring multiple edge states into communication.  Two sample geometries will be employed in this project.  These  are a GaAs/AlGaAs superlattice pillar with edge states  communicating on a 2D surface sheath; and a gated GaAs/AlGaAs  heterojunction with edge states communicating across a long,  narrow \"line gate\" barrier.  Existing theoretical predictions in  these cases will be tested with measurements to be made using a  high-field (19Tesla), low temperature (20mK) apparatus on samples  fabricated from MBE-grown GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures.  It is  expected that the results will advance general understanding of  electronic transport in quasi-1D- and in anisotropic 3D-  materials.  %%%  This research program examines ways in which electrons interact  with each other to create ordered or collective structures.  In  many materials systems magnetism is driven by electronic  interactions and in many technologically important areas like  mass storage devices and computer memory, magnetism plays a  fundamental role.  Our program is an experimental effort to  develop and examine model systems of magnetism.  Only by using  very pure model systems can the electronic interaction effects be  isolated and studied.  Our preliminary results have shown that  when you have all electrons magnetically aligned, then forcing  one to flip its orientation cause all its neighbors and their  neighbors to turn to partially flip, creating a kind of swirl or  vortex.  These swirls of electrons, called Skyrmions, determine  the magnetic properties of the material.  To study Skyrmions, our  group has built collaborations with Lucent Technology, the Kepler  University in Austria, the Institute of High Pressure Physics in  Russia, and  the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in  Florida.  The group encompasses students from high-school summer  interns, to undergraduate and graduate students who will work  together using novel techniques of light transmission to \"see\"  these electron swirls and study their most fundamental  properties.  New microscopes are being developed, which will have  eventual application in biology and DNA sequencing, extending  beyond the materials science of this program.  New materials  systems combining silicon technology with optical properties will  be used, which again will have application in future generations  of optoelectronics.  ***",
