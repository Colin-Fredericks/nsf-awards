This is especially true for  surgery in the brain where it is important to preserve as much  healthy tissue as possible in the process of removing all of the  diseased matter.  Also, the boundary, which is irregularly  shaped, must be identified in three dimensions.  Surgeons  typically examine medical images from magnetic resonance (MR) and  computerized x-ray tomographic (CT) scanners to extract  diagnostic information for surgical procedures.  Currently  surgeons are forced to imagine the three-dimensional situation  for presurgery planning, something the human brain is not well  suited to performing in a precise and reproducible manner.  In  order to provide a complete engineering solution to this problem  using high performance computers, the following steps have to be  performed: (1) acquisition of data in a suitable geometric  raster; (2) generation of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions;  (3) registration of the 3D reconstructions to the patient on the  operating room table; and, (4) labeling of relevant tissue  structures in the data (segmentation).  The technology required  for achieving steps (1) - (3) is being developed outside of  medicine.  However, this is not true for segmentation, which is  the least advanced of the four steps; this investigation seeks to  develop core segmentation algorithms for solving the problem.    Work during this investigation is to concentrate on template-  based segmentation and operator-driven segmentation in  neurosurgical applications.  In template-based segmentation the  goal is to improve the ability to establish correspondence  structures automatically in cases with moderate pathology.  The  operator-based segmentation portion of the investigation would  develop a working platform for the integration of a volume editor  and a force feedback device needed for algorithmically more  complex projects such as segmentation in three-dimension s.  ***",
