 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ribet 9705376  This project is concerned with the interrelation between the geometry, the stratified geometry, the diophantine aspects, the modular and cohomology properties, and the combinatorial structure of the integral canonical models of Shimura varieties of preabelian type and of their special fibres.  New notions of Shimura s-crystals and Shimura Lie s-crystals will be used to attack the Langlands-Rapoport conjecture, as well as for understanding the Lie canonical stratification of the special fibres of these integral models.  The investigator will work on a better understanding of the geometry of integral models with the ultimate goal being a proof of the zeta function conjecture for Shimura varieties of preabelian type.  The Arakelov intersection theory will be used to study the Diophantine problems in integral models of Shimura varieties of preabelian type.  This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry, a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful having recently solved problems that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern computers and compact disks.",
