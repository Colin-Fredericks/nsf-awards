 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is funded through the Professional Opportunities for  Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program as a  Research/Educational Enhancement Project.    The investigator proposes a research and education plan that:  draws on the wealth of interdisciplinary applications of  statistics; contributes to advances in model selection and  resampling methodologies; and utilizes the new capabilities for  developing computing environments and courseware.  Statistical applications are making greater use of flexible,  computationally--intensive modeling procedures. As a result, the  issue of selecting appropriate models is an important one. The  investigator plans to extend methods of model selection to robust  regression, including least absolute deviation regression. These  alternatives to least squares regression are very popular when  the data come from heavy tailed distributions and when there are  outliers.    In the area of education, the investigator plans to integrate  statistical theory and practice in a way not commonly encountered  in undergraduate courses -- through in-depth case studies or  labs. The labs raise interesting scientific questions that  highlight the interdisciplinary framework in which statistics has  developed; they employ new statistical methodologies, such as  resampling methods and model selection techniques; and they are  to be presented in an interactive programming environment.    The investigator also plans to bring her technical skills in  high--dimensional modeling to bear on an area of statistical  application -- modeling growth of roots in the study of plants.  Biologists are interested in learning about the effects of  various environmental conditions on biosynthesis rates in growing  plant tissues.  Developing a model for the velocity of growth and  for the elemental growth rate using innovative nonparametric  methodology would be very helpful in analyzing experimental  outcomes.",
