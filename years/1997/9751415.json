 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1993, a new approach to introductory Cellular and Molecular Biology laboratories was initiated in the Department of Biology.  In 2-week modules, students learned assay methods, then designed and executed experiments.  This generated material for work on scientific communication skills, culminating in either research poster sessions or papers in the style of the primapy research literature.  The opportunity to design and test their own hypotheses generated considerable enthusiasm among biology majors for open-ended investigation.  This has been evidenced by above-capacity enrollment pressures in related courses and increased student research production, particularly in cell biology and in immunology.    Interest and enrollment in these courses has continually increased, challenging faculty to create laboratory experiences that take students to a higher level of independence, and straining the limits of departmental space and available equipment.  A new science building  offers an opportunity to expand independent investigation within these courses.    This project creates a cell culture facility in the new instructional laboratory space for Cell Biology and Immunology and equips it for microspectrophotometry, thermal cycling, and computer analysis.  New laboratory experiences at the junior and senior level involve more students, working in small groups, in increasingly sophisticated and up-to-date preparation.  Cell Biology is a prerequisite for Immunology; changes in the laboratory curriculum are designed to improve this linkage as students develop laboratory investigation skills.  An emphasis on cell culture and cellular /molecular techniques is expected to reduce the need for vertebrate animal experiments in Immunology.  The improvements to instructional laboratory facilities also has significant benefits for student research involving cell culture, including a special January-term Introduction to Biological Research, which targets beginning biology majors for hands-on research experiences.   *",
