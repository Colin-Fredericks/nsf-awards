 "awd_abstract_narration": "9711793  Lopez        Deposit  feeders  play several important roles  in  determining  whether  organic  material  is demineralized  or  buried.   These  animals function to make surfaces available for microbial  growth  and  move  particles both horizontally and vertically within  the  seabed  at  a  pace that far exceeds sedimentation.  The  central  problem  in  understanding deposit feeders  is  to  identify  the  materials that they utilize and to determine the sources of those  materials.  The interdisciplinary approach of this project is  to  combine  a chemical reactor theory of digestion with measurements  of   the  processing  of  enzymatically  available  amino  acids,  focusing on rates of hydrolysis in, and absorption from, the gut.  In  vitro  and in vivo fluorometric methods will be developed  to  assay enzyme activity in the guts of small deposit feeders; these  methods  that will be applicable to planktonic animals  as  well.  Chemical  analyses and deposit-feeder bioassays will be conducted  to  test whether methionine or other essential amino acids become  more  limiting  in  laboratory simulations of diagenesis.   In  a  shallow   subtidal  site  the  hypothesis  that  the  holothuroid  Parastichopus californicus is limited to feeding during times  of  relatively  high methionine concentration will be tested.   At  a  200-m  site  the  hypothesis that the burrowing urchin  Brisaster  latifrons  will  show greater hydrolytic and absorptive  capacity  for amino acids after the spring bloom than during winter will be  tested.",
