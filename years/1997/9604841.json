 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604841  Koenig    The proposed study centers on novel, specialized domains  located at  intermittent intervals in the outer boundary of axons,  called  \"periaxoplasmic plaques.\" The plaques were discovered in  isolated axoplasm  from the Mauthner neuron located in the goldfish central  nervous system,  and their presence has now been confirmed in axons of rabbit  spinal nerve  roots; therefore, they are likely to be specializations  common to long  axons in general. Identification of ribosomes in plaque  domains suggests  that the latter are potential local centers of protein  synthesis concerned  with local turnover of axoplasmic proteins. This premise is  a significant  departure from prevailing views on how the axon's vitality  and mass are  maintained in a steady state. One major experimental aim is  to analyze the  principal structural components located within plaque  domains of goldfish  and rabbit axons at an electron microscopic level in order  to define the  spatial organization of the plaque domain, and to  characterize common  features and distinctive differences between older and more  recently  evolved vertebrate axons. Another major experimental aim is  to test the  hypothesis that plaque domains represent local centers of  protein  synthesis, and are targeted endstations for RNA trafficking  from the  neuronal cell body. For this purpose, immunostaining, and  molecular  biological techniques will be used to evaluate localization  in relationship  to plaque domains in goldfish and rabbit axons of elongation  factor 1a, an  essential cofactor of protein synthesis, and localization of  messenger RNA  that codes for specific gene products, respectively. Labeled  RNA constructs  will also be microinjectied into the Mauthner cell to  evaluate targeting  and transport of RNA to plaque domains from the cell body.  Finally, sites  of de novo protein synthesis, assayed by metabolic  radiolabeling in  goldfish and rabbit axons, will also be evaluated by  autoradiography in  order to determ ine the spatial relationship between the  localization of  nascent peptide chains to plaque domains. Information from  the proposed  study should contribute to a greatly improved understanding  of how  axoplasmic proteins, and vitality of long axons are  maintained on a long  term basis.",
