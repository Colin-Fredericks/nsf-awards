 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722828  Aggressive Chemical Mimicry of Prey Pheromones  Evolutionary specialization of a predator on a few prey  species has potential advantages and disadvantages.  Such a predator can evolve to become highly efficient  at finding, handling, and utilizing its prey, but the  predator becomes dependent on availability of these  particular prey, which could be costly in years of prey  scarcity. The bolas spider Mastophora hutchinsoni is an  extremely specialized predator. The adult female emits  chemical attractants that mimic the sex pheromones of  its moth prey, a form of aggressive chemical mimicry.  The spider exploits the inherent mate-finding behavior  of its victims, which are male moths. When prey  approach the spider, it strikes them with a sticky ball  at the end of a short thread. This capture device,  called a bolas, represents a highly reduced web that  the spider swings with one of its forelegs. Two moth  species, one active early at night and the other late  at night, account for more than 90% of this predator's  prey; only two other moth species are ever captured. To  attract mates, female moths of the two principal prey  species release blends of chemical compounds that do  not overlap in their components. The spider could  produce a master blend of all these components, but  preliminary results indicate this would make the  attractant much less efficient in luring one of the  spider's two principal prey species. If the spider  could adjust its attractant blend to predictable and  unpredictable variation in prey abundance, it would be  a much more efficient predator and could minimize a  major disadvantage of prey specialization. In this  research, we propose to use a combination of chemical,  electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches to  determine if this bolas spider shows flexibility in its  behavior or mimetic signal to improve its hunting  effectiveness. Specific questions to be addressed  include the following: (1) Does the spider's emitted  signal change over the cou rse of a night to correspond  with the predictably different diel patterns of sexual  activity of its principal prey species? (2) Does the  emitted signal vary seasonally to correspond with  predictable changes in abundance of its prey species?  (3) Do hunting tactics and the emitted signal vary  plastically with unpredictable prey availability?  Studies of this system will lead to an understanding of  tradeoffs involved in the evolution of exploitaiton of  chemical communication and the role of behavioral  plasticity in minimizing the costs of specialization.",
