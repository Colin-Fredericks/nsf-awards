This capacity for simultaneously retaining and importing information must be achieved by networks of neurons, especially in the cerebral cortex.  Much of cortex consists of defined areas devoted to one or more of the senses such as touch, and each of these areas represents a topographic map of a sensory surface such as the skin.  Dr. McCasland's research uses new anatomical and computer-imaging techniques to study a well-known model of such topographic maps -- the portion of rodent somatosensory cortex representing the invariant array of large whiskers on the face.  Using this model, his group has shown that a much larger area of adult cortex than normal is driven by a few spared whiskers when all other whiskers are repeatedly trimmed.  Such large-scale changes imply robust shifts in the activation of individual neurons and therefore of the operation of local cortical circuitry.  Because the same circuits are critical for the rodent's exquisitely precise discrimination of tactile cues, these results provide a powerful model of how brain circuits can both perform precisely and remain adaptive.   This project studies potential mechanisms underlying the demonstrated large-scale neuronal plasticity.  Studies will focus on the interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons within local circuits, and on the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in such interactions. NMDA receptors are found on both excitatory and inhibitory neurons and have been implicated in several forms of neuronal plasticity.  Subtle changes in the strength of inhibition within local cortical circuits have dramatic effects on the selection of sensory inputs.  Thus, neural inhibition may represent an important control point for cortical plasticity.  Yet little is known of the behavior of inhibitory neurons during adaptation, or of the relati onship between neural inhibition and the activation of NMDA receptors.  Dr. McCasland's methods are uniquely suited to systematic, cell-by-cell measures of activation in identified excitatory and inhibitory neurons.  The project will test whether neural inhibition declines in early stages of adult plasticity, then increases as new activation patterns emerge.  Blockade of NMDA receptors will show whether these receptors are necessary for either the measured changes in excitation and inhibition and/or for the neural plasticity itself.  The results will provide a unique assessment of the relative roles of excitation, inhibition, and NMDA receptors in adult cortical plasticity.",
