 "awd_abstract_narration": "Networks of workstations (NOWs) are becoming increasingly  popular for providing cost-effective and affordable parallel  computing.  However, the LAN environments are gradually  becoming heterogeneous due to the commodity nature of  workstations and networking equipment.  Such heterogeneity  gets reflected in terms of communication capabilities of  nodes (processor speed, memory speed, network interface  support) and network architectures (different interconnects  with varying topology and connectivity).  This is  forcing NOW environments to be gradually redefined as  `Heterogeneous Networks of Workstations' (HNOWs). This  research is targeted towards providing fast and scaleable  collective communication support for such emerging HNOWs.  The following problems are being addressed by this project:  1) quantitatively specifying the heterogeneous  characteristics of a HNOW environment and studying their  impact on the performance of current implementations of  collective communication operations; 2) designing and  developing optimal algorithms for collective communication  operations by considering major heterogeneous  characteristics; and 3) studying the performance gains  achieved by the optimal algorithms for different suites  and HNOW environments.  An experimental HNOW testbed  consisting of a set of workstations with different speeds  and different interconnect types (Fast Ethernet, ATM, and  Myrinet) is planned to be used together with theoretical,  analytical, and simulation approaches to develop and  validate the new research results.",
