 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ludden  9722917  The Eleventh International Congress on Nitrogen Fixation will be held in Paris, France, July 20-25, 1997. Nitrogen fixation is one of the most important subject areas relating to the support of life on earth and encompasses concerns related to natural resource conservation, particularly fossil fuels, plant-microbe signaling and interaction, regulatory mechanisms, nutrition, food production, etc. This congress is of great importance for this scientific field. Scientists from over 30 different countries are expected to attend. The topics to be discussed will cover virtually all aspects of biological and non-biological nitrogen fixation and will include the following major topics:  1) chemistry and biochemistry of nitrogen fixation;  2) genetics and regulation of nitrogen fixation and assimilation; 3) rhizobial and actinorhizal symbiosis;  4) environmental and physiological factors controlling nitrogen fixation;  5) nitrogen fixation by bacteria in association with grasses;  6)  nitrogen fixation in forests;  7)  sustainable agriculture and nitrogen fixation;  8)  genetics of legumes and symbiotic organisms;  9)  taxonomy and phylogeny of diazotrophs;  10)  nitrogen fixation by photosynthetic bacteria and cyanobacteria;  11)  carbon metabolism of nitrogen-fixing organisms;  and 12)  nitrogen fixation and environmental stresses.    This grant will be used to provide travel funds for U.S. graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other more junior scientists.   All recipients will present their work at the meeting.",
