 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Physics at Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) has historically placed great emphasis upon undergraduate teaching and the education of teachers.  In addition to the standard curriculum for these students, many faculty members have individually used research as a tool to broaden and enhance the educational process.  The Physics department is committed to providing a strong applied research experience for students and has done so by  involving undergraduate and graduate students in research activities.  In the Fall of 1991, the department implemented the undergraduate Applied Physics program, and when coupled with the masters program, students have many opportunities to participate in science.  To sustain this momentum, and ensure that research remains an integral part of the undergraduate experience, the National Science Foundation and IUP will provide funds to renovate a central laboratory and support facility in Weyandt Hall.  Constructed in 1965, this space is used to house investigations involving experimental nuclear and solid state physics, and is used for sample preparation in the study of electrical properties of semiconductor materials and the effects of ion bombardment damage on such materials.    Renovations will encompass modifying rooms into four separate spaces to create a non-classified clean room, a clean area, and mechanical room, and a room for maintenance and storage.  The clean areas will be used for the purpose of sample and test device fabrications associated with semiconductor material research.  Seven of nine research faculty members and their students will benefit from the renovations which will provide a state of the art clean room,  and a stimulating environment to work and learn.  It is anticipated that this project will aid in the recruitment of highly qualified students and help enhance the overall diversity of the department.",
