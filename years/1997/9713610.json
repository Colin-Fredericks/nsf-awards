 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for support of a cooperative project by Dr. Mansour Mohamed, Department of  Textile Engineering, Chemistry, and Science at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC, and Dr. Ali Hebeish, at the National Research Center (NRC) in Cairo, Egypt.  The objective of this joint research is to study ways to improve sizing agents and procedures for cotton and PES/cotton fiber materials.   The NRC staff will work with modifications of locally available starches.  Acrylic acid, alone or admixture with other vinyl monomers will be used as the polymerizable components of the composite.  The properties of the composites will be investigated, including film-forming, rheology, solubility, as well as its amenability to sizing, weaving, desizing, and reclamation.  By controlling the composite components and molecular size and substituents of starch, composites with pre-determined properties will be developed.   The NCSU team will test the NRC-produced sizing agents, as well as the resulting yarn quality.  They will also test these size formulations for their use in conventional and high speed weaving machines.  Scope:  This research project will involve two experienced researchers from well respected institutes for textile research, and with complementary expertise and facilities.  Finding optimum sizing materials that can be reclaimed and reused will address a major problem for a large industry in both countries, and would have special environmental impact on countries where textile industries are a major polluters.  Egypt and several other developing countries rely extensively on their textile industries, and yet these are some of the most polluting industries for the water available for human use.  The collaborating scientists plan to conduct chemical synthesis of new polymeric sizes in the laboratory, and to test them in the laboratory for their effectiveness and ability to be recycled.  They plan to scale the studies to actual manufacturing conditions.  This proposal meets INT objective of supporting U.S.-foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.",
