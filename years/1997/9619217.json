 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619217  Hare   The project goals are:  (1) to create permanent changes in the SEM climates for students, both in the school district and in the preparation of teachers at our university; (2) to create hands-on learning opportunities in SEM at the Children's Museum and to showcase girls and women as the teachers/leaders in presenting these exhibits; (3) to empower participants to make a difference in protecting our environment, and (4) to create awareness in parents and teachers to make a difference in the ways we are raising and motivating our daughters in SEM.   A collaboration between a university, large public school district, and a museum in an area that has been heavily rural and is suddenly turning into a major tourist attraction provides many opportunities for unique and innovative aspects.  The opportunity to work with elementary and middle school girls and teachers for the past year in a NSF model project has motivated this more comprehensive effort with the expectation of long-term infrastructure change, both within the public schools and within teacher education and parenting.",
