 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to expand and modernize the laboratory exercises in the Mechanical Engineering Technology course in Physical Measurements.  The course has been predominantly lecture (42 out of 60 hours).  Although the course material deals with more than 50 types of sensors, laboratory experiments allow practice with only 12 sensors, and data are taken manually, giving students no experience with computer data acquisition.    The objectives of this project are to acquire a larger number of sensors for use in additional exercises, so students gain practical experience and familiarity with the sensors; to include modern computerized data acquisition equipment and techniques; and to shift the course emphasis as much as possible from passive lecture experience to active experimental experience, while using the strengths of multidisciplinary teams of Electrical Engineering Technology students and Mechanical Engineering Technology students to broaden the knowledge of students from each discipline.    Articles resulting from this laboratory development can aid other similar programs in choosing laboratory equipment for such upgrades and justify and promote the use of active, versus passive, learning, particularly with multidisciplinary teams.  *",
