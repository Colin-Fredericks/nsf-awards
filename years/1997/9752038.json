 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating several integrated mathematics/physics projects that are (1) strengthening the student's skills at applying mathematical concepts and (2) better preparing students for a highly technical workplace.  These classroom projects use physics concepts to motivate the study of mathematical concepts.  The mathematics is immediately applied to revisit the physics concept and serves to uncover the physics.    Both the physics and mathematics community are calling for the pedagogy used in classrooms to reflect current knowledge about how students learn as well as to reflect the technology available.  The projects serves to produce a student-centered classroom where students are expected to take on the responsibility for learning using the instructor as one of the resources.  Technology (CBLs and MBLs) is being utilized to collect data with spreadsheets and graphing calculators used as tools to organize and analyze data.  Students are developing the skills that are necessary to work collaboratively (e.g., the ability to utilize the resources of each team member, the ability to express oneself clearly, and the ability to be sensitive to the individual needs while still requiring a final product) as well as the skills that are necessary for them to work independently (i.e., the ability to read critically, the ability to develop a process and a plan of action, and the ability to find resources as needed). Communication skills are being developed as the solicit-confront-resolve model is used extensively.                These projects demonstrate that an integrated approach to mathematics and physics helps students by providing them with a better understanding of the physics, and with the ability to apply the mathematics.  The projects are being disseminated at state and national meetings of physics and mathematics professional organizations, and by publishing the projects as a collection.",
