The IMS is also the major international symposium in the microwave field and a focus of research results in wireless communications.  Each year the MTT-S promotes students education in microwave theory and techniques through a number of mechanisms.  One of the most important is the Student Paper Competition at the IMS.  This is a selective program which brings the world's best students together in an integrated program in which they present their work not only to a technical audience but again to a group of judges.  The program helps to develop the student's technical acumen, introduces them to the international research community and helps to build a community of students who will lead the next generation of microwave engineers.    The Student Paper Competition Program is open to any full-time student, typically, although not necessarily, a graduate student.  First author student papers are judged by the Technical Program Committee along with regular submissions, using the same standards. These are presented in regularly scheduled oral or poster sessions for optimum dissemination to the research community, followed by a separate presentation before a panel of judges. Each winner will receive a certificate and a cash prize provided by MTT-S.  First, Second, and Third Place winners will be selected.  Due to the high standards of this conference, winning such a prize can have a real and highly beneficial impact in a student's career.",
