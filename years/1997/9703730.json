 "awd_abstract_narration": "The detection of signals in noise is a critical task for a number of practical  signal processing and communication systems.  The performance gains that can be  achieved by using observations taken at multiple sensors are well known.   However, generally is too costly to transmit all the data generated by each  sensor to some central location to use in making a signal detection decision.   It is therefore of great interest to study distributed detection schemes, which  provide acceptable performance while requiring only limited transmissions.   Research on distributed signal detection schemes for cases with dependent  observations has been lacking.  The goal of this project is to develop the  foundation of a theory for understanding distributed detection schemes for cases  with dependent observations from sensor to sensor.  The theory will predict when  the optimum distributed processing schemes will be different from the optimum  isolated sensor processing schemes.  The theory will also explain why this  occurs.    The approach draws heavily on weak-signal results we have already developed and  on recent preliminary results.  Specifically, we are attempting to represent the  optimum sensor processing in terms of known functions and unknown constants, as  we have done in the  weak signal cases.  Using such a representation should allow  one to determine when the optimum isolated sensor processings will be optimum and  to explain why the optimum isolated sensor processings are not optimum in some  cases.  While the focus is on developing much needed theory, the results will be  immediately useful in many applications.  Furthermore, some emphasis is being  devoted to developing design algorithms and to the study of nonparametric  distributed detection schemes for cases with uncertain statistical models.  Such  studies will produce tools and techniques for pressing practical problems.",
