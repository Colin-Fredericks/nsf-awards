Dr. Crain will work with Kiyoshi Igarashi,  Director of the Upper Atmosphere Section, Space Science  Division, on a research project entitled \"Electro-dynamic  Processes of the Equatorial and Mid-Latitude Ionosphere in  the Pacific Region.\"    The PREASA (Pacific Region Equatorial Anomaly Studies in  Asia) initiative is a multi-site, multi-instrumented, multi-  year campaign to observe the dynamics and the electro-  dynamics of the Equatorial regions of the ionosphere and  test established theories on the relevant processes involved  in determining motions and irregularity development.  The  research will allow observations that are unique in their  location and their methodology and, thus, will allow the  creation of databases of the ionosphere and upper atmosphere  that are especially useful.  The primary goal of the  research is to integrate the growing PREASA observational  database into a comprehensive model of the electrodynamics  (Ionospheric Motions) and Ionization Distribution throughout  the Pacific Longitude region.  It is anticipated that such a  model will aid in the development of a regional capability  to predict Ionosphere electrodynamics and Irregularities  which effect radio and HF propagation.  These models will  also aid in the analysis of future PREASA databases and help  understand the general mechanisms responsible for Low and  Mid-Latitude irregularities throughout the world.  ***",
