 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is improving the pedagogy of a recently introduced, cross-disciplinary, two-semester course sequence called Science and Our Global Heritage I and II, which is required of all sophomores at the college.    Previously in the course, the department has been limited to performing experiments in physics, chemistry, biology, environmental science, and sociology, which are often difficult to extrapolate to the global arena a meaningful way because of the time necessary to perform extensive data analysis and real-world modeling.    With the introduction of computers into the laboratory, students can extend their understanding of real-world global problems in a meaningful way by implementing simulations and complex modeling. In addition, the introduction of the computers facilitates quick, accurate graphical presentation of data for data analysis and mathematical curve fitting.    The objectives of the project include (1) allowing students to manage and manipulate data quickly so that they can focus on the discovery process underlying scientific concepts; (2) allowing students to investigate how topics being investigated in the laboratory can be applied to investigate global concerns; (3) improving the ability of small groups of students to investigate the application of the science process to the problems of society; and (4) producing a CD ROM as an aid to the teaching of the science component and to facilitate the dissemination of the course material.    The department is equipping each of three laboratories with eight multimedia PCs to be used interactively by small student groups for data collection, analysis, modeling, and acquisition of descriptive material regarding the laboratory topic. In addition, CD writing equipment is being installed to facilitate the production of a CD ROM, and three laptops with projection equipment are being provided for laboratory instructors' use.  *",
