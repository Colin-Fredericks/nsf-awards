 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most instructors of college and university physics courses would agree that the purpose of the laboratory is to provide a chance for students to grapple with the phenomena, see the concepts in action, learn to use equipment, and develop experience with the craft of experimental physics.  Traditional labs, mainly devoted to taking and analyzing data, usually giving step-by-step, or \"cookbook\" procedures, are mainly ineffectual in achieving these goals.    The laboratory is an important part of a thorough change in the way we at the University of Michigan-Dearborn are teaching introductory physics courses.  We emphasize student engagement with material in lecture, collaborative group problem solving, and concepts rather than calculations.  Over the past two years we have successfully replaced labs in the first term of the two-term calculus-based sequence with ones that encourage students to grapple with concepts and to solve real-life problems in the lab.  The labs use computers to collect data using a great variety of sensors.  They also support digital video analysis of two-dimensional motion and simulation programs as appropriate.  We now propose to extend this reform in three directions.  First, to create more appropriate labs for students in the algebra-based course taken mainly by students going into the health professions.  Second, to complete the changes in the labs accompanying the second term course on electricity, magnetism, and optics.  Third, to develop computer-based training modules that will provide individualized instruction for students in the operation of computer data collection and analysis programs.  All students who take physics, whether from engineering, the sciences, or mathematics, will benefit from these changes.    Most laboratory development projects have concentrated on giving students experiences that develop their conceptual understanding.  The laboratory exercises we develop that also include the solution of experiment problems will be disseminated through presenta tions, publications, and workshops.  *",
