 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor William H.   Saunders, Jr., of the Department of Chemistry at the University of   Rochester, is carrying out quantum chemical calculations on elimination   and proton transfer reactions.  Calculations on fluorine-substituted   carbanions permit the assessment of the role of negative ion   hyperconjugation, and studies of elimination reactions of   fluorohydrocarbons address the borderline between E1cb and E2 reaction   pathways.  Factors governing the orientation and stereochemistry of   concerted elimination reactions are examined through consideration of   charge distributions, isotope effects, and ion pairing.  Particular   attention is placed on developing an understanding of the syn-anti   dichotomy, wherein cis olefins are produced by anti elimination but trans   olefins are produced by syn elimination.  Among the superficially simplest chemical reactions are those involving   the transfer of a single positively-charged hydrogen atom (a proton) from   one place in a molecule to another.  Despite the apparent simplicity of   such reactions, however, experimental results indicate appreciable   complexity.  Through the application of calculational techniques and with   the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor William H.   Saunders, Jr., of the Department of Chemistry at the University of   Rochester, is exploring the fundamental aspects of proton transfer   reactions.  His studies also extend to the analysis of reactions   initiated by the loss of a proton, focusing in particular on whether the   overall reaction path for such reactions involves simultaneous   elimination of an additional group or if such elimination occurs   subsequently to the initial proton loss.  These issues are central to an   extraordinarily wide variety of chemical reactions, and Professor   Saunders' studies are leading to a fundamental understanding of the   factors controlling them.",
