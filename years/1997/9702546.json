 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702546  Weihs    This CAREER grant explores a relatively new phenomena in  nanoscale multilayer materials:  self-propagating,  exothermic reactions.  Using  free-standing multilayer foils  that are sputter deposited, the velocities and temperatures  of the self-propagating reactions are quantified using  optical techniques.  The thermodynamic driving forces are  measured using calorimetry techniques, and resulting  microstructures identified using electron microscopy and X-  ray diffraction.  The impact of structural and physical  parameters on the ignition, velocity, and temperature of the  reactions are investigated, and the resulting information  used to develop models that aid in understanding the  reactions and in predicting material properties.  The  educational program is designed to strengthen  the materials  science education infrastructure by developing a national  database for classroom demonstrations.  This educational  program provides the design of a National Data Base for  Classroom Demonstrations in Materials Science.  The database  could be linked to NSF's home page to permit quick access to  ideas, instructions, and information for classroom  demonstrations.  It could include descriptions, pictures and  videos of exciting new demonstrations in materials science.  %%%  Novel exothermic reactions have been demonstrated in thick,  free-standing multilayer foils.  They ignite at room  temperatures with a simple spark, travel at speeds greater  than 10m/s, and reach temperatures above 1500 C.  As free-  standing foils they offer the ability to generate heat  rapidly and locally, providing new opportunities for joining  materials.  ***",
