 "awd_abstract_narration": "Logan  9708421       The principal investigators and their colleagues undertake a  systematic study of nonlinear phenomena in the transport of  bacterial and other colloidal substances through domains of  variable porosity.  They assume that the porosity is a function  of the colloid concentration, which places a nonlinearity in the  time-derivative term of the resulting  reaction-diffusion-convection equations that govern the flow.  The investigators address issues of well-posedness and  qualitative behavior for some of these types of biofilm problems,  using techniques such as energy arguments and semigroup analysis.  They also study the existence of traveling wavefronts in these  systems using dynamical systems methods.  A significant part of  their effort is to interact with colleagues in the geosciences in  order to be certain that the models they study are physically  well-founded.       The presence of colloids, of which some bacterial substances  are examples, in subsurface aquifer systems can have a profound  effect on the transport of contaminants.  For example,  hydrocarbons can form a substrate for microbial growth which can  then result in the formation of a biofilm on the solid surfaces  of the aquifer.  The behavior of biofilms in important in the  mining industry for the leaching of metals from ores, in the  petroleum industry for the control of biofilm accumulation to  prevent plugging in oil recovery, and especially in the  environmental water resources area for in-situ bioremediation.  It  has been demonstrated experimentally that the presence of  bacterial substances can enhance the transport of harmful  chemicals, like DDT, through the soil; in other cases, biofilms  can form barriers that block the transport of such contaminants.  The investigators study mathematical equations that model the  interaction of contaminants and colloidal particles and the  effects of these interactions on the flow characteristics of  subsurface domains.  One goal is to understand, through exami ming  the validity of various models, how different mechanisms affect  the hydrodynamic flow.",
