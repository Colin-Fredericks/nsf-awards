Astonishingly violent \"fish wars\" have  erupted,  leaving cooperative arrangements  in  disarray,   fishing communities economically  depressed, and fish stocks at risk of collapse.  This project  is  designed to reexamine, in the  light of  modern  game-theoretic  concepts,  the  core reasons for  this  instability  of  cooperative   management,  and  to  identify  new  institutional arrangements which might prove to  be more stable.        The work proposed involves formulation and  analysis of game-theoretic models of a bi-  national jointly managed ``shared'' fishery,  where the stocks are harvested sequentially as  they migrate across national boundaries.  The  models are necessarily dynamic, since strategic  interactions are conditioned by past performance,  as well as by projected future circumstances.  Emphasis is placed on pervasive uncertainty and  the role of incomplete information that is common  in decision making. Specific issues to be studied  are:       1)institutional incentives which have led to  over-investment in fleets and processing  facilities;         2) tradeoffs between long term goals of  conservation and sustainability and short term  goals of socioeconomic stability;         3) strategic interactions, conditioned by  the particular ecological structure of the  ecological community of harvested fish species;  and              4) the design of institutional arrangements  which can promote stable cooperative joint  management of a marine fishery in uncertain and  unanticipated circumstances.        Funding for this project is provided by the  programs of Computational Mathematics, Applied  Mathematics, and the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities in MPS, and by the Computational  Biology Activity in BIO.",
