 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702588  Peeples  This Career Proposal describes research and educational  plans that will enhance the skills of engineering students  to work on interdisciplinary programs at the interface of  engineering and the life sciences.  The research area  involves mechanisms of stability used by thermophiles to  stabilize proteins and lipids to heat and acidity.  The  production of heat shock proteins and the rigidifying of the  membrane lipid molecules are two such stabilizing  mechanisms.  The stabilizing mechanism will be investigated  by using electron spin resonance on appropriately labeled  portions of the membrane molecules.  Once the stabilizing  mechanisms have been identified, attempts will be made to  extend these mechanisms to enzymes outside of their natural  environments, i.e., for use in biocatalysis.  Stabilized  proteoliposomes will be synthesized and tested to determine  their stability.  The educational goals will be achieved by  a variety of methods including: use of campus resources such  as the interdisciplinary Biocatalysis and Bioprocessing  Program; use of group problem and design situations,  specific courses, and a mentoring program to increase  diversity and the utilization of underrepresented groups.  ***",
