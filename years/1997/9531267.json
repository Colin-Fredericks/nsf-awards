 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9531267  Vladimir Polyshchuk    This Phase II Small Business Innovation Research project aims at the development and construction of a health monitoring system for high speed rotating machinery.  Phase II will be involved in the development of the overall procedure, experimental verification and certification of the developed system, and the construction of the prototype machine health monitoring system for field application.  The work will be carried out in three simultaneous tasks:    1.  The development of a comprehensive procedure for machine health monitoring which includes (i) identification- to identify damage and wear, (ii) quantification- to evaluate the level of damage, and (iii) prognostication- to predict remaining life of the damaged component.     2.  The development of experimental studies for verification and certification of the developed software package.  Three major experimental developments will be carried out consisting of (i) two fully instrumented rotating machinery teat rigs set up by B&C EA, Inc., (ii) a fully instrumented bearing test rig developed by the Timkin Bearing Company, and (iii) an industrial pump tested by the Duririon Pump Company.  3.  The development of hardware and software for the data acquisition, data storage, and signal processing for field data by the Quatech Company.  Three different systems will be developed:  (i) the Portable Monitoring System- instrumented only with 'dumb sensors' for data acquisition , (ii) the Continuous Storage System- continuous scheduled monitoring, and (iii) the SCAN (Smart Centralized Automated Networking) System- multi-channel wireless networking with a receiving station.    Two main commercial applications are: i) An on-board machine health monitoring system that will enable automatic control/shutdown of the machinery for event management (for safety measures and prolongation of machine life), and ii) a plug-in type machine health monitoring system for recording performance history during regular maintenance (for d etermining operational safety without shutdown or disassembly of the machine) e.g. in defense industries- jet engines, helicopters, and land vehicles and   in commercial industries- petrochemical, power generation.  ***",
