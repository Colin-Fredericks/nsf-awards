 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  goal  of  this research is to develop  algorithms  that  simultaneously separate, localize, and track multiple moving  acoustic  sources.  Most human beings have  the  ability  to  close  their  eyes while in a room with a half dozen  people  talking and separate out the various strands of conversation  while physically localizing the speakers.  This is something  computers cannot yet do: it is easy to scatter a half  dozen  microphones  about  a  table around which  many  people  are  speaking,  but  standard algorithms cannot use  the  signals  from those microphones to separate, localize, and track  the  speakers.   This project is exploring algorithms to  perform  simultaneous  acoustic source separation, localization,  and  deconvolution,   using   modular  architectures.   Different  modules encapsulate different pieces of knowledge: what  the  acoustics  of  a room can do to a sound, what  human  speech  sounds like, what it means for sources to be separated,  how  sources  tend  to  move about in space.   The  knowledge  is  combined  in probabilistic framework, yielding estimates  of  the  separated  source  waveforms  and  physical  locations.  These algorithms have the potential to improve devices  like  speaker   phones,  cellular  telephones,  stereos,  computer  speech  recognition  systems, burglar  alarms,  and  hearing  aids.",
