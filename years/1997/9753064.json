Rutgers University    POWRE: Geometric Computation and Applications    Computational geometry deals with algorithmic aspects of geometric   problems. The problems studied have often been abstracted from real life   applications, but these abstractions are frequently so far removed from the   original problem that the solutions cannot possibly impact real-life calculations.  Furthermore, the original problems may be so complicated that the state-of-the-art techniques in theoretical computational geometry are insufficient to provide major breakthroughs in the application area.   Finally, collaborations between theoretical computational geometers and   researchers with geometric applications are impeded by differences in training and in vocabulary.  While devoting again full energies to research after several years of academic administration, the PI proposes exploratory work in how to conduct research in theoretical computational geometry, to be valued by that community, while maintaining real collaborations with applied scientists and demonstrably impacting the applied field as well. The particular application areas selected are wireless communications and cartography.",
