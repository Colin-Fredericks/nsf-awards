 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, having long-term technological relevance, is  supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, and  focusses on the study of heterogeneous reaction dynamics.   Professor Andrew B. Bocarsly and his students at Princeton  University will use molecular beams, surface spectroscopic and  microscopic methods, and flow reactor studies to characterize the  reactions so that models for these processes can be developed.   Catalytic decomposition and oxidation reactions will be studied in  detail.  Many technologically important processes occur between gas and  liquid phase reactants and solid surfaces.  These heterogeneous  reactions can increase the efficiency of important industrial  processes and be used to limit amounts of undesirable constituents  present in effluents from many common processes.  Professor  Bocarsly and his students at Princeton University will study  reactions involving carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides as well as  processes for preparing solid surfaces that have desired catalytic  properties.",
