 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703003  Clayton    Dale Clayton of the University of Utah will carry out research designed to elucidate factors responsible for differences in the specificity of parasites to one or more kinds of hosts.  Specifically, Clayton will first reconstruct molecular genealogies of a group of New World doves and of two groups of ectoparasitic feather lice.  One of the louse groups is found on wings and is not specific as to host species. Whereas the other group is found on the abdomen and is host-specific.  The genealogical analysis will permit identification of instances where lice have switched from one host to another and provide clues to macroevolutionary events involved in host-parasite association.  Microevolutionary events will be assessed via a series of experiments in a \"dove-dome\" (Tracy Aviary in Salt Lake City, UT) where Clayton will be able to carry out controlled experiments to examine factors such as (i) lice dispersal capability, (ii) differential lice vulnerability to host defenses, and (iii) different intensities of interspecific competition. The project will be incorporated into courseware taught by the PI, and collaboration has been established with Tracy Aviary for research and education.  Interpretive signs will be displayed and a public computer display will be established to explain the research in progress.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved extensively in the project.",
