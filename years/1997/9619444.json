 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Salah et al    The Massachusetts Institute of Technology will host eight students  annually at its Haystack Observatory to provide research experiences  for undergraduates. The Haystack Observatory is a multi-disciplinary  research center dedicated to radio astronomical research, using its  37-m diameter telescope.  The facility is also used for studies of the  earth's upper atmosphere by taking advantage of  its 46-meter and  67-meter high power radars and available optical facilities.  The  students will be involved in the acquisition of data using the  instrumentation, carrying out the analysis and interpretation of the  measurements, as well as the development of hardware and software to  improve the capabilities of the facility. Astronomical studies will  involve the characterization of galactic radio emission sources and  star formation investigations.  Atmospheric studies will emphasize the  effects of geomagnetic storms on the structure and dynamics of the  earth's atmosphere, spectral studies of periodic variations observed in  the upper atmosphere, and radio propagation effects.  Technical  projects include the digital design of signal processing systems, tests  of advanced recording heads, and development of realtime control  software.  The students will work closely with a staff mentor  throughout the summer, and will prepare a report and presentation on  their projects.  The presentations will be given at national  conferences, and opportunities will be provided to continue some of the  projects during the academic year.  The students will be exposed to all  aspects of the research facility through seminars and demonstrations at  the various unique facilities, and will obtain a thorough practical  experience of scientific research at a facility dedicated to research.",
