Fundamentally  new  transport behavior is  predicted  for  sample  geometries  that  bring multiple edge states into  communication.  Two sample geometries will employed in this project. These are  a  GaAs/AlGaAs superlattice pillar with edge states communicating on  a  2D surface sheath; and a gated GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction with  edge  states  communicating across a  long,  narrow  \"line  gate\"  barrier. Existing theoretical predictions in these cases will  be  tested with measurements to be made using a high-field (19Tesla),  low  temperature (20mK) apparatus on samples fabricated from MBE-  grown  GaAs/AlGaAs  heterostructures. It  is  expected  that  the  results   will   advance  general  understanding  of   electronic  transport in quasi-1D- and in anisotropic 3D- materials.  %%%  This  experimental  research project  probes  electron  transport  behavior  in  novel  devices based on one of  the  most  advanced  device technologies in microelectronics; that based on the  GaAs-  GaAlAs  system.  This  system is used in some  advanced  electron  devices  for computer use because it can lead to faster operation  than equivalent devices made of silicon. The experiments will  be  based   on  thin  conducting  layers  fabricated  in  the  GaAlAs  technology  which give a confined two-dimensional \"electron  gas\"  in   which   the   residual  scattering   from   impurities   and  imperfections  is  reduced  to  extremely  low  levels,  so  that  inherent  electron gas behavior at very low temperatures  and  at  high  magnetic  fields can be observed, and  compared  to  recent  theoretical  models.  Results  from  this  research  may  include  unusual  new  effects or materials which may find new application  in  tech nology.  This  research project is  interdisciplinary  in  nature  and  involves graduate students who will  be  excellently  trained to enter positions in industry, government or education.  ***",
