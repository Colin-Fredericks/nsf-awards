 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laboratory courses are an excellent environment in which to master basic knowledge obtained in course lectures.  However, it is evident that many laboratory environments are computer controlled so that automated testing, measurement, and device protocols are becoming standard.  Therefore, this project is making all of the introductory laboratories computer driven.  In particular, it is enhancing the education of the students in the following areas:  (1) system design and integration; (2) computer interfacing and data acquisition, including computerized instrument control; and (3) testbed design and automated testing.  The software implementation is being accomplished through National Instrument's LabVIEW Software, while the hardware implementation is being accomplished using a Pentium-based personal computer with GPIB card.  A Lab-PC+ multifunction I/O board is performing data acquisition and control of GPIB compatible instrumentation, which is being connected to the PC computer and controlled via LabVIEW drivers.  In addition, computer controlled laboratories are allowing faculty to greatly modify the content of the laboratory curriculum so that a more integrated connection between the theoretical courses and the laboratory offerings can occur.  Finally, laboratory experiments with more design content can be offered.  *",
