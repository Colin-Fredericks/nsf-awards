 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because lack of control and replication impede many software  engineering studies, there is a need to design experiments that  take advantage of completed projects (and the associated data),  rather than \"live\" projects (where the goal of getting the  product out the door may compete with data capture and analysis  goals).  The research project involves conceiving, designing and  preparing a collection of large-scale, multi-location  retrospective experiments.  The research focuses on four fault  identification techniques (requirements inspection, formal  specification, formal design, and fault injection), building upon  existing work by determining which methods are more effective and  in what contexts.  In particular, the project seeks evidence  about which method is most effective and/or efficient at fault  identification and removal.    The research involves a consortium of industrial and academic  partners, all affiliated with Howard University's Center for  Research in Evaluating Software Technology.  Where possible,  parts of the experimental design will be tested by running parts  of the experiment with student projects to confirm its  feasibility and to help direct the preparatory efforts.  The  results should have wide impact, both on the community of  practitioners (who will find the results useful for guiding  resource allocation decisions) and researchers (who will note the  feasibility of doing software engineering field experiments with  retrospective data).",
