 "awd_abstract_narration": "Skopp  9630117    The New York Academy of Sciences mentors a professional development and school reform program that enables teachers and students in three selected middle schools in New York City to learn, practice and understand the scientific research process.  Each year all students participate in and present the results of projects based on controlled experiments.  The mentoring is carried out over a three year cycle.  In year one, the school performs a needs assessment and buys into the program when the teacher, administrative and parent leadership sign an agreement.  Team building includes professional development by the New York City Science and Technology Assistance Centers (STAC) and a several-day field trip to a nearby forest preserve.  The Academy provides mentors for each teacher and funds for library improvement.  The FOSS Variables unit is done by all students and they report on articles in science journals.  During the first year teacher leaders emerge at each school.  These leaders attend a summer workshop at which they engage in inquiry, develop templates for student projects, and make concrete plans for their schools.  In year two, all teachers in the school receive professional development and implement the science fair. Communications among teachers, between teachers and administrators and between teachers and parents are developed electronically and through newsletters and faculty meetings.  In year three, the schools  plan for sustainability and replication by other sites with mentorship support, and communications help.  The project is evaluated by an external evaluator.",
