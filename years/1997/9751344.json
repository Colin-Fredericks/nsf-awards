 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a cohesive, integrated program in parallel processing for Computer Science majors that incorporates laboratory activities and undepgraduate research projects in appropriate courses.  An SGI Onyx2 parallel computer, with four processors, is being used to introduce a real environment early in the Computer Science curriculum and in subsequent required and elective courses, develop a set of laboratory activities in parallel processing to accompany topics in computer science, support undergraduate research projects, and eliminate problems related to remote computer access.  Specifically, the computer enables faculty to (1) teach performance analysis more effectively using experimentation and statistical methods, (2) assign projects that have been precluded by equipment limitations, (3) support long term honors and research projects, (4) give students a larger number of more appropriate laboratory experiences with a real computer, (5) develop a model for a parallel processing curriculum that integrates the new computer into activities of appropriate courses and undergraduate research projects, and (6) support collaborative projects with students and faculty outside the department.  Evaluation of the project includes an instructor questionnaire to ascertain the effectiveness of laboratory activities and use of the computer in meeting course objectives.  Students are asked to evaluate the laboratory activities and the computer in carrying out course requirements and undergraduate research.   *",
