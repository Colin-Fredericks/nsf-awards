 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602503  Pang    This award supports U.S.-Japan collaborative research  between Dr. Stella Pang of the Department of Electrical  Engineering and Computer Science at the University of  Michigan and Dr. Toshiaki Tamamura of the Photonic  Functional Device Laboratories at NTT  in Kanagawa, Japan.  Dr. Pang will be supported for six months at NTT in order to  develop and apply advanced nanofabrication technology for  optoelectronic devices to semiconductor mirrors, waveguides,  and lasers. The effects of processing technology on the  device characteristics and reliability will be studied.  Techniques such as in-situ passivation and epitaxial  overgrowth to remove or minimize process induced defects  will be developed.   Comparisons will be made between  quantum dots that are formed by  self-organized technique and by damage free dry etching  technique.    The U.S. researcher brings to this collaboration her  knowledge of low damage dry etching, surface passivation, in-  situ monitoring and process control, and Si-based optical  modulators.  This is complemented by expertise in the area  of high resolution electronic beam lithography, epitaxial  growth of strained layers and self-organized quantum  structures, and optical characterization of devices by the  Japanese researcher.  The project is expected to result in  new or improved processing technology related to  lithography, etching, material growth, and device  integration.  In addition, the new technology will increase  the design flexibility and allow new high performance  optoelectronic devices to be improved and developed.  It is  expected that the cooperation between these laboratories  should foster future collaborations.",
