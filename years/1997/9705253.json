 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705253  Nelson    Over a period of three years, Wisconsin Public Television is producing the science strand in the television series, Get Real!.   This series, which is broadcast on all public television stations and many commercial stations in Wisconsin, presents children involved in and succeeding at a variety of activities.  The youth hosts introduce kids as heroes, problem-solvers, thinkers, learners, and helpers.  These stories present role models to help enhance self-image and the sense of worth.  The science strand runs through each of the programs, delivering science as an integral ingredient of the wide-ranging vignettes which are directly relevant to the audiences' world and interests.    The series is designed for at-home viewing.  However, to ensure that the science strand works within the context of the science curriculum used in Wisconsin public schools, the project has developed partnerships with The Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters through its Center for the Advancement of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education (CASE) and the Wisconsin Elementary and Middles Level Science Teachers (WEST) association.    This request is support continued production of the science strand, expand outreach, and to extend carriage into neighboring states.  Wisconsin Public Television has made a commitment to include the science strand as a regular part of the series and is developing a business plan to develop a steady source of revenue to support its production.  Therefore, this request is for declining support over the three years of the grant.",
