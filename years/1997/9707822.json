 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707822  JONES        Oregon  State University (OSU) will operate the R/V  WECOMA  during 1997 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of  NSF-  sponsored  projects.  The R/V WECOMA is a 185'  general  research  vessel  constructed  in 1975 and underwent a  mid-life  refit  in  1994.   OSU  operates the WECOMA under a charter  agreement  with  NSF.   The  ship is scheduled for 188 operating days in 1997,  of  which 107 days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.  Of  the  remaining  81 days, 70 are in support of NOAA-supported  programs  and  11  are in support of Navy programs.  The WECOMA begins  the  year  with  cruises off the coast of northern California,  Oregon  and  Washington.  In mid-May the ship transit to the  Bering  Sea  for  a  70 day NOAA cruise.  The remainder of the year's  cruises  will be in the pacific northwest.          This  vessel  is  part of a fleet used by  NSF  to  support  oceanographic  research.   Most oceanographic  research  requires  highly  specialized equipment permanently installed on the vessel  for which the ship must be specifically designed.  This equipment  also  requires  highly trained crew members for  maintenance  and  operation.   Oceanographic vessels do not  operate  in  the  same  manner  as  general  cargo  or fishing  vessels,  therefore,  NSF  supports  the  operation  of  a  variety  of  ships  specifically  dedicated   to  oceanographic  research  that  are  operated   by  universities and research institutions around the country.  ***",
