This is unfortunate since interesting  physical phenomena in manwsnms leads to a strongly  frequency-dependent conductivity at terahertz frequencies. The  objective of this project is to construct a terahertz  spectrometer for measuring the frequency dependent properties of  correlated materials at low temperatures using a new technique  for generating and detecting broad-band terahertz radiation. The  project requires interdisciplinary expertise that is provided by  the two principal investigators (P.I.'s).    The terahertz spectrometer is based on recent advances in the  ultrafast laser community. A femtosecond pulsed laser is used  to photogenerate carriers in a GaAs crystal. The injected  carriers accelerate and approach drift velocity in the  depletion electric field on a subpicosecond timescale. The  radiation from these carriers is a  coherent-picosecond-electromagnetic pulse which propagates away  from the crystal in the direction of the pump pulse. The source  is reasonably efficient with a peak power of several mW. Using  ordinary optical components, the terahertz beam can be  reflected from a sample, which is located inside a cryostat  with a variabletemperature capability, and the electric field  can be detected as a function of time by measuring the  electro-optic phase retardation induced on a time-delayed  femtosecond probe pulse in a nonlinear ZnTe crystal. With this  technique, radiation can be produced that is centered between  0.5 and 1.0 THz with a bandwidth of ~1 THz. The complex Fourier  transforms of the incident and reflected electric fields can be  used to determine the real and imaginary parts of the complex  dielectric function of the material as a function of frequency.  The broad-band terahertz spectrometer represents a significant  advancement over traditional methods in its ability to  measure  the response at frequencies important in correlated systems.  For one thing, it is currently very difficult to measure both  the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function at  terahertz frequencies without invoking the Kramers-Kronig  relation.    After building and testing the spectrometer, the terahertz  response of several heavy-fermion and mixed-valent systems will  be measured over a temperature range from 1.5 to 300 K. In  these systems, strong electron correlations lead to an enhanced  Fermi-liquid ground state at low temperatures. Measurements  using microwave and far-infrared spectroscopy have observed a  narrow Drude response in some of these systems, but the  limitations of the conventional techniques prohibit a complete  characterization of the response on a variety of materials.  Some new systemse such as small-gap Kondo insulators and  materials that display nonfermi-liquid behavior, will also be  examined. Features in the conductivity are expected at  terahertz frequencies in both these systems. Other systems,  including quantum magnets, quantum well and dot structures,  compounds with charge and spin-density-wave ground states, and  materials where disorder-induced localization is important are  all examples where strong correlations produce a  frequency-dependent conductivity at terahertz frequencies, and  experiments are planned for many of these systems in the  future. Finally, the spectrometer's utility goes beyond the  measurements that are being proposed. After developing  capabilities to reduce the sample' s temperature below 1 K, we  could examine the electrodynamic response in the exotic  superconducting ground state of some heavy fermion materials.  ***",
