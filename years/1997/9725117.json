 "awd_abstract_narration": "The City College of New York's Program for the Retention of   Engineering Students (PRES), begun in 1987, was established to   increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the   engineering field.  PRES concentration is on freshman.  Data   indicate that half of engineering students drop out during the   first two years of school.  PRES services are focused on improving  academic performance and providing career information.  Among the  services listed, are, 1) pre-freshman and pre-transfer summer  enrichment programs; 2) mathematics and science workshops; 3)  frequent academic monitoring and advisement; 4) career orientation  and professional development sessions, and 5) cooperative education  and summer job placement.  Comparison data provided indicate that  student  retention rates are impacted with 90 percent of the  students staying in engineering versus 50 percent for those  students not in the program.  Another highlight of the proposal is  the program's impressive impact on graduation rates and  matriculation into graduate programs.  In addition, the proposal  indicates PRES will continue to grow through the support it  receives from its 18-member advisory board composed of corporate  and foundation representatives.  The strengths of the nominee  include:      .  Largest enrollment of engineering students in New York state       (50 percent of the state's engineering students).    .  Pre-freshman enrichment, personal counseling, block             registration, tutoring by peers and upper classmen, required       non-credit course in problem solving, math and science       workshops, frequent academic monitoring and advisement, career       orientation and professional development services, summer job       placement.       Significant impact on student retention, graduation,             academic performance.       90 percent of the students remain in engineering.       PRES student graduation rates are twice as high as other            minority engineering students.       Founda tion and corporate support.       Innovative and replicable.    In summary, PRES is a sophisticated and comprehensive student   support system.  The population of assisted students   overwhelmingly satisfies the NSF criteria for diversity and   underrepresented populations.  The program offered the unique   component of involving transfer students in the support process  even before transfer from the feeder school.",
