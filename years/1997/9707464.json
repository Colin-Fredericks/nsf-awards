 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707464  Eason  Many animal species are territorial, with individuals defending  areas  against conspecifics. Territory owners incur costs from defending  the territory, but also benefits from the territory's resources;  benefits  must outweigh costs for defense to be feasible.  Previous work has  ignored  a characteristic of territories that may be critical in  determining the costs  of their owners:  tactical defensibility, or the relative  difficulty of  defending a particular site.  One factor that may be the primary  determinant  of defensibility is the presence or absence of landmarks in the  habitat.  Anecdotal reports from a wide variety of taxa (insects, fish,  reptiles, birds,  and mammals) have suggested that animals use naturally occurring  and man-made  features as territorial boundaries.  This common phenomenon has  received very  little attention from scientists, and this study will address this  lapse.  The system to be studied is the territorial behavior of the cicada  killer wasp (Sphecius speciosus).  Males of this species defend  mating  territories on flat, featureless ground.  This species responds  strongly  to landmarks:  male wasps will move their territories so that the  boundaries coincide with landmarks, if landmarks such as dowels  are provided.  This study will determine the degree to which the size and shape  of  territories can be manipulated by introducing landmarks.  For  experiments,  grids will be constructed of dowels, and the size and shape of the  units  in the grid will be varied. Behavioral data will also be  collected.  The data obtained will be used to examine the effects of tactical  defensibility on defensive costs and male mating success in cicada  killers.  The results will provide information about the effects of habitat  heterogeneity on territory size and thus on the density of males.  Such data  are of value to theoretical ecologists and in addition will be of  practical  use to conservation biologists:  an understanding of how habitat  heteroge neity affects territorial species may enable wildlife  biologists  to create habitats that are more suitable to threatened or  economically  important species.",
