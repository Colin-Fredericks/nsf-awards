Sethu Raman and Leonard  Pietrafesa of North Carolina State University  (NCSU), Raleigh, and Dr. P.A. Aswatha Narayana  of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras  (IITM), India.  These scientists, in  collaboration with the Indian National  Institute of Ocean Technology, will study  Indian sea breezes, atmospheric convection  along the sea breeze front, and storm surge  processes along the East coast of India.  In  the first part, the scientists will investigate  the horizontal extent of the sea breezes in  relation to land-sea temperature differences  and the ambient wind, as well as the formation  of deep convection along the sea breeze front  and its dependence on other factors such as  land use pattern and upper air stability.  They  will use a hydrostatic numerical model  developed at NCSU and transferred to IITM.   This model will be extended to a 3-dimensional  state and used with atmospheric observations in  India that are taken every three hours and that  date back for 30 years.  The model may be  supplemented with a non-hydrostatic model as  needed.  In the second part, the scientists  will utilize a storm surge model available at  the NIOT and based on Sea, Lake and Overland  Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model originally  developed in the United States.  They will  develop methods to prescribe meteorological  forces that drive the ocean model and will also  use a simple hydrodynamic model developed at  NCSU that was successfully used in predicting  the tropical storm surge in North Carolina.    Scope:  This award allows cooperation between a  US team that is quite active in modeling  various atmospheric-sea-land phenomena, and an  Indian team that has excellent analytical  capability as well as access to extensive data  sources including governmental organizations  that operate radar, satellite, and other  atmospheric and ocean measurement  instrumentation on a continuous basis.  The  resear ch is of significant scientific benefit  to the US and India, and is of particular  importance to the meteorological activities of  the Indian authorities in predicting severe  climatic and weather conditions.  The project  involves both eminent and young scientists.   ***",
