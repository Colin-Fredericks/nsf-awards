University of Arizona  Title: Long-Term Variations of the North Atlantic Oscillation    This award supports a research project designed to use tree-ring  data from Morocco, appropriate tree-ring data from western Europe  and eastern North America, sea ice extent records, and indices from  the GISP2 Greenland ice cores to provide a 1000 year reconstructed  record of variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).   Previous investigations have shown that the cool season large scale  alternations of atmospheric mass between the North Atlantic regions  of subtropical high pressure and subpolar low pressure are highly  correlated with precipitation in Morocco.  Because Morocco is  physically located at the southern extremity of the NAO system,  slight perturbations in the system are recorded in the Moroccan  precipitation records.  The tree rings record variations in the  state of the NAO through the changing direction of associated  atmospheric moisture transport.  Three-ring data from western  Europe and eastern North America, as well as Greenland ice core  data and regional sea ice extent also show a high degree of  response to the state of the NAO, and thus, can be used to assess  the more northern extremity of the oscillation.  The tree-ring  construction of the NAO index will place recent NAO trends in a  long-term perspective.  Of particular interest is comparison of the  recent NAO trend with NAO variations during the Little Ice Age and  other periods of climate extreme.  A final product of the project  will be a long-term synoptic climatology showing various states of  the NAO along with their associated North Atlantic synoptic weather  conditions and North Atlantic SST anomaly fields.",
