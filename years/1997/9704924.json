 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704924    Pego    Nonlinearity helps to create wave phenomena in a variety of important  systems of partial differential equations that arise in science and  engineering. The focus of the proposed research is on developing and  improving methods for analyzing the stability of waves in several  systems of physical interest. These include 1) Solitary waves in  nonlinear dispersive media, including lattice dynamics and water waves;  2) A recently discovered class of localized nonradial solutions of  nonlinear Schrodinger equations in 2+1 dimensions; and 3) Internal waves  in fluids near the liquid-vapor critical point.  The methods under  development involve improving the use of: a) Evans functions to analyze  eigenvalue problems in two dimensions with symmetries; b) singular  perturbation theory for resolvent operators, to study how stability  results for integrable systems persist in nonintegrable systems for  lattice dynamics and water waves; c) infinite-dimensional center  manifold theory in ill-posed systems, to study the existence of  traveling water waves in three dimensions; d) zero-Mach-number  asymptotic analysis of low-velocity flows, to study hydrodynamic  phenomena near the critical point, specifically: damping rates of  internal waves about a strongly stratified equilibrium, and possible  capillary effects in one-phase flows of near-critical fluids.    The general goal of the first part of this research is to understand how  \"robust\" are nonlinear wave phenomena. Nonlinear waves in rare,  so-called \"integrable\" systems can be very well understood due to what  seems miraculous -- they can be solved in closed form. But most  realistic systems are not integrable, so one needs to know what  phenomena depend on integrability and what do not. An important  infrastructural technology where nonlinear waves are important and are  not completely understood is long-distance communication via optical  fiber. The second part of the work was motivated by physics experiments  carried out on the spa ce shuttle; also, the use of supercritical fluids  in materials processing is extensive and growing. The behavior of flows  of such fluids near the critical point is unusual and little understood,  and this has led to costly failures in experimental design in the past.  Fundamental investigations are needed to build the knowledge base about  such flows that can serve as the foundation for the development of  applications.",
