 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:      I propose to numerically address the question of  finite time singularity development in the  three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations  with smooth initial data.  These equations model  the flow of incompressible ideal fluids.  In particular,  I will consider the axisymmetric with swirl case which  allows for higher resolution than possible in fully  three-dimensional experiments.  Several different  finite difference techniques will be implemented.  I will investigate the performance of the different  numerical schemes in order to assess the quality of  each method.  Also, I will study the effects different  numerical boundary conditions have on vorticity  amplification as well as the fully three-dimensional  problem using particle methods.    In conjunction with these experiments, I will perform numerical  simulations of the Vlasov-Poisson equations in one dimension.  These equations model a collisionless plasma of electrons in a  uniform background of ions, and serve as a simpler analogue of  the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations.  I will  numerically study the behavior of weak solutions to the  Vlasov-Poisson and Fokker-Planck-Poisson equations arising from  non-smooth electron sheet initial data.  An electron sheet  describes a concentrated beam of electrons.  The equations will  be regularized by either smoothing the initial condition or by  including collisions modeled by the Fokker-Planck-Poisson equations.  I propose to use both a a finite difference method developed  by Jack Schaeffer as well as particle methods to examine the  solution of the Vlasov-Poisson equations obtained in the limit of  vanishing regularization.    And finally, this proposed research will prepare me to afterward  conduct research related to the Boltzmann and Fokker-Planck  equations with non-qmooth initial data which has potential  medical appliations.  These equations are used in the computation  of dosage calculations in radiation therapy.",
