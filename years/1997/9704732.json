Glynn   Stanford University     Markov process theory provides a rich analytic and probablistic  structure which is intrinsically natural from a modelling  perspective.  Much of the literature on inference for continuous-  time Markov processes assumes that the process has been observed  continuously over some time interval. However, in practice, many  of the data sets available involve observing only discrete   ``snapshots'' of the process.  Existing theory on parameter  estimation in this setting often results in computationally  prohibitive methodologies. This research addresses the issue of  computationally tractable parameter estimation for discretely  observed continuous-time Markov processes. Many of the results  utilize Monte Carlo simulation to achieve tractability.  The   second fundamental question examined in this research is that   of error propagation through a stochastic system. When the output  performance measure of the stochastic system cannot be evaluated  in closed form the output measure is simulated from the modelled  system. To address this situation, the investigators develop  estimators and their sampling properties for functionals of the  stochastic system.    Statistical models have always proven a powerful tool for  purposes of modelling, understanding and predicting complex  systems.  This research advances the frontier of statistical  models for dependent observations.  For example, the statistical  methods of this research are applicable to the diverse areas of  modelling levels of pollutants and contaminants in air, soil   and water which evolve over time and/or space; forecasting  changes in the stock market; and predicting or assessing demand  for the development of an optimal communications network.  The  use of statistical models for purposes of modelling complex  systems has been limited in the past due to the state of   computing power; a state which has certainl y improved in recent  years.  In this research, the investigators develop a framework  for practical implementation of advanced statistical methodologies  which capitalizes fully on the high performance computing  available today. The research addresses the issue of modelling  under partially observed information.  For example, the electrical  or computer engineer may use such models to assess network status   when only partial information is available on the state of the  system; in predicting air quality for a given region, observations  of pollutant levels are made at sites irregularly located over the  region and often at irregular points in time. The theoretical  constructs necessary to implement the models in the more common  scenario when only partial information is available are presented.  Additionally, this research involves error assessment of the   predictions or output performance measure of an estimated complex  system again capitalizing on the availability of high powered  computing.",
