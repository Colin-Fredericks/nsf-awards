 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714322  Dale    The Birmingham Public School System and the University of Alabama  at Birmingham formed a partnership to address the problem of  declining mathematics achievement in the district.  This project  will provide major staff development for teachers of grades K-5.    The Birmingham K-5 reform plan has four main elements:    1.   The adoption of a high-quality reform-based curriculum series,       Everyday Mathematics.    2.   The creation of a mathematics Staff Development Team composed       of classroom teachers, mathematics educators, and       mathematicians,     3.   The provision of substantive teacher enhancement for all K-5       teachers in the system, and    4.   The development of a plan for on-going teacher renewal after       the project ends.    All 907 of the district's K-5 teachers will participate in an  intensive staff development program that includes summer institutes  and academic year meetings.  The Staff Development Team will design  and implement the program.  The NSF-funded Bridges to Classroom  Mathematics Project will work cooperatively with the Staff  Development Team in designing the program.  Additionally, five  Mathematics Resource Teachers will support classroom teachers  during implementation.  Parents, teachers, administrators, and the  business community participated in the planning.  The project  evaluation will include participation in the core evaluation  process, along with all of the other LSC projects.",
