 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704813    Grabovsky    This proposal aims to investigate three problems related to homogenization,  composite materials and their effective properties. The first problem  will combine homogenization theory, bounds on the effective moduli  of composites and Young measure techniques in order to study the  relaxation of the ill-posed optimization problems with  weakly discontinuous objective functionals. The method yields an answer  for a class of quadratic functionals.  The second project will seek out the exact relations for the effective behavior  of polycrystalline composites using a new technique that combines  PDE theory and variational principles. The method is successful in  at least one such problem.  The third project will study the critical behavior of high contrast  composites near the percolation threshold by utilizing the analogy  between the phase transitions in Ising ferromagnets and the random  resistor networks near the percolation threshold on the one hand,  and recent results on the high contrast continuum composites away  from the critical point on the other.    Composite materials are media that look homogeneous but in fact have  complex structure when viewed under a microscope. These materials are  finding their way into our everyday lives in objects such as skis, golf  clubs, automobiles, aircraft, computers, cement, construction components  of buildings and bridges, sensors and many many more. The idea of  composite materials is to combine beneficial properties of its simple  but imperfect constituents. The difficulty here is that the properties  of composites (called effective properties) depend not only on what you  mix but on how you mix it. In other words, they depend on the geometry  of what you see under a microscope (called microgeometry). Therefore  the goal is to specify which microgeometries produce the best composites  provided you use the same materials in prescribed proportions. In general  this is an ill-posed problem. That is, it may not be solved in its raw  form  by the most powerful computers. The first part of this proposal aims to  reformulate the problem into a form suitable for solution on a computer  (into a well-posed problem). The second part of this proposal will  seek out and investigate the very special cases when some effective  properties of polycrystalline composites do not depend on the microgeometry.   This work may have applications for the design of underwater sensors  based on piezoelectric polycrystals. The last part of this proposal  constitutes a long term project on studying \"nature's composites\"  like porous rocks or sea ice (consisting of ice with brine inclusions).  The problem here is that the two constituents comprising the composite  have extremely different properties (like air and rock, or brine and ice).  Modeling the properties of such composites presents a formidable  mathematical problem. The progress here would enhance our understanding  and give us more control of a diverse array of problems ranging from   extraction of oil from porous rocks to global climate change (that depends  to a great extent on what is happening to Arctic and Antarctic sea ice).",
