 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Shepard Krech III, Mr. Scott Allen will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct archaeological excavation at Macaco, the seventeenth century 'capital' of the Palmares which is located on the Serra da Barriga, a mountain in Alagoas, Brazil. The Palmares were fugitive slaves who fled colonial plantations and established their own society which developed and survived for approximately 100 years. The Palmares successfully repelled repeated attacks by the Dutch, before finally falling to the Portuguese. Although the Palmares left no written record, they are described in several colonial documents which provide (a likely biased) insight into their political and social organization. It appears that over a century of independent existence the group melded original African elements with knowledge acquired on plantations and contact with indigenous native Americans to forge a new culture. Through his excavations at Palmares Mr. Allen will examine the material byproducts of this process. He will focus on changes in pottery manufacture and use, housing construction and spatial patterning in terms of village layout and activity areas.   Archaeologists have come to realize that cultural entities are often short-lived phenomena and that humans can redefine social boundaries with surprising rapidity. This contrasts to older models which recognized that groups, although they change over time, have considerable long-term integrity in terms of both boundaries and membership. `Ethnogenesis` refers to the process of ethnic group emergence and the Palmares provide an excellent case study for this since their history is known in broad outline. It is not understood however how the Palmares were able to develop a distinct identity over a short period of time, how they melded together elements from different cultural traditions and how this identity was expressed in material terms. Mr. Allen's research should shed significant light on this process.  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide new insight into a little understood aspect of New World history and provide information of interest to both archaeologists and historians. It will also increase the understanding of a basic process which took place many times in different parts of the world and, through a study of material culture, provide archaeologists with new analytic techniques. The work will also assist in training a promising young scientist.",
