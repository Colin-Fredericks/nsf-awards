 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, Butler will continue studies of electronically   nonadiabatic chemical reaction pathways.  One set of experiments will   seek to predict adiabatic and nonadiabatic reaction channels upon local   electronic excitation of a molecular functional group.  As an example,   photofragment velocity and angular distribution measurements from   crossed-laser molecular beam photodissociation of nitric acid together   with ab initio calculations will identify all the product channels of   nitric acid resulting from laser excitation.  Other molecules to be   examined include nitromethane, methyl nitrate, and nitramide.  In another   set of experiments photofragment velocity and angular distribution   analysis of the photodissociation channels of a series of amides will use   emission spectroscopy of dissociating molecules to characterize the shape   of the potential energy surface in the Franck-Condon region.  Detailed   insight into well-known photo-induced bond cleavage channels will be   obtained.    The experimental measurements in this project combined with calculations   will help us understand the photochemical reactivity of complex   molecules.  For example, some reactions are forbidden even though there   is enough energy available for them to proceed.  This project will   provide a basis by which we can explain some of these unexpected outcomes",
