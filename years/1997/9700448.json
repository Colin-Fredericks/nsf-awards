 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, a linear function of  a symmetric matrix variable X is minimized subject to linear  equality constraints on X and the essential constraint that X be  positive semidefinite.  Several problems can be cast as SDP  problems including linear programs, convex quadratic problems  with convex quadratic inequality constraints, matrix norm  minimization and a variety of maximum and minimum eigenvalue  problems. In addition, SDP has many applications in enginnering,  combinatorial optimization and statistics.    It is known that several interior point algorithms for linear  programs can be extended to SDP problems. As in linear  programming, many of these methods are polynomially convergent  and perform very efficiently in practice. In particular,  the class of primal-dual interior point methods and their higher-  order variants are the most effective interior point methods.  In contrast to linear programming, there are many ways one can  compute the Newton search directions used in primal-dual  algorithms for SDP. For this reason, the theory of primal-dual  methods for SDP is substantially more difficult than that for LP.    This project addresses the development of the theory and  implementation of primal-dual interior point algorithms for SDP  problems.    The objectives of this research project include:  1) developing a new primal-dual interior point algorithm for SDP;  2) advancing the knowledge of the theory of polynomial and  superlinear convergence analysis of primal-dual methods for SDP;  3) studying the existence and asymptotic behavior of continuous  trajectories for SDP;  4) developing new higher-order primal-dual methods for SDP;  5) implementing the new proposed algorithm and comparing it  against existing primal-dual interior point methods; and  6) extending primal-dual interior point algorithms to the context  of nonlinear SDP and complementarity problems.",
