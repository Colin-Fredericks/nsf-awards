 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide a modern computational  platform to facilitate broad communication by the  research and education community of Archbold Biological  Station (Archbold), and provide an active presence for  the station on the Internet to enhance research  collaboration.  Archbold, established in 1941, is a not-  for-profit independent research facility in central  Florida, dedicated to long-term ecological research.  Staff, visiting investigators, and students conduct  research primarily focused onthe organisms and  environments of the Lake Wales Ridge and adjacent  central Florida.  Use of the facility is often intense.  Areas of research strength are population ecology and  conservation biologyemphasizing the relationship between  species and ecosystem processes.  Complementary  education programs involve research training for  graduates and undergraduates, use by college classes,  and K-12 environmental education.  Archbold supports  research and education by providing access to study  areas and organisms on its 5,000 acre globally  significant scrub preserve, which is one of the most  distinctive regions in the U.S., and a 10,300 acre ranch  landscape.  The station's integrated infrastructure-  species diversity, land, long-term data, ease of access,  reference collections, fire and land management-are its  greatest asset.    The project will support a computer networking system to  integrate Internet, Intranet, and Local and  Wide Area Networking technologies into Archbold  activities. The design can be logically into four  (1-4) primary computing subsystems:(1)Telecommunications  & Internetworking Subsystem to interface the Wide Area  Network to the Internet; (2) Internet Presence or World  Wide Web Interface Subsystem to incorporate Archbold  activities accessible via www applications, email, and  FTP (for efficient data transfer between remote  locations).  Archbold proposes selection of Microsoft's  NT 4.0 as a Server platform based on a review of current  performance and funct ionality and analysis of the  industry long- term outlook; (3) Local Area Network  (LAN) Subsystem including the physical backbone and  individual workstation wiring to bridge a new science  LAN with the existing Administrative LAN; (4) Wide Area  Network Subsystem (WAN) with (LAN) Extension to off-site  facilities and Dial-up; as well as (5) a small attic  conversion to accommodate a new computer Information  Center at the station; and (6) an Operations and  Management Plan.",
