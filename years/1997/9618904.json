 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is funding Prof.    J.Simons at the University of Utah.  Over the next three years work in   his group will focus on the dynamics of energy transfer and chemical   reactions involving anion species.  Specifically, for anions in which the   extra electron is very weakly bound, the binding energy can be similar to   the rotational energy level spacings of the underlying molecule.  So, as   the molecule rotates faster and faster, its rotational period approaches   the orbiting period of motion of the electron, energy can be efficiently   transferred and electron ejection can occur.  Over the past several   years, excellent experimental work in other groups has examined the rates   of auto-detachment of electrons from such anions to study the coupling   between rotation and electronic motions.  In the present work, the theory   of these events as well as their computational simulations will be   undertaken.   The chemist's ability to create new molecules and new materials relies   heavily on understanding the electronic motions in atoms and molecules.    As the science of chemistry enters the 21st century, it is focusing much   of its efforts along two fronts: the interface between chemical science   and life science- biological chemistry, and the design and synthesis of   new materials with unusual properties.   In the latter area, it is   especially important for theoretical chemists to consider and to predict   the electronic and chemical (e.g., stability and energy content)   properties of molecules that have not yet been synthesized or even   observed.  An integral part of the theorists' ability to contribute to   this effort lies in knowledge of how electronic energy, momentum, and   angular momentum can be converted to energy, momentum, and angular   momentum of the atoms and molecular fragments, within a molecule.  The   efforts being funded in this program are directed toward providing a   basic theoretical framework for understanding and predicting such   properties.",
