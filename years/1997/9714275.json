 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-9714275  Lin    A key issue associated with emergence and survival of life  under extreme environments is the delineation of habitable  zones.  Conventional investigations have focused on the  existence of water on the surface of planets as a  consequence of radiative heating provided by their host  stars.  Dr. Douglas Lin and coworkers will examine the  persistent existence of a sub-surface liquid water layer as  a consequence of tidal heating in satellites around planets.  Through a case study of the tidal interaction between Pluto  and Charon, these researchers will examine this process as  an effective mechanism for heating satellite interiors.  A  systematic analysis will be carried out to test the  hypothesis that the persistent energy dissipation within  Charon is adequate to preserve liquid water below its ice  crust.  A similar analysis is planned for the tidal  interaction between Uranus and its satellites.  This award  is made through the NSF's special competition on Life in  Extreme Environments, with participation by the Division of  Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical  Sciences.",
