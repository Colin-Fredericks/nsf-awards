 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bowman  9705782       The continued fraction algorithm is one of the most  important fundamental algorithms in mathematics.  It returns for  any given real number a sequence of rational numbers that in a  very specific sense are the best possible approximations to the  given real number.  As a consequence continued fractions have  applications throughout mathematics including, but not limited  to: finding units in quadratic fields, solving linear  congruences, identifying a rational number in a floating point  calculation, and factoring large composite numbers.  Part of this  investigation deals with finding other algorithms similar to the  continued fraction algorithm, but that give approximations that  are best in other senses.  One part of the research deals with the  problem of determining an algorithm to return best approximations  in some previously specified sense.  Another deals with  determining in what way some known algorithms are giving \"best\"  results.  In much of the research, computers are used to aid in  the discovery and analysis of algorithms -- and this is necessary  as many of the algorithms of interest are quite complex.  One way  of understanding these algorithms is through their combinatorial  properties.  Thus one avenue of research being studied is into the  combinatorics of the algorithms.  Applications of the  combinatorics of the algorithms to other areas of mathematics is  also considered.       Algorithms are recipes, descriptions of how to solve a  problem step by step.  They are the basis for programs that tell  a computer what to do.  The speed of an algorithm usually depends  on the size of the problem.  For instance, the usual algorithm for  solving a linear system of equations takes about 1000 times  longer to solve a problem with 10 times more unknown variables;  algorithms for sorting a list of items may take 100 times longer  to sort a list that is 10 times longer.  For any significant  problem (modeling the earth or atmosphere, understanding the  security  of cryptosystems, protein folding, etc.) creating more  efficient algorithms is an important goal.  This project looks for  best possible algorithms for several kinds of problems.  Employing  such algorithms can make the difference between solving a problem  in five years or in five hours.",
