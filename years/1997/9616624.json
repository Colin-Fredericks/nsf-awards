 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616624  Lee  The overall objective of this project in intelligent structural  systems is to advance the state-of-the-art and state-of-practice  of seismic protective systems technology.  In particular,  application to the construction of new and more advanced  structures and the rehabilitation of existing construction using  such intelligent technologies will be emphasized.  Special  attention is given to two important areas.  The first explores  the application of protective systems as a global retrofit for  welded moment-resisting steel frames under near-source seismic  conditions such as those experienced in recent Northridge and  Kobe earthquakes.  The second area addresses the technical and  fiscal implications of using protective systems to rehabilitate  masonry and non-ductile concrete buildings.  In addition,  theoretical and experimental studies will be undertaken to permit  the comprehensive evaluation and comparison of passive and semi-  active systems.    The following tasks will be performed to complete the proposed  research: (1) Test beds for performance, evaluation and  comparison; (2) Near-source ground motions; (3) Application to  welded moment-resisting steel frames; (4) Application to  rehabilitation of concrete and masonry buildings; and (5)  Development of simplified methods of analysis and design  guidelines.  ***",
