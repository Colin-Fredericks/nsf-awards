 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is supporting   Professor Mark Cybulski at Miami University.  The main goal of this   research project is to implement a method for analyzing weak   intermolecular interactions at higher levels of Moller-Plesset   perturbation theory (MP3 and MP4) and its infinite order generalization   coupled-cluster theory (more specifically, L-CCD and CCD models).   The   method involves the joint use of the supermolecule approach and   perturbation theory of intermolecular interactions at one of the   aforementioned levels of theory.  The concurrent use of both approaches   permits the interpretation of the supermolecule interaction energies in   terms of rigorously evaluated electrostatic, exchange, induction and   dispersion energies.  Specific applications will focus on complexes with   unusually large higher-order correlation effects such as Ar-HCN and   NH3-CO.   In addition, the magnitude of the three-body nonadditive   effects in an open shell complex Ar2-CH will be examined.  In parallel   with calculations of interaction energies, calculations of molecular   properties of the complexes will be performed and the influence of   component energies on molecular properties such as dipole moments and   nuclear quadrupole coupling constants will be carefully examined.       There is a growing interest in understanding weak intermolecular   interactions in biological systems.  The interactions are considered   `weak` in the sense that the interacting species retain, to a large   degree, their individual character.  Intermolecular interactions are   responsible for base-pair formation across the strands of DNA and RNA.    Unfortunately, the information about the energetics of interaction is   not, in general, accessible experimentally.  The most promising approach   for studying the energetics of intermolecular interactions is   computational chemistry.  The goal of this project is to further develop   a method for studying intermolecular interactions which proves   particularly useful in providing insight into the nature of weak   interactions.   Applications will, initially, focus on smaller complexes   such as NH3-CO and Ar-HCN, in which interactions were found to be   difficult to interpret.",
