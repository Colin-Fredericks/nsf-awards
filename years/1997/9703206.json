 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research endeavors to explore uses of Markov chains,  focusing on applications in statistical physics and computer  science.  Markov chains are used in these disciplines to study  features of a combinatorial set by allowing (1) the sampling of  configurations and (2) estimating the set's cardinality.  In  statistical physics such sets arise as models of simple physical  systems, where the configurations typically represent  arrangements of molecules in the system.  Sampling provides  insight into the thermodynamic properties of the system, such as  the specific heat and free energy.    Recently in computer science, several new techniques have been  developed for proving that certain classes of Markov chains are  rapidly mixing.  In fact, there has been considerable success  with algorithms for precisely the types of problems arising from  physical models.  This project represents three new ways of  continuing this research in directions which will be beneficial  to both fields.    (1) Develop provably efficient algorithms for other combinatorial  problems.  Two problems of interest are: (a) k-coloring, which  arises in the Potts model for antiferromagnetism, and the Ice  model, and (b) Hamiltonian cycles on lattice regions and  hypercubes, which has applications in cryptography (for  encrypting images and generating random Gray code) and biophysics  (for studying compact conformations of polymers).    (2) Design sampling algorithms for finite lattice regions which  will give insight into the corresponding problems in infinite  lattices (i.e., the continuum limit).    (3) Develop decomposition techniques for bounding the mixing rate  of Markov chains and study applications using \"`simulated  tempering.\"    Finally, this interdisciplinary research will be complemented by  the design of new courses which focus on (and encourage projects  related to) recent research results and through the organization  of workshops and seminars which bring together scientists from  the relevant disciplines.",
