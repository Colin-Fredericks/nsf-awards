By inviting students to join staff in their research efforts over a concentrated time period, students will have a learning experience that is normally unavailable at their colleges during the regular academic year.  A summer program also offers the advantage of exposing the greatest number of students over the grant period to the challenges and rewards of a career in scientific research.  With a successful summer program, the Geophysical Laboratory can contribute to science education through the realm of science it knows best, fundamental research, and expand its present impact on the education of graduate students and postdocs to undergraduates as well.",
