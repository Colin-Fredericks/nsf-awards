 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project strengthens the curricular content of computer networking and communications courses through the introduction of hands-on ATM and wireless network programming to students.  The Department of Mathematical Sciences and School of Technology of two institutions are establishing two laboratories to teach advanced computer networking.  Traditional computer networking courses are able to provide students with hands-on software development and network performance experience with TCP/IP networks.  This project furthers the expertise of students by introducing next-generation networks.  In particular, projects and experiments based on gigabit ATM networks and wireless networks are being introduced.  This step enables the students to be well prepared for the upcoming network technologies.  These technologies are becoming more prevalent in the industry.  In addition, there are a number of interesting research issues that still need to be addressed in these networks.  The objective is to prepare the students for both industry and advanced graduate research.    Two different approaches are being used to teach practical advanced networking concepts.  At one of the institutions, a project-based approach is being used.  The students focus on writing software applications using the ATM and wireless API.  The other is following an experiment-based approach in which each course typically involves 2 hours of theory and 2 hours of laboratory work.  The collaborative venture benefits the students, who are exposed to both of these techniques.  Two different ATM switches are also being used to help students better understand switch implementations.",
