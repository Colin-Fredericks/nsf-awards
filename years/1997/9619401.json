Research projects are available in the following areas of research: Computational Electromagnetics, Digital Signal Processing, Wireless Communication, Mechatronics, Electronics, Power Systems, and Computer Architecture.  The professional development activities will consist of seminars/workshops on technical writing, oral communication, graduate education, academic careers, industrial careers, and professional ethics.    Each student will be required to present a mid-program oral presentation on the progress of their research.  At the end of the summer, the student will participate in a poster session, prepare a written report and an extended abstract, and present an oral presentation on their research.  Faculty-student interactions will be enhanced through a number of activities including five informal lunches highlighting presentations on research and graduate studies in electrical and computer engineering.  ***",
