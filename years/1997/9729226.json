 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729226  Arntzen  Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) represent a significant  threat to the general population but this problem is even  more prevalent in the urban environment.  As a result 12  million Americans including 3 million teenagers acquire  these diseases each year.  This is an important social  problem that has an impact on families and the community.  Reducing the incidence of these diseases would be a factor  in influencing social science thinking for years to come.    The research to be conducted is directed toward a novel  inexpensive approach to sexually-transmitted disease (STD)  prevention using transgenic plant proteins and a polymer-  based delivery system.  Specifically, a polymer-encapsulated  orally-delivered protein antigen would be used to prevent  infection.  The research seeks to solve three major  problems:    1)   Inexpensive methods for protein production.    Obtaining protein from plants represents a less    expensive alternative to laboratory production.  2)   A self-administered (orally) delivery  system.  3)   Improving awareness of the potential impact of    bioengineering on the economics of disease prevention.      Other types of delivery systems will be considered that may  be more effective in dealing with other diseases such as  genital herpes, Hepatitis B, and AIDS.    This research is being conducted as a component of a  research project at Cornell University supported by award  BES-9708250.  ***",
