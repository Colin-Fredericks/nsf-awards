 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701008  Raven   Graduate student Simon Malcombep, under the direction of Dr. Peter Raven at the Missouri Botanical Garden, is studying the several species of the Old World tropical shrub Gaertnera (madder family, Rubiaceae) for the evolution of pollination and floral features. Along with several related genera, these plants are considered ancestrally to possess hermaphroditic flowers with two different style lengths (said to be distylous), a condition hypothesized to promote outbreeding. Within the genus, several species have changed to the dioecious condition, with separate male (pollen) and female (ovule or seed) flowers on separate plants, a condition obligately enforcing outbreeding. The relative roles of pollinator effectiveness (the flowers are insect pollinated) and genetic inbreeding depression have been impossible to disentangle, in trying to determine what ecological or genetic factors drive the evolution toward dioecy. A well supported phylogeny for the 48 or so species of Gaertnera is one major goal of this project, to be reached by combining extensive morphological studies with new DNA sequence data generated from all the species. Then, field-based studies of pollination and seed set can be targeted to species pairs or groups where contrasting distylous and dioecious conditions coexist.   Field collecting in the Old World tropics and observational work on pollinators and seed set will provide necessary materials for morphological and molecular analyses of the phylogenetic relationships among the species of Gaertnera shrubs, leading to improved classification of these plants and reliable markers for identification. In addition, tests will be made of ecological conditions pertaining to pollinator effectiveness and seed set in various species pairs and groups, to assess factors that promote the evolution of dioecy in plants.",
