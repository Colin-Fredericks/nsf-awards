 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will collect national time-diary data to test substantive and methodological hypotheses related to people's use of time in modern societies.  Using established diary procedures with CATI interviewing, about 1500 adult respondents will be asked to complete a `yesterday` diary detailing their activities, when and with whom they did the activities, and whether they were engaged in secondary activities while they accomplished various tasks.  Data will be collected to be consistent with 1965, 1975, and 1985 national studies to allow exact cross-time comparisons.  The substantive significance of the research revolves around long-term trends in the time adults spend in various types of social contact, with particular interest in time spent with children and spouses and time spent alone.  This research will assess whether time devoted to conversations, child care, and doing activities with other family members has been declining, as has been suggested by authors using `social capital` explanations and related theoretical perspectives.  The methodological significance of the study centers on the problems survey respondents have in making accurate estimates of the time they spend on various activities.  Previous research has indicated systematic and consistent patterns of over-and under-reporting in estimates of time spent at paid work, and the present study will examine whether similar patterns apply to estimate questions about housework, religion, and organizational activities.",
