 "awd_abstract_narration": "The federal initiative of the past decade to reform science and mathematics education at the K-12 levels has resulted in greater emphasis on inquiry, active learning and new uses of technology at pre-college levels.  It has become imperative that current students be more engaged in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education.  Educators are being challenged to develop teaching tools that engage students' imaginations and provide a platform for integrating technology into technical and non-technical undergraduate curricula.    This project is a two year renewal of a successful project started in l995 by the Center for Image Processing in Education.  The current project introduces digital image processing as a learning tool for educators serving students studying for careers as technicians.  The project was designed to accomplish three activities: conduct professional development for technological education faculty at the high school and community college levels; build on the work of the University of Arizona's Image Processing for Teaching project to develop instructional materials for technological education; and establish a linking infrastructure to deliver the workshops and materials, provide strong follow-up support, and reach out to potential users.    Objectives for the renewal period include:  1.  Continuing to provide high quality professional development opportunities tailored to the needs of educators involved in technology oriented fields such as biotechnology, environmental technology, and agricultural technology at the high school and community college levels.  2.  Continuing development of instructional materials for technology education, both completing materials begun during the first period of funding and developing new materials in areas identified by educators and the project's Advisory Board.  3.  Maintaining and expanding the effective infrastructure for disseminating workshops and materials, and continuing to provide strong follow-up support and reach out t o potential users.  4.  Developing a strong summative evaluation program that effectively employs quantitative and qualitative analyses.",
