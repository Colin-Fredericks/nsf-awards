The collective modes observed  in  ultrasound  experiments are sometimes known  as  Cooper  Pair  Vibrations. The experiments in this project mainly deal with  the  non-linear excitations of two well characterized collective modes  of  3He B, namely the real squashing mode and the squashing mode.  The  studies will take advantage of the fact that the line widths  of  these modes become very narrow at low temperatures where  the  quasi-particle   scattering  rates   are   small.   The   planned  investigations will emphasize saturation studies and a search for  phonon  echoes,  in analogy to pulsed nuclear magnetic  resonance  effects.  Pulse  time  of flight studies  with  large  excitation  pulses  will  be  employed. In addition,  a  search  for  soliton  behavior  and  in  particular self induced transparency  will  be  undertaken  using  similar  techniques.  Because  of  the   large  coupling  between  the  squashing  mode  and  ultrasound,  it  is  expected that it will be more advantageous to study the squashing  collective  mode. In addition, an experimental approach  to  find  magnetic  resonance  signals corresponding to transition  between  Zeeman  sublevels  of  both  the  squashing  and  real  squashing  collective modes in magnetic fields.  %%%%  This  experimental project is devoted to the superfluid  behavior  present  in the liquid formed by cooling helium atoms of  isotope  mass  three, at low temperatures. Liquid helium when cooled below  4.2  Kelvin degrees (about -270 Centigrade) becomes a superfluid,  which  flows  with  no  viscosity,  permitting  persistent   flow  patterns  such  as  rotating inside a container.  The  superfluid  formed  by  the  isotope  o f helium  of  mass  3  is  even   more  interesting  in  its properties, which are the  subject  of  this  experimental  project. In liquid helium three the  superfluid  is  associated with \"pairing\" of the helium atoms, and the  pairs  of  helium  atoms have a characteristic rotational motion about  each  other,  in  contrast  to  pairing of  electrons  in  conventional  superconductors  in which the pairs do not have \"orbital  angular  momentum\". The consequences of this unconventional pairing in the  helium  three  superfluid  include  collective  modes,  known  as  squashing and real squashing modes, which are the subject of this  research,  which  will  be  carried out  in  part  using  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  methods. Liquid helium  three,  one  of  the  simplest  liquids  known, is a testing ground  for  developing  a  thorough  understanding of the properties  of  condensed  matter.  Even with its simplicity it offers complex behavior which may, if  correctly understood, provide insight into the behavior  of  very  different  materials, including high temperature superconductors,  in  which unconventional pairing may also occur in the superfluid  (superconducting) phase.  This experimental work is  carried  out  in  part  by  graduate and postdoctoral students who  receive  an  excellent  training in physics and in other areas  also,  in  the  pursuit  of  the  cryogenic measurements using  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  and other sophisticated methods. This is an  excellent  preparation  for  a  career  in industrial  research,  government  laboratories or in academia.  ****",
