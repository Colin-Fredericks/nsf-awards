 "awd_abstract_narration": "Symbolic computation is exact -- the result of a computation  is guaranteed correct. This comes at a cost -- the computations  are sometimes very slow and/or memory intensive; at times, the  correct results of a computation are too huge to be of use.  Numerical computation, on the other hand, is faster, and, on well  conditioned input problem instances, one can expect correct  solutions in the sense of backward error analysis. The numerical  approach has been very successful in solving a wide spectrum of  computational problems in science and engineering. However, there  are situations where this approach is not completely  satisfactory. In several applications of polynomial system  solving arising in areas such as geometric modeling and  kinematics, one needs the exact answer to a given problem  instance and not to a near-by instance.  On the flip side, in  many application problems, the input polynomial system is not  known exactly but to within small error bounds. This changes the  nature of questions that can be asked of a solver.  For instance,  a question such as ``does a given system of polynomial equations  have a root of multiplicity r?'' changes to ``is the given system  of polynomial equations near a system that has a root of  multiplicity r?'' with respect to some appropriate measure of  nearness. Existing symbolic/numeric algorithms are not equipped  to handle such questions well. Some of the issues that need to be  addressed in this framework are: characterization of the  solutions to a system of polynomial equations/inequalities in the  presence of small input errors; design of efficient algorithms  for solving polynomial systems that work in limited (or adaptive)  precision; understanding the factors that affect the stability of  these algorithms; investigation of ways to arrange the sometimes  independent  symbolic phase and numerical phase in polynomial  system solving to take maximum advantage of the strengths of each  other.    This project investigates some specific instance s of polynomial  system solving in the above framework with particular focus on  approximate polynomial greatest common divisors and several  special families of systems of polynomials. A new parametric  minimization technique is being studied and applied to the  approximate GCD problem and  several of its variants.  The  concept of generic Groebner bases is introduced and in  combination with eigenvalue computations, their effectiveness in  the approximate solving of certain special families of polynomial  systems is being investigated. The investigation of generic  Groebner bases throws fresh light on some well-known unresolved  issues in Groebner base theory. The new techniques will be  applied to polynomial systems arising in geometric modeling and  kinematics.",
