 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712872  Green    Research will be undertaken in response to an Announcement of   Opportunity (NSF 97-38) for Coastal Studies in the Great Lakes.  This is   a collaborative research project involving eleven  investigators from   five academic research institutions.  The research is being conducted   under the auspices of the NSF Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) program and   the NOAA Coastal Ocean Program.  This collaborative, interdisciplinary   5-year research program will entail an integrated program of field and   laboratory studies and mathematical modeling to quantify the role of   coastal currents and thermal fronts in mediating cross-margin transport   in Lake Superior.      The western shore of Lake Superior's Keweenaw Peninsula exhibits a   dramatic coastal jet known as the Keweenaw Current.  A strong, shore-  parallel density front, the thermal bar, also is characteristic of this   region and persists long into the summer. The goal of the proposed work   is to determine the physical, chemical, and biological effects that   arise from the intense physical forcing on this system, and   specifically, to elucidate how these effects interact temporally and   spatially to define distinct nearshore and offshore environments in Lake   Superior.  This project represents the first effort to model coupled   physical, chemical, and biological processes in the coastal zone of Lake   Superior where both vertical and horizontal thermal structure and   transport processes are important.    Investigators on this award are responsible for overall project   management and they are involved with three research subgroups: Physical   Processes, Chemical Gradients, and Biological Communities.  The Physical   Processes group will examine the relative importance of all forcing   factors (e.g., wind-driven variability, baroclinic instability) that   govern cross margin transport using in situ observations, numerical   modeling, and satellite observations.  The Chemical Gradients group will   characterize nea rshore-offshore differences in distributions of chemical   species, evaluate chemical tracers of water and sediment movement, and   investigate differences (inshore vs. offshore) in chemical cycles   induced by the current.  The Biological Communities group will determine   how gradients in primary production, trophic structure, and rates of   material transformation develop. All three groups will interact closely   throughout the project to obtain and share complementary data sets and   to derive a coupled physical/chemical/biological model of the system.    The detailed, process-level understanding achieved by this project will   advance our quantitative understanding of the processes that regulate   the transport, transformation and fate of biologically, chemically and   geologically important matter in coastal regions and provide a firm   basis for future management decisions on how best to preserve the   pristine nature of Lake Superior.",
