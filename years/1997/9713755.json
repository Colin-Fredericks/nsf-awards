 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with the development of a general  theory of power efficiency for active structural acoustic  control systems. Two classes of problems are studied: the  control of free-field sound radiation from structures, and the  control of structural sound transmission into enclosed spaces.  For both classes of problems, the power efficiency is defined  as the reduction of acoustic power output normalized with  respect to the electromechanical power input. The research  emphases are to derive expressions for the power efficiency for  both classes of problems; to determine the effect of transducer  selection and control law implementation on the power  efficiency; and to investigate the fundamental limitations in  power efficiency for active structural-acoustic control. The  research strategy consist of four classes. First, power  efficiency expressions are derived for both classes of control  problems. An investigation in transducer selection and control  law implementation is then performed with analytical models.  Next, the fundamental limitations in power efficiency for both  classes of problems are studied. The final task is an  experimental investigation of the concepts derived from the  numerical studies. The development of power efficiency models  is novel because it enables different control implementations  to be compared with a consistent metric. By providing a  systematic method of comparing the tradeoffs in active  structural-acoustic control, engineers are able to perform one  to-one comparisons of such factors as transducer selection and  location, control law implementation, and electromechanical  design. The research provides a tool by which practicing  engineers can quantitatively compare the merits of active  control designs for applications such as the suppression of  sound radiation in transportation systems, aerospace vehicles,  and precision machinery.",
