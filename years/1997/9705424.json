 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705424  Waldow  This Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award is  for three years of support for a research program involving  undergraduate students to study phase separation kinetics of  a ternary polymer system.  %%%  Pesearch training is an integral component of a broad  chemical education for undergraduate students.  This  research will complement the growing commitment to  undergraduate research and will allow greater integration of  research and teaching.  The research plan focuses on  kinetics of phase separation in binary polymer blends  compatibilized with a random copolymer.  The specific system  is polybutadiene, polystyrene, and a random copolymer of  butadiene and styrene.  The phase separation kinetics will  be measured using a temperature jump wide angle light  scattering instrument constructed at Pacific Lutheran  University (PLU).  The resulting light scattering  information will be compared with nucleation and growth as  well as with spinodal decomposition theories.  The results  from these kinetics of phase separation studies (1) will  provide new information about the effect a random copolymer  has as a compatibilizer;(2) will help in making comparisons  to theory and simulations;(3) will allow comparisons of  efficacy of random copolymers as compared to published work  on block copolymers; and lastly (4) may lead to information  used in the design of random copolymer compatibilizers.  ***",
