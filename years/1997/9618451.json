Plans in  the long run include collaboration in building two cosmic  ray observatories that will be equipped to study the highest  energy cosmic rays in order to understand how protons or  nuclei are accelerated to such high energies,  and to try to  determine the sources of those cosmic rays. This work is  expected to address one of the central problems in  astrophysics, the origin of cosmic rays.    Collaboration with Russian, Japanese and Vietnamese  scientists will take place under this grant.  Testing of  detectors essential to the project will take place in Japan,  with the participation of two University of Chicago  students. Exchanges of visits between Chicago and Dalat,  Vietnam will help initiate cooperation on computer  simulation of the detectors. A visit to Chicago by a key  Russian scientist will help define the potential for Russian  contribution of inexpensive photomultipliers to the project.",
