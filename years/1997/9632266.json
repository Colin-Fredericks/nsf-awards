 "awd_abstract_narration": "We seek to marry rate-distortion theory with perceptual science in order to  develop improvements in fidelity criteria and techniques for the  compression of video and other natural data sources.    The information theory of Weber-Fechner (WF) and root law (RL) fidelity  criteria will be studied, with emphasis on their application to lossy  compression of video signals and on calculating lower bounds to their  rate-distortion functions. Multiterminal source coding models will be  employed to deal with perceptual considerations, such as  just-noticeable-differences and masking, that arise when sequences of video  frames are viewed.    Also, we shall explore novel video compression schemes grounded in WF/RL  theory that provide dramatic computational simplifications relative to  competing  algorithms at high data rates and promise better quality in the  low-bit-rate regime for such appications as video telephony and distance  learning.  Low-latency video compression and transport will be performed on  facilities in the DISCOVER Lab to test our perceptually based algorithms.",
