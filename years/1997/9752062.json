It provides continuity in hands-on training in advanced manufacturing at the secondary and postsecondary levels and links with manufacturers in order to create a skilled workforce that can compete in a global manufacturing environment.  Curriculum development activities include the creation of two advanced manufacturing courses that provide hands-on experience with state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing equipment.     The project addresses the need for \"recruiting\" secondary students into manufacturing technology careers by developing a course for high school students that provides manufacturing career information and exposure to manufacturing technology design and implementation processes.  A summer camp for middle school students provides them with exposure to manufacturing technology and careers in manufacturing.      Professional development experiences are provided for middle school and high school manufacturing technology teachers, high school guidance counselors, technical college faculty from throughout South Carolina, and manufacturing employees who need to upgrade their skills.",
