 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9661256  Emerling    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication service that will be self-supporting after Phase I. We will use a MEMS technology demonstrated successfully by several laboratories. The process begins with a CMOS chip, available from many vendors, and applies a relatively simple mask-less postprocessing etch to produce pits, cantilever beams, and membranes. Researchers have used this technology to demonstrate a variety of MEMS devices.  This MEMS process leverages existing CMOS fabrication to create MEMS devices integrated monolithically with CMOS circuitry. The single postprocessing step requires no photolithography and no expensive equipment.  During Phase I preliminary design rules, guidelines, and examples will be developed and distributed to the MEMS community, and initial  designs will be solicited. We will install the fabrication equipment, and perform the processing of the initial run, returning parts to researchers for testing.    The proposed MEMS fabrication service will enable the research and development to keep our nation in the forefront of the commercialization of MEMS. The service will support commercialization by providing cost effective prototype fabrication and volume manufacturing.  ***",
