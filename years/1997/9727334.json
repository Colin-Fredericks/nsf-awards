The goal is to enable thin film manufacturing facilities to  implement principles of industrial ecology by utilizing  chemical reactors that are 100% efficient with respect to  all process fluids.    The strategy for achieving this goal is to demonstrate that  nonflowing processes can be optimized to minimize the  consumption/creation of high purity fluids while still  meeting film property goals.  In the limit, 1 00% of the  fluid used in the process will be converted to solid film in  the case of deposition, or to fluid products in the case of  film etching.  The intent is not to change one film or one  chemistry, but to create a paradigm shift in manufacturing  technology based upon a current need to embrace industrial  ecology.  The way to realize the vision is to design a new  type of reactor that can be used in many different chemical  processes.    The objectives of the project are to develop a list of  flowing chemical processes used in IC manufacturing that  could be replaced by nonflowing processes; to demonstrate a  nonflowing chemical process that reduces the use of toxic  chemicals and the creation of waste, both by the process and  associated facilities, by a factor of 1000 for films  comparable to those grown commercially; and to demonstrate  film properties within manufacturing specifications for  tungsten deposition on full wafers by nonflowing chemical  vapor deposition.    An environmental impact paredo of chemically-driven  processes used in integrated circuit manufacturing will be  created.  Those processes will then be evaluated in order of  impact in terms of fundamental kinetic and thermodynamic  principles for amenability to nonflowing process conditions.  A paredo of impact of converting commercial thin film  processes to nonflowing conditions wil l result.    A system approach to thin film processing will result in an  algorithm for quantification of waste creation as a function  of processing parameters.  The algorithm will contain  information with respect to the thin film process and its  associated facility demands, such as pump oil contamination  rate and waste from reactor cleaning.    Experiments relating thin film properties to near-surface  gas composition during nonflowing processing will create a  window of process conditions that meet film manufacturing  specifications for a chosen test chemistry.  These process  conditions will be used in the above algorithm to find  reactor specifications and processing conditions that  optimize waste minimization and film properties.  This  process will be demonstrated on full wafers upon the  completion of the construction of a wafer scale chemical  vapor deposition nonflowing reactor.",
