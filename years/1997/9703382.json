O'Malley, Jr. as the Principal Investigator.  The research  develops asymptotic methods to solve nonlinear boundary value  problems for both ordinary and partial differential equations  when solutions feature narrow boundary, shock, or transition  layer regions of rapid change.  The research will emphasize stiff  computation and dynamic metastability, through a consistently  hybrid asymptotic/numeric investigation.  Special notice will be  paid to asymptotically exponentially small terms, which have  previously received scant attention, since we are now well aware  that asymptotics beyond all orders can be of critical physical  significance.    Throughout science and engineering, problems often occur which  involve singularly perturbed boundary value problems.  The best  known example is fluid dynamical boundary layers.  Analytical  and numerical techniques must be combined to effectively attack  these important problems.  This work rests on a hybrid approach to  solving both ordinary and partial differential equations for  model problems motivated by application needs.",
