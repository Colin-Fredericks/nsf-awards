 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program provides support for research on the magnetic properties and   synthesis of transition metal carboxylate clusters by Dr. George Christou   of the Chemistry Department, Indiana University.  Some families of   manganese carboxylate clusters have been found to exhibit single-molecule   magnetism (SMM).  Research will determine the influence of the molecular   environment on the observed magnetic properties and the factors   responsible for SMM behavior.  Detailed studies will include both DC and   AC magnetic susceptibility measurements.  New examples of complexes   exhibiting SMM will be synthesized, including cobalt carboxylate   clusters.  In addition, metal carboxylate clusters will be incorporated   into supramolecular assemblies using a variety of polyfunctional ligands.    The resulting compounds will be tested for magnetic properties in an   attempt to provide synthetic access to new magnetic materials.  Some   molybdenum and rhenium species with alkoxide functionalities will also be   prepared.  Magnetic materials are technologically important in many areas, including   electronics and manufacturing.  Miniaturization and finer control of   devices continue to be desirable goals.  This research will lead to   better understanding of magnetic phenomena at the molecular level and   possibly to increased ability to design molecular- and nano- scale   devices with specific magnetic properties.",
