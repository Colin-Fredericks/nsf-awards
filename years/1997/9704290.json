The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. James W. Vallance to work with Dr. Stuart B.  Savage at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.    Dr. Vallance will be studying the behavior of pyroclastic  flows focusing on simulation and modelling.  Pyroclastic  flows are hot, dry flows of particles and gas with a high  concentration of particles. This project will encompass all  parts of a flow, including a hot, non- to partly fluidized,  dense, basal avalanche having a concentration of particles  similar to that of the original deposit, an overriding  turbulent ash cloud surge with a very low particle  concentration, and a convecting ash cloud.  The study  focuses, however, on the granular basal avalanche.  These flows destroy property and kill hundreds of people  yearly.  This project will combine the talents of a field  oriented geologist, experienced in volcanic hazard  assessment and mechanics, with a professor of civil  engineering, internationally respected in grain-flow  mechanics and modelling, at McGill.  ***",
