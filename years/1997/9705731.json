 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT      Song-Ying Li     Li is investigating several problems in harmonic analysis, complex   analysis and non-linear  partial differential  equations. His project   includes the Corona problem  in several complex variables. Li will   consider  Hankel operators, commutators, composition operators and  the complex Monge-Ampere operator. Li is  focusing on the existence,   uniqueness and  regularity of solutions of complex Monge-Ampere   equations on smoothly bounded weakly  pseudoconvex domains. These   results can  be directly applied to the study of the boundary behavior   of Kahler-Einstein  metrics.       The project of Li is aimed at developing both the theory and   application  of harmonic analysis, complex analysis and partial   differential equations. The theoretical part of the project is   concerned with several important  problems in these fields.  The main  problems of this project  are strongly  related to control  theory, mathematical physics, especially   quantum mechanics and approximation theory.  The theory of systems control can be   directly applied to  Electrical and Computer Engineering    and approximation  theory can be used to deal with problems in   signal processing.",
