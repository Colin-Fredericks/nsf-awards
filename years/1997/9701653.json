The IMA is a unique institute addressing a national need.    The programs of the IMA are designed to foster linkages among the   mathematical sciences, other sciences, and industrial research by identifying   problems and stimulating research in various interface areas of mathematical   sciences and to encourage the participation of mathematical scientists in   areas of application by providing an atmosphere conducive to   multidisciplinary research.    Yearly IMA programs are carefully chosen to provide a meeting ground for   mathematical scientists with engineers and scientists from academia,   industry, and government laboratories. The interaction of senior and mid-  level scholars and  postdoctoral fellows is designed to provide an   environment where new ideas can be developed and explored.  The IMA   places a high priority on the training of postdoctoral researchers, including   both individuals associated with the annual program and those participating   in the industrial postdoctoral program.  The IMA also supports summer   research and training programs for graduate students, as well as an ongoing   seminar on industrial problems.  Efforts are made to schedule programs of   timely research interest and where opportunities exist for cross-disciplinary   and programmatic collaboration and scientific exchange.   In addition to   National Science Foundation support, the IMA is supported by 29   Participating Universities and 12 Participating Corporations.",
