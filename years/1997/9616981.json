 "awd_abstract_narration": "The electronic digital computer has brought about significant changes in several fields of  science.  Computer-based modelling and statistical analysis tools have automated data  collection, storage and analysis.  Computer simulations have allowed scientists to visualize  phenomena they could not observe in nature.  Yet such applications also raised questions for the  practice of science: Are simulation and data analysis valid sources for causal models?  Can  experiments be replaced or supplemented by computer simulations of the same processes?   Computing has transformed the practice of science in many disciplines, yet no history of  scientific computing has yet been written.  As a first step toward this goal, the investigators will  examine the use of computers as scientific instruments in diverse fields of biological, physical,  and behavioral science.    The proposers will begin with a systematic bibliographic search of primary and  secondary sources for several fields of science for the period from 1975 through about 1975.   Then they will undertake historical research, including archival analysis, on-site visits, and a  selected set of interviews.  Although the approaches to material in each field of science will vary  from one investigator to another, their efforts will be united by a common goal and common  research questions, including efforts to situate the computer within its institutional, social, and  intellectual context; to understand how the computer changed scientific practices and was  changed by them; and to analyze how computers were used to promote the authority of certain  institutions, individuals, and methods.",
