 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neale  9615342  Increases in ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B, 280-320)  associated with the Antarctic ozone hole have been shown to  inhibit the photosynthesis of phytoplankton, but the overall  effect on water column production is still a matter of  debate and continued investigation.  Investigations have  also revealed that even at \"normal\" levels of Antarctic  stratospheric ozone, UV-B and UV-A (320-400 nm) appear to  have strong effects on water column production.  The role of  UV in the ecology of phytoplankton primary production has  probably been underappreciated in the past and could be  particularly important to the estimation of primary  production in the presence of vertical mixing.    This research focuses on quantifying UV effects on  photosynthesis of Antarctic phytoplankton by defining  biological weighting functions for UV-inhibition.  In the  past,  techniques were developed  to describe photosynthesis  as a function of UV and visible irradiance using laboratory  cultures.  Further experimentation with natural assemblages  from McMurdo Station in Antarctica showed that biological  weighting functions are strongly related to light history.  Most recently, measurements in the open waters of the  Southern Ocean confirmed that there is substantial  variability in the susceptibility of phytoplankton  assemblages to UV.  It was also discovered that inhibition  of photosynthesis in Antarctic phytoplankton got  progressively worse on the time scale of hours, with no  evidence of recovery.  Even under benign conditions, losses  of photosynthetic capability persisted unchanged for several  hours.  This was in contrast with laboratory cultures and  some natural assemblages which quickly attained a steady-  state rate of photosynthesis during exposure to UV,  reflecting a balance between damage and recovery processes.  Slow reversal of UV-induced damage has profound consequences  for water-column photosynthesis, especially during vertical  mixing.    Results to date have been used to model th e influence of UV,  ozone depletion and vertical  mixing on photosynthesis in Antarctic waters.  Data indicate  that normal levels of UV can have a significant impact on  natural phytoplankton and that the effects can be  exacerbated by ozone depletion as well as vertical mixing.  Critical questions remain poorly resolved, however, and  these are the focus of the present proposal.  New  theoretical and experimental approaches will be used to  investigate UV responses in both the open waters of the  Weddell-Scotia confluence and coastal waters near Palmer  Station.  In particular,  measurements will be made of the  kinetics of UV inhibition and recovery on time scales  ranging from minutes to days.  Variability in biological  weighting functions between will be calculated for pelagic  and coastal phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean.  The  results will provide absolute estimates of photosynthesis  under in situ, as well as under altered, UV irradiance;  broaden the range of assemblages for which biological  weighting functions have been determined; and clarify how  kinetics of inhibition and recovery should be represented in  mixed layer models.",
