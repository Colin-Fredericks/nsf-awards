 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research project represents one of the first   comprehensive biological process studies to be carried in the   Arctic Ocean over a full annual cycle.  Investigators from Oregon   State University, the Canadian Dept. of Fisheries and Oceans, and   from other U.S. institutions will use a Canadian icebreaker as   home base for a 14-month period to study the seasonal cycle of   biological production and respiration, and the seasonal cycle in   biomass of algae, bacteria, protists, and zooplankton, in the   central Arctic.    The research program will be organized around continuous   measurement of dissolved oxygen concentration in the upper water   column. Dissolved oxygen content integrates the sum of production   and respiration in both the water column and in the overlying sea   ice. Continual monitoring of dissolved oxygen will allow detection   of the initial spring increase in primary production, and of   transient algal blooms, that may be missed by a discontinuous   sampling program. Concentration of inorganic nutrients in the   upper 100 m, concentration of dissolved and particulate organic   matter in the water and in sea ice, biomass of autotrophic and   heterotrophic organisms in the water column and sea ice, uptake   rates of carbon and nitrogen by phytoplankton, and respiration   rates of the planktonic community, will be analyzed at least   weekly.    The seasonal study of production/respiration processes will   provide valuable information regarding: 1) the present structure   and function of central Arctic ecosystems, which can serve as a   baseline for evaluating the impact of future global change   processes in this sensitive region; and 2) the nature and timing   of production and respiration processes in a high latitude system   and in particular how the heterotrophic community survives during   the dark winter months.",
