 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  EEC-9726306  BEHRENS      It is not unusual for Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers to form partnerships between two or more universities.  These partnerships provide access to more research expertise than is resident at a single university and hence create stronger centers.  Although the research strengths of each university and the degree to which the research integrates is typically well understood before two or more universities join together to form a center, the managerial and administrative issues may not be.  Differences in organizational culture, management philosophy and bureaucratic procedures, if not addressed, can break up an otherwise fruitful partnership.  The objective of this project is to develop a tool, for use by two or more universities planning to enter into a partnership, to focus discussions on these non-research related issues.  This tool would use the business alliance lifecycle model based on a marriage metaphor developed by Kantor et.al. as a conceptual framework.  The tool would be an annotated checklist containing items that potential partners must discuss before entering into a partnership, such as what the \"target market\" for the envisioned center is.  Included under each item would be a short discussion about why consideration of that item is important.",
