Different  materials have different constitutive  equations.  Research  in  constitutive equations is  usually  associated  with  certain fields such as mechanical or civil engineering  or  others.  Three previous conferences at the University of  Arizona  had constitutive equations of nearly all  materials  used  in  engineering applications as a theme.  A  follow-up  conference  is planned for summer of 1999 on the  campus  of  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  This date also marks  the  25th  anniversary  of  a workshop on Inelastic  Constitutive  Equations  held at RPI and sponsored by the Solid  Mechanics  Program of NSF.  The proceedings of this workshop will serve  as a gage for measuring progress.  Support is sought for the  travel  expenses of invited speakers, graduate students  and  post-doctoral  associates,  and  for  publication   of   the  proceedings.   A  separate budget financed  by  registration  fees   covers   other   expenses  including   announcements,  preparation and conference organization.",
