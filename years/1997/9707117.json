They  are developing a 14,000 sq. ft. area of aquatic exhibits and  support spaces that will increase visitors understanding of the  science concepts related to water, aquatic habitats, and organisms.   The exhibit area will be developed in two phases.  Phase I will be  completed in the spring of 1998.  It will consist of 15 or so  fresh-and saltwater habitat tanks, a learning laboratory, a small  program theater, a salt marsh touch pool and eight interactive  exhibits.  Phase II, for which this planning support will be used,  will consist of an additional 25 interactive exhibits and  associated programs.  The Phase I area will serve as an  experimental laboratory for the creation of the Phase II learning  activities.    With this planning grant, they will hold three staff development  workshops, a planning seminar focusing on the learning theory of  constructivism and how it can inform and drive exhibit and program  development, produce a report of the seminar proceedings, and  identify and recruit a national advisory team to assist with the  development of Phase II.  As a result of the planning activity  their staff will be informed about constructivist theory and its  application to museum exhibits and activities, they will increase  their knowledge of front-end evaluation strategies, they will  develop new community and professional partnerships, and they will  have a plan to use as they move forward with the implementation of  Phase II exhibits.",
