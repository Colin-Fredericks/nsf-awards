 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Research Council will examine means to strengthen linkages between mathematics and the natural, behavioral, and engineering sciences, thereby supporting the continuing productivity and quality of the research enterprise in a time of constrained resources.  Toward that end, a committee will be formed to examine mechanisms for enriching the dialogue between the fields, with the principal efforts of the committee being to suggest what are likely to be the most effective mechanisms for collaboration, and to implement them through the Internet, widely circulated reports, and other dissemination activities, such as campus workshops convened by committee members.  The committee will also examine implications for graduate education in the sciences and mathematics, and suggest changes in graduate training intended to reinforce efforts to strengthen the dialogue among the sciences.    Funding for this activity will be provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and also by DARPA.    Committee activities will include several meetings, two workshops, and an examination at doctorate-granting institutions of the role of graduate education in fostering linkages of science and mathematics.
