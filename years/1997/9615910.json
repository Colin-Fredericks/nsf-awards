 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, Freed will continue studies of dynamical   molecular processes and free radicals in fluids, on surfaces, and in   related systems.  New electron spin resonance (ESR) relaxation and   structural techniques will be employed, and the necessary theoretical   frameworks will be developed and extended.  Two-dimensional Fourier   Transform (2D-FT) ESR, electron-electron double resonance (2D-ELDOR), and   Far Infrared (FIR) ESR studies of fast and slow motional regimes will be   developed and applied to rotational molecular dynamics in liquids,   presenting a multi-frequency approach covering 9-250 GHz.  Pulsed ESR   methods will be developed at 106 GHz base on a new source appropriate for   liquid studies and new quasi-optical methods for FIR-ESR.  Other systems   investigated will be glass-forming liquids, inhomogeneous fluids such as   microemulsions, restricted reorientational dynamics on surfaces,   translational diffusion in simple and complex liquids, biradicals in   liquids, and radical clusters in solids.  NMR spectroscopy has been successfully used in a wide range of   applications, from chemical structure determination to medical diagnostic   scanning.  The related technique of ESR spectroscopy has been much slower   to be developed in part because of obstacles caused by the frequencies of   radiation which must be used and the shorter relaxation times, that is,   the time during which one can measure the molecular effect being   observed.  This research program will involve the development and   improvement of ESR techniques which may help to bring ESR-based methods   into more common usage as analytical tools in chemistry, biology, and   materials science.",
