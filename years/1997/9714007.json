 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last six years, the University of Maine has made  an unprecedented investment in its marine laboratory, the  Darling Marine Center to benefit both University faculty  and visiting researchers and their students.  Facility  improvements include many new laboratory and offices  spaces, more research instrumentation, and basic support  facilities such as a dining hall and new classrooms.  The  inauguration of a Visiting Investigation Program in 1991,  the expansion of educational offerings, and the growth of  a large undergraduate internship program, have resulted in  a population explosion that shows no sign of abating.    To set priorities for improvements, the University has  involved visiting investigators and visiting out-of-state  colleges in facility planning.  Based on their  recommendation, housing has been targeted as the  greatest facility weakness.  The Center's housing is  primitive, overcrowed, and woefully inadequate and this  deficiency is restricting the growth of both educational  and research programs that impact a growing community of  visiting faculty and students.  The University's  Department of Environmental Health & Safety has issued  unfavorable reports on the status of much of the Center's  housing, mostly due to inadequate fire protection and ADA-  access.  Most housing is of cottage construction and is  restricted to summer use.  Some housing lacks both heat  and running water.  In order to temporarily meet housing  demand, every available space has been converted to bunk  space throughout 11 separate building.  Due  to the age and condition of many of these structures,  modernization would be largely cost prohibitive.  While the Center now has beds for 60 people during the  warm weathers months, year-round housing will currently  accommodate only 18 students.  The Center's growing  educational and Visiting Investigator programs are being  severely hindered by this housing shortage, resulting in  schedule juggling and restrictions on the number of  individual s and visiting college classes that can work on  site at any given time.  In addition, the dining hall,  built in 1992, was designed to feed 35 people at a time  but now must accommodate twice that number. 20-room  dormitory to house visiting faculty and students year  round will be constructed.  Two previous FSML facility  improvements awards to the University have been  responsible for stimulating the number of visiting  investigators to the Darling Center and making their  visits more productive.  In addition, the awards have  helped immeasurably to encourage additional investments by  the University and by local, citizens who support the  Center through their private donations.",
