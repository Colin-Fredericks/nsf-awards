 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jones    Abstract    Jones proposes research in four closely related areas:  (1) Strong   Moment Theory, (2) Orthogonal Laurent Polynomial Sequences (OLPS's),   (3) Applications of Szego Polynomials, and (4) Computation of Special  Functions.  Following are brief descriptions of the proposed research.    (1)Research on strong moment problems will be focused on determining   all solutions of a given problem when more than one solution is   known to exist.  For certain classes of problems we propose to show   that there are infinitely many solutions in the form of step-functions.    For the infinite family of moment problems associated with   bi-sequences of log-normal moments, we propose to obtain explicit   expressions for all solutions of the moment problems, by using the   Nevanlinna parametrization.  (2) A primary goal for research in this   area is the determination of explicit formulas for OLPS's  that are   analogues of the classical orthogonal polynomials of Jacobi, Hermite   and Laguerre. Explicit formulas will also be sought for recurrence   formulas, Rodrigues' formulas, differential equations, quadrature   formulas and other known properties of the classical polynomials.    For areas (3) and (4) our primary goal is to investigate computational   methods for use in applying recently obtained Theoretical results to   problems of science and technology.    Orthogonal functions are used as building blocks to describe in   mathematical language a large number of  physical phenomena; for   example:  (a) the magnetic field of the earth   (for navigation and   geophysical research), (b) musical tones, (c) motion   of ocean tides, (d) alternating electrical currents and   (e) force fields  due to gravitational attraction (orbiting planets   and satellites) and electrostatics.  Examples of orthogonal functions   that help form the basis of mathematical physics (and its engineering   applications) are spherical and cylindrical harmonics, Fourier series   and orthogonal polynomials.  OLPS's are r elatively new orthogonal   functions introduced in the 1980's by the principal investigator and   collaborators (Thron, Waadeland and Njastad).  Originally they were   used to solve strong moment problems.  Jones proposes their   application to quadrature formulas for efficient computation of   integrals that arise in science and engineering.  Szego polynomials are  applicable to frequency analysis problems that arise in such fields as  communication (digital transmission of radio, television and telephone  signals), radar, phonetics, speech processing, speech therapy, and  teaching the deaf to speak.  Our research will compare Szego polynomial  methods with other known methods, seeking to refine the Szego method  and exploit its application.",
