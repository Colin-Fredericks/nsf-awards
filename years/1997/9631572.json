A number of field measurement studies have resulted  in the hypothesis that ozone is being destroyed by a catalytic cycle involving Br  atoms. If this were important in the marine environments in general, it would have  substantial implications for our understanding and modeling of the global budget of  tropospheric ozone. However, there are several areas of the chemistry and dynamics  of the process that are poorly understood, for example: What is the source of bromine  atoms? What is the fate of the BrO radicals produced? What are the important  removal mechanisms for reactive bromine radicals? What is the mechanism for  recycling HBr? What are the spatial and temporal characteristics of ozone destruction  in the Arctic troposphere? Purdue University has brought together four groups of  researchers with complementary capabilities to enable them to uniquely pursue the  answers to these questions. The specific objectives, and associated approaches, of this  research effort are:       (1) Measurement of the kinetics of the operative reactions, presumably  occurring on the surface of or within sea salt or acidic sulfate aerosol, whereby  bromide ions are oxidized to molecular bromine or other photolytically active bromine  compounds, under conditions relevant to the Arctic. These measurements will be  conducted using stopped-flow and pulsed accelerated flow spectroscopic techniques.       (2)  Investigation of the competitive reaction paths for Br and Cl atom  reactions with aldehydes and ketones, the reactions between BrO and ClO radicals,  and the role of anions in catalyzing aqueous phase oxidation of the bromide ion. This  work will be conducted using ab initio computational methods.       (3)  Development and application of highly sensitive and selective methods for   the mea surement of carbonyl compounds. This instrument will be used in future field   projects in the Arctic. The results of the laboratory, field and computational studies  will be integrated into a box model of the detailed chemistry occurring in the Arctic  marine boundary layer.       (4)  The Purdue Mesoscale Model will be refined for application to the Arctic.  The modified and optimized model will then be tested against observational data from  the Arctic, followed by incorporation of the box-model chemistry.  ***",
