 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9527558  Riley   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will result in the development of quality manufacturing procedures for the cost-effective production of high-performance Oxide Dispersion Strengthened Silver (ODS-Ag) sheathed High-Temperature Superconductor (HTS) wire.  We have demonstrated in our successful Phase I Research that novel ODS-Ag materials fabricated using internal oxidation of a dilute Ag-alloy precursor are viable advanced sheathing materials for HTS wire that will enhance the mechanical and electrical properties of the resulting composite.  Using Total Quality Management (TQM) principles, we will build on our Phase I achievements and develop quality manufacturing procedures associated with the qualification and processing of dilute Ag-alloys.  In our approach, we will address the underlying technical and economic factors associated with raw material procurement, processing, and quality assurance.  Success in our Phase II program will result in dilute Ag-alloy qualification procedures optimized for the quality manufacture of high-performance ODS-Ag sheathed HTS wire, ultimately leading to a product with an incrementally improved price to performance ratio.   The successful development of cost-effective ODS-Ag sheathed HTS wire will significantly accelerate and broadly enable a multiplicity of HTS bulk applications.  The increased strength and robustness of the improved wire will benefit such mechanically demanding applications as Power Transmission Cables, Motors, and Generators.  Similarly, the improved alternating current performance of the improved wire will benefit such electrically demanding applications as Transformers, Inductors, and Fault Current Limiters.",
