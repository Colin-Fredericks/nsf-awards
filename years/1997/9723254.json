 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dighton  9723254         The PIs understanding of how biodiversity and ecological function  are linked is not well understood. Ectomycorrhizal (plant-fungal)  associations of tree roots provide an ideal model to study this linkage  because ectomycorrhizal fungi are (i) widespread, (ii) may have different  potentials to acquire nutrients and (iii) are affected by anthropogenic  stresses, such as pollution.       This project will be the first to detail effects of species  diversity and composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi on tree seedlings  growth and nutrient uptake. The PI will compare the ability of single and  multiple infections of ectomycorrhizas to take up essential nutrients and  determine whether this capacity is influences by mycorrhizal community  structure.       In this initial phase of the work the PIs' will prove their ability  to use the two main proposed methodologies, that: (i) measuring the  kinetics of P uptake into ectomycorrhizal mycelia in culture and on  infected root tips; and (ii) production of tree root systems with defined  community structures of 1, 2 and 4 species combinations of  ectomycorrhizal fungi. Under the current budget, the PI will use only  radioactive 32p in the uptake studies as it can be measured using on-site  facilities Also because the PI can not purchase a climate-controlled  growth cabinet, results from the initial trials may show a greater  variability than originally intended.",
