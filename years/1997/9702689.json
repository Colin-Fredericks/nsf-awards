 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702689  Ford    This award supports a six month Science and Technology  Agency Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. Mark Ford at the  Mechanical Engineering Laboratory (MEL), Agency for  Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan.  Dr. Ford  will work with Dr. Masahiko Onda, Director of the  Instrumentation and Control Division at the Mechanical  Engineering Laboratory on a research project entitled,  \"Study of High Altitude, Long Range Observational Platform.\"    The proposed research will focus on a variety of topics,  including system optimization, propulsor development,  computational fluid dynamic modelling, and alternative  energy source creation, all of which are connected to the  development of an advanced, highly maneuverable, lighter  than air vehicle -- hereafter called HALROP (High Altitude  Long Range Observational Platform).  As a multi-role  platform, HALROP will accommodate different payloads,  specific examples being: 1) land, sea, and air mobile  communications, environmental and remote sensing; 2)  observation and repair of the ozone layer; 3) space  observation, and; 4) cargo delivery.  The fundamental  requirement shared by these various applications is the long-  duration maintenance of a high-altitude, stationkeeping  position.  Solar power, active boundary layer control, and a  novel hull shape are three of the key technologies that will  enable this next generation airship to fulfill the stated  research requirements.    The proposed research addresses both applied and fundamental  engineering science issues, with the Mechanical Engineering  Laboratory being unique in that it is currently exploring  all the research agendas associated with the proposal.  Mark  Ford and Masahiko Onda are among the leading researchers in  the world in this project, and the collaborative effort will  likely yield positive and mutually beneficial results for  the United States and Japan.  ***",
