 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Matthew B. Zimmt, of the Department of Chemistry at Brown   University, is supported by the Organic Dynamics Program and the Office   of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences   Directorate for his exploration of solvent-mediated electronic coupling   in electron transfer and energy transfer reactions.  The mediation of   electronic coupling between an electron donor and an electron acceptor by   the surrounding medium represents an essential element in chemical and   biological electron transfer.  Through the synthesis of a family of   molecules bearing donor and acceptor moieties attached to a common rigid   spacer, Professor Zimmt explores the role of intervening solvents in   electron transfer processes, addressing the generality of   solvent-mediated coupling in electron-mediated and hole-mediated   processes, the dependence of solvent-mediated coupling on solvent   properties and on donor-bridge-acceptor electronic symmetry, the effects   of interference between solvent- and bond-mediated coupling, and the   relevance of solvent-mediated electronic coupling to triplet energy   transfer.  Reactions in which an electron is transferred from one molecule to   another form the basis of a wide range of important chemical and   biological processes, including the photosynthetic capture and   utilization of energy from sunlight by plants.  With the support of the   Organic Dynamics Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities   of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, Professor Matthew   B. Zimmt, of the Department of Chemistry at Brown University, studies   chemical factors influencing the transfer of an electron from one   molecule to another.  By constructing molecules designed to hold the   donor and the acceptor of the electron with a well-defined orientation   and spacing with respect to one-another, Professor Zimmt examines the   role of intervening solvent molecules in mediating the electron transfer   process.  These model studies shed light on the fundamental factors   controlling biological electron transfer reactions and are of additional   relevance to areas such as the design and construction of molecular-scale   electronic devices.",
