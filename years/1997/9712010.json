 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712010    This proposal is for a Small Grant for Exploratory Research  which evaluates  the nature of interdisciplinary efforts in Civil  Infrastructure Systems  (CIS) research.  It acts as a pre-test of the Principal  Investigator's work  on the policy impacts of disciplinary models of decision  making in the  context of infrastructure policy making.  It is hypothesized  that the  impact of self-selection into professions and the  educational and  professional socialization into those professions shapes how  infrastructure  decisions are made.  Consequently, the potential for  interdisciplinary  understanding is increased.  The SGER will investigate this  condition in  attempting multidisciplinary CIS research.    The project will:  1) develop a clear understanding of NSF's  CIS-related  programmatic research portfolio; 2) develop a similar  understanding for  research and development at other federal and state  agencies; 3) identify  interdisciplinary CIS-related centers or institutes in the  U.S. and  throughout the world and describe their focus and expertise;  4) evaluate  the interdisciplinary nature of NSF-CIS awards; 5) identify  stakeholder  organizations to be partners and initiate discussions of  research and  development partnerships; 6) develop interdisciplinary  framing of basic CIS  research needs; and 7) posit the impacts of the results on  the future of  engineering education.  ***",
