 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9723216  Post-transcriptional regulation of the  Drosophila cholinergic genes   PI: Toshihiro Kitamoto         Neurons use a variety of molecules as  neurotransmitters to communicate with their target cells.  Specification of particular neurotransmitter phenotypes  (enzymes required for transmitter synthesis and release) is  a  fundamental process for orderly construction and  operation of neural  circuits, and requires coordinated  expression of a particular set of  neurotransmitter-specific  genes.  The objective of this proposed  research is to  understand the regulatory mechanism for two cholinergic  neuron-specific genes, encoding choline acetyltransferase  (ChAT) for  biosynthesis of acetylcholine and vesicular  acetylcholine transporter   (VAChT) for packaging  acetylcholine into synaptic vesicles.  It has  recently been  demonstrated that the ChAT and VAChT genes are organized  into a \"cholinergic\" locus where the latter gene is nested  within the  former.  This unique organization of the  cholinergic locus, conserved  among distantly related  species, suggests that novel  post-transcriptional  mechanisms are involved in coordinated regulation of these  two genes.  The project will thus specifically focus on mRNA  processing and translation mechanisms of the ChAT and VAChT  genes using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism.  First, transgenic animals  that carry appropriate reporter  genes will be created using P-element mediated  transformation technology available for Drosophila.  The  mechanisms for ChAT and VAChT production will be  investigated by  qualitative and quantitative analyses of  reporter gene expression in  the nervous system of the  transformants.  Second, Drosophila VAChT mutants will be  isolated and their phenotypes will be carefully  characterized.  VAChT mutants together with already  available ChAT  mutants will be used to examine the effects  of altered acetylcholine metabolism on regulation of the  cholinergic genes.  The proposed  research using molecu lar  and classical genetics will provide a clearer  picture of  interesting new mechanisms regulating coordinated expression  of the two cholinergic genes.",
