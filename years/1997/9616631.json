 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9616631  Nehrir    In order to fully utilize the transmission capacity of transmission lines, significant advances need to be achieved in power system control as applied to the damping of low frequency electromechanical oscillations.  Power system stability characteristics generally restrict the maximum allowable power transfers on transmission lines to be significantly below power transfers at thermal limits of the lines.  The stability characteristics of power systems depend on damping devices and damping control strategies employed.  While there are many devices that can be used in power systems to achieve damping, the strategies that are currently used to control these devices generally do not provide enough stability enhancement to enable operation of transmission lines near their thermal limits.  The development of better damping control strategies for large power systems is the focus of this research.    The characterization of large power systems in real time is difficult because of random load changes and time-varying operating conditions.  One avenue to controlling systems that are not precisely characterized is fuzzy logic control (FLC).  FLC is a branch of intelligent control that currently is receiving considerable attention.  In the power systems area, several studies have been conducted recently on the use of FLC in small power systems.    In this research, we propose to explore ways in which FLC can be configured with power system control devices such as power system stabilizers and static VAR compensators to dampen low-frequency oscillations in large-scale power systems.  The first phase of the research will consist of a fundamental study to determine how FLC's can be structured in multiple-device nonlinear dynamic systems to increase damping and to enhance stability robustness.  Some preliminary design considerations in this regard are described in this proposal.  In the second phase of the research, methods of FLC design will be developed for use in conjunction with power  system control devices for robust damping of low-frequency local and interarea oscillations in large-scale power systems.  Alternative design strategies such as supplementary FLC and FLC with supervisory control and adaptive versions of fuzzy controllers suitable for application to large-scale power systems will be developed to account for wide variations in the system operating conditions.  Methods of tuning fuzzy controller parameters will be explored using advanced signal analysis and identification algorithms.    Several simulation models will be used.  Initially, controller design methodologies and performance will be evaluated on a basic three-machine, nine-bus power system.  This will be followed by a fundamental study and evaluation of their use on more complex systems, including a reduced-order (17-machine, 46-bus) model of the western North American power system.    The proposed research is a collaborative effort between the Department of Electrical Engineering at Montana State University (MSU) and that at the University of New Mexico (LTNM).  The lead institution will be MSU with primary expertise in power systems and control.  The University of New Mexico will participate in the work (20% of the effort), with primary expertise in fuzzy systems, and will explore conditions under which fuzzy logic control can guarantee stability of large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems with multiple oscillatory modes.  The work will foster collaborative efforts between faculty and graduate students at the two universities.  The research should advance the state of the art both in power system damping and FLC.  It will also have a big impact on graduate and undergraduate education; direct student involvement at both graduate and undergraduate levels has been planned.  One of the research tasks will involve participation of undergraduate students in the implementation of FLC controllers on laboratory-scale power systems.  Results of the research will be presented at appropriate conferences and will be pu blished in technical journals.",
