This information  should assist in defining a class of systems exhibiting  singularities including turbulent dissipation fluctuations,  self-focusing in nonlinear optical systems, cavitation  phenomena and sonoluminescence, and gravitational  singularities.  The experimental surface waves are produced  using a Faraday apparatus (vertically oscillated tank).  This proposal focuses on three aspects:  determination of  the threshold value for singularity formation, understanding  the time dynamics of states exhibiting singularities, and  finally pursuing local models for the structure of the  singularities.  The continued development of  undergraduate research and  improvement of the undergraduate course work are at the core  of the teaching plans.  The research investigating gree  surface singularities is integrated with a program of  involving undergraduate and graduate students in the  experiments.  %%%  This is a CAREER project to study local singularities or  local blow-up of some pare of a system.  Such singularities  play an important role in the behavior of a number of  physical systems such as turbulence, burn-out of lasers and  optical fibers, cavitation, and singular objects due to  gravity:  black holes.  Significant mysteries exist about  what classes of motion and what types of singularities arise  in physical systems.  The droplets, spray and foam produced  by breaking waves on a beach and in deep water are examples  of singularities on a liquid surface.  This project studies  liquid surface singularities to aid in both the knowledge of  liquid motion, and the general understanding of physical  sysstems exhibiting singularities.  The continued development of undergraduate research and  improvement of the undergraduate course work are at the core  of the teaching plans.  The research investigating liquid  singula rities is integrated with a program of involving  undergraduate and graduate students in the experiments.  ***",
