This annual gathering of Computer Science educators is the premier of its type in that nation, and to which many aspiring awardees gather.  This proposal is directed at providing this group with an understanding of the programs and processes of DUE within the Foundation, and to provide specific guidance on successful proposal preparation.  Prior activities in this area have been highly successful resulting in higher quality proposals, and a larger quantity.  It is an excellent outreach to the Computing community.",
