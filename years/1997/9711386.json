 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tabled resolution for general logic programs has been shown  to be effective in declaratively solving complex  applications, including program verification through model  checking, and program analysis for optimizing compilers.  Efficient implementations of the above applications have  been built using the XSB tabled logic programming system,  which perform at least as well as existing implementations  consisting of much larger programs written in lower level  languages. The project is aimed at improving the  expressiveness, efficiency and ease of use of tabled logic  programming systems. The main goals of this project  are: (a) To study the interaction of constraint solving with  tabled resolution, a combination that considerably increases  the expressiveness of tabled logic programming systems.  (b)To design techniques for optimizing tabled constraint  logic programming systems by extending traditional factoring  and indexing to constraints, and by selective tabling. (c)  To construct tools for high-level debugging of tabled logic  programs.  Tabling and constraints have both separately  introduced a new level of declarativeness to traditional  logic programming systems. The combination of tabling and  constraints enables encoding of problems that cannot be  solved declaratively using either individual paradigm.  Tabled constraint logic programming thus promises to be a  significant step towards realizing the ideal of declarative  programming.",
