 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project investigates protocols to support group  communication services in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)  networks.  As ATM networks are increasingly used to provide  services in telecommunications networks and the Internet, there  is a pressing need for flexible and extensible group  communication protocols that exploit features of ATM in order to  offer high performance services to group-based applications.  Important issues that must be addressed in providing group  services include construction and maintenance of multipoint  connections, group membership management, and consensus on a  group leader.  This research explores novel solutions to all  three problems that take advantage of the underlying link-state  routing (LSR) algorithm used to support point-to-point  communication.  Specifically, by modeling various aspects of  group communication as consensus problems under LSR, robust and  efficient solutions are developed to support multiple types of  multipoint connections, fault-tolerant leader/membership  consensus, and even improvements to LSR itself.  The resulting  protocols are intended to provide new group services both within  individual ATM networks as well as across interconnected,  hierarchical ATM networks.  Additional and updated information on  this project can be found at http://www.cps.msu.edu/~mckinley/atm.",
