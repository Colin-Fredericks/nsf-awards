 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706862    Lin    The main theme of this proposal is the rigorous mathematical  theory of defects in condensed matter physics. Of special interest are   defects in liquid crystals and vortices (filaments) in superconductors. One  describes the geometrical properties, topological structures, and  dynamical behavior of these defects by analyzing the so-called defect  measures. It is a rather formidable task. For liquid crystals one has to  study first a certain nonlinear coupling of equations of Navier-Stokes type  with those of evolutionary approximate harmonic map systems. For  superconductivity, one studies then the flow of Yang-Mills with certain  nonlinear effects (Eliashberg-Gorkov equations). The next key issues  are understanding the development of singularities of solutions, such as  energy concentrations, sharp interfaces, and bubbling phenomena. In  particular, one must examine singularities in the flow of harmonic and  approximate harmonic maps and the dynamics of vortices and filaments in  Ginzburg-Landau equations. This study should also  give insight into other problems that arise in classical fluid dynamics.         Various natural phenomena can be described by solutions of certain  partial differential equations. Often singular behavior of solutions reveal  not only facets but also essential characteristics of the problems they  describe. The latter is very important for technological and industrial  applications. For example, the type II superconductors (high-temperature  super-conductors) are characterized by the existence of a certain lattice structure  of vortices and filaments. To  control the dynamics of these  vortices and  filaments is one of the central issues for the applicability of these   high-tech materials. It is, therefore, a very basic problem of continuing  interest. Despite many serious efforts, very few mathematical methods exist  so far to tackle such problems. The present proposal presents  a new and novel theoretical approach which has already been shown, by   preliminary analysis, to be useful for a class of problems arising in  material science. Modern technology needs high performance, high energy  efficiency, and high accuracy. Both liquid crystals and superconductors are  in such a category. This study will yield new and insightful qualitative  and quantitative information regarding these fascinating materials, in  addition to having its own intrinsic mathematical importance and interest.",
