 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Mallik's research focuses on the design, synthesis and   evaluation of liposome based receptors for protein surfaces.   Mixed   liposomes derived from metal containing lipids, polymerizable ionic   lipids, and polymerizable hydrogen bonding lipids are equilibrated with   the template protein carbonic anhydrase to create a three-dimensional,   complementary replica of the protein surface.   Synthetic targets include   lipids containing differing head groups and photopolymerizable diene or   diyne tails that, after equilibration, are photochemically polymerized to   achieve a semi-rigid, protein-specific receptor. Efficacy of the   photopolymerized template synthesis is quantified by measuring the   protein-replica binding constants.  Educational activities include   introducing a graduate bio-organic course and addressing undergraduate   needs by establishing a Virtual Organic Chemistry classroom on the Web to   facilitate student-teacher communication.     With this CAREER award, the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   research and educational activities of Professor Sanku Mallik of the   Department of Chemistry at the University of North Dakota.   Professor   Mallik's research is focused on the creation of a three-dimensional   protein recognition surface by using a specific protein to direct the   formation of a collection of molecules with which it interacts.    Subsequent chemical linking of these molecules into a polymer effectively   leaves a footprint of the protein in the resulting polymer.   In contrast   to the considerable synthetic effort involved in other approaches to   molecular recognition, this approach is expected to generate simply and   rapidly a highly specific binding site for the target protein.     Professor Mallik's educational activities include developing a graduate   curriculum targeting the interface between organic and biological   chemistry and facilitating student-teacher communication through a   Virtual Classroom on the Web.",
