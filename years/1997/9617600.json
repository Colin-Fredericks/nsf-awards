 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated computational environment for computer-aided  mechanical design will be developed and tested.  The environment  will support the key design tasks of function validation,  dynamical simulation, parametric design, and functional  tolerancing for a broad range of mechanical assemblies, such as  camera shutter mechanisms, part feeders, robotic arms, and  computer housings.  The research will address the fundamental  task of computing the effects of part contacts on function.  Contact analysis is difficult and time-consuming even for  experienced designers due to the quantity and complexity of the  contact constraints in modern assemblies.  The difficulty is  greatest in assemblies with multiple contacts, meaning that  different parts interact at various stages of the work cycle.  There is no general purpose software for contact analysis.  Contact analysis will be studied within the configuration space  representation of mechanical function.  Configuration space  computation algorithms will be extended to the full range of  planar assemblies and to selected spatial assemblies.  Algorithmic support will be developed for the design tasks via  configuration space manipulation.  The software will emphasize  breadth of coverage, depth of analysis, and robustness.",
