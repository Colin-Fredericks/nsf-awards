 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the evaluation of system integration   solutions to computer-aided assembly planning. Three solutions of system   integration are considered. First, an assembly design viewer and a process   specification system are included in system integration. Second, an assembly   modeling system is added and integrated with an assembly design viewer and a   process specification system. Third, functions of assembly design viewing,   process specification and production simulation are integrated in a virtual   reality system. Production engineers from the manufacturing industry will   participate in an experiment. The three solutions together with three   packages of application software will be presented to production engineers.   For each solution, subjects will be asked to use the corresponding package   of application software to perform assembly planning. Subject performance   will be measured. Subjects will also be given a questionnaire to obtain   their subjective evaluation of the three solutions. Both objective data from   the experiment and subjective data from the questionnaire will be analyzed.   Based on the results, a system integration solution for computer-aided   assembly planning will be recommended. The proposed work will be performed   in collaboration with researchers at the National Institute of Standards and   Technology (NIST).  The results of this research will reveal the advantages and disadvantages   of various system integration solutions for computer-aided assembly   planning. The recommended solution of system integration will lead to the   future research and development of knowledge, technology and commercial   software products towards an effective system integration for   computer-aided assembly planning. The proposed work will directly   contribute to the NIST System Integration for Manufacturing Applications   Program. The exchange of knowledge, experience and technology with NIST   researchers will spin off new collaborative relationships and projects.",
