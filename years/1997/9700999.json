Massachusetts Amherst          This proposal seeks support for research in the molecular modeling of two important aspects of fluid behavior in porous materials.  Both concern the role of the adsorbent microstructure.  Traditionally this has been analyzed in terms of the behavior of fluid in single pores.  Although this analysis has led to important insights into the problem, recent research in this group and others has shown that important effects occur which cannot be understood on the basis of single pore behavior.  Effects associated with confinement, wetting and adsorbent disorder are all significant in determining the behavior and these effects are coupled.  A program of research using computer simulation and theory is planned.  Among the issues to be explored are:  extending the range of adsorbent microstructures considered; analysis of hysteresis loops in adsorption/desorption isotherms; further development and application of theoretical techniques; and investigation of fluid mixture phase separation in such systems.    The second area for study involves the role of  structural deformations in the absorbent microstructure during adsorption.  In almost all thermodynamic treatments of physical  adsorption it has been assumed that the adsorbent is a rigid matrix that is not structurally altered upon adsorption.  While this is an excellent approximation in most circumstances there are now important examples where experiments provide evidence of significant structural deformations on adsorption.  A program to study these phenomena using Monte  Carlo computer simulation is suggested.  The goals are to evaluate different models for adsorbent flexibility, develop methods for calculating the thermodynamic properties needed for a study of phase transitions in such systems and to develop insights into when such structural deformation may have a significant impact on the system.",
