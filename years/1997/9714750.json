 "awd_abstract_narration": "As computer communication networks evolve from offering best-effort   service to offering real-time services with stringent Quality of Service   (QoS) guarantees (e.g. video), the need for improved fault management   techniques increases. Network fault management is an open problem that   continues to increase in complexity.  A major cause of the increase in   complexity of this problem is the heterogeneity of networks. Networks of   today are comprised of a variety of technologies (e.g. Wireless, ATM,   Ethernet), that are expected to support a diverse set of networked   applications (file transfer, WWW, video conferencing).  The fault   management problem has been studied in varying degrees for different   technologies, but there are many open issues  29 , 40 , and we are   unaware of any methods that can effectively be applied across   technologies. Current methods are largely ad hoc and rely on the expertise   of a human network manager. Even within single-technology networks   (e.g. Ethernet LANs), strategies developed for one network, cannot be   easily generalized to other networks.  In addition, the rate of change  within   a network makes it difficult for the network manager to maintain a high   enough level of expertise to develop and maintain effective fault   management strategies.  New techniques that can be generalized and   applied across technologies are needed to ensure network reliability in an   efficient manner.      The long-term goal of this research is to automate as much of network   management as possible.  Within network management, we will first focus   on fault management.  Along these lines, the plan is to develop methods   for fault management that (1) can be applied across different technologies,   (2) can generalize from network to network, and (3) can adapt to changes   in the network. Previous research  12 , 13 , 14  has demonstrated that   adaptive statistical techniques can be used for network fault detection.   These types of techniques use the network measur ements to learn the   behavior of the network and can thus be generalized.  The goal for this   planning period is to identify a set of  problems within fault management   that can be addressed using rigorous, generalizable methods.    Fault management encompasses a large, complex set of problems that   have not been well studied or defined.  Before methods are evaluated, the   problems to be addressed must be identified.  Each network technology   will be studied in terms of fault management, and a set of issues that are   common across all or most of the technologies will be extracted.   For   each of the problems that are identified, the feasibility of using automated   techniques and generalization will be evaluated.  Preliminary results will   be obtained using the TCP/IP test network.  The result of the planning   activities will be a research direction that is focused on a set of feasible   problems that are widely applicable across network technologies.   A web   page will be created for the fault management research planning project.    The web page will contain a description of the activities and results   obtained.  The URL of the web page will be  http://www.nml.csam.iit.edu/~planning/.",
