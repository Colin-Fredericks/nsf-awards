 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9723749  Maddock          In order to understand how cell growth and division occur, it is necessary to determine how proteins that normally control the timing of cell division work.  Central players in this process are GTP-binding proteins.  These proteins act as cellular switches, receiving input signals and then transmitting the signal to downstream proteins.  The activity of the GTP-binding proteins is usually modified by other specific proteins.  Recently, a new family of GTP-binding proteins has been found in many different kinds of organisms.  This evolutionary conservation between distantly related species suggests that this family of GTP-binding proteins has a fundamental, though currently unknown, cellular role(s).  The goal of this research is  to understand the cellular role of this GTP-binding protein and to define the relationship between this protein and interacting proteins.  These studies will be in the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus.  Caulobacter is the ideal model system to dissect the role of this protein since cell cycle studies are easily performed and all of the molecular and genetic advantages of a bacterial system can be exploited.   Due to the conservation of these GTP-binding proteins this work is likely to have application in other systems.  %%%    This research is looking at the function of an essential protein, a GTPase, which is conserved from archea and bacteria to humans.  The evolutionary conservation suggests that this protein has a fundamental role, and the objective of this research is to determine that role.    ***",
