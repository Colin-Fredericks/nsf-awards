 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns personal social relationships between people of different demographic backgrounds, such as friendships between African-Americans and whites.  The investigator presents a partial theory of the social structural constraints on demographic heterogeneity in personal networks.  She will undertake a visiting professorship at Northwestern University to enable her to refine the theory, develop specific hypotheses, and do preliminary data analysis in preparation for a full-scale empirical test of the resulting theory.  The project broadly addresses one striking regularity about personal networks: almost all of our close personal contacts are demographically similar to us.  Present theory stresses that a person's involvement in a homogeneous organizational setting increases the propensity to form network connections with demographically similar others.  A more comprehensive theory of heterogeneity in personal networks will take into account organizational membership dynamics  and people's participation in multiple organizational settings.  The investigator lays out this theory, pointing out new hypotheses that will be tested.  The scientific implications of the theory to be developed range widely because personal networks are a crucial part of the social landscape surrounding individuals.  Networks affect individual outcomes ranging from labor market position to mental health.  Personal networks also affect diversity within and across organizations, as well as organizational survival.  As a result, a theory of personal network formation helps to explain basic stratification processes.  Furthermore, this project and its results are extremely important to a society whose members differ by race, religion, sex, age, and education.  We need a deeper understanding of heterogeneous personal networks because the relationships in them cross-cut these cleavages, providing the stable foundation for an integrated society.  Network connections between, for example, African-Americans and whites, or people with high and low levels of education, can ensure that our society, although differentiated by race and education, is not divided by them.  This POWRE award will assist the investigator in her primary research goal for the next few years.  Taking a position as Visiting Assistant Professor will allow her to interact with organizational scholars and social network researchers in a new setting.  The theoretical and empirical results of this larger project will not only contribute to the existing research literature and thus the investigator's visibility in her field, but will also assist her in her teaching and mentoring roles.",
