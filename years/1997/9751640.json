 "awd_abstract_narration": "Remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) have become important tools in research and environmental analysis and management.  These techniques allow for effective hypothesis testing in environmental research.  Access to equipment and training at the undergraduate level are vital to the preparation of science students for graduate school and future employment.  This is especially critical for minority students who are underrepresented in these disciplines.  In response to this situation, the Dominguez Hills Information Technology (DoIT) Laboratory is being developed through this project.  The laboratory focuses on the integration of remote-sensing and GIS technologies.  The missions of the laboratory are (l) making available technical training in the earth and environmental sciences to student groups that traditionally have not had access to such programs and to future elementary and secondary school teachers, (2) providing access to remote-sensing facilities and instruction for students of the four other state university campuses in the southern California area which cannot be supported by their home departments, including extension programs; (3) providing area community colleges an avenue for their science technology students to seamlessly progress into a 4-year academic institution, and (4) providing access to communications, data and programs now available on the internet through the recently installed Internet backbone.  *",
