 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723244  Momany  The overall goal of this research project is to develop novel crystallization strategies based on the design of self-assembling matrices (SAMs).  To create these SAMs, sophisticated molecular techniques and combinatorial libraries will be used to engineer antibody fragments and other relevant macromolecules that crystallize with large voids that can accommodate additional target macromolecules.  The target for which a structure is desired would be carried into the lattice though specific interactions selected though Phage Display panning.  A SAM-based method of crystallization will significantly increase the rate of crystal structure determinations and thus make practical crystallography associated with genome-projects.  The approach is ideal for crystallizing macromolecules such as peptide hormones, carbohydrates, RNA, DNA, and membrane-bound or glycosylated proteins that have resisted standard empirically-based crystallization strategies in the past.  By creating a mechanism that avoids empirical crystallization screens, this SAM-based approach can have a significant impact on the entire field of structural biology.  ***",
