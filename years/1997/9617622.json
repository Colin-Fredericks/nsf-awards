In particular, a child's age has been shown to influence jurors' judgments of the child's credibility.  Two pilot experiments are being conducted at this time.  The first is designed to explore the utility of using q-sort techniques for assessing adults' stereotypes of children of various ages.  In the second, adults will hear testimony of a child.  The age of the child will be manipulated.  The range of ages adults find believable will be evaluated.  The results of these pilot studies will inform the development of a complete proposal designed to advance scientific knowledge of stereotyping and of jurors' decision making.  %%%  This research focuses on the factors that influence jurors' perception of child witnesses.
