In this grant he is planning to work on a variety  of problems in statistical mechanics of superconductivity  and magnetism.  There are three different projects:  One  project concerns with the PI's long standing interest, a  general theory of topological phase transitions.  A second  project concerns the properties of high frequency plasma  resonance in layered superconductors.  Finally a third  project is to study the role of steps and other defects in  the magnetization of thin magnetic films.  %%%  The PI of this grant is a senior distinguished theoretical  physicist from the former Soviet Union with a series of  honors (Lenin Prize) and a number of accomplishments to his  credit.  He is planning a research program to study the role  of defects and microstructures in the thermodynamic  properties e.g. phase transitions and in the electromagnetic  response.   The work has applications in the general area of  the properties of superconductors and magnets.  ***",
