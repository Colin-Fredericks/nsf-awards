 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Buzzard  9706018    This project has three components.  The first component is the study of the dynamics of polynomial maps of two variables.  The primary goal of this component is to show that the topological notion of Omega stability is equivalent to the analytic notion of hyperbolicity.  Similar programs have led to a great deal of activity and many new results in the fields of one complex variable dynamics and real dynamics.  The second component is the study of polynomial mappings of three variables using techniques of pluripotential theory.  Pluripotential theory has been an effective tool in the study of the dynamics of polynomial mappings of one and two variables.  The main goal of this component is to determine the extent to which this tool can be applied to higher dimensional polynomial diffeomorphisms, whose dynamics have been studied very little.  The third component is the classification of algebraic surfaces in terms of a weak notion of hyperbolicity.  The main goal of this component is to show that the existence of a rank-two holomorphic map from complex 2-space to an algebraic surface is equivalent to the existence of a Zariski dense image of the complex plane.     The main focus of this project is the study of iterated maps, which are mathematical abstractions for processes which are repeated many times.  Such repeated processes are commonly found in many diverse fields.  For instance, many biological processes, such as DNA replication, are simple procedures which are repeated many times.  More directly related to the current project is the notion of a genetic algorithm, which is an attempt to use some of the features of biological reproduction, such as genetic crossover and competition, to produce effective computer algorithms.  The crossover part of this procedure can be modeled by iterated maps very similar to those under study in the current project.  An important feature of repeated processes is that many times, a slight change in the parameters of a process which  is repeated many times can lead to a drastic change in the final outcome.   While this may be desirable behavior in some cases, it is more common to prefer systems which are reliable and relatively unaffected by small errors or changes in conditions.  Hence it is natural to ask which processes are stable in the sense that a small change in parameters leads to a small change in the final outcome.  Resolving this question for some systems is the primary aim of the current project.",
