 "awd_abstract_narration": "9600920  Campbell  The research portion of this CAREER proposal concerns RNases  H, widely distributed enzymes found in systems ranging from  retroviruses to humans.  They specifically degrade the RNA  strands of RNA:DNA duplex hybrids, an important function in  DNA replication.  The distribution of RNases H further  suggests that they are centrally positioned to regulate key  decisions in DNA replication and nucleic acid metabolism in  all biological systems.  Dr. Campbell will initiate studies  to establish the roles played by RNases H in eukaryotic DNA  replication and cell growth using the protozoan Trypanosoma  brucei. Expression patterns of the major RNase H, TbbRNHI,  of T. Brucei will be established; activity patterns of the  expressed and purified recombinant enzyme will be defined;  and mutations that result in catalytically altered enzyme  will be identified.  The educational plan consists of adding  innovative changes to a new course recently introduced into  the Brown undergraduate curriculum and implementing a  program to mentor and ignite under-represented minority  student learning and scientific interest.    RNase H is an enzyme that specifically degrades the RNA  strand of DNA:RNA hybrids (H for hybrid). The RNase family  is widely distributed, found in systems ranging from  retroviruses to humans. They are function in controlling the  replication of DNA, and thus are critical to the life cycles  of retroviruses as well as eukaryotic organisms.  In this  project, the role of RNase H in a complex organism, the  protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, will be studied in an effort  to learn more about their function in cells. The education  component adds innovative changes to a new course on  fundamental concepts in modern biology, as well as a program  to stimulate under-represented students to pursue academic  careers.  ***",
