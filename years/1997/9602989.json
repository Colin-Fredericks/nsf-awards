The workshop,  organized by Dr. David Micha, University of Florida with the  collaboration of senior scientists of several Latin American  institutions, will take place at the campus of the  University of Florida, on February 27 and 28, 1997.  The  purpose is to promote scientific contacts between scientists  in the U.S. and Latin America, aimed at developing  theoretical and computational methods applicable to problems  of common interest in  these sciences.    Materials science is a priority area both for this country  and throughout  the hemisphere, and the topics to be  discussed will address new methods to interpret data and to  predict phenomena in several areas of theoretical chemistry.  A book of the proceedings abstracts, including a summary of  discussion comments on present needs and expected future  trends, will be made available to scientists.  ***",
