 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704245  Shen    Research is proposed in two areas:  almost periodic differential equations   and lattice dynamical  systems. Recently, the principal investigator and a   collaborator systematically investigated the dynamics of various types of   almost periodic differential equations. Fundamental dynamical issues such   as the existence of almost periodic and almost automorphic solutions,   asymptotic behavior of bounded solutions, the structure of omega limit sets,   etc. have received a considerable amount of attention.  The principal   investigator and her collaborators also studied the global dynamics of some    almost periodic differential equations arising from biology and physics by   utilizing both the general  approach and theory established in the principal   investigator's joint works with Yi.  The principal investigator plans to   continue her research in almost periodic differential equations.  In   particular, she intends  to explore the global  dynamics of various almost   periodic population models such as migration-selection models and multiple   species competition models; to study almost periodically forced oscillators   such as  van der Pol oscillators and Josephson junctions;  to consider   spatially almost periodic parabolic equations; to find conditions on the   existence of almost periodic dynamics;  and to investigate  almost   automorphic dynamics in general differential equations.  In her recent work   and also in joint works with her collaborators, she studied the stability of   standing and traveling waves and the existence of chaotic dynamics in   lattice dynamical systems.  Among the results, an existence criterion for   chaotic dynamics in coupled map lattices is found; a moving coordinate   approach, which is different from but analogous to the traditional moving   coordinate approach in partial differential equations, is introduced to deal   with traveling waves; and various dynamics such as spatial chaos,   propagation failure, traveling waves, etc., are shown  to exist in  a discrete   Nagumo equation. The above works provide some insight into the complex   behavior of lattice dynamical systems.  Continuing her commitments in   lattice dynamical systemq, she would like to study the following problems    in the near future:  other possible routes such as bifurcations to chaotic   dynamics; existence and stability of traveling waves and the appearance of   synchronization.  Moreover, she intends to continue the analysis of the   dynamics in the discrete Nagumo equation; and to explore the dynamics in   lattice  population models.    Both almost periodic differential equations and lattice dynamical systems   are widely used as models for many  physical and biological problems.  For   example, in the population dynamics of a single species, the dynamics of   the species is described by an almost periodic reaction diffusion equation if   a continuous environment is inhabited, seasonal variation is accounted for   (note that  seasonal variation may  not be exactly periodic but rather almost   periodic) and there is another inherent periodic variation.  If the species   inhabits a patchy environment, then its dynamics are described by a lattice   ordinary differential equation.  Furthermore, if each individual of the   species migrates from patch to patch in a discrete time manner, then the   dynamics are characterized by a coupled map lattice.  Numerous other   examples are found in electric circuits, climate dynamics, image processing   and pattern recognition, material sciences, etc.  It is therefore of great   importance to study almost periodic differential equations and lattice   dynamical systems.  Though much research has been done, many scenarios   appearing in both areas are far from being well understood.  The principal   investigator proposes to do research in these two areas.  In particular, based   on her previous experience, she plans to study various models arising from   physics and biology such as competition models, almost periodically fo rced   oscillators, etc.  The proposed research is intended to be a mathematical   contribution to the qualitative and quantitative theory of almost periodic   differential equations and lattice dynamical systems, resulting in a better   understanding of complex behavior in these systems.",
