 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of racial identification in Brazil.  It has a methodological component, focusing on a difficult issue of measurement.  Analysts of race and ethnicity use data that generally code racial and ethnic categories on the basis of respondent self identification. However, self identification of race and ethnicity is often inconsistent with the way persons are socially classified. Therefore data based on respondent self identification may be inappropriate for measuring racial inequality or discrimination. Differences between these forms of racial classification are noteworthy in the case of Brazil. Comparisons of racial self identification with racial social identification in Brazil are possible for the first time due to data collected in a recent national survey. Using these data, this research project will examine how Brazilians self-identify by race and how this may deviate from their socially ascribed race.      The research will also study the determinants of racial self identification and the consequences of using self identification for estimating racial inequality. This phase of the work addresses six chief questions: (1) the extent to which self identification of race deviates from interviewer (or social) identification of race using census racial categories, (2) the extent to which there is a preference for ambiguous racial categories, (3) the extent to which there is a preference for the Afro-Brazilian identity affirmation category, (4) the impact of class and racial reference group variables, (5) influences of modernization and urbanization variables, and (6) whether social identification leads to estimates of racial inequality, and particularly income inequality, that are different from those based on self identification.      Results from this study will contribute to the scientific literature on theories of racial and ethnic identification, changing conceptions of race in Brazil, and racial inequality in Brazil.  Studying the scientific questions in a social environment ve ry different from that of the United States will provide a useful comparison that can help guide public responses to issues of race and ethnicity in America.",
