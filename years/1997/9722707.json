The systemic approach to refortn is                                becoming common because it recognizes                                and responds to this complexity ...

OVERVIEW                                                        Proposed Study Objectives                                       This revised proposal outlines a project designed to (i) synthesize and advance the  scientific foundations of assessment, (ii) monitor trends in science and mathematics assessment  in the U.S., and (i ii) improve public understanding of the purposes and meanings of  assessment and test scores. These three connected activities reflect a particular vision: of an  applied science of assessment that derives principles from basic science and builds on  systematic analysis of human learning processes in specific content areas.              At the core of this study is the recognition that advances in the science of human  learning over the last two or three decades provide a powerful scientific foundation for              97-CBASSE-266-01 (revised)                                      Page 1",
