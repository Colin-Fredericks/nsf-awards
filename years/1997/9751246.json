 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to rapid technological advances and changing student and employer needs, Florence-Darlington Technical College will enhance its Machine Tool Technology (MTT) laboratory instruction through a comprehensive infusion of state-of-the-art equipment, instructional software, and enhanced instructional design.  The project will improve the learning environment of MTT students - emphasizing higher levels of creative problem-solving, teamwork, problem analysis, creativity and computer skills - and will include the re-design of core Computer Numerical Control (CNC) theory courses that will directly impact more than 300 curriculum and continuing education students annually.  The project centers around a modern laboratory environment anchored by computers with specialized simulation software and computer-controlled lathes with industry-standard controls.  The laboratory environment will simulate that of industry and be enhanced by an inteactive, eam setting that more closely reflects the global work environment of the 21st century.  This approach will encourage students to learn how to learn, emphasizing creative problem-solving, effective communication skills, goal identification and evaluation,  and teamwork.  Students will be introduced to machining operations through exercises that combine practical, hands-on experience with creative problem-solving and project management within a team environment.  The concept of computer integration with the machining process will be taught by allowing students to perform experiments, develop scientific and technical skills in creating designs, run simulations, and produce a product using state-of-the-art technology.  Students will gain a greater working knowledge of the entire CNC process and will acquire key skills required by local business and industry.  The project will integrate traditional machine tool education with the in-demand skills of leadership, quality and reliability, production process, computer automation, and teamwork.  *",
