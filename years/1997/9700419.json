 "awd_abstract_narration": "James Hynes of the Chemistry Department of the University of Colorado is   funded by the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to   study the kinetic theory of prototype reactions in solutions, small   clusters and at surfaces.  Quantitative predictions and qualitative   interpretations will be provided for experiments. The calculations will   be carried out using quantum electronic structure methods, molecular   dynamics, analytic theories and models. The solution phase research will   focus in two areas: (1) Excited photon transfer reactions (ESPT) in which   acidity is dramatically increased by photoexcitation. (2) Reaction   dynamics in electrolytes. The dynamics of prototype unimolecular SN1   ionization reaction of tertiary butyl chloride in salt solutions will be   studied. Furthermore,  heterogeneous surface chemical reactions    responsible for the depletion of the ozone in the upper atmosphere will   be investigated.  By far the majority of reactions which are of interest to chemists take   place in the solution phase, and the most important solvent is water.    The effect which the presence of aqueous solvent has on a chemical   reaction is still not fully understood.   Hynes is applying a combination   of theory and computer simulations to determine the molecular nature of   solvent-solute interactions and their effect on the rates of chemical   reactions in solution.  He is also applying these theoretical methods to   studies of important environmental problems such as acid rain and ozone   depletion.",
