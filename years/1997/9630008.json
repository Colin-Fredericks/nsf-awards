The work is broad based, treating stratiform   orographic clouds and hailstorms over the northern High Plains.   Models have been developed at the South Dakota School of Mines and  Technology (SDSM&T) that simulate the development of clouds, rain,  snow, and hail.  Methods have been developed that treat the  numerical simulation of the seeding of convective and stratiform  clouds. The simulation of the seeding agent involves the release of  the agent, the spread of the seeding agent throughout the  atmosphere, and the interaction of the seeding agent with the  supercooled liquid water in the cloud.  Only in the past few years  have these methods been incorporated into fully three-  dimensional, time-dependent models. This allows, for the first  time, the many hypotheses of the cloud seeding community to be  tested in the strongest scientific frameworks, although many  useful insights and greater understanding have resulted from lesser  dynamic frameworks.          Studies of winter/spring situations will be carried out.  In  addition, the pattern of summer convection, as detected by radar  pattern climatology leads to much different precipitation patterns  than in the winter.  The Principal Investigators also will simulate  those patterns.  These summertime cloud situations will allow  testing of the effects of simulated seeding on the merging of cloud  cells, an important effect detected in field experiments in  previous research.          The seeding of hailstorms has been simulated and is revealing  intriguing results. Whether or not the storms have an active  coalescence process and the lifetime of the cells  determine the degree of response to the seeding.  Also, the timing  and the placement of the seeding material are important for the  seeding to be effective.  Further work is needed to  strengthen the theoretical basis.  The m odel being used for this  work simulates the formation and development of the precipitating  ice particle spectra.  Such detail is necessary if  conclusions are to be drawn concerning the effects of cloud seeding  on hailstorms.          The Principal Investigators also have developed models that  simulate the processes of atmospheric electricity in clouds.  The  numerical simulations of seeding effects on the storm s   microphysics will be applied to a vigorous thunderstorm and  analyzed as to their effects on the   storm electrification.          Successful completion of this research should lead to  increases in understanding of the microphysical processes involved  in precipitation production and storm electrification.",
