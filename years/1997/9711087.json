 "awd_abstract_narration": "9711087  Gauri  This proposal is to develop new durability factors, DF,  based on pore-size distribution., for calcareous porous  rocks, limestones and dolomites.  Existing criteria for rock  soundness are based upon the damage caused by the  crystallization of salt and freezing of water in the pores;  however, these criteria have often failed to predict  accurately the actual service life.    Wetting, freezing, salt crystallization, and expansion of  clays are the major sources of disruptive pressure that  develop in the pores of the stone.  The increase in pressure  in the pores given by dp -- 2-y ((dA) (dA)R)l where y is the  surface tension and A dV dV and V are the area and volume of  small (r) and large (R) pores, suggests that the pore size  distribution should be a fundamental factor in the  durability of stone.  Using mercury porosimetry to determine  pore-size distributions and by training the computational  method of Artificial Neural Network (ANN ), the PI has  developed durability factors (DF) for the differentially  weathered strata of the Sphinx. These predicted values  correlate well with the present condition of the strata  after their exposure to weathering for nearly 5000 years.    The proposed research plan will include older rocks, such as  the Mesozoic limestones of Texas and the Paleozoic  limestones found in Mid-America older rocks, where the  porosity has been altered by a variety of complex processes  concerned with the recrystallization of calcite.  Also  included will be even younger limestone from Florida of  Cenozoic and Quaternary age.  Dolomite will be studied as  representative carbonate rocks where porosity has been  completely altered. By extensive field study the PI plans to  develop a column or columns of weathered limestone,  irrespective of age, in which the strata are ordered  according to their durability and assigned DF from one to  ten.    Pore-size distributions will be determined for the  unweathered samples of these rocks obtained from the deeper  in terior or from nearby recent roadcuts and quarries.  These  distributions will be made the dependent variables while the  DF will be the independent variables in the training of ANN.  This proposal then aims at developing model equation(s) to  predict DF for many types of porosity distributions found in  limestone and dolomite.  ***",
