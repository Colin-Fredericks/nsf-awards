 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Florian Potra    DMS-9706894    Interior Point Methods for Semidefinite Programming    Abstract    Further investigation of interior point algorithms for semidefinite  programming (SDP) is proposed with emphasis on the study of global and  local convergence, infeasibility detection and software development.  While the vast majority of interior point methods for linear  programming (LP) have proven polynomial complexity, this is not the  case for SDP. The iteration complexity of interior point algorithms for  SDP and its dependence on the search direction as well as on the  central path neighborhood used by the algorithm will be investigated.  Locally superlinearly convergent algorithms will be identified within  the class of interior point methods for SDP with proven polynomial  complexity. Superlinear convergence is especially important for SDP  since no finite termination schemes exist for such problems. The local  convergence analysis for interior point algorithms for SDP is much more  challenging than those for LP and it will be a major focus point of the  project.  A C++ package for solving large-scale SDP problems will be  developed. The code will efficiently handle different sparsity patterns  arising in applications, and will provide refined infeasibility  detectors.    Semidefinite programming (SDP) represents one of the most important  classes of optimization problems with many applications in science and  engineering especially related to optimal control (in electrical  engineering), optimal allocation of resources (in economics and  manufacturing), structural optimization (in civil engineeering), etc.  According to a recent survey paper, semidefinite programming is ``the  most exciting development in mathematical programming in the 1990's''.  Until recently no efficient methods were known for solving general  semidefinite programming problems. In the late 80's it has been  realized that interior point methods, initially developed for linear  programming, can be successfully used  for solving semidefinite  programming problems. The advent of interior point methods has created  new opportunities for the application of SDP in science and  engineering. In order for these opportunities to materialize it is  important to provide the scientific community with a good theoretical  understanding of the behaviour of interior point methods for SDP and  with reliable and efficient software capable of solving large-scale SDP  problems.  The project will investigate some of the most critical  issues in the theory of semidefinite programming and will lead to the  design of efficient practical algorithms. The software resulting from  this project is likely to have a positive impact on several application  areas in science and technology.",
