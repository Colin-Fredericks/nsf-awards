 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710139  Thompson    This is an experimental and theoretical research effort on  the evolution of structure and the mechanical state of  polycrystalline films during thin metal film deposition and  during subsequent thermal processing.  The goal of the  research is to develop models and simulations which can be  used to predict the course of grain size, grain orientation  and stress evolution as a function of substrate, film and  capping layer material properties, while also considering  the deposition conditions and subsequent thermal history.  The stresses in films deposited on substrates are monitored  using wafer curvature measurements made while heating at  controlled and variable rates and while annealing at  different temperatures for different times.  Film material,  capping layers, film thickness, and film deposition  temperature are among the varied parameters in these  experiments.  In situ TEM observations explore grain  structure evolution in heated films on thin substrates which  impose a strain in the films due to differential thermal  expansion.  Texture of the films is monitored by X-ray  analyses.  %%%  As modeling and simulation capabilities evolve through  comparison with experiments, new quantitative capabilities  are developed for predicting grain structure, grain  orientation, and stress evolution. This  provides techniques  for processing of films with properties that are optimized  for specific engineering applications.  Polycrystalline  films are used in electronic, micromechanical, and magnetic  devices.  In these applications, the performance and  reliability of polycrystalline films are strongly affected  by their structure, specifically the distribution of grain  sizes and crystallographic orientations.  ***",
