 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702291  Van Zandt    An important area of research in cognitive psychology is how  information, whether directly impinging on the senses or  retrieved from memory, is transformed during cognition to allow  performance of simple tasks.  Understanding this process of  transformation provides the basis for understanding human  behavior more generally.  This research will emphasize a  theoretical, model-driven approach to the study of behavior, in  which a number of models of human information processing will be  developed and tested.  In particular, this research will use  neural network models and certain statistical models to explain  the interactions between behavioral variables (such as reaction  time, response accuracy and confidence) in memory retrieval  tasks.  In addition, the research will involve the construction  of biologically plausible models of simple decision-making in an  interdisciplinary, collaborative effort with Dr. Ernst Niebur of  the Zanvyl Krieger Mind/Brain Institute.  These models may  represent a step toward the development of biologically realistic  models of human cognition.    As psychological science becomes more specialized, students  require more mathematical and statistical training.  The research  and educational activities in this project will teach graduate  and undergraduate psychology students about modeling human  behavior.  Changes to the undergraduate psychology curriculum at  the Johns Hopkins University will incorporate laboratory and  research experience in introductory level experimental psychology  courses.  Redesigned statistics and experimental design courses  will emphasize computer methods and psychological applications.   As a result, Hopkins undergraduates will have a deeper  appreciation for scientific and quantitative methods in  experimental psychology.  Furthermore, students with interests in  cognition and neuroscience will have opportunities to do  collaborative research in these areas by assisting directly with  the research in this proj ect.    This research, assisted by undergraduates and graduate students,  will progress toward an understanding of the differences and  similarities between network models and more traditional  statistical models of cognition.  Finally, the application of  these kinds of dynamic models of cognition to problems in memory  retrieval will increase our understanding of the ways that humans  use information in making decisions about the world and  ultimately enable the development of automated methods to help  people make such decisions in more effective ways.    ***",
