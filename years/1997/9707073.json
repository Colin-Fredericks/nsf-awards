 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707073  Voorhees    Interfacial energy is the primary driving force for the  precipitate coarsening processing metal alloys in the  absence of elastic stresses.  As a result, the average  particle size increases monotonically with time, and large  particles grow at the expense of small particles.  In  contrast, in the presence of elastic stress, particles can  undergo inverse coarsening where small particles grow at the  expense of large particles, and large-scale particle  migration occurs in the solid.  Complete stabilization of  the two-phase mixture with respect to coarsening may be  possible.  In this research the coarsening process is  examined in elastically stressed solids both experimentally  and theoretically.  The experimental effort focuses on two  major unexplored aspects of the coarsening process in  elastically-stressed solids:  (1) the kinetics of the  coarsening over a wide range of average particle sizes, from  small average particle sizes, where the interfacial energy  is the dominant energy in the system, to large particle  sizes, where the elastic stress is the dominant energy in  the system, and (2) the three-dimensional morphology and  spatial arrangement of particles in the l ate stages of  coarsening.  The theoretical effort is directed toward  predicting the evolution of a statistically large system of  particles where the particle morphologies and locations  evolve in a manner that is consistent with the elastic and  diffusion fields in the system.  This effort should allow  the determination of statistically averaged quantities such  as the exponents and amplitudes of the temporal power laws  that describe the coarsening kinetics as well as the  development of the microstructure during coarsening.  %%%  The theory will be used to predict the coarsening kinetics  using parameters that will be measured in the experiments.  The theory will be sufficiently realistic that the  predictions can serve as a guide to the development of  coarsening-resistant coherent alloys.  * **",
