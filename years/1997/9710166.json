 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences   Directorate, Professor Edward L. Clennan, of the Department of Chemistry   at the University of Wyoming, studies the oxidation of organosulfur   compounds with molecular oxygen.  Professor Clennan examines the   reactions of dialkylsulfides with singlet oxygen, in which both physical   quenching and chemical reaction are observed, elucidating their   mechanisms by observing reactive intermediates such as O,S-sulfenyl   sulfinates and thiopersulfoxides.  The photooxidations of thiolanes and   1,3-dithianes are also explored, focusing on the formation and reactions   of hydroperoxy sulfonium ylides.  In order both to investigate the   fundamental influence of environment on organic sulfide oxidations and to   develop new synthetic methods, Professor Clennan examines the electron   transfer oxidation of 1,3-dithianes and the molecular oxidation of   sulfides in zeolite microenvironments.  Sulfur-containing organic compounds and their oxidation are matters of   considerable importance in a wide variety of biological, atmospheric, and   industrial processes.  Professor Edward L. Clennan, of the Department of   Chemistry at the University of Wyoming, with the support of the Organic   Dynamics Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the   Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, studies the reactions of   sulfur-containing molecules with oxygen. Through analysis of the products   of these reactions and of the intermediate compounds formed en route to   these products, Professor Clennan sheds light on the fundamental   molecular events responsible for their formation.  In addition to the   provision of a more general understanding of such oxidation reactions,   these studies are leading to the development of new mechanistic tools to   explore light-assisted oxidation reactions and the discovery of new and   useful oxidizing environments and new methods for the synthesis of   important materials.",
