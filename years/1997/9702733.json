 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project develops a systematic and unified  methodology for control of mechanical and structural systems  such that an integrated design of plant parameters and  control parameters is achieved to provide optimized total  systems; low-order controllers are obtained to satisfy  hardware and control implementation constraints; special  mathematical form of structural system models is exploited  to provide simplified design schemes and simpler control  laws; saturation constraints and control-loop time-delays  are taken into account explicitly in the design process; and  innovative computational algorithms using a unified Linear  Matrix Inequality (LMI) based formulation are developed. The  education component seeks to address some important  challenges in the effective teaching and training of  students and practicing engineers in the systems and  controls field today. In particular, the education goals of  this career plan are the following: (i) to promote an  interdisciplinary systems and controls education at the  university of Houston (UH) by fostering cross-departmental  teaching activities, (ii) to contribute to the continuing  education of practicing control engineers that are  disconnected from the rapid changes and advances in the  field, (iii) to provide industry's perspectives in systems  and control education and to address real-world problems in  the systems and controls curriculum, and (iv) to attract  freshmen students into control engineering and to motivate  high-school students towards science and engineering. A  project on control of plasma process is used as a  demonstration paradigm for the interdisciplinary teaching of  systems and controls at UH. This education project will be  pursued in collaboration with the Chemical Engineering  faculty at the Plasma Processing Laboratory. Close  collaboration with Cummins Engine Company, Hughes Aerospace,  the Payload Integration Company and other companies is  pursued to strengthen the industrial relevance of research  and education components of this project.",
