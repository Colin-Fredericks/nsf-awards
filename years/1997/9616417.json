The  objectives of VORTEX were to further our understanding of tornadogenesis, tornado  dynamics, storm environment relationships, and numerical prediction of severe  tornadic storms.  Data was collected from a variety of sensors including aircraft,  ground based surface stations and upper air sites, and radars.  Several of these  sensors were stationary, but many were mobile, thus the scientists were able to  intercept and follow a large number of tornadic storms.          Data collected from a mobile 3-cm Doppler radar and video during the  VORTEX and during a smaller scale data collection effort during 1996 will be used  by the Ppincipal Investigator to study the detailed structure of tornado vortices.  The  radar data were obtained with unprecedented resolution at distances ranging from 2  to 12 km for eight separate tornadoes.  Two of the radar data sets were of very large  tornadoes at a ranges of about 3 km with resolution volumes of 60 x 60 x 75 m.   One of the data sets is of a large but relatively mild tornado at 30 x 30 x 75 m  resolution.  These radar data sets along with extensive video and photographic  footage will be used to document detailed tornado structures and evolution as  depicted from radar reflectivity, Doppler winds, and photogrammetry.   ***",
