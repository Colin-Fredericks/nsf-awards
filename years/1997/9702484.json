 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-9702484  Abstract - A Frank    Bipolar outflows and highly collimated jets are nearly ubiquitous  features associated with stellar mass loss. From Young Stellar Objects  (YSOs) to Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) and Planetary Nebulae (PNe) -  the stellar cradle to the grave - there exists clear evidence for  collimated gaseous flows in the form of narrow high velocity streams or  extended bipolar lobes. In YSOs, LBVs and PNe collimated highly  supersonic outflows are observed to be transporting prodigious amounts  of energy and momentum from a central star .  Outflows and jets must  play a significant dynamical role in the evolution of the parent stars.    The similarity of jets and bipolar outflows across the Hertzsprung-  Russell (H-R) diagram must tell us something fundamental and quite  general about the nature of stellar evolution, as well as the  interaction of stars with their environments. A large database of high  resolution observations , including observations from the Hubble Space  Telescope (HST)) are available.  A general, well tested suite of theory  for explaining outflow collimation and propagation  could serve as a  powerful diagnostic tool linking the outflows to their often obscured  sources.  This could  initiate substantial progress in two of the most  fundamental issues facing modern astronomy: the need to understand  stellar birth and stellar death.    The research goals of this project are ambitious but attainable. First,  to develop and refine such a general theory of collimated stellar  outflows by detailing the basic physics which drives the collimation  process. Second, to extend our understanding of the collimation and  propagation of the outflows to include more realistic physics such as  the effect of microphysical processes and magnetic fields.  The  research focuses on two major investigations. One goal of this study is  to use PNe and PPNe morphologies to determine the route which stars  like the sun follow as they evolve from the Giant to the Dwarf stage.   The second project is a long range study of radiation-gasdynamic and  magneto-gasdynamic collimation of jets from Young Stellar Objects.    The final products of the research will be a suite of well tested tools  which can bridge the gap between the theory and reality, allowing the  histories of individual objects and classes of objects to be recovered.    The educational and outreach goals of the project are equally  ambitious: to use the accessibility inherent to numerical simulations  (i.e. graphics and animations) along with the visual power of real and  \"synthetic\" bipolar outflow observations as the core of a series of  innovative programs in curriculum development, interactive planetarium  displays and middle school outreach efforts.  The  efforts as a  \"popular\" science writer and as a regular contributer  to both DISCOVER  and ASTRONOMY magazines have provided experiences in effective  strategies for bringing science to wider audiences.  These skills, and  the fruits of the research, will be integrated into education  initiatives which will introduce Planetarium visitors, college and  middle school students to stellar astronomy as well as to wider issues  in the workings of science as a whole.",
