 "awd_abstract_narration": "Temple University is the recipient of funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure for the renovation and upgrading of the Department of Psychology's animal housing and laboratory facilities.  Recognized as one of the nation's leading centers for research and research training in the field, its research programs are diverse addressing both clinical and basic science issues in comparative psychology, social behavior, neurochemistry of motivation, behavioral analysis of cognition, and effects of traumatic experiences along with work on the mechanisms and properties of classical and instrumental conditioning.  The majority of research is performed in Weiss Hall, a facility  that was constructed in 1973.  However, due to changing regulations and codes, the physical deterioration of the facility,  and unsuitable space, animal housing has decreased substantially. The  continuing absence of adequate space has negatively impacted individual faculty projects and programs.   Renovations will include removing asbestos containing doors, resurfacing walls, floors, and ceilings, improving lighting and HVAC systems, and installing a new cage washer. Upon completion, the renovated facility will increase efficiency and meet federal requirements. The upgraded facility will assist the faculty as they attempt to meet the research and educational goals of the University in the recruitment of new faculty and students pursuing  careers in psychology.  As an urban university, Temple's Department of Psychology  provides a route for under-represented minorities and women to obtain advanced degrees in science. This project will enhance the Department's endeavors to sustain research excellence and training for future scientists in the next century.",
