 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700948  Warner  The objective of this research is to describe the evolution of the diversity of reproductive patterns that are seen in animals today.  This research will allow a field test of the predictions of mathematical models that include considerations of within- and between-gender conflict interactions and their resolution.  The resolutions do not necessarily maximize the fitness of any of the participants, but the compromises achieved are the mating systems seen.  Predictions using this approach differ significantly from those made by precious theory, and explain the existence of patterns of mating behavior that appear to confer lower individual mating success.    The predictions will be tested in a well-known group of temperate fishes.  Using simple, non-harmful techniques, the distribution of mating success in certain areas will be altered and the redistribution of males and females will be monitored.  The model makes several non-intuitive predictions about male and female reactions to altered mating distributions.  All models, especially those proposing a new way of thinking about the evolution of particular characteristics, need to be tested so that they may be evaluated in nature.",
