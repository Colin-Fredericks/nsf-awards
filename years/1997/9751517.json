 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the equipment, training, and interpersonal skills requirements of students preparing for high precision, highly automated machining positions. The project is addressing these issues by retrofitting an existing engine lathe with digital readouts and a Bridgeport mill to emulate equipment found in small machine shops. Machinist students are acting as peer trainers to high school students enrolled in similar programs. Students who teach will truly learn their trade. In addition, the project is establishing a website linking all high schools, BOCES, and interested industrial shops to the college's site for the purpose of sharing information on projects, vendor demonstration schedules, student mentoring activities, and job opportunities. Students who are required to work in teams, and have some interaction with industry, make a much smoother transition to the team-oriented work environment. A coordinate measuring machine (CMM), SPC, and other digital readout devices are being incorporated into the college's metrology course to better prepare freshmen students for their summer co-op experiences and future work environment. Engineering technology students are being provided with a metrology course in which they can gain skills in SPC applications and concepts. Lastly, existing machining and measuring facilities are being brought up to the standards demanded by industry.  *",
