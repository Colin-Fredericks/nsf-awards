 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Copeland  9626907         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a cost effective method of improving the efficiency of air conditioners. Air conditioners pump heat from a low temperature to a higher temperature where it is rejected to the environment. At design conditions, heat is removed from the room air and rejected to the environment at 95 F, cooling the room air from 77 F to 55 F. Even though the heat removal is non-isothermal, the evaporator of the conventional vapor compression cycle operates isothermally at a single, low temperature (45 F). If some of the heat from the room air were transferred to the refrigerant at a higher temperature (>45 F), the work needed to run the cycle would be reduced.  During this Phase II effort, conventional modern vapor compression air conditioners (i.e., pure fluid) will be modified to effectively remove heat from the room air at a higher average temperature. Like a conventional cycle, the modified cycle needs only one mechanical compressor; however, the power needed to compress the vapor is reduced. With HCFC-22, measurements during Phase I showed an 18% increase in COP (the theoretical limit was 23%). During Phase II, equipment will be developed for air conditioners in the range of 2 to 20 tons and the performance improvement will be demonstrated in a small scale (2 tons) air conditioner.       The innovative air conditioning cycle developed during this Phase II effort will improve the energy efficiency of both air conditioners and refrigerator units. The primary commercial market for the proposed system will be large scale, new installations in commercial office buildings and industrial refrigerators. Split cycle home air conditioners can also benefit from the improved performance of an ejector expansion cycle.  ***",
