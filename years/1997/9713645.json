GE Engineers will make visits to the University of Michigan, for the duration of one to two weeks each time, in order to conduct the joint research.  The research objective is to understand the interactions between laser beam and machined material as a function of wavelength, intensity, and interaction time using a new generation of industrial lasers.  Focus will be given to processing of advanced materials using parameters such as high average power, high peak power, high beam quality, and various wavelengths which were not available in the previous laser systems.   The collaborative research will generate fundamental understanding of precision manufacturing with novel industrial lasers.  The research result could propel widespread industrial applications of this technology.  Also, the industry presence on campus could foster close university-industry interactions which are valuable to updating engineering education programs and preparation of future talents with advanced knowledge on emerging technologies.                  2",
