 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern research in molecular, cellular, and developmental  biology requires the precise measurement of cellular or  subcellular activity in two or three dimensions. The  development of probes for the noninvasive assay of activity  has contributed greatly to our understanding of the complex  hierarchies of pathways that regulate cellular functions.  Equally significant has been the development of microscope  imaging technologies that can directly follow the changes in  molecular content and distribution which underlie a wide  range of biological processes in living cells.  Many available fluorescence microscopic techniques are  yielding limited detail about the organization and dynamics  of complex cellular structures, primarily because of the  slow speed with which conventional image detectors capture  and process high-resolution images. Impaired by UV-excited  fluorophores, one-photon confocal laser scanning microscopy  (OCLSM) techniques are often incompatible with high-  resolution (aberration-free) 3-D imaging and greatly reduce  cell or tissue viability with repeated scanning. In  contrast, the new two- or three-photon excitation laser  scanning microscope (TELSM), which uses a red-wavelength  femtosecond laser, surmounts some of the problems of OCLSM  and provides both sensitivity and high resolution without a  confocal aperture.    The proposed Multi-photon Excitation Fluorescence Imaging  Microscopy (MEFIM) system will afford a unique, state-of-the-  art opportunity to integrate advances in optical microscopy,  low-light video detection, and two- or three-dimensional  image analysis in measuring the fluorescent signals from a  living cell. The system's modular nature will also provide  the flexibility to meet varying optical and detection  requirements of multiple users. This instrumentation will  play a vital role in current research programs at the  Advanced Cellular Imaging Facility (ACIF) of the University  of Virginia and will provide novel opportunities to meet  future research n eeds.",
