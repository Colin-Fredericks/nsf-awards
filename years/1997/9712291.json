 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9712291  Geubelle  An experimental and analytical research project will  investigate the fiber debond and pull-out processes in fiber  reinforced polymeric and ceramic matrix composites subjected  to dynamic loading conditions. While extensive work has been  performed regarding these two failure mechanisms under quasi-  static loading conditions, and while all preliminary  investigations on that topic indicate a strong dependence on  the loading rate, very little is currently known on how  these processes take place under dynamic loading conditions.  The joint experimental and analytical research project aims  at shedding some light on the dynamic debonding and pull-out  processes and constitutes a mandatory preliminary step for  the design of impact-tolerant composite structures.    The experimental part of the project consists of dynamic  push-out and pull-out tests performed on various model  composites with the aid of a specially adapted Split  Hopkinson Bar apparatus. In addition to macroscopic  load/displacement curves obtained from the elastodynamic  response of the bars, in situ optical observations of the  debonding and pull-out processes will be performed using a  photoelastic  set-up  and  a high  speed  camera, providing  independent measurements of the debonding length and speed.  In  situ thermographical measurements on the model composite  and post mortem microscopic analyses of the fracture  surfaces will also be performed to capture the possible  occurrence of localized frictional heating which has been  shown in some preliminary investigations to drastically  affect the pull-out process.***    The analytical part of the project has two basic objectives:  firstly,   detailed  finite  element  simulations   of   the  experimental  set-up will be performed to characterize  with  precision  the  dynamic  loading of the  composite  specimen  during  the  tests. Secondly, two distinct and complementary  numerical  schemes  (a  special volumetric/cohesive  dynamic  finite  elemen t scheme and a spectral form of  the  boundary  integral method) will be used to investigate the adequacy of  existing  cohesive  and  friction  models  to  capture   the  observed fiber debond and pull-out processes.***",
