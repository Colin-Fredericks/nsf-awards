 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lassar, Andrew B.  IBN: 96-04667    The central goal of this grant is to understand how signals from surrounding tissues activate the expression of Pax-3 in the dermomyotome. Work in Dr. Lassar's lab is focused on understanding the regulatory signals that induce formation of vertebrate skeletal muscle. Although it is clear that expression of either MyoD or Myf-5 is essential for the formation of skeletal muscle, it has hitherto been unclear how these genes are activated during development.  He has recently begun to address what regulatory molecules mediate the induction of MyoD and Myf-5 by signals from either the axial tissues (i.e. the neural tube/notochord) or the overlying ectoderm. Recently he has found that the same signals that induce somitic myogenesis induce somitic expression of the paired box transcription factors, Pax-3 and Pax-7, prior to inducing high level expression of either Myf-5 or MyoD. Furthermore, infection of somites in vitro with a retrovirus encoding Pax-3 (which is normally expressed in the dermomyotome) is sufficient to induce expression of MyoD, Myf-5 myogenin, and myosin heavy chain in paraxial mesoderm in the absence of inducing tissues.  His  results indicate that signals that activate somitic expression of Pax-3/Pax-7 also activate somitic myogenesis and that ectopic expression of Pax-3 can activate myogenesis in the absence of other inducing signals. Together, these findings suggest that Pax-3 may mediate activation of MyoD and Myf-5 in response to the muscle inducing signals from either the axial tissues or overlying ectoderm.    In this study, he seeks to: (1) identify the region(s) of the Pax-3 gene that drives dermomyotomal expression of a Pax-3 transgene in transiently injected mice embryos, (2) identify the sequences in this regulatory region that directly respond to Shh/Wnt signals or ectodermal signals, and (3) clone the transcription factors that interact with these regulatory sequences. The goal of this study is to elucidate how signal transduction  pathways are integrated in the paraxial mesoderm to control expression of a key regulatory gene, Pax-3, which itself induces somitic myogenesis.",
