 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603429  Melngailis    This award supports the participation of American  scientists/engineers in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Formation of  Ion Nanobeams and Applications to Materials Processing to be  held in Nara, Japan from November 16-21, 1997.  The co-  organizers are Professors John Malngailis of the University  of Maryland and Kenji Gamo of Osaka University in Japan.  This seminar will address a broad range of topics related to  ion beams and their application to materials processing,  including ion sources and optics, ion beam irradiation  effects, nanofabrication, application of focused ion beams  to maskless device processing, and the use of ion beams for  microanalysis.  %%%  Focused ion beams are now widely used in the integrated  circuits industry for precisely sectioning individual  components in integrated circuits during failure analysis,  for rewiring integrated circuits during the prototyping  phase, and for repair of masks.  As minimum dimensions in  integrated circuits shrink, significant advances will be  needed for ion microbeams to continue to serve these  functions.  In addition, present research may lead to new  applications in micromachining and semiconductor devise  fabrication. The main practical developments in the area of  finely focused ion beams have occurred in the United States  and Japan.  This seminar brings together researchers from  both universities and industry.  The exchange of ideas and  data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S.  participants to advance their own work, and will set the  stage for future collaborative projects.  ***",
