The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Charles H. Conley, of the University of Texas,  Denton, to work with Dr. Moshe Flato at the Universite de  Bourgogne in Dijon, France.  Dr. Flato is a well-known  expert in mathematical physics.    Dr. Conley will study irreducible unitary representations of  gauge supergroups.  He is trying to generalize them to the  setting of supergroups and supermanifolds.  In addition, he  will complete a study on indecomposable representations of  semidirect project Lie groups.  He will use the realizations  he has found to show that the smooth indecomposable  representations with a preunitary composition series may be  completed to representations acting by bounded operators in  a Hilbert space.  In addition to his work with Dr. Flato,  the PI will also be able to work with active groups in  affine Kac-Moody Lie algebras, quantum groups, and star  representations.        ***",
