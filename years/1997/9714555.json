The  principal investigator has made a series of observations of  how the partially sighted interact with graphical user  interface (GUI)-based computers.  These observations have  resulted in a set of seven hypotheses relating to how  partially sighted individuals interact with a GUI computer.  This planning grant seeks to test these hypotheses via a  series of experiments to enable the investigator, in the  long term, to design improved user interfaces for the  partially sighted.  Approximately 100 subjects are to be  studied in these experiments.  Each subject will have  undergone a series of standard ophthalmology exams, which  will be used to establish an empirical link between visual  system physiology and specific HCI behaviors.  ***",
