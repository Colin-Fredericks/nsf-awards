This award supports a collaborative,  interdisciplinary study to expand on these discoveries.  The  crayfish claw was found in the Upper Carboniferous to Lower  Permian Pagoda Formation deposited in glacial environments 280 to  300 million years ago; the discovery pushes back the first  occurrence of crayfish 65 to 75 million years.  The crayfish  burrows were found in the Lower Triassic Fremouw Formation  deposited approximately 240 million years ago.  Their abundance  and complexity indicate that crayfish developed burrowing  behavior early in their long history.    The objectives of the study are to collect additional crayfish  body and trace fossils from Antarctica, to use these fossils to  develop further insight into the depositional conditions in parts  of that continent during intervals of the Late Carboniferous-  Early Permian and the Early Triassic, and to study the early  evolutionary and burrowing history of freshwater astacoid  decapods (crayfish).  Specifically, the work plan is: 1) to  search for more fossil crayfish and crayfish burrows in the  Pagoda Formation; 2) to interpret the way of life of the crayfish  in the Pagoda Formation and relate it to the crayfish morphology;  3) to reconstruct the depositional environment and paleoclimate  recorded by the crayfish-bearing rocks; 4) to search for crayfish  within burrows in the Fremouw Formation; 5) to quantitatively  describe the burrows in the Fremouw Formation; and 6) to compare  the morphology and behavior of Late Carboniferous to Early  Permian crayfish and burrows to those of the Early Triassic and  later.    This study will elucidate the evolutionary and behavioral history  of crayfish.  Modern crayfish exert an important control on  paramet ers such as energy flow, biotic species composition, and  biotic abundance in many different aquatic ecosystems.  This  proposed study will yield information about how and when this  environmental and behavioral diversification took place, as well  as increase understanding of the late Paleozoic and early  Mesozoic paleoclimates.",
