Recent  transport studies  to  B=7T  of  the  upper  critical field  Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 3555 (1997)  provide strong  evidence  for unconventional spin-triplet pairing, and a novel  field-  induced   dimensional   crossover.    These   and   similar   magnetic  measurements  will  be  extended to higher  fields  in  a  search  for  reentrant superconductivity which has been predicted for such quasi-1-  d superconductors.  In the normal state, the origin of a new series of  angular magnetoresistance oscillations, which map the curvature of the  Fermi  surface,  will  be  investigated.  A search  for  corresponding  angular   magnetic  oscillations  via  torque  magnetometry  will   be  initiated.   In  the  dielectric  state,  the  origin  of  the   \"fast  oscillations\" will be investigated via torque and transport in  pulsed  fields to 100T.  %%%  This  is  a  renewal proposal to study superconducting,  metallic  and  dielectric properties of the quasi-one  dimensional molecular conductors TMTSF at low temperatures  and  large  magnetic  fields Superconductivity arises when two negatively  charged  electrons become attracted to each other and become \"paired\", in spite  of  the  fact  that  \"opposites attract while likes  repel\".   In  all  conventional  superconductors, these paired electrons have opposite spin, such  that  the  total  spin of the pair is zero, a fact which plays an  important  role in the explanation of the superconducting state.  A recent theory  has  predicted, however, that in certain materials in which  electrons  are confined to move mostly in one direction, electrons with the same,  rather  than  opposite, spin, can form pairs, and  superconduct.   One  consequence  of  this  pairing would be that a  magnetic  field  could  enhance, rather than destroy , the  superconducting   state,  opening  the  interesting   possibility   of  superconductivity  reappearing in very  high  magnetic  fields.   This  project involves a search for high field superconductivity in  a  one-  dimensional  molecular conductor, where initial studies are strongly suggestive  of  equal spin pairing and reentrant superconductivity.  ***",
