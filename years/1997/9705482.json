Support will be provided for  research on the relation between materials properties and  physical properties of the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR)  manganites.  The focus will be on how strain affects  materials properties.  The research will be done as a  collaboration between Johns Hopkins University and Bell  Laboratories of Lucent Technologies.  Theoretical research  will be done at Johns Hopkins and experimental research will  be done at Bell.  A graduate student will spend time at Bell  as part of this project.  Expressions of interest in this  research have also been given by DuPont, Hewlett-Packard,  Varian and IBM.    CMR manganites are perovskite materials in which the  resistivity can be changed by orders of magnitude by  application of a few Tesla magnetic field.  While there is  no immediate commercial application, it is widely believed  that such a dramatic effect will be useful for technology.  It has become clear that the physical properties of a given  sample of CMR material depend strongly on sample form and on  how the sample was prepared.  This dependence of physical  properties on materials properties must be understood and  controlled if these materials are to be technologically  useful.  It is likely that one important source of the  observed variability is strain.  The main focus of this  research will be on understanding and quantifying the  effects of strain on materials properties, but other effects  arising from the presence of junctions between CMR and other  materials may also be considered.  %%%  This is a award under the Grant Opportunities for Academic  Liaison with Industry (GOALI) program and is funded by the  Division of Materials Research and the Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities.
