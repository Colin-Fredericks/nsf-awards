 "awd_abstract_narration": "Breznak  9709000    Roughly 2000 species of termites degrade 1 billion tons  annually of lignocellulosic plant material and residues  derived from it (e.g. humus) and in doing so derive  nutrition from some of earth's most abundant, but refractory  and nitrogen-poor food resources. To accomplish this feat,  they have evolved into spectacular symbioses with gut  microorganisms representing all known domains of life on  Earth -- Bacteria, methane-producing Archaea, and Eukarya  (protozoa). Such microbes are important in: (i) nitrogen  economy (via N2-fixation and excretory N-recycling); (ii)  production of acetate (a major carbon and energy source for  termites) from H2 + CO2; and (iii)production of digestive  enzymes. Nevertheless, a lingering source of frustration has  been an inability to culture (and thereby better understand)  some of the major members of the termite gut community, ea.  spirochetes. However, molecular biological tools now afford  a means to probe the nature, number, physiological role(s),  and phylogenetic diversity of termite gut microbes without  the absolute requirement for cultivation. Accordingly,  research in this project will integrate molecular biological  approaches with biochemical and physiological studies to  increase our understanding of termite gut spirochetes, as  well as a variety of other microbes relevant to termite  nutrition and vitality. It is expected that this research  will continue to reveal termites as a rich reservoir of  novel (and largely untapped) microbial diversity and a  fruitful system for discovering new principles of microbial  interactions.",
