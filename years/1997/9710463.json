 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9710463  Ting -wei Tang     Impact ionization is  one of the most important factors limiting the performance of today's advanced semiconductor devices.   The impact  ionization is the source of hot-electron-induced device degradation and is responsible for avalanche breakdown of transistors.  The main issue of impact ionization is the modeling of the impact ionization coefficient, (.  Conventionally ( is modeled as a function of electric field or the average energy of total electron population.  Unfortunately, these models do not properly describe the non-local of impact ionization.     In this research, we propose an innovative approach to model ( as a unique function of the average energy of only those high-energy exceed the impact ionization threshold energy.  This average macroscopic variable describes the behavior of  ( more accurately than the electric field or the average energy of total electron population.  The objective of this research is then to find a system of hydrodynamic transport equations, when solved, will provide information about this macroscopic variable.  A preliminary investigation indicates that the system of transport equations for the high-energy electron subpopulation can be reduced from three to a single transport equation.  This enables us to solve the transport equation easily and use our newly developed novel impact ionization model as a post processor to any existing device simulator which does not have an impact ionization model.    A great impact of this research on the computer-aided design of semiconductor devices can be anticipated.  The model can be readily incorporated in existing device simulation tools for more accurate  prediction of impact ionization related phenomena occurring in the transistors, including the prediction of the avalanche breakdown voltage.  The additional computational cost is very minimal.",
