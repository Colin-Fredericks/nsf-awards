 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies a general and powerful method for  program optimization.  This method is based on  incrementalization, which allows repeated computations on  slightly changing inputs to be performed efficiently by  updating their values incrementally from one computation to  the next.  Since all non-trivial computations proceed in an  iterative fashion, which requires repeated updates of  program states, incrementalization underlies essentially all  loop optimizations.  This project focuses on an important  application of incrementalization, namely, loop optimization  for aggregate computations on arrays.  This optimization  can produce drastic speedups of programs for problems in  image processing, computational geometry, computer graphics,  multimedia, matrix computation, etc.  The method captures  aggregate array computations in loop bodies and  incrementally updates their results over iterations.  Part  of the analysis is reduced to symbolic simplification of  constraints on loop variables and array subscripts.  Analytical and experimental results both show drastic  speedups compared to previous techniques.  Work specifically  planned for this project includes: refining and extending  the techniques and algorithms, implementing the algorithms,  analyzing the performance of the optimization algorithm and  the optimized programs, and developing models for the time  and space complexity and data locality of the programs that  will enable us to tune the optimizations.",
