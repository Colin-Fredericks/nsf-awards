 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704911  Short    This project will attempt to develop signal processing techniques based on   nonlinear dynamic (NLD) forecasting. Traditional signal processing   approaches have generally relied upon the assumption that systems are   either periodic/quasi-periodic or random.  The NLD forecasting approach   attempts to bridge the gap between these approaches by assuming that there   may be a deterministic component which is responsible for the observed   complex behavior.  Prior work on a test case has shown that it is possible to   use NLD forecasting to predict seismic background noise sufficiently well   that it is possible to reduce the noise by over an order of magnitude, making   it possible to see hidden teleseismic events.  In other applications, NLD   forecasting has been used to unmask secure chaotic communication   schemes by predicting the dynamics of the chaotic carrier with sufficient   accuracy that the hidden messages may be extracted.  The proposed research   will expand the use of multi-step forecasting methods so that predictions   can be made for longer times, and so that signal extraction may be   improved.  Resumming techniques will also be studied, where a series of   short-term predictions will be used to rebuild the hidden signals.  Seismic   data from various sites will be examined to explore the limits of   predictability, and an attempt will be made to develop real-time processing   techniques which will aid in monitoring of nuclear treaties.  The link   between spectral signal processing methods and NLD processing will be   studied so that the tools can be used in a complementary and integrated   manner.  Curvature-based methods of NLD processing will be developed   for time series where it is difficult to get a nice phase space reconstruction.    NLD forecasting will be used to create statistical ensembles which can then   be considered from a statistical processing perspective.  Success in these   research areas will represent significant progress in the developme nt of   NLD signal processing as an important new technology.    This project will attempt to develop a new signal processing technology   based on nonlinear dynamic (NLD) forecasting. Traditional signal   processing approaches have generally relied upon the assumption that   systems are either periodic or random.  NLD signal processing recognizes   that many systems which appear to be random may be produced by   processes which are inherently predictable, at least in the short-term.  In   fact, it is the ability to make accurate short-term predictions which   distinguishes nonlinear dynamic systems (also known as chaotic systems)   from typical random systems.  These NLD prediction techniques have   already been used on a test case of seismic background noise provided by   the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), where it was shown   that the background noise could be predicted so well that after the predicted   background was removed, one could clearly see the presence of hidden   signals which were essentially equivalent to distant nuclear test detonations.    In another application, NLD prediction techniques have been used to extract   hidden messages from chaotic communication systems, where the   predictions about the behavior of the chaotic carrier signal were so accurate   that when they were removed, the hidden message signal could be observed.    The proposed research will expand these NLD forecasting methods to   improve the extraction of signals from noisy environments.  The seismic   problem will be examined using various data sources to determine the limits   of predictability, and a parallel processing implementation will be used to   attempt to develop a real-time processing system which may be useful for   monitoring of nuclear treaties.  Further research will examine the   connection between NLD techniques and traditional signal processing   techniques.  Success in these research areas will represent significant   progress in the development of NLD signal processing  as an important new   technology.",
