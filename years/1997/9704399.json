 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators have developed a new method for applying concepts of symbolic dynamical systems to the study of knot and link groups. The set of representations into a finite group of the commutator subgroup of an oriented knot group or the augementation subgroup of an oriented link group has the structure of a shift of finite type, a special type of dynamical system that can be completely described by a finite graph. The set of representations into a finite abelian group of the commutator subgroup of an oriented link group is a higher dimensional shift of finite type. Dynamical invariants of the shift such as topological entropy, directional entropy and the zeta function produce new, computable knot invariants, and give useful information about branched cyclic covering spaces. Elementary and effective obstructions to conjugacy for free group automorphisms result as a byproduct. The project will expand the investigators' previous work, using these new techniques to address several open questions in knot theory. DNA, solar plasma filaments and garden hoses have a common feature: each exhibits knotting and linking.  The mathematical theory of knots and links began in the mid-nineteenth century, and today its importance is recognized in diverse areas of physics, chemistry, biology and engineering. Until recently, the methods employed in this field have come from topology and algebra.  The two principal investigators have discovered tools from the field of symbolic dynamics that are novel and effective for studying knots and links.  Symbolic dynamics, which studies arrays of data, is central to information and communication theory and has important applications in the analysis of chaotic systems and the science of materials.  This project will extend the investigators' techniques, address unanswered questions in knot theory and establish new bridges between disciplines.",
