Organizers are Dr.  Thomas T. Veblen, University of Colorado, Boulder, in  collaboration with Dr. Mary Kalin Arroyo, Universidad de  Chile, Santiago.   This congress will be organized around  the theme of Southern Temperate Biota and Ecosystems: Past,  Present and Future. The theme will  be developed by  presentations and discussions around major biological and  ecological questions, recent advances in research on  southern temperate biota and ecosystems, evaluations of  science-based strategies for the sustainable use of  resources, and the interface between pure research and  development.    The Southern Connection was created to bring together  scientists conducting research on the biota and ecosystems  of the temperate latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere with  the  purpose of  improving communications among scientists  working in the region.  Participation of US-based scientists  will allow them to interact with a broad diversity of  Southern Hemisphere scientists  Through such interaction and  exchange of information, research on a wide range of  environmental biology topics will be stimulated and  improved.  ***",
