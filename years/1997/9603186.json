 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603186  Malin           The American Chemical Society, working together with  the chemical  societies or scientific academies of Argentina, Brazil,  Chile, Costa Rica and  Mexico, will organize and monitor two-month visits by young  Latin American  scientists to laboratories in the United States.  During the  two years of the project,  the American Chemical Society will select three participants  from each country  from among nominees identified by the counterpart  organizations.  As a pilot  project, at least two additional scientists will be selected  to visit industrial  laboratories in the United States.  The host companies will  furnish the stipends for  the industrial visitors.  Costs of international travel will  be borne by the visitors'  countries of origin.           A major benefit to the United States scientific  community will be the  establishment of long-term collaborative research  relationships between US  laboratories and some of the outstanding young chemical  scientists in  Latin America.  This will facilitate investigation jointly  with US scientists of  important scientific problems, for example, in natural  products chemistry  and environmental chemistry.  A second major effect of the  program will be to strengthen working relationships between  US organizations and Latin American scientific societies and  academies.  Finally, the program will foster interactions  between young scholars from the region and US industry,  which, in the spirit of the NAFTA accord, will benefit both  sides as the Latin American economies continue to expand.  This award is jointly supported by the Chemistry and the  International Divisions of NSF.  ***",
