 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research performed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography encompasses all of the ocean sciences including the relationship between the atmosphere and the ocean.   Over the years scientists have focused on developing and expanding basic theorems to understand and predict the physical and biological world.  Acquiring field data is absolutely necessary to this work, and the success of field research and the development of new research ideas is dependent upon the technology available. The majority of researchers use field instruments to collect data at sea or under extreme conditions of temperature, pressure or humidity. Current instrument test facilities at Scripps are unreliable and inadequate to support research in ocean acoustics, coastal dynamics, physical oceanography, marine geology and geophysics, and marine and atmospheric meteorology. NSF funds will be used to replace fixed equipment  for instrumentation facilities that will be consolidated as an integrated test facility.  This project will significantly improve efficiency and reduce the time required to fabricate and modify instruments.  Improved capabilities will amplify and expand graduate training in the development, calibration, operating, and modification research equipment.  Modernized facilities will impact experimental work conducted by 38 faculty, 38 postdocs, 60 Ph.D. graduate students and 124 research staff, and will continue to be an ocean science resource for the scientific community.",
