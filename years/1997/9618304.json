 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first generation of quantitative equilibrium models of international fluctuations document that the standard complete markets models with fluctuations driven solely by technology have a hard time accounting for many of the observed features of the data. This research consists of three projects which model specific fractions and assesses their ability to better account for the observations.   The first project introduces sticky prices and monopolists who price to market internationally. It is motivated by the early observations that nominal and real exchange rates are both highly volatile compared to domestic price indices and by the more recent work which documents large deviations from the law of one price for traded goods. The model blends together the real business cycle models in which all fluctuations are driven by real technology shocks with the sticky price literature in which fluctuations are driven primarily by monetary shocks.   The second project introduces a friction in international credit markets. The standard model has perfect international credit markets, and it generates cross country correlations of consumption that are much higher than in the data and cross correlations of output that are much lower than in the data together. This project introduces a friction in international credit markets and assess if it can quantitatively help to account for these anomalies.   The third project is motivated by the evidence that the movements in nominal exchange rates have been much larger than the movements in inflation, money growth, or interest rate differentials across countries. This project analyses the potential for a plausibly parameterized version of a model with segmented asset markets to produce these features of the data. The model is based on the idea that agents differ in the level of their participation in asset markets.",
