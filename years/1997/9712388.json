 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns equational reasoning, with emphasis on word  and unification problems. The investigation comprises graphs,  congruence closure and equational unification, along with further  development of these topics, and combinations of these topics.  The objective is to develop new decidability and complexity  results, and to design and implement efficient algorithms.  The  approach to word problems will use the rewriting paradigm,  concentrating on procedures and data structures for computing  complete/canonical sets of rewrite rules.  In particular, the  method using SOUR graphs for completing rewrite systems will be  investigated, particularly the way in which SOUR Graphs can be  used to develop procedures for solving the word problem in  certain classes of theories.    The first part of the research will be to examine the procedure  in its simplest form, on string rewriting systems.  Once methods  are developed to solve the word problem in its simplest form,  those methods will be moved back into pure equational logic, and  finally into full first order equational logic.    For ground equational theories, the plan is to investigate  techniques for computing congruence closures based on the  rewriting paradigm developed in studying Shostak's congruence  closure method.  Applications to combinations of decision  procedures will be investigated.  The relationship between the  congruence closure method and SOUR graphs will be investigated  and exploited.    In unification, the concentration is on semantic unification,  where some of the function symbols have semantics associated with  them, usually specified in the form of an equational theory.  The  main focus of the applications is automated reasoning and  symbolic computation.  E-unification problems arising in process  algebra. Knowledge representation and constraint solvers will  also be investigated.  Both theoretical and practical issues will  be studied: (1) on the theoretical side, decidability and  complexity issues on variou s equational unification and  disunification problems will be investigated---this is a  continuation of work done over the past several years; (2) on the  practical side, the goal is to come up with efficient algorithms  along with fast implementations, making use of heuristics.  Implementations will be incorporated into the Unification  Workbench, a library of unification algorithms.",
