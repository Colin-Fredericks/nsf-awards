 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is funded through the Professional Opportunities for  Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program as a  Research/Educational Enhancement Project.    This project has  two parts.  The first is the development  of a theory of Harish-Chandra modules for quantized  enveloping algebras.  These modules are important because  of their impact on the study of Lie group representations.  In the classical case, the Harish-Chandra modules of  semisimple Lie algebras behave nicely when the action  is restricted to maximal compact Lie subalgebras. To construct  an analogous quantum theory, the investigator will analyze  already known quantum analogs of these special Lie subalgebras  and identify new ones.  Next, basic results such as a quantum  Harish-Chandra's subquotient theorem and a finiteness condition  on isotypic components will be proved relative to these  subalgebras.    The second topic concerns generalizations of the classical  theorem due to Chevalley: the invariants of the symmetric  algebra of a semisimple Lie algebra under the adjoint group  surjects onto the Weyl group invariants of the symmetrized  Cartan subalgebra. The researcher will study a variation of  this setup where the two groups  are replaced with  the smaller  adjoint group and Weyl group associated to certain Lie  subalgebras of a given semisimple Lie algebra.  To what  extent does  the image of the first invariant subalgebra  have finite codimension in the second? Answers will put  recent solutions to a question of Wallach in a general context.  The main technique is to exploit the so-called Letzter map,  originally developed for quantized enveloping algebras.",
