 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712174  Carson  At accretionary margins sedimentary carbon is recycled as pore  waters are squeezed from the compacting sediments. These pore  waters are discharged at natural seeps where some of the carbon  is  deposited as thick surface and subsurface layers, additional carbon  may be sequestered in gas hydrates, and some of the carbon is lost  to the water column in gaseous form. The relative proportions and  magnitude of these processes, however, are poorly understood. The  present project will begin an in situ , experimental approach to  examining and quantifying these processes on the Oregon margin.  Sampling chambers will be fitted to sealed borehole drilled by the  Ocean Drilling Program and will be used to collect precipitate and  fluid flow out of the sedimentary section. Samples from the year  long experiment will be subsequently analyzed to provide  information on the kinetics of carbon sequestration during fluid  expulsion. Not only will the research define chemistry of the  fluids and associated digenetic deposits, it also will relate the  mass deposited over time to a known volume of fluid, and measure  the affect of that deposition on sediment permeability. Microbial  research will examine the potential role and importance of  organisms in controlling the carbon partitioning.  ***",
