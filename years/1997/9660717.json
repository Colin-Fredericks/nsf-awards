 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  96-0717  Wong      This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project will develop a method of producing fine, uniform tantalum (Ta) filaments, using technology originally developed for superconductors, and determine the performanceof these filaments in electrolytic capacitors. Existing Ta powders used for capacitors have demonstrated increasing specific capacitance as the manufacturers have improved the sodium reduction process. However the new powders are more sensitive to capacitor production process parameters such as sintering time and temperature and forming voltage. This forces a compromise in the final capacitor between capacitance level and negative performance criteria such as operation voltage, leakage, breakdown voltage, and equivalent series resistance. In addition, the new powders are much more expensive due to the lower production yields. The performance of the Ta filaments is expected to meet or exceed that of commercially available powder without any of the performance drawbacks such as sensitivity to sintering temperature or forming voltage while promising higher yields and lower costs.      The Ta filaments have the ability to address a sizable Ta powder market for electrolytic capacitors.  ***",
