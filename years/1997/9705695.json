The  work is based on the SQUID interferometry techniques the  PI  has  developed  to  detect the phase of the  order  parameter  in  single  crystal  superconductor samples; and  on  the  use  of  a  scanning   SQUID  microscope  (SSM).   Three  areas  of  proposed  research   include:  (1)  Use  of  the  SSM   to   study   vortex  configurations  and  dynamics  in  superconductor   arrays.   (2)  Application  of the SQUID interferometry methods to identify  the  order parameter symmetry in heavy fermion superconductors and  in  organic   superconductors,  both  types   of   material   showing  indications  of unconventional pairing. (3) Magnetic  imaging  of  hybrid  systems consisting, e.g.,of alternating arrays of  d-wave  and s-wave islands.  %%%  This  experimental research project, at the forefront of research  in  unconventional  types of superconductivity,  focuses  on  the  \"phase coherence\" property of superconductors and superfluids  in  general.  The  most  useful properties  of  superconductors:  the  superfluid    (lossless)   electrical   conduction,    and    the  Superconducting  Quantum  Interference  Device  (SQUID)  magnetic  field  sensors  and  fast logic elements, all  arise  from  phase  coherence. It has recently been found with high probability  that  the   phase-coherent   properties  of   the   high   Tc   cuprate  superconductors   are   strikingly  different   from   those   of  conventional  superconductors, like lead and NbTi. This  research  project  is devoted in part to the phase properties of additional  types  of  superconductors, organic metals  and  \"heavy  fermion\"  superconductors,  which  may also exhibit   unconventional  phase  behavior. Portions of this research will utilize a Scanning Squid  Microscope, which can measure local m agnetic fields at the  level  of one billionth of an Oersted (1/2 Oersted is about the level of  the  earth's magnetic field) with a spatial resolution  of  about  100  micrometers. Results from this research may include  unusual  new   effects  or  structures  which  may  find  application   in  technology. This research project is interdisciplinary in  nature  and involves graduate students who will be excellently trained to  enter positions in industry, government or education.  ***",
