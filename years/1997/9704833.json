 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704833  Jaco       This project involves the development and use of efficient  triangulations and normal surface theory in the study and  understanding of 3-manifolds.  The primary objective is to develop an  algorithm to decide if two 3-manifolds are homeomorphic, thereby  providing a complete classification of 3-manifolds.  Efficient  triangulations lead to combinatorial methods that yield results  analogous to those obtained when a 3-manifold is known to have a rich  geometry (hyperbolic structure).  All 3-manifolds admit  triangulations, those which are least understood are precisely the  class which admit efficient triangulations; hence, this project  provides new methods to study the least understood cases of  3-manifolds.       Low-dimensional manifolds provide the geometric models of most  physical phenomena.  It is natural to ask for a description of all  possible such models.  For nearly a century, the classification  (precise listing of all possible models) of 2-manifolds has been  understood.  Following this work by fifty years, it was learned that it  is not possible to classify all 4-dimensional models.  This project  attacks the problem in dimension 3, which remains open.  ***",
