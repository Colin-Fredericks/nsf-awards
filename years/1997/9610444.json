 "awd_abstract_narration": "9610444  Kuchment    The problem of creating photonic crystals has two major components: a   mathematical one and a technological one. The mathematical part consists   of non-standard spectral problems for the periodic Maxwell operator and   some of its scalar counterparts. The aim of the proposed research is to   develop novel analytic and numerical methods of analysis of frequency   spectra depending on geometric and physical characteristics of the band-gap   material. In particular, it is planned to develop new asymptotic models of   the problem in 2D and 3D, to study numerically and analytically the   asymptotic models for different geometries of PBG materials in 2D and 3D,   to study relations between spectral properties of photonic crystals and of   other mesoscopic physical systems, to study novel possibilities of    localization of light, to study geometries that promise to open large spectral   gaps, and to obtain new analytic results about effects caused by localized   impurities.    Photonic band-gap materials, often referred to as photonic crystals, have   attracted a lot of attention since the idea was suggested in 1987. A photonic   crystal is an artificial composite optical material that is an optical analog of   a semiconductor. The main  property of interest is existence of a range of   frequencies (``colors\") of light that cannot propagate in this medium. It is   expected that creation of such a material would bring about a technological   revolution in optics, laser technology, computing, information transmission,   and other areas. Significant increase in efficiency of laser devices, highly   efficient planar antennas, optics protecting against enemy's laser beams,   perfect mirrors, laser diodes, memories, switches, and lossless optical   information transmission lines are among numerous applications.  This   award is supported by the Division of Mathematical Science and the   Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).",
