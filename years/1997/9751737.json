 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Physics has had a substantial involvement in astronomy education over the last 11 years.  Faculty and students in the Physics Department have begun a vigorous program of stellar photometry research projects that has resulted in faculty and student papers and presentations at professional and student meetings.    Remotely-controlled and robotic astronomical observatories are now a reality, and several are currently operating successfully.  Telescopes in these observatories are controlled via telephone lines by completely remote operators who are, in some cases, thousands of miles away from the observatory.  Robotic or automatic telescopes can be programmed to run completely independent of the astronomer, making numerous observations throughout the entire night.    A remotely controlled and robotic telescope is a logical extension of the previous efforts of this institution in astronomy education and research.  This facility is a multipurpose facility, performing university teaching, teacher education, research, and community outreach.  It is also providing an avenue for the university to begin a distance education program with area high schools.  *",
