The first area of   research is the control of hybrid systems of partial differential equations and   ordinary differential equations, with applications in bioremediation and   population modeling.  The second area is optimal control of the obstacle in   variational inequalities, with elliptic or fourth order operators (involving   biharmonic operators). The third area is the investigation of optimal   chemotherapy strategies in HIV models.  First, the existence of an optimal   control must be shown for the models and objective functionals appropriate   to each application area.  Secondly, this optimal control must be   characterized through necessary conditions from the derivation of an   optimality system, which is the state system coupled with an adjoint system.    Due to the variety of systems treated, existence, uniqueness, and   characterization of the optimal control requires new and different a priori   estimates and convergence arguments.  For some of the applications,   numerical simulations will be completed.    This research involves theory and applications of optimal control of partial   differential equations, ordinary differential equations, and variational   inequalities.  The first application area is control of a bioremediation model   for encouraging the remediation of contaminants by metabolism of bacteria.    The level of the nutrient inputs is controlled to optimally run a bioreactor.    The approach will be lab tested on a gas phase bioreactor with pseudomonas   putida bacteria degrading paraxylene.  Other population models will be   investigated. The second application area is the control of variational   inequalities, which model the designing of the shape of the membrane by   controlling an obstacle put under the membrane.  These models arise in flow   through porous media, hydrodynamic lubrication, elasto-plastic  analysis,   continuous casting, and electrochemical machining.  The third application   area is the design of optimal chemotherapies for the treatment of HIV   infection.  The effect of a \"cocktail of various drugs\" can be simulated for   an immunology model involving CD4+T white blood cells and the HIV   virus.  Also a model involving the time elapsed since the cells became   infected with HIV will be studied.  Numerical simulations for the optimal   control and resulting controlled quantities (like CD4+T cells), will be   completed using realistic data.",
