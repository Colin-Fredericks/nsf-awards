 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604289  Sharp  Two families muscle-specific transcription factors - the myogenesis regulatory factor (MRF) family which is expressed only in skeletal muscle, and the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family which is expressed in all muscle types - are required for skeletal myogenesis in mammals, and have been shown to act synergistically.  Members of each family bind to specific DNA sequences in the promoter regions of muscle-specific genes and activate transcription.  This research will determine how these two families of transcription factors act synergistically to activate the transcription of the skeletal muscle (skm) actin gene.  Unlike other muscle-specific genes which demonstrate MRF/MEF2 synergism, the MRF and MEF2 binding sites of the skm actin gene are physically separated from each other on the DNA.  Co-transfection and mutagenic analysis will be performed using an skm actin gene promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene construct.  Co-transfection into non-muscle cells of this reporter gene with DNA constructs expressing specific MRF and/or MEF2 transcription factors will be used to evaluate the effect on transcription of particular combinations of MRF and MEF2 proteins.  The role of specific DNA binding sites within the skm actin gene promoter will be determined using the same reporter gene in which specific MRF or MEF2 binding sites have been mutated.  The results of this research will provide the basis for future analysis of the promoter-specific and transactivator-specific regions of the MRF and MEF2 proteins, and should lead both to broader regulatory models that can be tested in the context of other promoters and to a better understanding of the process of myogenesis.    The process by which skeletal muscle precursor cells develop into skeletal muscle is regulated by an intricate interplay of molecular mechanisms.  One approach to understanding these mechanisms is to study the DNA-protein interactions which regulate the expression of muscle-specific genes during  development.  This research will determine how two families of muscle-specific proteins which are required for skeletal muscle development act synergistically to activate the expression of the skeletal muscle actin gene. The results of this research should lead both to broader regulatory models that can be tested in the context of other genes and to a better understanding of the process of skeletal muscle development.",
