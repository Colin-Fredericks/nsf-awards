Candidate solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) materials, such as YSZ, doped-LaGaO3, doped-LaCrO3, LSM and Ni-YSZ, have been deposited by thin and thick film techniques. However, many traditional thin film technologies are subject to certain limitations, such as the requirement for high vacuum chambers and line-of-sight limitation, which restrict their commercial viability for SOFCs. The ability to address these limitation and deposit low cost, high quality, fuel cell thin films at moderate substrate temperatures without post deposition treatment is essential for the wide spread commercialization of fuel cells. With the CCVD technology, high quality SOFC materials can be deposited at a 90% cost reduction and at twice the deposition rate of traditional CVD. MicroCoating Technologies (MCT) has shown that CCVD processing does achieve epitaxial, phase pure, dense, smooth coatings of YSZ and DLC materials, and porous, conductive, columnar Ni-YSZ and LSM. Additionally, BaCeO3, Pt and multilayered YSZ have been deposited by MCT. During this Phase I research, thin films of SOFC materials will be grown and the processing apparatus will be scaled up. In Phase II a small scale, commercial prototype for stacked SOFCs up to 20 cm across, with power density near 1 watt/cm2, will result from this effort.   Low cost, high quality YSZ, DLC, Ni-YSZ and LSM films for SOFCs stacked cells producing power densities of 1 watt/cm2 are desired. The commercialization of stacked SOFCs in vehicles and portable power generation would be achieved by utilizing thin films to increase power density 10 times per units volume and mass. These high power densities position SOFCs to capitalize on a potential mult i-billion dollar industry, and at the same time offer significant environmental advantages. ***",
