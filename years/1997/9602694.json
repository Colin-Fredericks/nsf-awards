 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pennsylvania State University, one of the leading institutions in the field of inorganic ceramic materials research, is the recipient of funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program for the renovation of facilities of the Intercollege Materials Research Lab (IMRL). Located on the University Park main campus, the Materials  Research Laboratory Building, which houses the IMRL,was constructed in 1969 with assistance from the National Science Foundation.  Research conducted in the facility is diverse in content and scale, having both theoretical and applied investigations, including studies of ferroelectric, dielectric, optical, and thermomechanical properties of materials. Processing and materials synthesis experiments involve thin film deposition, high pressure synthesis, low temperature synthesis, and high temperature ceramic processing. The laboratory contains characterization facilities with special emphasis on ellipsometry, x-ray power diffraction, electron microscopy, and vibrational spectroscopy.  In addition to research in the core of materials science, there are many investigations that are interdisciplinary in the broadest sense, including design and synthesis of materials suitable for the encapsulation and immobilization of nuclear and chemical waste and other environmentally related problems.  Current conditions of the 27 year old facility makes it difficult for the department to compete in world-class materials research. New families of electronic analysis and test equipment require environmental controls that are beyond the capabilities of the present facility.  Because of environmental constraints, sensitive measurement operations have to be suspended several months. Funds will be used to install new fume hoods and renovate installations that will provide the required ventilation for both research efforts and compliance with OSHA and Clean Air Acts.  Research space will be renovated to provide 3-level clean room facilities for thin film, tape casting, and screen printing   operations for electronic materials.  Upon completion,  the project will enhance the role of IMRL as it continues its output of important research results and quality graduate students for the future of advanced materials and processing in the nation.  The renovations will help the Department maintain research excellence into the 21st century.",
