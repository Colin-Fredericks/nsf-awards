 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most serious consequence of inadequate design of waste containment facilities or a chemical spill is migration of chemicals into groundwater supply.  Central to the analysis of pollution transport through soils is knowledge of permeability of the soil, before and after becoming saturated with chemicals.  The objective of this research is to develop a method of predicting the change in soil permeability due to contamination.  The project will seek to develop a method of quantifying the change in permeability caused by replacement of pore fluid with a certain amount of specific contamination.  The mechanical behavior of the clayey soils in this study depends to a great extent on the composition of the pore fluid.  When existing pore water is replaced with another fluid, the interparticle force may in some cases become more repulsive, causing the dispersion of the particles, and yet in other cases become more attractive, causing flocculation and shrinkage of particle clusters.  A permeability test with water as the permeant can be conducted in a reasonable  length of time.  However, a direct method of determining a contamination-induced corresponding change in permeability is to perform a compatibility test in a laboratory on undisturbed field specimens.  Considering the wide variety of contamination possible, this procedure is very time consuming and costly.    A new method to estimate the change in permeability is based on the Olsen's cluster model, which recognizes that particles are arranged in clusters in a clayey soil, and that fluid flow through such a soil occurs primarily through inter-cluster pores.  The Kozeny-Carmen equation applied to this cluster model was found to represent reasonably well the influence of porosity on the value of permeability.  With the pre-contamination permeability experimentally determined, this modified Kozeny-Carmen equation allows the calculation of the permeability change caused by contamination as a function of the change in inter-cluster porosity.  Previously developed physico-chemical theories will be used to compute the change in inter- and intra-cluster porosity caused by contamination.  Commercial clays (including montmorillonite, illite, kaolinite, and mixtures) as well as two natural soils will be used in this study. Contaminants will include formamide, ethanol, acetic acid, triethylamine, heptane, benzene, and a sample of industrial landfill leachate.",
