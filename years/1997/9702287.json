 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Cammers-Goodwin's research focuses on three different   manifestations of molecular structure: molecular recognition, pi stacking   and secondary solution structure.  Phosphate and pyrophosphate   recognition is examined through interactions with guanidinoindole   derivatives synthesized in accord with computer-aided molecular design   parameters to maximize host-guest hydrogen bonding and electrostatic   interactions.  A systematic variation of substituents designed to achieve   both electron-rich and electron-poor aryl moieties in a series of benzyl   biphenyls is utilized to determine overall stability achieved through pi   stacking in fluid solution.  The decarboxylation of a   carboxybenzisoxazole is exploited to determine the role of hydrogen   bonding in the stabilization of helical protein structures by   trifluoroethanol.  Educational activities include developing an   interdisciplinary biological chemistry course and a course that targets   drug design through molecular modeling based on available protein crystal   structure data, and through a community outreach program, tutoring and   mentoring disadvantaged teenagers.  With this CAREER award, the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   research of Professor Arthur Cammers-Goodwin of the Department of   Chemistry at the University of Kentucky.   Professor Cammers-Goodwin's   research addresses, through study of model systems, the nature of the   interaction between biological molecules and ions and the factors   dictating the three-dimensional structure of biological molecules in   solution.  By focusing on comparatively small model compounds in place of   the often complex biological molecules, hypotheses regarding specific   factors governing the form of the natural molecules are tested.    Professor Cammers-Goodwin's educational activities include developing an   interdisciplinary course on biological chemistry course and a course on   pharmaceutical synthesis, and through a community center, mentoring   minority high school students.",
