 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704222  Erskine    This award partially supports the development of unique  instrumentation for synthesizing laterally constrained thin film and  multilayer magnetic materials and microstructures and for studying  novel magnetic phenomena in the structures The new instrument  incorporates state-of-the-art thin film growth and characterization  capabilities, contact mask and focused ion beam technology capable of  creating submicron structures in the films, and complementary high  spatial resolution magnetic sensitive spectroscopy/microscopy probes  The new instrumentation adds important capabilities to existing  research programs of several faculty at The University of Texas which  explore thin film magnetism, mesoscopic physics, micromagnetics and  magneto-transport phenomena.    Scientific issues to be explored based on new capabilities of the  instrument include 1) micromagnetic phenomena including properties of  magnetic domains in ultrathin films and patterned micron-scale  ultrathin film structures; 2) the effects of deliberately induced  substrate roughness (atomic steps) and film thickness variations on  magnetic domains and related properties including coercive forces and  anisotropy of thin films and thin film based microstructures; 3)  finite size scaling effects, critical behavior, exchange coupling and  dynamical properties of well characterized multilayer and  microstructured magnetic systems, and 4) magneto-transport and related  magnetic phenomena associated with multilayer films and multilayer-  based microstructures.    An important feature of the instrument design is the unique  combination of materials growth and microstructure fabrication  capabilities, materials characterization tools and magnetic sensitive  probes which can be used separately or as an integrated system. The  instrument consists of three coupled subsystems 1) a thin film growth  and characterization chamber incorporating multicell molecular beam  epitaxy (MBE) with real-time growth monitoring tools inclu ding  Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) and Auger Electron  Spectroscopy (AES); Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) including  high resolution spot profile analysis capability;  2) a Magneto-Optic  Kerr Effect (MOKE) polarimeter set up for high spatial resolution  scanning measurements as well as analysis of hysteresis dynamics; and  3) a high resolution Scanning Electron Microscope with Spin  Polarization Analysis (SEMPA) instrument. The SEM/SEMPA instrument is  configured to accept a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) column to mill  microstructures while viewing the process using SEM.  The system is  integrated with gate valves and air lock chambers permitting the  SEMPA/MOKE subsystem or the MOKE/film growth subsystem to be used  independently.  %%%  This instrumentation has the potential to advance the fundamental  knowledge and understanding of thin-film magnetic structure.  Such  structures have great potential for device applications, which can  produce breakthroughs in magnetic device technology.",
