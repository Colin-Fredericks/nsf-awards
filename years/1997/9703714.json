The IIGS is the  display of present surgical position and trajectory on  preoperatively obtained tomographic images.  The MIS is a  technique by which surgical exposures and damage to healthy  tissues are reduced by the use of endoscopes to allow  surgical visualization through small openings in the skin.  These two techniques are complementary, MIS presents high  magnification, real-time imaging at the cost of a small  depth of field and surface-only imaging, while IIGS provides  a wide field of view with three-dimensional information but  uses images which do not reflect anatomic changes since  their acquisition.  By using the proposed merging process,  both the tomographic information and the video input will  appear on the same computer screen allowing the surgeon to  use each imaging modality for its strength and mitigating  the disadvantages of each.  The combination of these  techniques would be accomplished in three steps: (1) the  creation of a device which allows the determination of the  visualization geometry of the endoscope and the tracking of  that geometry in three-dimensional physical space, (2) the  design, programming and testing of software to allow the  display of high throughout image formation, and (3) the  development of alternatives to conventional IIGS display  modes to allow flexibility depending on the nature of the  surgical situation.  This process could result in improved  outcomes as measured by more complete resections and reduced  damage to healthy tissue.  ***",
