However, the  current representation of the hydrological cycle in GCMs is  inadequate to properly characterize its important role and  interactions within the climate system.  A critical shortcoming is  that the global water cycle is not closed so that the land and  oceans remain uncoupled, i.e. river runoff from the continents is  not added as an input to the oceans.  The purpose of this research  is to close the global hydrological cycle in the CSM under  development at NCAR by incorporating horizontal transport of water  across the continents (i.e river transport) into its land  component.  A grid-scale land surface parameterization will be  coupled to algorithms for subgrid-scale runoff generation and an  explicit representation of global river networks to accurately  route river flow across the continents to the oceans.  We refer to  this coupled land parameterization - subgrid algorithm - river  transport scheme as a Global Land Hydrology Model (GLHM). The board  scope of this work includes the development and testing of a GLHM  which comprehensively models the cycling of water over and through  the continental and surfaces; coupling this model to the CSM to  link the land and the oceans; and using the CSM to improve our  predictive understanding of the role of the global hydrological  cycle in the Earth's climate system.  Specific near-term objectives  are to: develop a prototype version of the GLHM from existing or  simplified model components; test the ability  of the prototype GLHM  to reproduce observed continental hydroclimatology; and to perform  initial coupled model experiments to determine the effect of  closing the global water cycle on CSM simulations.  Specific  contributions of this work to the NCAR (or any other) CSM effort  include: conservation of fresh water balance simulation due to  water cycle closure; computation of physically realistic river  hydrographs along continental margins for input into ocean, sea  ice, and later, biogeochemical transport models; the ability to  simulate subgrid soil moisture distributions and subgrid fractions  of inundated floodplain, both of which are intimately linked to the  generation of grid-scale water, energy, and biogeochemical fluxes;  an improved ability to validate CSM performance since streamflow is  the most observable and well documented of the land surface fluxes;  and an improved framework for understanding the global water cycle  and its complex interactions within the Earth's climate system.   This is the first attempt at a coordinated effort to build a state-  of-the-science GLHM that explicitly resolves the vertical and  horizontal circulation of terrestrial water for the specific  purpose of closing the global water cycle in CSMs.",
