Hou                    Applied Math                       Caltech                 Abstract of Proposed Research      We propose developing a new finite element method of computing  multiscale and multicomponent problems in composite materials and  porous media.  In this method, the base functions are constructed in  such a way that they contain the local microscopic properties of the  differential operators. These oscillatory bases are independent from  each other and can be constructed independently. In effect, we  break a large scale computation into many smaller and independent pieces,  which can be carried out perfectly in parallel. Thus, the size of  the computation is drastically reduced. Due to this drastic memory saving,  numerical computations of practical problems with  many small scales, which were previously unobtainable using a  traditional finite element method, now become possible using our method.  An advantage of our approach is that it can handle general multiscale  problems without the requirement of scale separation, a property which is very  important for practical applications. Several numerical examples are included  to demonstrate this effect. We will perform a careful numerical error analysis   of our method. The effect of grid resonance, and geometric singularities  of local inclusions, such as corners, cusps, will be analyzed.    Effective numerical simulations of multiscale phenomena play an essential  role in many engineering and industrial applications. A direct numerical   solution of the multiple scale problems is difficult even with modern   supercomputers. The major difficulty of direct solutions is the scale of   computation.  For oil reservoir simulations, it is common that millions of   grid blocks are involved, with each block having a dimension of tens of   meters, whereas the permeability measured from cores is at a scale of several   centimeters. This gives more th an hundred thousands of degrees of freedom per  spatial dimension in the computation.  Therefore, a tremendous amount  of  computer memory and CPU time are required, and they can easily exceed  the limit of today's computing resources. The goal of this proposed research   is to provide a coarsened reservoir model which gives simulation results in   close agreement with those of the original fine scale description but at   considerable computational savings. Many existing up-scaling methods   currently used in the oil industry are based on the homogenization theory  with periodic structures and separable scales. There is no guarantee that   they work for general random permeability without scale separation. In  comparison, our approach is more systematic and general.  We are very hopeful that this proposed research will provide an  effective alternative to perform oil reservoir simulations.",
