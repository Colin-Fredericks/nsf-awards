The collaborators are Robert  Howard, National Solar Observatory, Tucson,  Arizona and K.R. Sivaraman, Indian Institute of  Astrophysics, Bangalore, India.  The  researchers will use two unique data sets, the  Kodaikanal and Mount Wilson sunspot data.  The  Kodaikanal data go back to 1906.  These data  sets constitute a particularly valuable set of  fundamental data on solar surface motions.   Using the combined data, the investigators will  study solar surface motions that are important  for answering many unsolved questions about the  solar dynamo processes within the sun.  The use  of complementary data will greatly improve the  precision with which to infer subsurface  physical conditions related to the solar  activity cycle.     Scope:  This project supports a collaboration  between two highly competent solar astronomers  and deals with a difficult but important  scientific problem.  Solar astronomy is a field  of Indian strength.  This award supports the  analysis of data collected under a project  previously supported by the Division of  International Programs (INT).  The project is  mutually beneficial and meets INT criteria for  support.      ***",
