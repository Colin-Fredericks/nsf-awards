 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705195  Tu    It is the purpose of this research to investigate the  wetting behavior of Pb-free solders on thin film  metallization.  Emphasis is on the wetting tip behavior and  intermetallic compound formation during soldering.  Investigated is a unique thin film reaction where the grains  ripen and spall resulting in dewetting.  To understand the  basic science of reactive wetting and the applications to  thin film metallization in electronic packaging, two main  topics are the focus of the research: (1) the instability of  a reactive wetting tip and (2) the mechanisms of spalling  and dewetting. The dependence of wetting angle on the  composition of Sn in dilute Pb(Sn) alloys is examined.  It  is expected that the wetting angle changes observed in the  case of Pb(Sn) on Ni will be less than that of Pb(Sn) on Cu,  which, in turn, will be much less than that of Pb(Sn) on Pd.  Previous work shows that the wetting angle of molten  eutectic SnPb on Pd is unstable and changes with time.  A  systematic and comparative study on Ni, Cu, and Pd surfaces  is conducted..  %%%  Solder technology is essential for electronic packaging.  The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) has projected a  trend of increasing use of solder in device manufacturing.  The US Congress and Environmental Projection Agency (EPA),  however, has expressed a concern over the use of Pb in the  electronics industry.  As a consequence, lead (Pb)-free  solders and their processes, properties and reliability need  to be studied.  ***",
