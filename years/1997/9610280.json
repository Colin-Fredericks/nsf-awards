 "awd_abstract_narration": "9610280  German    New research on supersolidus liquid phase sintering (SLPS)  addresses three topics.  The first examines microstructural  evolution during heating and sintering.  A current model of  the process makes assumptions on the rate of grain growth,  liquid film thickness, shrinkage rate, semisolid particle  viscosity, and causes of distortion.  These assumptions are  addressed by experimentation performed on model systems  using microstructure measurements from quenched samples and  in situ testing.  The goal is to increase the model reality  and to recognize any behavior between systems.  The second  topic is  the prediction of final component size and shape.  A computational prediction for the loss of structural  rigidity as liquid spreads on the grain boundaries needs  verification.  Furthermore, gradients in grain size,  particle size, packing density, substrate friction, and heat  transfer need to be included in the final component size and  shape predictions.  The third activity extends the model to  several other processing conditions (bimodal-sized powders,  powders of differing compositions, high viscosity systems,  reactive systems).  %%%  Success in this research should positively impact the use of  the SLPS process to produce full density, complex shapes via  powder metallurgy.  A research target is tool steels where  there are opportunities to use SLPS in the near net-shape  production of high performance tooling.  ***",
