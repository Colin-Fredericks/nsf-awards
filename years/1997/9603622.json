 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jones & Norris  IBN 9603622         Pacific salmon, after being born in freshwater streams,  migrate downstream to a lake or to the ocean.  Then, after  several years, they migrate upstream to their original place  of birth.  Pacific salmon are semelparous; i.e. they breed  once and die soon thereafter.  During this upstream breeding  migration, blood levels of stress (glucocorticoids) and  reproductive hormones (gonadotropins, estrogens and  androgens) surge, and their reproductive organs mature.  After spawning, they all die within 7 to 14 days.  Before  death, their bodies (e.g skin, muscle, heart) exhibit  pathological changes that are remarkably similar to those  seen in aging humans.  Recently,  Dr. Jones and Dr. Norris  discovered that the brains of spawning salmon exhibit  neuronal degeneration and beta-amyloid plaque deposition.  They also found changes in glucocorticoid  hormone receptor  immunoreactivity in specific brain regions.  The presence of  amyloid-like plaques and dying neurons are very striking  observations since this is also seen in older humans,  especially those with Alzheimer's disease.  Dr. Jones and  Norris will now examine more precisely the timing of these  changes in wild salmon and determine the role of steroid  hormones.  Greater understanding of salmon brain aging,  especially the role of stress and reproductive hormones,  could help in the management and conservation of Pacific  salmon, some of which are endangered.   Dr. Jones and Norris  will also verify that salmon brain aging is similar to that  in other species, including human.  Thus, the synchronized,  predictable, and rapid aging of salmon may serve as an ideal  model system to help us understand normal aging processes in  the brain, as well as in abnormal conditions such as  Alzheimer's disease.",
