 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support is provided by the Organic Synthesis Program  to continue   Professor Donald S. Matteson's studies of asymmetric synthesis with   boronic esters in the Department of Chemistry at Washington State   University.  Professor Matteson will examine the cyclization of   asymmetric boronic esters to obtain chiral cyclobutanes, providing a new   route for the synthesis of natural products, typified by the boll weevil   pheremone, grandisol.  Reactions allowing the conversion of boronic   esters to alkyldihaloboranes will be developed, and these reactions will   be modified through intramolecular delivery of nucleophilic centers to   afford new syntheses of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing heterocycles.    Catalytic chirality control in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds will   be assayed, as will reactions resulting in the conversion of carbon-boron   bonds to carbon-nitrogen and carbon-carbon bonds.  These studies will   open the doors for the preparation of C2-chiral diamines and the study of   retroracemization reactions, allowing complete conversion of racemic   boronic ester substrates to a single diastereomeric product.  Many molecules exist which bear the same relationship to their mirror   image as a right hand bears to a left hand - they look the same, but they   are not identical.  Often, one form of a molecule will display different   properties, particularly with regards to biological activity, than those   of its mirror image form, and thus synthetic organic chemists must devise   methods for the preparation of single forms of desired molecules.    Professor Matteson will explore such `asymmetric` syntheses by developing   the chemistry of compounds containing boron, exploiting the unusual   chemical reactivity of such compounds to facilitate the formation of new   carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bonds.  He will develop routes to broad   classes of compounds, providing a general foundation on which to build   the field of asymmetric synthesis, and also will highlight the practical   utility of the chemistry through the synthesis of a molecule which may   serve as an agent for the control of boll weevil infestations.",
