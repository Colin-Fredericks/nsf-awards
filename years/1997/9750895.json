 "awd_abstract_narration": "A GC/MS system, with mass spectral libraries and complementary mass spectral tutorial software, is being used in a project-based lab curriculum. Students work on realistic projects from the day they enter the lab in first semester General Chemistry. By the time they are seniors, they are ready to tackle true real-world problems that are open-ended and ill-defined. In order to successfully solve these problems, students need the sophisticated tools necessary to bring these problems to a complete, professionally satisfying closure. Although GC, FT-IR, and NMR are useful techniques for characterizing compounds, GC/MS allows students to positively identify unknowns, reaction products, by-products, and impurities. The Instrumental Analysis lab course is being restructured with the acquisition of GC/MS to incorporate Problem-Based Learning. Real-world problems that require GC/MS and that reflect the concerns of the local community are being developed with the help of an outside panel of industrial experts. These projects in particular engage students in community outreach activities, a model that can be emulated at other institutions. The GC/MS system also is used in the undergraduate research program. Acquisition of GC/MS enhances the research program by putting another powerful problem-solving tool at the disposal of students, better preparing them for the transition to graduate school or industry. Finally, we are training our senior chemistry majors to act as GC/MS student technical experts. These technical experts assist lower division and research students who need to use GC/MS in their projects but who do not necessarily need to learn the intricacies of running a GC/MS. This model, too, can be emulated at other institutions. Dissemination of our approach to incorporating GC/MS into the curriculum will be accomplished at regional meetings and through chemical education journals.  *",
