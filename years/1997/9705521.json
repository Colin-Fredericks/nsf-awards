 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705521  Du    This experimental research project is a study of  magnetotransport  and  millimeter wave spectroscopy of the 2-D electron gas in  the  fractional   quantum   Hall  effect  regime,   specifically  the  properties  of  composite Fermions in a partially  filled  Landau  level. The experiments open a new window to probe dynamics  of the  quantum  Hall system. The internal structure, ie, the  dispersion  w(q)  of the bound states, and the inherent fluctuations  of  the  bound states, will be investigated.  Millimeter waves  tunable  in  energy  from  1-10K will couple into the 2-D gas  via  a  surface  metal  grating  or periodic density modulation, and  a  sensitive  differential  photoconductivity  technique  will  be   used  for  detection.   The  experiments  will  also  involve  nanostructure  techniques such as high-resolution electron-beam lithography  and  processing.  %%%  This experimental research project is devoted to basic  properties  of  a  conducting  electron  system when  confined  into  a  two-  dimensional  planar region. Such a confined set of  electrons  at  low  temperatures and with high magnetic fields exhibits  a  very  unusual  set  of characteristics, and in some ways  the  entities  which  are relevant are not electrons behaving as they  behave  in  vacuum,  but \"quasi-particles\" having separable spin  and  charge  properties. The \"composite Fermions\" of this situation are  to  be  studied  by  shining radio waves onto them and making  measurments  to determine the response to the radio waves. On the one  hand the  experiments  will provide new basic information  about  electrons  when   they  are  in  interaction  in  confined  layers  at  low  temperatures. On the other hand the device structures  which  are  used  in  these experiments are similar to those used in  advanced  microelectronic  devices  in the GaAs technology.  This  research  will  involve students who will be well trained in  the  area  of  physics and will also gain familiarity with  semiconductor  device  technolgy, and who will be excellently trained for  employment  in  industry, government, or education.  ***",
