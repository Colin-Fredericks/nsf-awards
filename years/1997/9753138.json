 "awd_abstract_narration": "Why do some persuasive techniques change attitudes only briefly, whereas others may change attitudes on a long-term basis?  Past research has demonstrated that attitude change induced through the thoughtful consideration of a persuasive message (called central route persuasion) seems to endure across time, whereas attitude change induced by other, less thoughtful means (called peripheral route persuasion) appears relatively impermanent.  The purpose of the proposed body of research is to investigate the mechanisms underlying persistent attitude change by examining at which stage in attitudinal processing central versus peripheral route messages have their greatest effect.  An electrophysiological paradigm will be used to separate an early stage of attitudinal processing, evaluative categorization, from later stages in attitudinal processing.  This paradigm is applied in two studies designed to tease apart the conditions in which persuasion causes lasting versus transient attitude change.  It is hypothesized that central and peripheral route persuasive techniques impact different stages of attitudinal processing, and further, that the most enduring types of attitude change are those that change the evaluative categorization itself.  The understanding of how persuasive techniques result in lasting attitude change is important for both practical and theoretical reasons.  For example, persuasive messages are often used in the domain of public health to reduce destructive behaviors (e.g. smoking during pregnancy) or promote protective behaviors (e.g. safer sex); the efficacy of these messages depends on their ability to produce long-term attitude change.  Although the need to examine the way in which a message is processed has been recognized for the past decade, the separation of attitudinal processing stages has been difficult using traditional measurement techniques.  The utilization of event related brain potentials in the current proposal represents an advance in measurement that will allow for the parsing and assessment of the stages of attitudinal processing.  It is hoped that the examination of the stages of attitudinal processing that are affected by different persuasive strategies will ultimately increase understanding and prediction of successful and enduring attitude change.  The principal investigator of this POWRE proposal is an assistant professor in the early stages of her career.  The studies in the current proposal represent exploratory work in a new line of inquiry.  This award will increase her productivity, visibility, and likelihood of achieving leadership in her field.",
