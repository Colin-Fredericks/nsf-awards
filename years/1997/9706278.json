 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a cultural anthropologist and a psychologist from Harvard University studying the adaptation of recent (within 6 months) immigrant students 10-14 years old (Koreans and Vietnamese from Asia, Dominicans and Haitians from the Caribbean, and Mexicans and Salvadorans from Latin America) to secondary school in the Boston area.  The project will get massive amounts of data over five years to observe how students (75 in each ethnic category) adjust to their new country, and to explain the troubling fact that among nearly all immigrant groups today school achievement declines with increasing length of residence in the US.  Four student research assistants will interview students in depth and get a variety of measures of their psychological and social adjustment.  Methods include participant observation, focus groups, formal psychosocial measurements and perusal of academic records.  The specific research questions will focus on the family system, the cultural models of schooling, the relation of social, cultural and economic capital to schooling success, neighborhood factors, time allocation, peer networks, and gender.     This research is important because the declining school performance of most immigrant groups associated with increased length of residence in the US is greatly troubling to this society.  This longitudinal study will provide a significant comparative case study to give insights into causal factors affecting this phenomenon, which will be available to be used by school administrators and policy makers to improve the situation.",
