Strain-induced  effects  in  1D  wires  and  0D   dots   are  relatively  unexplored,  because  the  strain  is   strongly  inhomogeneous and lacks the in-plane symmetry  of  the  much  studied  2D  heterostructures.  We will study  two  distinct  classes  of structures:  silicon-germanium (SiGe) wires  and  dots,  and  strained  III-V wires and  rings  fabricated  by  regrowth.   The  SiGe  research will  build  on  our  recent  measurements   of   strain  relaxation  and   strain-induced  quantization  in  submicron SiGe Quantum  dots.   The  III-V  structures will be fabricated by modulation-doping  regrowth  of   in-situ   patterned   surfaces   etched   in   strained  heterostructures in a chamber attached directly  to  an  MBE  system.   This  research is relevant not  only  to  strained  nanostructure  physics, but also to  a  number  of  proposed  nanodevices that incorporate strained regions.  In  addition  to  graduate student training, this research will provide an  ample number of semester and year-long projects for students  interested in laboratory experience.  %%%  Nontechnical CAREER Abstract:  As  technology advances, semiconductor devices that underpin  modern computers and lasers are becoming ever smaller. These  ultrasmall  structures are affected in complex ways  by  the  mechanical strains that arise during their manufacture.   We  will  experimentally investigate strain effects in two types  of   semiconductors:   silicon,  which  is  used  for   most  electronic circuits, and gallium arsenide, which is  crucial  for  applications that require very high speed operation  or  optical  signals.  In shedding light on strain in ultrasmall  structures  and gauging the promise of novel  devices,  this  research  will  couple  to  the education  of  graduate  and  undergraduate   students   in  semiconductor    physics   and  technology at Brown.  The education plan includes an  update  of  semiconductor  device courses and  the  revamping  of  a  semester-long   transistor  fabrication   laboratory,   upon  completing which students will have the background  to  take  on  semester  and  year-long  supervised  projects  on  sub-  sections of the proposed research.  ***",
