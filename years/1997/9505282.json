 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9505282  Lee   A critical deficiency exists in current dielectric materials that prevents their use in the next generation of semiconductor devices. Replacing conventional inorganic dielectrics with organic polymers is one of the more promising approaches to circumventing this problem. Organic materials offer lower dielectric constants, better planarization, improved dimensional stability, and require fewer manufacturing steps to process than their inorganic counterparts. However, current organic polymer dielectrics such as polyimides are not suitable as interlevel dielectrics for IC applications. Thus new organic polymers with the right combinations of properties are required.   We are proposing to continue the development of a new class of dielectrics based on polyquinolines. Polyquinolines do not have the same deficiencies that plague polyimides and polyquinoines are ideally suited to serve as dielectric materials due in part to their inherently low dielectric constants, low moisture uptakes, and unparalleled thermal stabilities. Unfortunately, the glass transition temperatures (<280 C) of most polyquinoline materials are too low for IC applications. In Phase I we sought and achieved the preparation of a useful polyquinoline derivative with a Tg above 300 C. In this Phase II program, we are proposing to continue the development of these materials and prepare polyquinoline dielectrics with T,'s2350 C. The new polymers developed in this program will be subjected to numerous evaluations to qualify them as intermetal dielectric materials. The final confirmation involves the preparation and electrical evaluations of IC test structures made from these materials.   The materials polymers that will be developed in this program are being designed to serve as intermetal dielectrics in IC applications. However, the anticipated advantages that they will offer are likely to make them attractive in many dielectric uses including IC passivation and various insulating layers for liquid crystalline displa y and multichip module applications.",
