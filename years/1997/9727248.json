 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727248  Knight  Increasing environmental concerns and impending  legislation, particularly concerning product takeback,  emphasize the importance of the end-of-life management of  products.  This has resulted in efforts to recover value  from components and materials before discarding of such  products and to reduce environmental impact.  Among the  various ways in which value can be recovered are,  disassembly or de-manufacturing, bulk recycling, and  incineration for energy generation.  Materials only have  significant recycled value when they are divided into clean  separate types.  This means that the viable recycling of  manufactured products depends greatly on the efficiency  with which materials can be separated from each other.  The  separation and recovery of items and materials from  products for recycling can be approached in two main ways,  which can be used together.  These are relatively careful  disassembly and bulk recycling, which often involves the  shredding of mixes of materials and using various  separation techniques on the stream of particles produced.  In the long term, recycling can be made more effective by  the design of products for greater ease of disassembly and  recycling.  This requires the development of suitable  product analysis tools to enable design teams to evaluate  the ease of disassembly and recycling of alternative  product concepts during the early stages of design.  In  addition, the development of better methods of bulk  recycling and for increasing the efficiency of existing  bulk recycling processes is important.  The work to be  carried out in this proposal addresses both of these  aspects.        The proposers have previously been involved in the  following developments:        Product analysis tools which simulate end-of-life           disassembly and evaluate the financial and           environmental effects of different product designs           and end-of-life scenarios.        Modeling of bulk recycling processes, in particular to            evaluate the best processing sequences for material           separation processes.    Building on this previous work, this proposal is concerned  with the investigation of several cases of the problem of  selecting the best sequence for recovery of materials by  bulk recycling, including the matching of mixes of different  products.  The use of this information in analyzing the best  combination of disassembly and bulk recycling for recovered  value or environmental impact will be also investigated.  Based on this investigation, tools for helping designers  examine the consequences of material selection upon the end  of life recovery of materials will be constructed, to enable  design teams to evaluate the recycling potential of proposed  products through optimal combinations of disassembly and  efficient bulk recycling.  In addition, models of material  separation processes for bulk recycling will assist bulk  recycling facilities to operate in an economic manner,  enhancing the end-of-life recovery of materials that would  otherwise not be recovered and be consigned to landfills.  ***",
