It focuses on three questions: (1) Which employers provide work/family benefits?, (2) Why do organizations adopt work/family policies? and (3) What are the implications of work/family policies for redefining gender relations and restructuring work life?  This project investigates work/family policies related to maternity leave, parental and family leaves, childcare and elder care programs and flexibility about the timing and location of work.  Historical data will be collected by surveying a stratified random sample of profit, non-profit, and public sector organizations to get information on their personnel practices.   Additional data on why organizations adopt work/family policies will be collected from personnel management literature and organizational documents (e.g., personnel manuals, press releases, work/family brochures) to determine how work/family policies affect organizations' social construction of gender and their understanding of the boundaries between work and family.  ****     ??",
