 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT 9605193  Johnson      This U.S.-Czech research project between Carl H. Johnson of Vanderbilt University and Ivana Machackova of the Czech Institute of Experimental Botany will examine the chemical basis of plant flowering.  Results should contribute to our basic understanding of the photoperiodic time measurement (PTM) system and the process of information transfer to flowering tissue, meristems, in plants.  Specifically, Drs. Johnson and Machackova plan to use the tobacco plant as the model system because much is known about PTM in tobacco and a variety of strains in the same genus display different photoperiodic phenotypes.    The researchers will build this inquiry upon recently discovered information about melatonin, a crucial hormone for PTM found animals, and new evidence suggesting that cytosolic free calcium fluxes are involved in the phototransduction pathway. Since melatonin is similarly found in higher plants, this project will attempt to determine the mechanisms controlling the circadian production of melatonin in plants and the roles, if any, played by melatonin and/or cytosolic free calcium in photoperiodic induction of flowering in higher plants.    This project in cell biology fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.   ??",
