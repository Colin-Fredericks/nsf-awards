 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most intuitive geometric concepts is that of dimension. While it is very easy for a non-mathematician to guess the dimension of a particular geometric object, it is fairly difficult to define the dimension in a formal, rigorous way. The first mathematical definition of dimension arises in linear algebra. From that definition one easily understands that the dimensions of the line, the plane, and the 3-space are respectively 1,2, and 3. Ever since the formation of topology as an offshoot of analysis, mathematicians attempted to define dimension in a non-algebraic way.  The most intuitive such definition is the so-called small inductive dimension ind(X) of a space X. Essentially, ind(X) at most n means that open sets U with boundary of dimension at most (n-1) form a basis of X. Extension dimension theory is a general theory of dimension in which spaces are not parametrized by natural numbers. Instead, they are parametrized by CW complexes. In this theory dim(X) being at most K means that K is an absolute extensor of X.  In particular, dim(X) is at most the n-dimensional sphere S(n) if and only if the covering dimension of X is at most n.  dim(X)=K means that K is minimal with respect to all L such that dim(X) is at most L. It turns out that extension dimension encompasses both the covering dimension and the cohomological dimension.  It is rich in interplay between geometry and algebra which, to the Principal Investigator, is the cornerstone of all mathematics. In the case of finite-dimensional compacta one has an associated algebraic object called the Bockstein algebra.  There is a dual theory to extension dimension which deals with CW complexes and in the case of countable CW complexes there is an associated algebraic object called the dual Bockstein algebra.  This project involves the study of 'dimension.'  The need to study objects of various dimensions is not unique to mathematics alone. The perception of the dimension of the basic object we live in, the Universe, has undergone signi ficant changes over time. In Newtonian mechanics, the Universe is assumed to be 3-dimensional; Einstein added one more dimension (time).  Currently theoretical physicists ponder various models of the Universe aimed at unifying gravity and quantum mechanics; in some models the Universe is of dimension 10 while in others its dimension is 26.",
