 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides a new high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) system that is crucial to the chemistry and environmental chemistry teaching laboratories and replaces a 12-year old HPLC used for all chemistry teaching and research laboratories.  The new instrument can be used at all curricular levels from introductory chemistry laboratory to senior research projects.  The HPLC system is the centerpiece of the separations instrumental analysis course and plays an important role in the environmental chemistry program.  It is one of the principal tools used to teach trace analytical methods for water and soils, as well as the analysis of foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals and the semipreparative scale separations of proteins and organic reaction products.  The acquisition of this essential analytical technique allows the university to provide undergraduates with the training, background, and experience in modern instrumentation that is expected by employers and graduate schools.  *",
