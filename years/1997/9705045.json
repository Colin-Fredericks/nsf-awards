 "awd_abstract_narration": "The General Motors Corporation Technical Education Program   and the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University (ISU)  have a partnership under which General Motors (GM) employees  can earn a non-thesis M.S. Degree in Statistics taking regular  courses from the department via video tape.  The degree  requirements include a research component that results in a  formal paper (creative component).  Students from GM will have  co-major professors, a statistician from GM and a statistician  from ISU.  The purpose of this proposal is to create  opportunities for visits and interactions that will help the GM  students with this creative component research and introduce ISU  faculty to research problems of interest to industry.         This project will fund interactions of two different but  related types: 1) site visits by ISU personnel with GM students  and co-major professors and 2) collaborative research with  scientists at GM Research Labs.  In the summer of 1997, one ISU  statistician will visit GM students and co-major professors,  discussing company interests and areas for collaboration, and  identifying appropriate topics for creative component research.   In the summer of 1998, this person will spend 1 additional month  doing collaborative research with GM scientists.  In the summer  of 1998 a second faculty member will spend two months engaged  in visits and collaborative research.  As part of their visits  with GM research scientists, these faculty members will give  seminars for GM statisticians and engineers on modern statistical  methods.  This proposed interaction will produce topics for  publishable creative components, research ideas for ISU faculty  members and solutions for real industry problems.         The educational experience of the students at GM will be  greatly enhanced through the proposed interaction.  The GM  students will be exposed to both academic and industrial  approaches to research.  Ideally, their creative components will  both answer a particular q uestion for GM and raise new questions  for the ISU faculty members, that can serve as subsequent topics  for both personal research and for that of future ISU graduate  students.  The end result will then be the advancement of  knowledge in directions important to industry practice.         Since the projects at GM will likely combine statistics and  engineering, many will serve as focal points to bring together  ISU faculty members from Statistics and Engineering.  Additional  collaborative research at ISU is thus likely to follow from this  project.         This GOALI project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
