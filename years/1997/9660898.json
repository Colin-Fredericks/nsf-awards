 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9660898  Hilmas        This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project will use a novel approach to fabricate multilayer ceramic capacitors  (MLCCs) having thin dielectric layers. The MLCCs will be fabricated through an adaptation of the low cost Fibrous Monolithic (FM) processing technology, currently under development by the proposer,  to produce advanced structural ceramics. It is based on the melt spinning of thermoplastic/powder blends to create novel hierarchical architectures beneficial to the ceramic industry. The project will incorporate BaTiOs and Ag-based powders as the dielectric and electrode materials, respectively, to fabricate 'in-situ' MLCCs. Microstructural characterization and electrical testing of these prototype MLCCs will be performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the overall concept. Phase I success will allow future iterations in order to optimize the desired electrical properties. The demand for multilayer ceramic capacitors  having high capacitance and high volumetric efficiencies has led to increased challenges in the manufacturing of MLCCs. The preferred method for increasing the performance of MLCCs, both in the U.S. and Japan, is to reduce the thickness of the dielectric ceramic layers below 10  m while maintaining a high dielectric constant. This has posed some critical challenges to current MLCC fabrication methods, such as tape casting, in order to meet these needs.   The successful adaptation of the FM processing technology from advanced structural ceramics to functional MLCC materials will allow the manufacturing of the latter at a low cost with a variety of architectures and incorporating a selection of dielectric layer thicknesses.  The optimization of this novel process will lead to higher volume MLCC production over current fabrication methods.  ***",
