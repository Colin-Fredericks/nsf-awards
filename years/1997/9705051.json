 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the initiation of a collaborative research  program between Dr. Barna Bihari of the Rockwell Science Center  and Professor Donald Schwendeman of the Department of  Mathematical Sciences at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  The  research will be performed at Rensselaer during the academic  year, 1997-98, and the subsequent summer, with follow-up  collaborative activity planned.  The focus of the research  will be on multiresolution schemes for the numerical solution of  nonlinear conservation laws.  Specific tasks will include the  implementation of high-order multidimensional ENO schemes on  general curvilinear grids, the study and implementation of  high-order boundary conditions, the study and implementation of  error estimates and adaptivity, and the application of these  methods to highly relevant computational fluid dynamics (CFD)  problems to the industrial sponsor.  A wide range of research and  teaching activity is planned including the formation of a  research activity group on numerical methods for conservation  laws which will focus the research efforts of faculty and  students initiated by this award.  Through the interaction with  this research group and with other programs at Rensselaer,  such as the Scientific Computation Research Center (SCOREC), the  collaboration will have a broad impact.  In addition to bringing  new areas of active research to Rensselaer, this collaborative  program will enrich existing programs.  A benefit to the teaching  activity at Rensselaer will occur through the interaction with  students in the math department and with students involved in the  Computational Science and Engineering program.  Dr. Bihari's  collaboration will also enhance the ongoing effort to encourage  academic-industry interaction through programs such as the  Workshop on Mathematical Problems in Industry (MPI).  This award  includes significant cost sharing by Rockwell.    This project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OM A) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
