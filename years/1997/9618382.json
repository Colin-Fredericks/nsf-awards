 "awd_abstract_narration": "The contributions of Isaac Newton to the development of modern science and its methodology  were epoch-making.  Yet in his lifetime Newton chose to publish only two  books and a few papers.  Only in the past generation, with the publication of his  Correspondence (1959-77) and Mathematical Papers (1967-81) has even a portion of the vast  quantity of his surviving papers have become known and studied.   These unpublished works have  been of great historical value, significantly enriching and modifying our interpretation of his  life and works, as well as that of early modern science.  During his career Newton treated a broad range of optical topics, including color and  refraction, interference phenomena, the construction of optical instruments, and the nature  of light.  Because Newton's optical investigations are so fundamental to his own  scientific development, and to an understanding of the development of science, it has  been widely recognized than an edition of his optical papers is sorely needed.  In 1984,  with support from NSF, I published the first volume of a three-volume edition of The  Optical Papers of Isaac Newton, and the current project will prepare volumes 2 and 3 for  publication.                                                       \u2563\u2502%\u00c1\u00a2 />\u2524 / \u2593??,  \u2534\u255d\u2563\u00a5\u00a5\u00c1> \u00c2?\u255d / \u2514/\u255d\u2563\u00c1\u00a5` ?\u00c2 /\u2510\u2524\u2563\u00c1>\u2502\u00c1\u00a2  \u00a5\u00a9/\u00a5 \u2563>\u2502%\u2510\u2524\u00c1 \u00a2\u2502\u2563\u00c1>\u00a5\u2563\u00a2\u00a5\u00a2 />\u2524 \u2551\u00a9\u2563%?\u00a2?\u2551\u00a9\u00c1\u255d\u00a2  \u2551?%\u2563\u2502` _/,\u00c1\u255d\u00a2  />\u2524 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u00c0\u00c1>\u00c1\u255d/% \u2551\u2510\u2593%\u2563\u2502",
