 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, the Field Museum of Natural History will construct an up to date catalogue of items in the Paul S. Martin Archaeological Collection, enter it into an electronic data base and make this available via the Museum's World Wide Web connection. Martin spent his archaeological career, which began in the 1930s and spanned more than 40 years, in the U.S.Southwest. His excavations and resultant collections constitute a unique national resource representing the coordinated efforts of a single individual in two relatively small areas: southwest Colorade and East Central Arizona/West Central New Mexico. Martin surveyed and excavated extensively in both areas and brought back to the Field Museum large systematic samples of his fieldwork. They are accompanied by extensive notes and photographs which make them useful for addressing many modern research questions. Martin was meticulous in his methods of excavation and survey and his work provides a solid data base for exploring issues of evolutionary precess, social relations, culture history and human behavior. Not only is a large corpus of ceramics and lithic artifacts represented, but hte materials include tens of thousands of corn cobs, seeds and other archaeobotanical samples which can be used to understand plant genetics, evolution and past environments.  Currently, much of the collection is uncatalogued and the previously catalogued items consist of litte more than an electronic  list. No detailed provenience information is included and there is limited consistency to the artifact descriptions, artifact material types or site characteristics. Therefore it is extremely difficult for researchers to use the collection in an effective manner. With NSF support, the catalogued information will be upgraded and the remaining materials will be entered into the system. An electronic database will be constructed. All pertinent `hard copy` records will be updated to agree with the corrected and upgraded electronic databases. Provenience data and artifact descriptions will be entered into the catalogue books. Access to the entire collection wiill ths be greatly facilitated and greatlyh improved service can be provided to the large number of archaeologists working in the Southwest USA.                                              `",
