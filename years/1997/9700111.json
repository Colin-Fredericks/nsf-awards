 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700111  Neugroschel  The Solid-State Electronics laboratory at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of Florida proposes to purchase semiconductor parameter analysis stations to support fundamental research in deep-submicron transistors for advancement of future technology of American integrated circuit manufacturers.  The equipment will be used for several projects, such as the NSF grant (ECS-9220382) supported investigation on the properties of thin Ge(x)Si(1-x) layers for state-of-the-art GeSi heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTS) for analog-digital telecommunication applications beyond the 2GHz bands.  A follow-on proposal to NSF on this subject is being prepared to meet the NSF-GOALI initiative with industrial partners.  Another current research project that will use the equipment is a Semiconductor Research Corporation contract on investigating the fundamental reliability limits of deep submicron silicon metal-oxidesemiconductor and bipolar junction transistors (MOSTs and BJTS).  Other ongoing and planned investigations include deep submicron thin-film silicon-on-insulator (TFSOI) MOST and BJT technology for low power applications, fundamental limits on extending Si MOSTs to <0.1-micron and <IV, and fundamental reliability limits in support of the development of high-voltage and smart power integrated circuits.  These projects are all undertaken in close collaboration with Texas Instruments, Motorola, Intel, and several other American manufacturers.  The proposed instrument stations are not available and are unique.  With this equipment, we expect to significantly improve the understanding of the fundamental limits imposed on future transistors at smaller dimensions.  In addition, we expect the results obtained from the proposed equipment to contribute significantly to the advances of future manufacturing technology.  ***",
