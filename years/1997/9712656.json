 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712656  Quinn  Many important microbial and cellular processes require a  knowledge of the forces with which these entities adhere to  surfaces, other cells, and receptor proteins.  some of these  processes include cell separations, tumor metastasis and  wall adhesion, cell seeding for vascular prostheses, etc.  Most adhesion assays are very qualitative in nature,  frequently due to the irregular nature of the containment  \"vessels\", their small size, and the difficulty in obtaining  quantitative data without extensive investment in device  development.  Adhesion studies are usually done by measuring  the force to wash the cell off of the substrate.    This SGER proposal seeks to make the process simpler and  more quantitative by developing a set of cells of known  surface-receptor strength for use in calibrating new  measurement vessels and cell receptor systems.  The standard  cells will be latex beads which have been coated with the  appropriate receptor for the experiment and labeled with an  identifying tag.  The adhesion of the coated latex particles  will be determined in the Radial Flow Detachment Assay  (RFDA) device that the PI and  coworkers have developed over  the previous funded grant.  The cells of known adhesion  (resistance to shear washing force) could then be used to  determine more accurately the forces involved in simple  washing tests, e.g., washing of cells from coated wells by  pipette streams of water.  ***",
