 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724037  Stevens  Behaviors affect life, death and reproductive characters of  individuals and populations and it is important to  understand their  expression and evolution. Understanding the expression of a  behavior  requires understanding the genetic basis of the behavior,  the physiological  basis of the behavior, the relationship between the behavior  and fitness as  well as effect of natural selection on the behavior. This  research will use an  insect model system to understand the role of genetics,  physiology and  selection in the expression of a behavior - cannibalism  behavior in the  confused flour beetle Tribolium confusum. Because behaviors  are likely to  be determined by or highly correlated with other traits -  including basic  physiological processes such as metabolic rate or  respiration rate - the  genetic basis of and selection on respiration rate and  surface behavior  (i.e., the tendency of beetles to be on the flour surface  rather than  tunneling in the flour media) will also be examined.  Using  high and low  cannibalism strains, experiments will determine if there is  single optimum  expression of a behavior in a given environment, by creating  populations  with differing allele frequencies of cannibalism genes and  tracking the  change in allele frequencies over time.  Statistical  analysis will be used  to determine the relative importance of selection vs random  processes in  behavior evolution. The proposed research will also examine  the  controversial, virtually untested portion of Wright's  shifting balance  theory, namely the plausibility of a population moving from  one adaptive  behavior stratagy to another by migration among populations.  The genetic  analysis will be done using recent developments in molecular  genetics  including quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis.  A  molecular genetic map  of the genome of T. confusum will be constructed and used to  identify  regions of the genome associated with the behavioral and  physiological  traits. This rese arch is an important contribution to both  behavior  genetics and evolutionary biology because it tests common  assumptions made  about the adaptive significance of behaviors, as well as  their genetic  basis and evolution.",
