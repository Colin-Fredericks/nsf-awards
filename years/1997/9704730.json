 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704730  Healey    We plan to carry out research in global nonlinear analysis of partial  differential equations of nonlinear elastostatics.  A major thrust of the  proposed work will be focused on applications of a new general existence  tool developed recented by Simpson & myself (from past partial NSF  support), viz., a generalization of the Leray-Schauder degree for global  continuation and bifurcation.  In the context a concrete problems, we seek  a-prior bounds, symmetry/positivity properties, etc., all with a view  toward obtaining meaningful constitutive restrictions for entire classes of  materials.  Our study will include both traditional (strongly elliptic)  problems and those involving phase change (loss of ellipticity).  For the  latter, a new approach based upon higher-gradient regularization, global  continuation and singular limits is being proposed.  The analysis of such  models at a very general level is fundamental to the understanding of  traditional engineering materials/structures and martensitic  transformations and shape-memory effects, which are observed in many  advanced engineering alloys. The work has two major goals: (i) To obtain  new qualitative results and detect new phenomena - of both mathematical and  physical significance; (ii)  To obtain new global-continuation (existence)  results in problems of 2 and 3-dimensional elasticity - including problems  involving phase transformations.    Broadly speaking,the proposed work will provide important mathematical  underpinnings to difficult nonlinear problems arising in traditional  engineering fields like structural & mechanical engineering and also in  more modern areas like materials science. The work has the potential to:  (i) deliver new mathematical tools for the analysis of difficult problems  of engineering practice,leading ultimately to safer and more optimal design  of structures; (ii) lead to a better understanding of the nonlinear  material behavior of certain engineering alloys, with potential  application s to manufacturing engineering and the design of non-passive or  \"smart\" structures.",
