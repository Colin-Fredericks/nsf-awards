It is supported  by the Office of Polar Programs, the Chemistry Division, and the  MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  This work will  provide constraints on the thermal and fluid-infiltration history  experienced by this rock and the possible biogenic origin of  ALH84001 carbonate.    This work will build on a previously completed pilot study  comprised of over 500 analyses of 12 well characterized carbonate  standards, 11 oxygen isotope analyses in ALH84001 silicates, and  9 oxygen isotope analyses coupled with 4 carbon isotope analyses  in ALH84001 carbonate concretions.  This pilot study demonstrated  the presence of gradients in the oxygen isotope composition of  more than 10 parts in 10,000 in ALH84001 carbonates over 10's of  microns, showing that there is sufficient `signal' in the fine-  scale stable isotope variations of these minerals for us to  extract meaningful information from our proposed analyses.    Further characterization of the oxygen isotope zonation and  search for low carbon-13 phases will be critical to interpreting  the environment of formation of these carbonate concretions.  The  heterogeneity already documented in this sample indicates that  much of this work will only be possible using ion microprobe  techniques.  The research work to be completed under this award  includes a large number of analyses of 10-30 micron spots (about  5-10 microns deep) in a variety of carbonate, silicate and iron  bearing minerals to establish compositional profiles for oxygen  and carbon isotopes.    These new analyses will allow the following: (1) test concretions  for core-to-rim oxygen zonation; (2) test and refine previo us  estimates of the temperatures of formation of the various  carbonate mineral phases; (3) investigate the fluid-infiltration  history recorded by non-carbonate phases, and (4) verify initial  observations that the outer portions of carbonate concretions may  contain low carbon-13 compositions, which may be related to  purported `biofilms' at concretion margins that have been  inferred in meteorite ALH84001.  These analyses will evaluate  published reports that the fractionation of carbon isotopes  between carbonate and associated reduced carbon is consistent  with biological processes.  These constraints are central to the  interpretation of the origin of carbonates in ALH84001, both with  regard to the possibility of their biogenic origin and the  evidence they provide of the nature of volatiles on early Mars.",
