 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616730  McIntosh        While much has been learned about the structure of tornadic storms over the  last few years, some problems still remain unsolved.  For example, progress has  been made over the last decade in understanding the structure of tornadic  thunderstorms and the general environment they create that is conducive for tornado  development.  Still unresolved, however, are details of how and why tornadoes are  triggered in some storms, but not in others and the knowledge of the detailed  structure of the tornado itself.          Scientists from the University of Oklahoma and the University of  Massachusetts propose to continue a productive cooperative effort to study the near  environment and detailed structure of tornadoes.  In the first year of this project,  substantial improvements will be made to a mobile, high-resolution, ground-based,  3-mm wavelength, pulsed Doppler radar from the University of Massachusetts.  The  radar upgrades will allow collection of data with improved resolution in both time  and space.          In the second and third years, the improved mobile radar will be deployed in  a collaborative effort between the University of Massachusetts and scientists from  the University of Oklahoma.  The objective is to map the Doppler velocity and  reflectivity fields in and adjacent to tornadoes and their parent circulations.  The  purpose of the experiment is to learn how and why tornadoes form, and to determine  their internal structure.          If successful the researchers will obtain the highest-resolution measurements  ever made of the structure of a tornado and its near environment.  This may lead to  better understanding of the process of tornado genesis and improved forecasts.   ***",
