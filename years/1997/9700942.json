 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700942  Schoener  A primary question in ecology is how a top predator affects other trophic levels. While many field-experimental studies have been directed toward understanding how food webs function, few have included very large terrestrial carnivores. One reason may be the general difficulty of manipulating such predators in limited, well-defined sites. Certain islands of Australia's Great Barrier Reef provide an opportunity to conduct field experiments on a system which contains a kind of very large terrestrial carnivore, monitor lizards, that is easily observed and handled. Monitor lizards and the next-lowest trophic level, the smaller scincid lizards, will be excluded or not from experimental plots in a crossed design. Skink and leaf-litter arthropod densities and taxonomic compositions, among other variables, will be recorded at regular intervals after inception of the experiment. To complement the experimental study, a comparison of skink and arthropod densities and taxonomic compositions will be performed on islands with and without monitor lizards naturally present. This study will help begin to fill the major gap in our ecological knowledge concerning the importance of very large carnivores in food webs.",
