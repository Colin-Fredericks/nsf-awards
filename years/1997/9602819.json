 "awd_abstract_narration": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) has devoted considerable resources to support the expansion and continued growth of a biochemistry initiative in the Department of Chemistry.  The increased numbers of students desiring a degree in biochemistry, now over 50, with 50% women, has necessitated the establishment of a formal biochemistry program.  In 1995, the faculty endorsed the incorporation of the interdisciplinary biochemistry program  to create the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.  Current biochemistry and associated facilities are grossly inadequate to support quality research.  To ensure the success of this initiative and provide students with a first rate research experience, WPI and the National Science Foundation will commit resources to modernize laboratory space and establish a biochemistry core facility.   Renovation of existing research facilities in Goddard Hall, a structure built over 30 years ago, is needed to accommodate the growing programs.  Renovations will entail reconfiguring of bench space, upgrading HVAC, electrical and plumbing systems, and installing new cabinetry, cold room and a built in glass washer.  Research programs benefiting from the this project include molecular plant pathogen interactions, ion transport though red blood cell membranes, synthesis and isolation of biologically active natural products from plant and marine sources, and molecular photochemistry and laser spectroscopy.  The renovations will increase available laboratory space, ensure safety, and enhance the overall research experience enabling students to successfully compete in advanced graduate programs.",
