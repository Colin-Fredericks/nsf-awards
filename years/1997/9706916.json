 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706916  B. Fornberg     Pseudospectral (PS) methods - a high-accuracy alternative to finite  difference (FD) and finite elemnt methods - are particularly effective for  solving convection-dominated PDEs over long times and in relatively simple  geometries. Both the algorithms themselves and their analysis have usually  been closely tied to expansions in different classes of orthogonal  functions. The recent book \"A Practical Guide to Pseudospectral Methods\"  (by the present investigator)  notes that a large body of generalizations,  enhancements and insights can be gained by viewing PS methods instead as  special cases of FD methods.  These opportunities will now be explored  further, in particular with the aim of combining the PS approach with  domain decomposition for time-dependent computational electromagnetics.          Pseudospectral (PS) methods were first proposed in the early 1970's (in  connection with meteorology and turbulence modeling). They are now  routinely used in many fields such as nonlinear wave motions, weather  forecasting, fluid mechanics, computational chemistry, and with  time-domain computational electromagnetics (TD CEM) emerging as a new and  potentially major application area. This present investigation will  explore how a series of new leads for PS methods can be developed further  and then brought to bear on applications, in particular in the field of TD  CEM. Such applications include simulations of the radar visibility of  objects and of how electromagnetic fields are generated by/ interact with  components on integrated circuits.",
