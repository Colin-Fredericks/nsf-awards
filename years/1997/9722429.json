 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical investigations and calculations of low-  energy hadron properties and interactions are being  conducted in terms of quark and gluon constituents by  modeling the large distance behavior of the relativistic  field theory known as Quantum Chromodynamics.  Two  complementary lines of investigation are being followed.  The first involves truncation of the Dyson-Schwinger  equations of motion, and the second involves use of a model  quark field theory to produce an effective field theory of  mesons.  Specific topics being addressed include meson  masses and decays, meson-meson and meson-nucleon interaction  coupling constants and form factors, and electromagnetic  form factors.  The experimental issues being confronted now  in experiments at the Jefferson Laboratory are of primary  concern within this research program.  An extension is being  made to address these matters at finite temperature and  matter density for application to the experimental program  at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider facility under  construction.  The investigations are designed to put onto a  theoretical basis those aspects of meson interactions and  electromagnetic couplings that have in the past been mainly  phenomenological.",
