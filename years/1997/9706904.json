 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry Program  with a contribution from the Mathematics and Physical   Sciences Office of Multidisciplinary Activities for instrumentation   supports  work in the laboratory of Professor James Cowan in the   Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University.  The research will   examine and compare the Mg(II) binding domains of E.Coli RNase H,   exonuclease II and other proteins.  Since Mg(II) must be recruited from   the environment or cellular medium and binding affinities are often not   high, the stoichiometry of this metal cofactor required to effect   hydrolysis is often not well defined.  While the metal binding domains   show considerable variation in charge density and coordination for the   metal, they have comparable binding affinities.  Studies will focus on   calorimetric and NMR investigations of Mg binding to native and mutant   enzymes.  The results will form the basis for the rational design of   proteins with novel cation or anion binding chemistry.       This research involves a systematic investigation to define the   relative importance of Mg(II) inner and outer-sphere coordination, metal   ion charge density and solvation, binding affinity and other factors in   the use of Mg(II) in important hydrolytic enzymes.  Not only should these   studies improve our understanding of the role of magnesium in proteins,   but results should also prove highly significant  in the rational design   of ion binding sites in proteins.",
