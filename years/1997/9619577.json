 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will bring eight highly motivated and capable  undergraduate students from among the region and the nation to  the Williamsburg campus of the College of William and Mary during  each of the next three summers.  The students will spend eight  weeks experiencing mathematical research first hand, with close  faculty guidance.  Faculty advisors will come from William and  Mary's mathematics department, widely known for its research in  matrix and operator theory.  Students will work with faculty  mentors, either individually or in small groups, on research  projects in matrix theory and its applications that have been  chosen by the faculty for their accessibility and appropriateness  for well-prepared undergraduates.  During the program, seminars  on mathematics topics and field trips to nearby installations  that employ mathematicians will be provided for the students.   Informal discussion and interchange of ideas among students will  be strongly encouraged.  Each student or group will make several  oral presentations and will prepare a final written report.  In  the past, such reports have been the basis for scholarly  publications co-authored by the students and their faculty  mentors.",
