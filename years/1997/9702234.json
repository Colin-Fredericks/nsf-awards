The educational component of this award includes working on  a multidisciplinary team to revise the science curriculum  for non-science majors (with a particular emphasis on  elementary education majors); participating in a project to  bring advanced computing into the high school classroom;  and, developing original computer-based exercises and active  group learning into the standard undergraduate and graduate  curriculum.     The research component invmlves the study of a previously  unknown morphological instability through which dislocations  in ductile materials can spontaneously develop disordered  structure under the influence of a stress gradient.  Molecular dynamics simulations of dislocations in three-  dimensional fcc metal crystals will be used as an ideal  means of finding quantitative estimates of the parameters in  the theoretical analysis, particularly the magnitude of the  minimum unstable wavelength under a physically realizable  stress gradient.  Also to be studied is the role of  temperature in the inhomogeneous nucleation of dislocation  loops, e.g., at a Frank-Read source, under an externally  applied stress.  %%%  This is a CAREER award to a new faculty member which  combines a research program of computational/theoretical  materials science with a teaching program affecting both  undergraduate and graduate students.

The  research component involves both theoretical and  computational research on the formation and structure of  defects in metals which affect their mechanical properties.  These studies will not only produce a fundamental  understanding of these important effects, but will also  practical applications to failure processes in structural  metals.  ***",
