 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry program   supports research on trace metal cycling in the environment by Drs.   Leonard W. Lion, Michael L. Shuler, and William C. Ghiorse of the   Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Cornell University.    The research is supported by the Divisions of Chemistry and Earth   Sciences and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  The long   term goal is to develop an accurate mechanistic model for predicting   formation of biologically-mediated surface coatings and their subsequent   influence on transition metal distribution in natural and engineered   environments.  This project focuses on identifying the role of manganese   oxides in controlling transition metal cycling and on developing a   quantitative model for the process.  In particular, the influence of   bacterial processes and biofilm formation on both manganese oxidation and   metal binding by manganese oxides will be included in the model.    Manganese oxidation and manganese oxide deposition will be measured in   cultures of bacteria in a bioflim reactor system where pH, temperature,   dissolved oxygen concentration, fluid shear and light intensity can be   controlled.  Manganese oxide surface properties and adsorption of lead   and cadmium for biologically oxidized samples will be compared to results   obtained for abiotic chemical redox processes.  The result will be an   integrated computational model to predict manganese oxidation and   manganese oxide trace metal binding, including cellular growth, biofilm   accumulation, manganese redox reations, and trace metal speciation and   adsorption.   Adsoprtion of lead and cadmium to iron and manganese oxide particles is   thought to be an important means of transport of these toxic metals in   the natural environment.  This study is directed toward understanding the   role of manganese oxide adsorption, including the role of   biologically-mediated manganese oxidation and cycling, in the transport   process.  The results will also be relevant to development of remediation   strategies for toxic metals.",
