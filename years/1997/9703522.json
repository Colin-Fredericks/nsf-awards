This Workshop will  involve researchers and designers from both countries to discuss  progress in the development and application of earthquake  protective systems to bridges and seismic retrofit of bridges.   topics to be covered include: (1) innovative protective systems;  (2) design methods for base isolated bridges; (3) design of  utilities carried by isolated bridges so as to accommodate  movement; and (4) full-scale verification of performance.    A comparison of US and Japanese isolation designs for the same  bridge will also made.  The program also includes site visits to  several base-isolated bridges as well as several major bridges  currently under construction in Japan.    The Workshop which is jointly supported by NSF and Federal  Highway Administration, will provide an added emphasis on active  and hybrid addition, the performance of seismically isolated  bridges and buildings affected by the Northridge and Hanshin-  Awaji earthquakes will be examined.    Opportunities for the development of cooperative projects  beneficial to both the U.S. and Japan will also be identified as  a result of these workshops.",
