 "awd_abstract_narration": "Owen  9704495    This research investigates the use of statistical sampling ideas in high dimensional numerical problems, particularly numerical integration and approximation.  Statistical thinking enters the picture because in  high dimensional problems one can get at most a sparse sample of the input space.  Surprising benefits  can accrue: for example it is known that randomizing a low discrepancy sequence can increase it's  accuracy.   For the case of numerical integration, this project looks at adaptive importance sampling  techniques in which the function values themselves are used to adapt the sampling towards the most  relevant region of the input space, while maintaining a data based estimate of integral accuracy.  In the  case of numerical approximation, this project will apply recent progress in hybrid numerical integration  methods to finding ways of building sample based approximations of functions with data determined error  estimates.    Numerical integration is a fundamental computational task with applications in physics, chemistry,  finance, statistics, and numerical approximation.  Numerical approximation is also fundamental, and the  advent of powerful and flexible computer simulators of scientific and engineering phenomena can only  increase the demand for computer experiment techniques based on approximation.  At present these computer models are widely used in the design of computer chips, automobile parts, airplanes, and in  global climate modeling.  These functions may take hours or even days of computer time and so finding  fast approximations (and estimating their accuracy) is important.  Better exploration of these functions,  call it function mining, can lead to faster introduction and greater reliability for new products.  It can also  be used to thoroughly explore the predictions of models for environmental change and storage of nuclear  wastes.",
