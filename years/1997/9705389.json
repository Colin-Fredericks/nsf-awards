An ordered state of interacting  flux  lines,  as  theoretically  predicted  by Abrikosov, provides  the  conceptual  basis  of  the  experimental  work. The  influences  of  material  disorder,   thermal fluctuations, and the quantum nature  of  the  flux  line formation lead to an extremely complicated picture  in  the  area  of  parameters  where the  Abrikosov  lattice  becomes  unstable. There are questions relating to a glassy phase  of  the  flux   array,  among  others,   which  are  addressed   in   this  experimental project. The work on 2H-NbSe2  identified two states  of  the flux line lattice characterized by dramatically different  dynamics,  one being disordered and have pinning frequencies  two  orders  of  magnitude  higher  than  the  ordered  lattice,   and  accompanied  by  much higher critical currents. In  this  project  local  magnetization measurements will be made using an array  of  microscopic Hall sensors realized in the 2-D electron gas at  the  interface  of a GaAs/GaAlAs heterostructure. Other work  includes  DC  and  AC measurements of the shear modulus of the flux  array,  and measurements of transverse currents in dynamic fluxon states.  Portions of the work will be done in collaboration with  Dr.  Eli  Zeldov of the Weizmann Institute.  %%%  This experimental research project, is focused on the behavior of  Type  II  superconductors in a magnetic field. In this  case  the  magnetic  field can penetrate the superconductor, in an array  of  quantized  flux lines. Under ideal conditions these  lines,  each  carrying  one  quantum of magnetic flux, arrange  in  an  ordered  array  or  flux lattice, as predicted theoretically by Abrikosov.  This  experimental  project  is devoted  to  measurement  of  the  motions  and  arrangements o f the flux lines in less  than  ideal  conditions when the flux lines may be in a disordered state or in  a  state  of motion somewhat like a liquid. The results  of  this  research may provide information of importance to the application  of  Type  II  superconductors including high temperature  cuprate  superconductors  in  improved  electrical  and  electromechanical  technology. This research project is interdisciplinary in  nature  and involves graduate students who will be excellently trained to  enter positions in industry, government or education.  ***",
