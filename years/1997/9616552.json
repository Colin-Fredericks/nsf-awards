 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to investigate the social and ecological correlates of mating patterns and intergroup relationships in black-mantle tamarins, Saguinus nigricollis, in the lowland rainforest of eastern Ecuador.  These small New World monkeys appear to be more monogamous than other tamarin species and, therefore, offer an excellent opportunity to test the hypothesis that variability in mating patterns is related to the costs of infant-rearing and the importance of cooperative breeding in tamarins.  The study will use detailed behavioral observation of several populations to examine the ecological, reproductive, and social correlates of monogamy in black-mantled tamarins.  In addition to its unusual mating patterns, this species is also distinguished by the fact that intergroup relationships are non-aggressive and neighboring groups may form polygroup associations.  As a result, this species offers an opportunity to test the hypothesis that food competition between groups determines intergroup relationships, as well as hypotheses about the proximate causes, adaptive benefits, and social consequences of intergroup tolerance.  This study will contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary and proximate relationships between cooperative breeding and mating patterns in New World monkeys and other cooperative breeding species.",
