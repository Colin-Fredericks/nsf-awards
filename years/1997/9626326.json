 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program (CRIF) will  assist the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State University acquire an atomic force  microscope (AFM). This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the  following: (1) structure, dynamics, and physical properties of inorganic monolayers; (2) self-  assembly of monolayers for application in bio-interfaces and nano-electronic devices; (3)  electron-beam-induced chemistry in self-assembled monolayers with applications to lithography;  (4) nucleation and growth studies of poly(methylene) clusters via Au-surface catalyzed  decomposition of diazomethane; (5) surface orientation effects in ultrathin polyimide films; (6)  composite layer structures based on self-assembled noble-metal colloid monolayers; (7) T4  replication system as a model for DNA replication; (8) nanometer-scale structure in both  continuous and discontinuous Au surfaces and (9) comparisons of the tunable microwave  frequency AC scanning tunneling microscope (ACSTM) and AFM images.      The atomic force probe microscope (AFM) enables researchers to image atoms directly. The  technique uses the piezoelectric effect which involves bringing an extremely sharp metal needle  within a few angstroms of the sample surface. The distance is small enough for electrons to leak  or tunnel across the gap and generate a minute current. As the gap between the tip and the  sample increases, the current decreases. As then probe crosses the sample, moving back and  forth across its surface, it traces out a contour map of the sample's surface atoms. The AFM is  used in the control of material used to fabricate semiconductor circuits.",
