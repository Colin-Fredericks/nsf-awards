The project will investigate  biochemical control of larval settlement and recruitment of  an abundant reef-building coral.  The major goals of this  research are:  1) to determine the extent to which molecular  signals and mechanisms similar to those that control larval  settlement, metamorphosis and recruitment of Caribbean  agariciid corals regulate these centrally important  processes in Acropora nasuta, one of the most abundant and  widely distributed ecologically important reef-building  corals in the Indo-Pacific; and   2) to develop and  investigate the potential usefulness of an acroporid-  specific \"larval flypaper\", as a unique tool for field  experiments.  Their long-term goals are to understand the  mechanisms by which chemical signals in the ocean control  reproduction, larval dispersal, settlement, metamorphosis,  recruitment, gene expression, and the interactions of  organisms with other organisms and with the environment.    The project brings together the efforts of two major  laboratories that have constituted different parts of the  process.  The Americans have expertise in molecular marine  biology, larval settlement and spawning cue biochemistry and  molecular mechanisms controlling recruitment.  Japanese  expertise is in the area of biology and ecology of mass-  spawning corals and cultivation of their larvae.  Techniques  to be developed for the control of spawning and  metamorphosis should accelerate research on the ecologically  important corals world-wide, and should ppovide an alternate  means of production that can reduce the existing pressure of  commercial harvesting on natural stocks.  Through the  exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden  our base of basic knowledge and pro mote international  understanding and cooperation.  ***",
