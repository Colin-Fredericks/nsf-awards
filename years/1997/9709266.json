Sponsored by the International Union of Theoretical  and Applied Mechanics and attended by sixty researchers from fifteen  countries, the symposium will focus on the use of non-reflecting computational  boundaries to address wave-propagation problems in unbounded domains.  Such  problems frequently arise in acoustics, aeronautics, electrical  engineering, meteorology, oceanography, ultrasonics, and seismology &  earthquake engineering.  The objectives of this symposium are to improve  communication on this topic across several scientific and engineering  disciplines, illuminate the performance characteristics of recently  developed methods, and facilitate the formulation of improved methods,  especially for highly challenging problems.  In pursuit of these  objectives, participants will propose and then agree on some generic benchmark  problems with which to compare the characteristics of existing methods, and  brainstorm promising approaches for the development new methods.",
