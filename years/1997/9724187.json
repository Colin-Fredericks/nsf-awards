 "awd_abstract_narration": "A scanning probe microscope will be acquired and of competency  with the instrument will be developed. The microscope will be  shared between the various departments in the school of  Engineering at The University of Mississippi, as well as being  available to other departments outside of the School of  Engineering. The School will maintain graduate student support  for the instrument to assure continuing proficiency with the  instrument, thus minimizing the learning curve as various  departments utilize the instrument for their projects. The  School will also provide the on-going maintenance cost of the  instrument. The microscope will have a significant impact upon  the research of each department in the School of Engineering at  The University of Mississippi. The microscope will enable the  various research groups to delve deeper into existing projects  as well as opening doors to a wealth of new research areas.  Some of the current projects that would be impacted include;  improvement of fiber-reinforced composite manufacturing;  analysis of nitrogen oxide catalyst surfaces; examining the  nature of surface-engineered reinforcing-fillers; water and  C12/C14 adsorption onto mineral surfaces involved in mineral  dating and well purging; and determination of the efficacy of  new techniques in integrated chip development and  manufacturing.",
