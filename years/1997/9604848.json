 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604848  Brawley    Many  marine  species  reproduce by external  fertilization.  This mode of reproduction might be expected to result in low  levels  of  fertilization  and recruitment  because  of  the  dilution  of  eggs and sperm by the turbulent  sea.   Recent  work,  however, demonstrates that fucoid algae (i.e.,  brown  seaweed's that are important components of rocky, intertidal  zones and estuaries) sense water motion and release eggs and  sperm only when the sea is calm.  Nearly 100% of their  eggs  are fertilized.  The proposed experiments will determine how  these algae sense water motion and whether similar responses  are  found  in  several  other species  that  are  harvested  commercially or are important nuisance species.  Studies  of  the  reproductive  tissues  with  electron  microscopic  and  physiological  techniques will establish the  basis  of  the  mechanical forces that expel eggs and sperm from adults  and  how  these are blocked by high water motion.  Field  studies  of   natural  communities  in  New  England  estuaries  will  complement the laboratory work.  These studies will  advance  understanding  of  the  mechanisms  by  which  marine  algae  respond  to environmental variables that affect reproductive  success.   This  information  should  be  useful  to   basic  scientists,  marine  engineers, coastal zone  managers,  and  mariculturists.",
