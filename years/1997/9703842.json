The first class of  such problems are the Navier-Stokes equations used to model coating flow.  The second topic will be Stefan type problems where the free boundary has  very large oscillations and this involve homogenization and boundary  layers; such models arise, for example, in chemical vapor deposition.  Next  topic will be the propagation of a crack in elastic material, where the free  boundary moves, with time, into the region.  Other areas of research will  involve nonlinear systems of elliptic variational inequalities and motion  of particles in fluid.            The problems to be studied arise in mathematical modeling of  industrial processes and design.  They include the coating of photographic  film, the design of magnetic heads for improved sound transmission,  processing of semiconductors, rheological properties of immersions, and the  analysis of cracks in metals.  Based on our past experience, it is  anticipated that the analytic methods which will be developed will enable  one to develop very efficient numerical schemes for computing quantities of  interest for these models, so that improved industrial products can be  designed in shorter time.",
