 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zheng  9703711    Yuxi Zheng proposes to study some nonlinear partial differential equations  from fluid dynamics (Euler equations), plasma physics (Vlasov-Poisson system),   and liquid crystal physics. These equations are the laws of motion of their   respective physics. The turbulent nature and/or defects in the materials   show up in the form of singularities and instabilities in the solutions of   the equations. Yuxi Zheng plans to use advanced analytical tools to study   the structures of the singular solutions. In the case of compressible Euler  equations in two space dimensions, for example, Yuxi Zheng plans to isolate  typical singularities (hurricanes, tornadoes, shocks, etc.) and investigate  their individual structures. The result of the investigation will be a clear   understanding of the worst possible solutions, and thereby quantify our   knowledge of the physics and offer guidance in high-performance numerical   computations of general solutions.    Yuxi Zheng proposes to study some applied mathematical problems in the   fields of fluid dynamics (which includes motion of the air and water),   plasma physics (which includes motion of the material that makes up the Sun,  and also more than 90% of the universe), and liquid crystal physics in   material science.  Scientists and engineers have used mathematical equations,   called partial differential equations, to model the motions. The turbulent   nature and/or defects in the materials show up in the form of singularities   and instabilities in the solutions of the equations. It is these singularities   and instabilities that often spoil accurate numerical computations of the   solutions. Yuxi Zheng plans to use the state of the art analytical tools to   study the structures of the singular solutions.  In the case of a compressible   gas such as air, for example, Yuxi Zheng plans to isolate typical   singularities (hurricanes, tornadoes, shocks, etc.) and investigate their   individual structures. The result of the investigation will  be a clear   understanding of the worst possible solutions, and thereby quantify our   knowledge of the physics and offer guidance in high-performance numerical   computations of general solutions.",
