 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technological advances in computer architecture  and communication technology, coupled with  economic factors, have led to the development of  a variety of parallel computing environments  with high message latencies. Examples include  mesh- and hierarchical-ring-based  multiprocessors, and networks of workstations.  Many  algorithmic techniques that ensured efficient  interprocessor communication (at least with high  probability) in the tightly coupled, small-  diameter parallel machines of the past no longer  guarantee efficiency in the new environments.  This project is dedicated to developing and  analyzing communication-scheduling algorithms  that ensure: (A) efficient parallel computation  in networks of workstations; (B) efficient  execution of dynamically evolving computations  in \"ring-like\" multiprocessors (including  chordal rings, express rings and hierarchical  ring networks); efficient orchestration of  variable-length communications  on ring-like networks.  Both analytical and  experimental methods will be invoked to craft  and evaluate algorithms that achieve these  goals. This project has complementary goals: (1)  to gain theoretical understanding of factors  that enhance --- and detract from --- efficiency  of interprocessor communication in high-latency  parallel environments, and (2) to develop  algorithmic techniques that translate such  understanding into provably efficient  communication strategies.",
