 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604585  Berkowitz  The objective is to study the influence of cholesterol on the dynamic properties of the lipid bilayer membranes.  Bilayer water permeability will be characterized in the absence and presence of cholesterol as will membrane order (order parameter, S).  These studies will resolve issues related to the hydrophobicity of the bilayer as a function of distance normal to the bilayer surface and will provide physical insights into the mechanism of solvent transport across bilayer membranes.  These computations will be carried out without truncation of electrostatic contributions to membrane structure and dynamics in a fully hydrated system.  It will be possible to carry out lengthy simulations through use of reversible multiple time step algorithms and the smooth particle mesh Ewald algorithm, which was developed by Dr. Berkowitz.  In addition to the cholesterol study, the effect of phospholipid hydrocarbon chain fluorination will be examined by simulation since fluorination also affects solvent transit across the bilayer.    Phospholipid membranes play a very important role in the functioning of biosystems.  Due to tremendous advances in computational methodology and computational facilities it is now possible to probe the properties of biomembranes using computer simulation techniques.  Molecular dynamics computer simulations technique will be used to study how the properties of biomembranes change when cholesterol is added to the membrane.  It is known that the interaction of some of the membranes with other biomolecules such as proteins is often determined by the electrical fields present in the system.  The objective is to study how these fields change when some of the hydrogen in membrane molecules are replaced by fluorine molecules.  Only those systems will be studied for which reliable experimental data are available and for which simulations will provide information complementary to experimental work.",
