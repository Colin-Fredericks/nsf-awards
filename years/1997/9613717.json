 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST 96-13717. California Institute of Technology. PI: N. Z.   Scoville    Astronomical Research with the Owens Valley Millimeter Array    This award supports research, technological development and   student education at the California Institute of Technology's   Owens Valley millimeter array. The array is made up of 6 precision   10.4m-diameter antennas, which currently can be positioned out to   maximum spacings of 220m north-south and 200m east-west. All the   telescopes are equipped with dual-channel (2.6 and 1.3mm)   cryogenic SiS receivers. At the shorter wavelength, the highest   angular resolution attainable by the array is 0.7 arcseconds.   Approximately 50% of the array's observing time is presently   devoted to investigations by non-Caltech astronomers.    During the tenure of the past three year grant, the Owens Valley   array has obtained aperture synthesis images of molecular emission   in domains ranging from comets to the envelopes of evolved stars,   to star-forming regions in the Galaxy, as well as the spiral arms   and active nuclei of other galaxies. The array has also been used   for extensive studies of active galactic nuclei, starburst and   ultraluminous galaxies at high redshifts.  During the last grant   period, the observatory also made a number of technical advances,   including the development of the ability to observe simultaneously   at 1 and 3mm, doubling the continuum bandwidth to 2 GHz, and   installing automated tuning and full LO coverage. An active system   to compensate for atmospheric phase fluctuations was also designed   and installation begun.  In the next three year grant period the   observatory's scientific programs will continue to include studies   of high redshift extragalactic systems, protostars and star-  forming regions and their associated protoplanetary nebulae, the   structure of the Milky Way Galaxy, collimated outflows from young   stars, interstellar chemistry and a variety of solar system   objects.",
