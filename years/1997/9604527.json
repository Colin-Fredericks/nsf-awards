 "awd_abstract_narration": "Johnson  9604527    This project is concerned with synthesis of inositol in plants.  While much is known about inositol phosphate signaling in animals, the corresponding issues in plants have not been well studied.  The overall long-term goal of the work is to understand inositol's role in the biology of subcellular organelles.  The PI has shown, in previous studies, that the key biosynthetic enzyme, myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase, has temporally and spatially controlled isoforms which is novel and unexpected.  This particular project will involve a detailed study of the sites of inositol and phosphoinositol synthesis.  A combination of immunocytochemical analyses, in situ hybridization studies, and enzyme activity measurements will be performed using Phaseolus vulgaris as a model.  This work will help in developing an understanding of cell signaling in plants, as well as regulation of an important metabolic pathway.     This project is concerned with synthesis of inositol in plants.  While much is known about inositol phosphate signaling in cells of animals, the corresponding issues in plants have not been well studied.  This particular project will involve a detailed study of the sites of inositol and phosphoinositol synthesis in bean plants.  The results will provide important information about processes which control plant growth, development, and differentiation.",
