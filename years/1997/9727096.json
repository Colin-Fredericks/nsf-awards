The  proposed approach builds upon a recently confirmed  pretreatment method in which cellulosic materials are  pressure cooked in water to make them susceptible to enzyme  hydrolysis.  The proposed research will carry out  exploratory research to screen, identify, and characterize  biodegradable enzyme mimetic(s) for formation of glucose  from cellulosic materials pretreated by aqueous pressure  cooking.    The research is directed toward identifying organic acid  catalysts, particularly fatty or long chain acids which will  adsorb on cellulose and hydrolyze the -glycosidic bonds to  give glucose.  The general goal of the research is to con  tribute to the reduction in cost of converting a renewable  material, cellulose, into fermentable sugars.    Specific objectives are:    1.   Rapid screening of a range of organic and fatty acids    for their combined potential to adsorb onto cellulose,    hydrolyze glycosidic bonds and pretreated cellulose, and    give only minimal degradation of glucose  2.   Selection of one or two of the organic acids,    determination of their rate constants for cellulose    hydrolysis as a function of acid (catalyst)concentrations    and temperatures ranging from80 to 180C  3.   Development of a hydrolysis model based on a    mechanistic analysis of adsorption and rate phenomena for    the purpose of bioreactor design, and calculating the cost    of the catalyst.    Preliminary experiments using pressure cooker pretreatment  of cellulose have shown the potential of succinic acid as a  hydrolysis catalyst.  Succinic acid has the added property  of being soluble in boiling water while precipitating from  solution at room temperature.  ***",
