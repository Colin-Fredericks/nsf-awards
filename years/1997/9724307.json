The instrument will  support numerous research projects that fall into four general  categories: advanced materials and processing, biotechnology of  surfaces, environmental research on surfaces and development of  new methodologies related to all three of the above areas.  The  instrument will be housed in a centralized facility where it will  be used by over 25 faculty researchers, 8 other industrial and  university scientists, and about 60 graduate students and  postdoctoral associates.  The instrument will also be used in the  education and research training of students, as an integral part  of a graduate course in surface chemistry and of an undergraduate  course on instrumental analysis.  %%%  The instrument will significantly enhance the University's  research capabilities in the area of surface science.  It will  have a large impact on research and education due to the large  number of investigators and projects involved.  Many existing  industrial collaborations will also benefit from use of the  instrument.  ***",
