 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unreliable failure detection has been gaining acceptance as  a fundamental paradigm for fault-tolerant distributed  computing. This paradigm was originally introduced to  circumvent the impossibility of achieving consensus in  asynchronous systems with crash failures.  The proposed  research aims to extend the applicability of failure  detection in multiple ways: (1) It will seek solutions that  tolerate both process crashes and link failures, and in  particular, solutions that are resilient to network  partitioning. (2) It will consider practical problems  besides consensus, e.g., atomic commitment and various forms  of group membership. (3) It will investigate the extension  of failure detection to other models, such as the timed  asynchronous model, in order to solve problems whose  specifications involve real-time. (4) It will explore the  use of randomization techniques to enhance the power of  failure detection. This research intends to widen the scope  of failure detection and to firmly establish it as a core  component of fault-tolerant distributed systems.",
