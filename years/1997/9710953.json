 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT: CMS-9710953, Ronald Harichandran, Michigan State  U.    Observations from closely-spaced seismograph arrays since  the late 1970's have shown that earthquake ground  accelerograms measured at different locations within the  dimensions of typical large engineered structures are  significantly different. This has resulted in considerable  attention being given to the modeling of spatially varying  earthquake ground motions, and on determining its effect on  the seismic response of large structures such as bridges,  pipelines, and dams. Studies on various structural systems  have shown that including the effect of spatially varying  earthquake ground motions often increases critical  responses, and hence large structures designed without  consideration for this phenomenon may be unsafe.    A key component in the characterization of spatially varying  earthquake ground motions is the coherency function, which  describes the incoherence between accelerations recorded at  different spatial locations. Different functional forms have  been proposed by different investigators for coherency  functions, but studies on how these different forms affect  the computed responses have been few. Also, since the low-  frequency variation of coherency is significantly different  among some of the commonly used models, it is critical to  resolve contradictions and provide guidance to engineers.    The objective of this research program is to use the high-  resolution maximum entropy spectral estimation method and  long-duration accelerogram records to resolve these  contradictions, using records from the Valley of Mexico, the  SMART-1 array in Taiwan, the Chiba array in Japan, and the  Northridge earthquake in the U. S.    This project is a cooperative research program with the  Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), involving a  joint collaboration between a U. S. engineer, a Mexican  engineer, and a Mexican seismologist.",
