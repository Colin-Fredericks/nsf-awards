 "awd_abstract_narration": "This MRI proposal is to build a network of cosmic ray detectors (neutron monitors) at high latitudes. The detectors are placed at strategic Polar locations to obtain information about the cosmic rays' angle of arrival. With such an array, the entire Earth acts as a directional cosmic ray detector. The fact that the Earth's magnetic field deflects the particles is used to determine the direction of arrival of energetic cosmic rays. Compared with cosmic ray detectors flown in space, this new \"Spaceship Earth\" will enjoy counting statistics far exceeding current spacecraft capabilities.   The Spaceship Earth network is an international project, with participation from US, Russia and Australia. The network consists of 9 high-latitude stations, roughly equidistant in longitude (1 in Antarctica owned and operated by the Australians, 4 in Russia, and 4 in Northern Canada which are covered by this proposal). The new network will be used for research, graduate education, and postdoctoral training. The data will be analyzed to understand the acceleration and transport of solar energetic particles, to probe the structure of magnetic turbulence in the solar wind, and to elucidate the mechanism of transient cosmic ray variations. The network has a high societal impact because the PI's will examine the role of cosmic rays in the context of space weather, and evaluate the network role to forecast space weather. An advance warning of as much as 10 hours of potentially damaging magnetic storms might be possible. (Presently, only one hour advance warning is possible).",
