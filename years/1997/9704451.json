 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9704451  The  increasing  importance of an annual meeting  of  researchers  funded by the Interactive Systems Program of the National Science  Foundation  is  underscored  by  a  national  agenda  that  views  improved   interfaces   as  vital  to  our   Nation's    economic  competitiveness, that proposes  universal access to  the  NII  by  every  citizen,  and  that  hopes to  place  computers  in  every  classroom  with network access.  Attendees of the First  Grantees  Workshop   (in   November  1995)  reported   uniformly   positive  experiences.   Researchers were delighted to  meet  and  interact  with  colleagues working in related fields, and to  learn  first-  hand  about  the  research and challenges in each others'  areas.  The  proposed venue for the Second Grantee Workshop is in  Oregon  from August 16th through August 18th, dates which have been found  to  be  in  minimal conflict with other meetings and which  allow  for  economical  pricing of rooms.  The proposed workshop  agenda  will  be  developed by a steering committee, with  feedback  from  participants of the last Grantee's Workshop.  The paramount goals  will  be  to  foster fruitful exchange of ideas and to  stimulate  interaction among colleagues.  The workshop will  also produce an  HTML  document, modeled on the previous effort, which  summarizes  the  different  projects  supported by  the  Interactive  Systems  Program.***",
