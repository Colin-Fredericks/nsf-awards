 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604670  PADEN    The pituitary is often called the master gland of the body  because hormones that it releases control the function of  other glands.  One of these hormones is adrenocorticotrophic  hormone (ACTH), which stimulates production of cortisol and  other steroid hormones by the adrenal gland.  ACTH release  is in turn controlled by the brain, which stimulates the  pituitary to release ACTH in times of stress or injury.  Thus understanding the mechanisms by which the brain  controls ACTH release is essential for understanding how  stress affects the body.  It has been known for many years  that the brain stimulates ACTH release in part by releasing  hormones itself, but it has been unclear if other control  mechanisms also exist.  Dr. Paden and others have recently  discovered that nerve fibers of unknown origin enter the  pituitary gland and appear to contact the cells that make  ACTH (called corticotrophs).  His current studies will  determine where these nerves come from and what type of  chemical signals they may employ to affect the activity of  corticotrophs.  Other experiments will investigate whether  or not these nerves respond to stress.  Results from these  studies may demonstrate the existence of an additional  pathway by which the brain can control ACTH release,  providing new insights into the mechanisms of the stress  response.",
