 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Nancy I. Totah, of the Department of Chemistry at the   University of Iowa, is developing new methods for the synthesis of   complex natural products with the support of the Organic Synthesis   Program.  Selective epoxidation of an enamide functionality in   ten-membered macrocycles and subsequent transannular addition is explored   as an approach to the synthesis of 6-6 fused ring amides with control of   up to four stereogenic centers.  This methodology will be applied to the   enantioselective synthesis of phenanthridone alkaloids such as   pancratistatin.  Exploitation of the conformational preferences of a   tricyclic precursor will provide access to C-ring modified phenanthridone   alkaloids.  The phenanthridone alkaloids are an important class of natural products,   displaying a variety of biological activities that include anticancer,   antiviral, growth regulatory, and insect antifeedant activities.  With   the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Nancy I. Totah,   of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa, is developing   new approaches for the synthesis of this class of compounds.  These   approaches, based on the formation of molecules containing two rings from   precursors containing only one larger ring, offer promise for the   preparation of compounds available in only small quantities from natural   sources as well as modified compounds, not known to occur naturally,   which may have potential medicinal and agricultural applications",
