 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723420  Ball  Winter is energetically-demanding; energy requirements for thermoregulation and other winter-coping adaptations typically increase when food is scarce. Physiological and behavioral adaptations, including termination of breeding and growth, have evolved among nontropical animals to cope with winter energy shortages.  Presumably, selection for the mechanisms that permit physiological and behavioral anticipation of seasonal ambient changes have led to current seasonal breeding patterns in many populations. Energetically-challenging winter conditions can directly induce death via hypothermia, starvation, or shock; surviving these demanding conditions likely evokes significant stress responses.  Winter conditions can also indirectly affect health; the stress of coping with energetically-demanding conditions may increase adrenocortical steroid concentrations and compromise immune function. Individuals would enjoy a survival advantage if seasonally- recurring stressors could be anticipated and countered by shunting energy reserves to bolster immune function.  The proposed laboratory studies of seasonal changes in mammalian immune function will test the hypothesis that immune function is enhanced in short days to counter the immunosuppressive effects of winter.  Melatonin secretion patterns change seasonally and may affect the shunting of energy into different physiological processes. If the hypothesis that short days ameliorate the energetic demands of immune function is true, then several testable predictions  emerge.  In contrast to previous studies of the energetic costs of immune function, the proposed studies will examine direct measures of immune and endocrine function.  Finally, the direct energetic costs of immune responses will be assayed in mice housed under various environmental conditions.  Taken together, the results of the proposed studies will provide insight into the interaction among neural, endocrine, and immune functions.",
