 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the fundamental spectroscopic methods used by scientists for determining chemical structure.  It is imperative that undergraduate students learn how to acquire and interpret NMR spectra.  Students at the University have previously studied spectral interpretation using NMR data bases or from spectra obtained by technicians.  They acquire no direct experience in operating the spectrometer.  Recent developments in rapid scanning NMR spectrometers permit a spectrum to be acquired in 10 seconds.  Thus it is possible to provide hands-on experience for laboratories of 24 students in undergraduate course at Hartford.   Students are also gaining experience in collaborative learning and a team approach to research problems.    NMR spectroscopy is introduced along with other instruments in the first-year chemistry laboratory, in keeping with the trend in chemical education to introduce students to instrumentation early in their college education.  The main focus of the NMR is in organic chemistry and subsequent laboratory courses.  The instrument is used to support group projects that culminate with presentation of results by students.  Student in more advanced courses have acquired the skill and confidence to use the NMR in more advanced applications including research projects.  *",
