 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oh  9722699    This award supports a two-year collaborative research  project between Dr. Hae-Soo Oh of the University of North  Carolina at Charlotte and Dr. Jae Heon Yun of Chungbuk  National University in Korea on a \"New Method To Obtain  Highly Accurate Three Dimensional Analysis of Crack  Propagation and Stress on Composite Materials.\"  The goal of  the project is to develop a new method for numerical  simulation of crack propagation which deals with the three-  dimensional singularities of vertex, edge and edge-vertex.    Fracture-related damage, metal fatigue and material failure  are critically important issues in the context of our  national civil infrastructure.  Effective inspection and  preventive maintenance programs (for example, of the  airworthiness of airplanes or the integrity of nuclear power  plants) require an accurate fracture analysis.  However,  because of the complicated geometry and nonlinearities that  characterize fracture mechanics, the use of analytical  techniques is very limited.   This project will combine the  experience of the U.S. and Korean laboratories to work on a  practical and accurate numerical simulation for three  dimensional fracture analysis.  ***",
