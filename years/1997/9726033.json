 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid expansion of wireless communication services during the last decade  is expected to continue at an even faster pace in the future.  This growth  creates a demand for novel modulation, coding, and detection methods  suitable for the rapidly varying multipath fading channels encountered in  mobile radio.  We propose to investigate a new approach to the estimation  and prediction of the fading channel which does not rely on statistical  characterization.  In this method, the physical nature of the flat fading  signal is exploited to yield a deterministic model that predicts the  channel for an entire block of data.  Specifically, the mobile radio signal  is decomposed into several scattered components distinguished by their  Doppler shifts;  the slowly varying parameters associated with these  components are determined and tracked, and the composite fading signal is  predicted.  This approach may potentially result in the ability to  anticipate and compensate for the \"deep fades that severely limit the  performance of wireless communication systems and will aid in the  development of low-power mobile radio systems.",
