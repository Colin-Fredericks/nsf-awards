Bone tissue is a living material which responds  and adapts to its  mechanical environment.  This research will examine the  influence of  mechanical loading on trabecular bone adaptation.  Trabecular bone is the anisotropic low density bone.  An  animal model of trabecular bone adaptation has been  developed at The Hospital for Special Surgery, an affiliate  of Cornell University Medical Center.  Compressive forces  will be applied to the distal femur of adult rabbits and the  resulting changes in trabecular architecture will be  determined.  The objective of this study is to model and  simulate these adaptation experiments.  Finite element  models of the experiments will be created from three-  dimensional micro-computed tomography images of the  retrieved specimens.  From these models, the local loading  conditions will be determined and correlated with trabecular  bone adaptation.  Then the models will be used to simulate  the trabecular functional adaptation to the applied loading.  The adaptation models are the first application of an  adaptation framework developed at the Katholieke  Universiteit, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; the model  application will be in collaboration with an investigator in  Nijmegen.  The goal is to acquire an understanding of bone  functional adaptation important in the etiology of many  skeletal disorders, including osteoporosis and  osteoarthritis.  ***",
