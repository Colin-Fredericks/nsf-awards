 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lineberger has submitted a renewal proposal to investigate the properties   of negative ions and their clusters in the gas phase using negative ion   photoelectron spectroscopy and ultrafast pump-probe excitation of ionic   complexes.  With these techniques both the structural information and the   reaction dynamics will be investigated for a broad class of systems which   are either chemical transients, reactive intermediates, or transition   state species.  Among the molecules to be studied are organic radicals   and biradicals, metals and metal clusters, and transition states for both   unimolecular and bimolecular processes.  Electron affinities,   singlet-triplet splittings, vibrational frequencies, and geometrical   information will be obtained.  Ortho, meta, and para forms of benzyne   (C6H4) will be synthesized using stereochemical control.  Unimolecular   processes investigated by ultrafast methods include the 1,2 hydrogen   shift in vinylidene to form acetylene.  The dynamics of ions in a solvent   cage will also be extended by following the appearance of products of   cage disintegration as well as solvent reorganization following electron   transfer in partially solvated ions.  One goal of these studies is to   increase the quantitative understanding of the processes driving the   simplest chemical transformations.  By studying the chemical   transformations of molecules which are both isolated as well as   surrounded by solvent species, Lineberger will be able to demonstrate the   effect that different solvents have on reactivity as well as on the rates   at which these reactions proceed.",
