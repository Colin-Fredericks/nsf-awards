 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sea cucumbers and other echinoderms have evolved the unique capacity to modulate on a physiological time scale the mechanical properties of their connective tissues.  This mechanical modulation is accomplished by neurally regulated secretions of cells located within the tissues.  The secreted molecules lead to either an increase or a decrease in the mechanical interactions between collagen fibrils.  The PI has isolated and characterized native collagen fibrils from sea cucumbers, and have identified two macromolecules from the same source that cause the fibrils to aggregate (\"stiparin\") and that inhibit aggregation (\"stiparin inhibitor\").  In addition, the PI has isolated two additional macromolecules that cause the tissue to become stiff (\"stiffener\") or plastic (\"plasticizer\").  The PI's hypotheses are that fibril-aggregation in vitro is the test-tube equivalent of tissue stiffening in vivo; that stiffener and plasticizer cause their effects through their interactions with stiparin and stiparin inhibitor; and that plasticizer and stiffener are localized in different secretory cells within the tissue.  The experimental approach uses biochemical, physiological and structural analyses.  The ultimate goal is to recreate in the test tube, using characterized macromolecules, the same modulations of fibril interactions that occur in the tissues.",
