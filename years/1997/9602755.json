 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will be used to support the restoration of research laboratories, shared facilities, and basic infrastructure for four basic science departments at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  The University has undertaken a multi-phased initiative for modernizing facilities dedicated to the basic sciences.  This project will support  Phase II renovations within three buildings of a five building complex:  the Woods Basic Science building constructed in 1961, the Physiology building constructed in 1929, and the Biophysics building constructed in 1959.  The three buildings share many deficiencies such as outdated infrastructure, particularly air handling, electrical and plumbing systems,  and substandard and dilapidated laboratory  and shared facilities.  Existing conditions of research space has affected research programs including, but not limited to:  computational biology, cell signaling, control of cell division, regulation of metabolism, bio-energetics of mitochondrial enzymes, studies of membrane transporters, pumps and channels, developmental neurobiology, molecular mechanisms of visions, and molecular biophysics of protein structure.  Upon completion, 19 laboratories and eight shared facilities will be modernized,  complying with  health and safety codes.  Improved facilities will  allow the Departments to initiate new interdisciplinary programs, retain and recruit the highest quality faculty and students, and sustain the highest quality of research into the next decade.",
