 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project investigates fundamental issues in the  design, analysis, and real-time implementation of nonlinear  control laws for underactuated mechanical systems. This  class of systems is quite broad and encompasses balancing,  brachiating, and walking robots, flexible structures of all  kinds including flexible link robots, and flexible joint  robots, airplanes and helicopters, underwater and  space  vehicles, electric motors, redundant robots, as well as  mechanical system models that include actuator dynamics, and  many of the classical control problems like the ball and  beam and cart-pole systems. Global and semi-global stability  and tracking results for classes of underactuated mechanical  systems are investigated in this project. The tools used are  Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods of nonlinear dynamics,  geometric nonlinear control theory, hybrid control, and  saturation. The results also apply to a larger class of  systems than have heretofore been investigated using these  techniques. The unifying theme of this research is to  exploit the underlying structure of the nonlinear dynamics  to generate `natural closed loop motions` that make  efficient use of passivity and energy. This work complements  and extends existing energy and passivity methods and more  recent backstepping methods, all of which attempt to exploit  more fully the inherent nonlinearities of the system, by  `shaping` rather than by `canceling`  all of the  nonlinearities in the system. On the experimental side, a  number of testbed systems are used to test analytical  research results. The laboratory includes several `gymnastic  robots,` (Acrobots, Pendubots), a three degree-of-freedom  air hockey playing robot, two direct drive robots, and a  flexible joint robot. The experimental component of the  research project is of vital importance both to the present  project and to the ultimate goal of creating dextrous  machines.",
