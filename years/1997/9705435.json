 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  The  objective  of  this  workshop is to bring  together  leading  scientists,  engineers, practitioners, and entrepreneurs  in  the  robotics and healthcare communities, display state-of-the-art  of  healthcare  robotics,  and identify fundamental  issues  and  key  technologies  which  require long term  research  endeavors.  The  rapid  increase  of  the aged population and  soaring  healthcare  costs  are crucial problems faced by today's society. Traditional  labor-intensive services and costly treatments will no longer  be  affordable,  yet demands for quality care continue  to  increase.  New  healthcare  technologies  are  emerging  from  robotics  and  intelligent systems which would make significant changes  in  the  current  practice  of  healthcare  services.  Minimally  invasive  surgery,  for  example, allows patients to be quickly  discharged  from  the  hospital.  Remote health monitoring  and  tele-nursing  systems  allow  patients to stay at home,  thus  avoiding  costly  hospital  stays.  Robotic vehicles and manipulation  technologies  allow   bedridden   patients   and   elderly   people   to   live  independently.  Miniaturized  sensors  and  actuators,   wireless  communication,  advanced  human-machine  interface,   and   their  integration technologies are pointing in the future direction  of  healthcare   technology.  Furthermore,  strategic   planning   of  research,  development, and deployment as well as the social  and  economic impact of the new technologies will be discussed at  the  workshop. The workshop will be held on March 26 and 27,  1997  in  the  Boston  area.   Participants will be  invited  from  various  sectors of the healthcare community, e.g., hospitals, home health  agencies,  nursing homes, insurance companies,  as  well  as  the  vendors  and  researchers  in robotics,  biomedical  engineering,  communication,  and software.  The result will be  published  and  disseminated as workshop proceedings as well as by web  page  and  virtual librari es.***",
