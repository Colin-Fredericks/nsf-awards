 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an 18-month planning project to continue the work that has begun on the ND-CoMSTeP project.  The goals of the planning project are to improve the original ND-CoMSTep project through increased involvement of scientists and mathematicians in preservice teacher preparation.  A two-day summer conference will be held for North Dakota scientists and mathematicians.  Those wishing to take a more active roll in teacher preparation will be given time at the conference to develop plans for their own institution. Two other trial initiatives will be a part of this planning grant. The first of these is the establishment of three teams, each consisting of a preservice mathematics teacher and a university mathematician.  They will work together to teach a university calculus class at a local high school. The second initiative involves undergraduate science majors working for approximately ten hours per week as teachers' assistants to master teachers at a local junior, or senior, high school. Each science major will meet with his/her academic science advisor, and science educator, once every two weeks.  These meetings will be an opportunity to talk about teaching, its rewards, its challenges, and the possibility of preparing for dual careers in science and science teaching.",
