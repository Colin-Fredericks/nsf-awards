 "awd_abstract_narration": "The drive toward public and universal access to the National Information Infrastructure (NII) has been a significant focus of national attention, bringing together policy-makers and activists working in fields such as education, community service, and disability rights. As computer networking becomes increasingly important, it is crucial to examine whether and how diverse social groups use this new technology. Computer networking technologies should be useful for a broad spectrum of society, rather than creating yet another social division on economic, educational, and generational lines. This project addresses this concern through research on SeniorNet, a community of computer-using seniors, proposing an in-depth case study of how a technologically disenfranchised group has been able to make computers and computer networking meaningful in daily life. The premise of this research is that access needs to be understood not only in relation to technical and economic factors, but also in relation to the social and historical context of computer use. The project focuses, in particular, on a sense of online community as a key factor in motivating and supporting access to new information technology. The analytic framework for this study is based on broadening the definition of access to include:1) initial entry, 2) ongoing participation in computer-networked activity, and 3) change and development of the community over time. Rather than focusing on just economic or technical preconditions for use of networking technologies, this study looks also at how people learn how to use it, why they find it compelling, and how it is integrated into their daily lives. This project is a collaboration between computer and social scientists at the Institute for Research on Learning (IRL) and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), involving ethnographic research and participation in a process of technological innovation with SeniorNet. SeniorNet is a nonprofit organization, founded in 1986, with approximately 20,000 current members, of whom approximately 4,000 communicate over America Online (AOL), and with a new but growing population on the World Wide Web (WWW). SeniorNet activities include online bulletin boards and chat rooms, face-to-face gatherings at both a national and local level, as well as classes in computer use at over 80 learning centers across the county. SeniorNet provides a rare case of a successful online community of a group that is generally considered technologically disenfranchised. Further, its relatively long history provides a rich case for looking at how a group is established and develops over time, in relation to changing technical standards. The research will involve ethnographic study of the existing practices of community organization, with particular attention to ways of gaining (or failure to gain) access to the community, and various forms of membership and participation. The project will address issues of access and technological innovation for technologically disenfranchised groups by providing a case study of a successful network community of seniors, informed by an interdisciplinary research perspective. The project will produce an ethnography of SeniorNet, focused around issues of access, membership, participation, and community development, and consideration of its relationship to policy debate around access to NII.",
