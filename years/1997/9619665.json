The project intends to recruit students who: (1) are under-represented in the field (minorities and women), (2) are undergraduates at other institutions, and (3) may not have opportunities to conduct research at their undergraduate institutions.  Student participants will be between their junior and senior years with the purpose of motivating the students to pursue graduate education.  The program will include: (1) a research project that is a self-contained part of a larger project, (2) mentoring by a project faculty and graduate student, (3) regular project meeting, (4) a weekly seminar series covering many aspects of environmental engineering and graduate student life, (5) weekly educational tours to provide first-hand contact with environmental problems and solutions, (6) a community project to foster teamwork and social awareness, (7) a final report written by the undergraduate researcher, and (8) a concluding symposium to provide all participants and the public to learn from the student research presentations.  Research will be in all areas of environmental engineering; atmospheric systems and air pollution control, surface water quality and water resources, environmental systems modeling, pollution prevention, environmental chemistry, wastewater, solid waste and hazardous wastes, and groundwater and subsurface remediation.  Faculty and students will be paired according to the interests of student and faculty, needs of the faculty, and abilities of the student.  ***",
