Boston University     CISE Research Instrumentation: A Study of an Event Based and Feature Based Approach to Speech Recognition     The aims of this study are to develop a speech recognition system based on phonetic features and to use the development of this system as a tool for understanding variability.  Relative to cepstral parameters, broad-class recognition results show that a signal representation based on phonetic features is better able to target the linguistic information and it does so in a more speaker-independent manner.  Furthermore, such a signal representation allows for a direct study of phonological processes.  The proposed equipment will help extend this work. First, the drastic cut in computation time afforded by the Ultra 2- will  speed up the development and optimization of acoustic parameters using the Fisher criterion and an automatic classifier, - make feasible experimentation with a full object-oriented lexicon,- allow experimentation with computationally expensive algorithms for the extraction of acoustic events and -allow faster computation of recognition results.  Second, the extra disks will allow investigation of larger data sets and the storage of computed parameters on line.  Third, the workstations will aid analysis by allowing users to listen to utterances and perform processing locally.  Finally, the proposed PC and synthesizer will allow a study of variability through acoustic modeling and analysis-by-synthesis.",
