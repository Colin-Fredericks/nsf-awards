 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project consists of two major parts:  parallelizable fast algorithms for large dense eigenproblems  and inexact/inner-outer iteration methods for large sparse  eigenproblems.    Techniques of rational transformation and matrix-squaring  for designing parallelizable fast algorithms for large dense  eigenproblems have been developed which only use matrix-  matrix multiplications and  QR decompositions as building  blocks. Now a general theory is to be established to  encompass the class of algorithms  developed and to also  provide guidance to the derivation of  new algorithms.  Error analysis, robust deflation techniques and stopping  criteria which are extremely important for the practical  implementation of the algorithms will be fully investigated.  This part of the research will result in deeper  understanding of the theory of a new class of generalized  eigensolvers and deliver a class of algorithms that are  truly of high parallel efficiency and robustness.    Efficient algorithms for eigenproblems of partial  differential equations is the major topic of the second part  of this research. Inner-outer iteration type of algorithms  will be developed for the subspace iteration and Lanczos  algorithms and the insight obtained will be applied to the  PDE case. It is demonstrated that different iterative  processes behave quite differently with respect to the  distribution of the accuracy of each inner iteration, and  each iterative process needs a careful analysis in order to  find the distribution strategy that will give the minimum  number of total inner iteration steps. Two algorithms, the  variable-accuracy inner-outer iteration method and the  successive inner-outer iteration method will be further  analyzed and their convergence behavior explained. A PDE  eigenproblem will be solved by putting an iterative process  such as the Lanczos method in a Hilbert space setting. At  each Lanczos  iteration step, the matrix-vector  multiplication corresponds to solving a boundary value   problem for the differential operator, and different  discretizations will be used to enhance efficiency.  The  research will result in deeper understanding and provide  sound theoretical results of various iterative processes for  solving large sparse eigenproblems in the setting of inexact  matrix-vector multiplication. It will also give more  efficient algorithms for solving  large sparse eigenproblems  that arise in many science and engineering areas.",
