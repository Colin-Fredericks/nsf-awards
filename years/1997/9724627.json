 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Electromagnetics Analysis System for NMR  A.  Project Summary Our overall goal is to predict and minimize the  radio  frequency  (RF)  electromagnetic (EM) losses  affecting  the  success  and  safety of human NMR at very high magnetic field strengths. To pursue  this  goal  we  require  the  means  to numerically  model  the  RF  coil-tissue  interface, and then to analyze the realization of the coil-tissue model on  the  bench, prior to actual human application. The means for the  modeling  and   measurement  of  EM  losses  will  be  provided  by   the   proposed  \"Electromagnetics Analysis System for NMR\". The rationale for  this  study  lies  in the need to know and control RF dependent transmit power,  tissue  heating,  field penetration, and signal-to-noise for high field (1.5-7.0T)  human and animal studies.  The need: A unique \"Electromagnetics (EM) Analysis System\" is requested to  support on-going high field NMR research and research training activities,  directly  and collaboratively at three institutions with leading  programs  in  high  resolution  metabolic, anatomic,  and  functional  imaging.  The  institutions:  Massachusetts General Hospital /Harvard U., the  University  of  Minnesota,  and  the  University of Alabama at  Birmingham  (UAB)  are  currently conducting basic life science research on humans and animals  in  vivo  at the highest magnetic field strengths available. Increased signal-  to-noise  (SNR) and its dependent spatial resolution, temporal  resolution  and  contrast, are chief reasons for performing NMR investigations at high  field   strengths.   Also   important,   the   spectral   resolution   and  susceptibility  contrast  also  improve  with  field  strength.  The  MGH,  Minnesota,  and UAB sites among others have demonstrated these high  field  advantages  with  their  3  and 4T whole body systems.  The  data  quality  achieved at 3 and 4T has compelled the MGH, Minnesota, and other groups to  consider the feasibility of human studies at 6 T, 7T, an d higher.  The  project: The proposed EM Analyzer will be used to help achieve  three  specific  aims: 1) predict of EM losses through RF coil-anatomy  modeling,  2)  verify and account for EM losses by measurement, and 3) minimize these  EM losses by appropriate RF coil design and application. In first aim, the  EM losses in finite element models of the coil adjacent to anatomy will be  numerically calculated. The consequences of these EM losses, to the coil's  RF  (Bl) field homogeneity, to safety, and to the SNR will be predicted by  using the computing power and software of the proposed instrument to solve  the  time-dependent electromagnetic and thermodynamic equations for  these  models. The second aim will be achieved by verifying the model predictions  by  bench  measurement  methods  using  the  high  power  pulsed  analyzer  functions  of the instrument. The modeled coils will be built and  tested,  with and without phantom, animal, and human loads. For the third aim,  the  theoretical  predictions and empirical verifications  will  be  tested  in  targeted applications. Initially, high field RF coils will be dedicated to  each  of  four  applications in the human head  targeting  deep  localized  structure,  whole brain, superficial local, or superficial global  cortex.  By  minimizing RF losses for each application we seek to show improved NMR  data  at  safe RF power levels in NMR applications at 1.5, 3, 4,  and  7T.  Although  the EM Analysis System will be applied to the development  of  a  wide  variety  of  high field NMR experiments, the three groups  proposing  this  instrument share a common interest to first develop the  high  field  human  head  application. The aims of this project will be closely  allied  with, and checked against the commercial high field products supported  by  Advanced NMR Systems, Inc.  The instrument: The EM Analyzer will be used to help prove the feasibility  of  6 to7T experiments, and to achieve the inherent potential of 3T and 4T  studies.  This   will  be  accomplished by predicting  and  developing  the  physical  and technical components of selected high field NMR experiments.  The  EM  Analysis System will be a workstation driven, high  power  pulsed  network  analyzer.  The  system will include  a  dynamic  gradient  signal  analyzer  as well. The workstation will host EM, thermal, mechanical,  and  NMR  simulation software for modeling the physical components of  the  NMR  experiment.  The  EM  Analyzer does not exist as a stand-alone  commercial  product,  but  will  be assembled from mostly off-the-shelf  hardware  and  software  components. Analogous to and deriving from  the  Automatic  Test  Equipment (ATE) used in military radar development and diagnostics, the EM  Analyzer  proposed  will  be  quite unique to  the  NMR  application.  The  Analyzer  will  be uniquely powerful as well, combining 3D, time-dependent  EM  simulation  software,  with  automated test  equipment  for  analyzing  realizations  of these EM coil designs on the bench, under realistic  high  power  pulsed or switched conditions. This instrument will allow 3D finite  element  models  of  anatomic regions encompassed by  EM  coil  structures  including  RF,  gradient and magnet coils, to be modeled.  Time  dependent  numerical  solutions of EM phenomena including SNR, B1 penetration,  power  absorption,  heating, magnetic susceptibility, etc.  will  be  calculated.  After  using  these  simulations to develop optimized  coil  designs,  the  proposed  instrument  will be used to dynamically analyze  the  physically  constructed  coil circuits for realistic RF pulse excitation and  gradient  wave  form  protocols. Thusly the success and safety of high  field  human  experiments will be predicted by simulation, and verified on the bench.  The  shared  use: The proposed instrument will be a much enhanced,  second  generation  of  the  workstation  and  small-signal  CW  network  analyzer  previously used by the PI while at UAB. The PI will assemble and  mainta in  the EM Analyzer at the MGH-Harvard Advanced Detector Laboratory, a part of  the MGH-NMR Center. In addition to and as part of their own research, Drs.  Vaughan  and  Ackerman will support and supervise local  Harvard  and  MIT  graduate  student projects requiring use of the EM Analysis  System.  This  system  will  be shared through continued collaboration with Dr.  Harrison  and  his  students  at the UAB, and with Drs. Ugurbil, Garwood  and  their  students  at  the University of Minnesota. In turn, the methods  and  coil  technology developed through shared use of the proposed instrument will be  verified by application at 4T and at 7T at the collaborating sites.",
