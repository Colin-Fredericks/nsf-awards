The focus of this  research is the investigation of several aspects of  multiclass queuing networks that arise from complex  manufacturing systems.  The scope of the research will range  from the development of fundamental mathematical models of  such networks to the computer implementation of the models  for some real world applications.  Specific research topics  to be investigated include the scheduling of wafer  fabrication lines, stability of multiclass queuing networks,  Brownian models under non-first in first out (non-FIFO)  policies, heavy traffic convergence, and computation of  stationary distribution for a reflected Brownian motion  (RBM).    Brownian models have been proved to be effective for the  approximate analysis of queuing networks. It has also been  proved that FIFO which most Brownian models to date employ  may be unstable in some networks.  Brownian models also play  important roles in both performance analysis and optimal or  near optimal scheduling of queuing networks. The Brownian  approximation will be used to analyze most queuing network  models that are interesting in practice.  The computer  implementation of the Brownian approximation scheme will be  used to predict the performances of a variety of queuing  networks, including those that arise in manufacturing and  telecommunication systems.  This research effort will  combine the expertise of the U. S. and Korean research  scientists in a project of mutual interest and benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science and  Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  This project adds an  international cooperative dimension to research supported by  NSF Grant No. DMI-9457336.  ***",
