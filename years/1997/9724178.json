 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for support of US scientists' participation in a `US-Pakistan Symposium and Workshop on Silicon Technology`, to be held in February 1998, in Islamabad, Pakistan.  The US team leader is Dr. T. Nejat Veziroglu, Professor and Director, Clean Energy Research Institute (CERI) at the University of Miami, in Florida.  The Pakistani co-organizer is Dr. Parvez Akhter, Director of the National Institute of Silicon Technology (NIST) in Islamabad.  The objectives of the workshop include: exchange of the latest knowledge on the technology and utilization of silicon in photovoltaics, as well as transistor applications; to highlight the known applications and benefits of the rapid growth in silicon technology, both for solar energy conversation and for computer applications; to discuss the utilization in solar cell technology in conjunction with the recently generated data on solar energy mapping in Pakistan; and to make recommendations for cooperative research and development between the US and Pakistan to accelerate the technology transfer in the field of silicon technology.  Specific topics to be discussed include: production procedures of silicon from quartz, rice husk, and silica sand; growth of single crystal and float zone technology; amorphous silicon technology as a viable material for solar cells; polycrystalline casting and ribbon technology; new materials and techniques to make thin film solar cells, heterojunctions, concentration and hybrids; comparison of these techniques for each specific applications; status of storage devices including hydrogen energy; and design of solar systems.   The last day will be devoted to specific workshops on specific topics with the purpose of identifying the most effective means for transfer of technology between industrialized countries and the developing countries.  Scope: This project deals with an area that is of particular importance to many developing countries that are in the so-called Sun-Belt.  Several of these countries lack adequate, or any, fossil fuel for the current demands or for any planned industrialization.  They would consider the development of a viable solar energy industry, either indigenous or as joint effort with industrialized countries, as a breakthrough in the equation that links economic development, environmental concerns, and needed financial resources.  Pakistan has been one of the countries that started on this effort early in the 1970's with some technical support from NSF grantees.  The US participants in this meeting are to be selected by a committee of two  US and two Pakistani experts in the field.   Both the CERI and NIST have extensive experience in organizing similar meetings in this area, some of which included other countries in South Asia.  The expected results of the workshop, including potential research collaboration, exchange of information, and opening avenues for US solar energy material companies to the Pakistani market, are helpful for both countries.  The proposal meets INT criteria for supporting activities likely to enhance collaboration between US and foreign researchers in areas of mutual interest.",
