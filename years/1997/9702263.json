 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702263  Swenson    Phase diagram models are created for bulk metallic glass  forming systems and technologically important metallic glass  -forming systems are thermodynamically modeled. The initial  work is on a well-characterized, good glass- forming ternary  system, Al-Cu-Zr, and an Al-base amorphous alloy system, Al-  Ce-Ni.  Phase diagram information (primarily isotherms and  liquidus surfaces) is determined using classical  metallurgical techniques, such as isothermal phase diagram  sample preparation, differential thermal analysis, and  differential scanning calorimetry.  The constituent binary  systems are modeled, followed by the ternary systems.  These  data are used to predict the optimum glass- forming  composition regions of the system, and the results are  compared with experimental bulk metallic glass samples  fabricated by melt spinning or piston forging and data that  in the literature.  Differential scanning calorimetry is  used to determine the glass transition temperatures of the  amorphous alloys and to measure thermodynamic properties of  the glass, such as heat capacity, that may be used to  improve the thermodynamic model itself.  A laboratory course  entitled \"Applied Thermodynamics of Materials\" is integrated  with current efforts to bring more modern, real world  applications into the classroom.  This course presents a  series of laboratory exercises involving the four main  classes of materials:  metals, ceramics, electronic  materials, and polymers.  %%%  The thermodynamic models that will be developed in the grant  can be used to optimize the glass formability of metallic  systems, as well as to derive more quantitative rules for  creating improved glass forming alloys.  ***",
