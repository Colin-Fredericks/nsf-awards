 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  Partridge    The galaxies and clusters now visible in the Universe grew from small  perturbations in density present at very early times, corresponding to  redshifts >1000. Many details of this evolutionary process are poorly  understood. In particular, we have only rudimentary (but rapidly improving)  understanding of the formation of cosmic structure in the first 5 billion  years after the recombination of the primeval plasma, that is in the large  range of redshifts 1-1000.    Refined radio-wavelength searches for various classes of fluctuations in  the cosmic microwave background radiation (CBR) will tell us more about the  early phases of structure formation, at the high end of this crucial  redshift interval. Optical, IR and radio observations of galaxies or galaxy  fragments at z = 1-3 are already providing important clues to the final  stages of galaxy formation (e.g., the onset of star formation).    Searches for CBR fluctuations and radio wavelength observations of high  redshift galaxies will be carried out.  The goal of the research is to help  bridge the gap in our understanding of cosmic evolution during the epoch  corresponding to redshifts (z) = 1-1000.    A study of the Hubble Deep Field at radio wavelengths will be carried out.  The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is a small but typical region of the sky  selected by astronomers for intensive study at all wavelengths, beginning  with a very deep Space Telescope exposure late last year. The aim is to use  observations across the electromagnetic spectrum to move our understanding  of galaxy evolution forward. Our radio observations will be carried out at  the Very Large Array at 8.4 and 1.4 GHz and with angular resolution from  10\" down to 0.4\" (close to the Space Telescope resolution).  Among the  scientific goals of our observations are:  --measuring radio spectra and morphologies to determine the nature of the  radio emission (synchrotron from supernova activity? active galactic  nuclei?)    --refining counts of radio source s at low flux densities    --examining the correlation of radio and optical luminosities    --improving limits on fluctuations in the CBR on angular scales 6\"-80\"    --searching for the microwave signals produced by clusters or protoclusters  of galaxies at z > 1.    Several related projects will parallel these efforts, including further  work on foreground sources of noise which interfere with searches for CBR  fluctuations, planning for a European space mission to map the CBR, and  near infrared observations of both high redshift galaxies already observed  at the VLA and of the 2-4 micron cosmic microwave background.    A postdoctoral associate will assist in some or all of these projects. The  position is intended, however, to provide the postdoc with further  experience and training in both teaching and research. In addition to his  or her research involvement, the postdoc would design and teach one course  per year at Haverford, under the close supervision and mentoring of members  of our department.  Undergraduate students will be involved in various  aspects of the research.",
