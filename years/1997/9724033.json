 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oligodendrocytes are the central nervous system cells that  make and maintain myelin (an insulating membrane that  surrounds nerves and facilitates fast nerve impulses).  Myelin is indispensable for the proper function of nerves  and muscles.  It has previously been shown that  oligodendrocytes, isolated from myelinated brain tissue and  kept in vitro (i.e., in the laboratory), regenerate and have  the potential to resynthesize myelin membranes.  It has also  been shown that during the process of regeneration,  oligodendrocytes reenact the sequence of events that lead to  myelination during development.  Hence these cells  constitute a good model to investigate the mechanism of  myelin formation.  In vitro, a critical requirement for this  entire process is the interaction of oligodendrocytes with  an adequate substratum (a surface to which the cells can  adhere).  A horse serum, heparin-binding glycoprotein (a  protein with attached sugars) termed GRASP  Glycine (a type  of amino acid) Rich Adhesion Serum Protein  has now been  identified, purified, and partially characterized that, in  vitro, fosters the adhesion of oligodendrocytes.  This  adhesion acts as a driving force that propels  oligodendrocytes on their path toward differentiation (i.e.,  myelin formation).  The long-term research endeavors are to  define the signaling events and single out the molecular  players that initiate and propagate the in vitro  regeneration/differentiation of oligodendrocytes.  It is  hypothesized that GRASP binds to a glycoprotein (receptor)  on the surface of oligodendrocytes; this binding turns on  the machinery that activates the cells to make myelin.  Specifically, this research is an attempt to confirm/refute  this hypothesis.  To this end, it is proposed to:  a)  identify and isolate GRASP's putative receptor; b) determine  the structure (i.e., the sequence of amino acids) of this  receptor; obtain the structure of GRASP and define its mode  of interaction with oligodendrocytes. The proposed  resear ch  should advance our understanding of the mechanisms that are  operative in the in vitro model.  Ultimately, it is hoped to  extend these concepts to the in situ system by identifying  GRASP's counterpart on nerve cells.  This research should  further our knowledge of the biology of OLGs and the  mechanism of myelin formation.",
