 "awd_abstract_narration": "Westneat  9701345         This study will elucidate major evolutionary patterns  in the functional morphology and hydrodynamics of locomotion  in a diverse monophyletic group of reef fish: the  triggerfishes and filefishes (Superfamily Balistoidea).  Data on the fin morphology, 3-D stroke kinematics, and  hydrodynamics of a taxonomically broad sample of these fish  will be collected and analyzed within the framework of  general mechanical predictions and tuo theoretical  hydrodynamic models applicable to long-based paired fin  propulsion.  Objectives include: (1) assessing the strength  of a widely assumed but untested correlation of fin shape  and kinematic profile; (2) testing the theoretical  advantages proposed for swimmers with long, narrow fins and  deep, rigidly held bodies; (3) determining which of the two  hydrodynamic models yields better estimates of mean thrust;  and (4) examining predictions from simple lever mechanics  and muscle architecture.  The study, the first in aquatic  locomotion to consider detailed form and kinematic data in a  regorous phylogenetic framework, will narow the traditional  gulf between functional studies that ignore the influence of  common ancestry and evolutionary studies that fail to  acknowledge biomechanical and hydrodynamic principles and  contraints.  The study will explore novel mechanisms of  thrust with potential applications in underwater propulsion  technology.",
