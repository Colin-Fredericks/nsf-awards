The molecular self-assembly, molecular order and processing to ultimately control material properties is the focus of the work described.  Ionic multilayer assembly (also known layer-by-layer assembly) is a new means of forming ultrathin organic films by the sequential absorption of monolayers of polyions or bipolar organic molecules of alternating positive and negative charge.  This method has won favor over traditional Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) techniques for forming films with complex supramolecular architectures because the layer-by-layer techniques are simpler, considerably inexpensive, and highly versatile.  Unfortunately, this technique has been limited thus far, because, unlike LB methods, there is no consistent means of introducing molecular scale ordering within the layers of the adsorbed films.  In this project liquid crystalline polymers are used to introduce order in the ionic multilayer assembly process.  The ability to create films with a specific desired molecular orientation opens the ionic multilayer technique to a broader range of electrical, optical, and sensor applications.  Furthermore, if switching induced by an electrical or magnetic field is possible in such films, a number of novel smart materials may result from this approach.  The educational aspect of the project includes the development of a new course in the chemical engineering curriculum which addresses the role of intermolecular interactions and self-assembly with respect to basic chemical engineering problems.  Changes in the teaching, approach and scope of an undergraduate polymer science laboratory and a polymer synthesis course are also addressed with emphasis on the issues of molecular scale phenomena and structure-processing-property relationships.  Finally, general community outreach and a specific program for the men toring of undergraduate and graduate minority and women students is included in the Career project.",
