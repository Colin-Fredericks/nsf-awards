 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Becker  San Jose State University, a campus of the California State  University, is a modern urban comprehensive university in  which faculty are required to do research. There is a large  18-faculty Department of Physics with approximately 35  undergraduate Physics majors in their Junior and Senior  years, including approximately fifteen students who are  female or members of under-represented minorities.  The REU Site that has been in operation since 1989 in the  SJSU Physics Department will be continued.  An innovative  component of this REU Site includes support for students in  industry-university collaborations: Four teams consist of a  Physics faculty member, a physicist from an industry or  government laboratory, and an NSF-REU student participant.  Most of the projects are in the areas of optics, condensed  matter, and computational physics.  All these projects  complement the Physics Department's officially recognized  \"Concentration in Lasers and Optics\", \"Concentration in  Condensed Matter\", and the \"Concentration in Computational  Physics\".  These three areas represent the major scientific  focus in the hightech \"Silicon Valley\" surrounding this  University.  These on-going research projects will provide  both experimental and theoretical research experience for  undergraduates in physics.  Undergraduate students are placed in fourteen projects which  range from experimental diode laser spectroscopy of stable  isotopes in carbon dioxide to theoretical studios of  electrical and optical properties of quantum well  semiconductors, to rare-earth spectroscopy.  The proposed program's major goal is to involve  undergraduate students, especially minorities, in research  who might not otherwise have the opportunity. ***",
