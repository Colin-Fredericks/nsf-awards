Leonard at the University of Hokkaido, Abuta,  Japan.  Dr. Leonard will work with Dr. Hiroshi Ueda,  Director of the Toya Lake Station, on a research project  entitled, \"Direct Determination of the Metabolic Costs of  Activity, Including Migration, in Adult Masu and Sockeye  Salmon.\"    The proposed research will evaluate the relative metabolic  cost of migration in individual adult Masu and Sockeye  salmon in a lacustrine model system.  The migration process  is a common, energetically expensive life-history strategy  among animals, and the evolution of migration is linked to  their ability to physiologically adapt to a heterogeneous  environment.  Migratory fish are ecologically and  commercially important species that are dependent upon  successful migration for survival, but the energetic cost of  migration - integral to the evolutionary development of life-  history strategies - in adult salmonids relative to oceanic  life has not been studied in detail.  During the research,  animals will be radio-tagged with electromyographic  transmitters and the activity levels between non-migratory  and migratory periods will be compared.  Additionally,  biochemical metabolic and hormonal parameters will be  measured in order to describe any direct effects of the  shift from non-migrant to migrant and the relationship  between biochemical changes and changes in activity will be  determined.  Results of the proposed research will provide  the first comprehensive evaluation in a field situation of  the energy required for migration relative to non-migratory  activity costs on an individual basis in adult salmonids.  ***",
