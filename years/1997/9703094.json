 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated program of research will develop techniques  for building concurrent software and techniques for  specifying properties of and validating concurrent software.  The construction of concurrent software is supported by  engineering coordination abstractions that capture common  patterns of communication, synchronization and process inter-  connectivity.  This work focuses on development of  abstractions that satisfy the needs of a class of real-world  problems, specifically scientific computing problems.  The  effectiveness of these abstractions is evaluated by applying  them to the solution of real-world problems.  Measurement of  development costs for solutions developed using abstractions  and alternative concurrent programming technologies will  form the basis of empirical evaluation to characterize the  relative merits of coordination abstractions.  The  validation of specifications of correctness properties of  concurrent software is investigated using a program flow  analysis called FLAVERS.  This work focuses on incorporation  of abstractions in FLAVERS to increase both the speed of  analysis and the accuracy of analysis results.  Evaluation  of the effectiveness of FLAVERS is assessed by applying it  to the verification of common classes of correctness  properties and to real-world concurrent applications, such  as those built with coordination abstractions.",
