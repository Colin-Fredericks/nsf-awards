 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604678  Matthews  The overall goal of this research is to understand the  mechanism by which the amino acid sequence of a protein  directs its rapid and efficient folding to its native  conformation.  A combination of biophysical and genetic  engineering methods will be used to probe the mechanism of  folding of homologous dihydrofolate reductases from a common  bacterium, E. coli, and from humans.  Circular dichroism,  NMR, fluorescence and x-ray scattering studies will provide  insight into the secondary and tertiary structures, as well  as the dynamics and sizes of transient, partially-folded  forms that have previously been observed to appear during  the folding of both proteins.  Ultrafast mixing will probe  the collapse of unfolded forms and the development of  nonpolar surfaces within 100 microseconds.  Mutational  analysis will probe the involvement of nonpolar side chains  in several hydrophobic clusters that appear to play key  roles in two classes of folding intermediates.  Protein  engineering will test the potential of fragments to fold.  Finally, the role of a bacterial chaperone, GroEL, in  influencing the folding of human dihydrofolate reductase  will be investigated.    Progress in understanding the structures and dynamics of  partially folded species that appear during folding should  provide insight into the process by which the amino acid  sequence of a protein spontaneously directs the formation of  its unique three dimensional structure.  A solution to the  protein folding problem would have an important effect on  biology, biochemistry and the biotechnology industry.  The  folding and transport of extracellular proteins is often  coordinated with their own synthesis or with the synthesis  of other proteins with which they form complexes.  Thus,  folding plays a key role in the normal functioning of cells.  Because the biological activities of proteins are directly  related to their three dimensional structures, an  understanding of the sequence/structure relationship is a   critical component of the processing of the genetic  information stored in the DNA sequence.",
