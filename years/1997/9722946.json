 "awd_abstract_narration": "Victoria Booth  Layman's abstract for proposal titled \"A dendritic origin of  bistability of motoneuron firing patterns\" (proposal #: IBN-  9722946)    In response to stimuli from the rest of the nervous system,  neurons in the spinal cord, called motoneurons, generate an  electrical signal called an action potential that is  transmitted to muscle fibers and induces contraction.  In  this way, the pattern of action potential firing by  motoneurons regulates muscle movement.  In the presence of  the naturally-occuring neurotransmitter serotonin,  experimentalists have observed motoneurons firing complex  patterns of action potentials that are believed to affect  muscle activity.  The cell mechanisms within motoneurons  responsible for the generation of action potentials are  sufficiently well known to allow the development of  mathematical models that replicate motoneuron behavior.  The  goal of this proposal is to investigate the cell mechanisms  underlying the generation of the serotonin-induced complex  firing behaviors by studying mathematical models of  motoneurons.  Of particular interest is the suggestion that  the complex behaviors are a result of the interaction of  mechanisms located in different segments of the neuron,  where one segment was previously thought to be uninvolved in  action potential generation.",
