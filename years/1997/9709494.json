 "awd_abstract_narration": "(c) PROJECT SUMMARY        The purpose of this project is to enhance interdisciplinary mathematics research, teaching and the professional development of postdocs at the University of Michigan.  This funding primarily provides half-support for four postdoctoral researchers associated with the Department of Mathematics' Interdisciplinary Initiative, with the remaining support coming from half-time assistant professor appointments (non-tenure-track) teaching one course per term.  The postdoc/assistant professors will be selected for their ability and interest to conduct research and  teach mathematics inspired by and applied to problems arising in science and engineering (physics, chemistry, biology, geology; mechanical, electrical, chemical, industrial and operations engineering, and financial mathematics).  The central goal of the project is to support existing interactions and stimulate new interdisciplinary research and collaborations between the Department of Mathematics and researchers throughout the University of Michigan's science and engineering departments and at other centers of excellence.  These goals will be pursued by way of the following activities supported in part by the grant:        . A regularly scheduled Interdisciplinary Mathematics Seminar given by experts in mathematical issues and applications relevant to other disciplines.    . An annual research conference organized by subsets of the Pls and postdocs, focusing each year on a different specific area of interdisciplinary mathematics.    . Postdoc/assistant professors will teach and develop upper-division undergraduate level special topics courses in areas of interdisciplinary mathematics.    The Pls and other senior associated researchers represent a broad spectrum of experience in applied  and interdisciplinary mathematical research.  They will mentor, guide, and collaborate with the  postdoc/assistant professors.    Funding for this activity will be provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities.",
