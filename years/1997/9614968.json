 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is radical kinetic and mechanistic studies.    Dr. Newcomb will carry out several projects that involve both direct,   laser flash photolysis and indirect kinetic measurements of reactions of   a variety of radicals.   One aim is to create kinetic scales for   substituted carbon radicals and heteroatom-centered radicals that   complement the highly developed scale for simple alkyl radicals, and part   of the work is directed at specific important targets such as the   kinetics of DNA radical reactions.  In addition,  emphasis will be placed   on studies of ultrafast radical rearrangements.  With this renewal award,   the Organic Dynamics Program is supporting the research of Dr. Martin E.   Newcomb of the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University.    Professor Newcomb will focus his work on probing the kinetic and   mechanistic properties of carbon radical intermediates.  A better   understanding in these areas will lead to expanded methodology for   synthetic chemists and knowledge that will bear on a number of vital   biological processes.",
