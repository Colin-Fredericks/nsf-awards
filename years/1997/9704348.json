 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to investigate the use of  adaptive  techniques to minimize the power consumed by  peripherals in mobile computing systems. Since battery life  is one of the most critical resources in the mobile  computing environment, good energy conservation methods can  dramatically increase the utility of mobile systems. The  investigators have previously demonstrated that new adaptive  techniques from the machine learning community are very  effective in solving disk spin-down problem  (deciding  when to shut down the disk in order to maximize power  savings) on traces of disk activity.  The project will  continue this work in two directions. The first direction is  to compare the performance of the new techniques with that  of other adaptive  algorithms for the spin-down problem.  The second direction involves applying similar machine  learning methods to wireless modems (radios). In addition to  the power savings gained by turning off the radio when the  network interface is not needed, adaptively choosing the  broadcast power level may also lead to significant energy  savings.",
