 "awd_abstract_narration": "Each summer (1997-2001) for 8 weeks, 10 undergraduate students  will work with 3 faculty mentors on research projects related to  the faculty members' research interests.  These projects will be  chosen carefully so that they are within the students' ability  and there is reasonable chance that the students' work will be of  interest to the mathematical research community.  It is expected  that some of the results will be incorporated into publishable  papers, either by the students alone or jointly with the faculty  member, and that the collaboration will continue beyond the  summer period.  Because of the short period of time and the  inherent risks involved in any serious research effort, the  students will be prepared to accept a favorable outcome that does  not include publishable results.    The two types of research projects that will be included are: 1)  Computer exploration projects, in which the students begin by  writing programs or using existing software to work out examples,  and formulate conjectures.  To the extent that they are able, the  students may also participate in attempts to find proofs and  conventional mathematical explanations for the experimental  results they have generated; 2) Projects in geometry and  combinatorics, that do not require extensive background knowledge  to begin working on, and for which cleverness and insight are the  keys to progress.    For the summer of 1997, the faculty mentors will be R. Strichartz  (P.I.), K. Pilgrim and R. Ehrenborg.  Strichartz will direct  projects of type 1) on analysis on fractals, Pilgrim will direct  projects of type 1) on dynamics of rational maps, and Ehrenborg  will direct projects of type 2) on combinatorics.  For future  summers, the mentors will include the P.I. and 2 others chosen  among Cornell faculty and visitors.",
