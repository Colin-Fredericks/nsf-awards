This   methodology is being developed and tested in several specific areas:   Monotonicity and stochastic ordering properties that follow from the   strictly unidimensional latent variable representation are being   studied and applied to nonparametric scaling problems.  A promising   Markov chain Monte Carlo method is being extended and applied to a   variety of problems, including: correct modeling of rater variability   in educational achievement data; accomodating heterogeneous   catchability in multiple-recapture censuses; and developing methods   for multidimensional and hierarchical latent variable models for   discrete repeated measures.  In addition, the research addresses the   sensitivity of inferences to underspecification of the model.  A   second thrust of the research is to refine and develop existing   characterizations of unidimensional latent structure into a   statistical theory of, and statistical methods for assessing, latent   variable dimensionality.    This work aims to more fully blend psychometric and statistical   approaches to latent variable models for repeated discrete measures.   Psychometric methodology tends to concentrate on model building and   model features; and psychometric data analysis tends toward issues of   scaling (selecting questions that ``hang together'' in the sense that   a unidimensional latent variable model holds), reliability (ensuring   that the latent variable can be estimated well from the questions   selected), and the assessment of latent variable dimensionality from   data.  Statistical methodology tends to sidestep these bas ic   psychometric questions, and instead concentrates on finer model   adjustments, and various inferential and predictive tasks.  The focus   of this research is on statistical and psychometric features of latent   variable models for repeated measures data, which is of interest to   quantitative psychologists, educational measurement specialists, and   cognitive scientists, as well as other social scientists.  Much of the   work is collaborative in nature, and it is built around the   development of theory and methodology motivated from, and useful for,   substantive applications.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------",
