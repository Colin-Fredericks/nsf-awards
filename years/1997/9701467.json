 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701467  Yamamuro  This action is to support an integrated research and  educational-enhancement project submitted under the NSF  Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program.    Most research into liquefaction of soils has been performed  on clean sands, while most of the documented historic cases  of earthquake-induced liquefaction have occurred in alluvial  silty sands. The current view of the effect of fines  (particles smaller than 0.074 mm) on the liquefaction  behavior of soils is that it either inhibits liquefaction or  that it has little effect. However this is not necessarily  correct. The behavior of silty sands has also been observed  to be highly unconventional.    The four major tasks and objectives of the research program  are:    (1) To investigate the unconventional behavior of silty  sands by  performing drained and undrained testing using monotonic and  cyclic loading. The objective is to explore the bounds of  the observed unconventional behavior.  (2) To evaluate, using scanning electron microscope and thin-  sections  analysis, the soil fabric of silty sands formed by the  different depositional methods used to create test  specimens. This will be followed by a study of soil fabric  created by water depositional processes in a fabricated  cylindrical vertical sedimentation chamber. The objective is  to ensure that the fabric created by alluvial deposition is  incorporated accurately into test specimens. The soil fabric  will then be modeled using Discrete Element Methods (DEM),  the objective being to verify possible 'collapse' mechanisms  of 'meta-stable' structures created in silty sands during  alluvial deposition.  (3) To perform model cone penetrometer tests (CPT) in a  fabricated  double-walled calibration chamber on silty sands. The  objective is to evaluate existing insitu liquefaction  assessment methods and the effect of grain size.  (4) To modify an elasto-plastic, non-associated flow  constitutive soil  model to capture the unconventional behavior pattern.  The  objective is to enable predictions of liquefaction in  alluvial silty sand.    The three main educational objectives are:    (l) To improve students' electronic communications skills  when acting as  'disassociated' project team members connected only by  networking technology.  (2) To improve undergraduate soil mechanics education by  providing  undergraduate students with greater exposure to advanced  soil mechanics testing by developing interactive videos.  Videos will be developed for tests such as monotonic and  cyclic triaxial testing, torsion shear, CPT, and  pressuremeter. This will supplement the basic undergraduate  laboratory experience.  (3) To encourage minority participation into the  geotechnical engineering  program at Clarkson University. This will be best  accomplished by participation in the McNair Program which  funds qualified minority students to participate in  undergraduate research during summers.",
