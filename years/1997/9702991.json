 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Career project is to apply techniques from  parallel computing and computational geometry to develop  theoretically sound and practically efficient parallel algorithms  for a class of irregular scientific applications and to infuse  the resulting knowledge into parallel computing and computational  science programs.    The main goal of the research is to develop parallel algorithms  and software for scientific applications that depend upon  interactions between entities (such as particles, atoms) located  in two or three dimensional space. To achieve this goal, a two-  pronged strategy will be used: Firstly, efficient parallel  solutions will be developed for specific applications. Secondly,  general techniques useful for parallelizing irregular  applications that depend on multidimensional point sets will be  investigated.  Two specific applications, considered to be Grand  Challenge problems by the High Performance Computing and  Communications (HPCC) Subcommittee, will be studied: The N-body  problem and Protein Accessible Surface Area Calculations. The N-  body problem is to simulate the motion of particles under the  influence of mutual force fields based on an inverse square law.  N-body computations are useful in such diverse fields as  astrophysics, plasma physics, molecular and fluid dynamics,  computer graphics and numerical complex analysis. Protein  Accessible Surface Area calculations are used to study the  structure of proteins, an important problem in computational  molecular biology. The access patterns required by many  scientific applications that depend on distribution of  particles/atoms can be abstracted into primitive queries on  multidimensional point sets. General techniques for efficient  parallel execution of such applications will be investigated and  software to aid programming such applications will be developed.    Education Plan:    The main goal of the education plan is to develop curriculum in  parallel computing and computational science at New  Mexico State  University and to train students to apply computer science  principles in solving important scientific applications on future  generation computing systems. A course in parallel computing has  already been developed and a textbook on algorithm design for  parallel computers is being written. Additional courses in  parallel computing will be developed and introduced. It is  intended to develop curriculum and establish a new computational  science program on campus. The results of the proposed research  will be integrated into courses in parallel computing and  computational science.",
