 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chief challenge of our time is the intelligent control of technology, and nowhere is that challenge being more vigorously interpreted and debated than in the context of education. This project investigates the prospects for using technology to provide distance learning in ways that support traditional educational values. To achieve this aim, the study will focus on the design features of the Western Governors virtual university in relationship to the educational value of individualization. This analysis will be carried out using the incrementalist theory of technology development, primarily as espoused by David Collingridge.  Incrementalists stress that error should be expected in any technological development and the cost of error can be minimized by advancing technologies in a series of slow, small steps whose effects can be quickly recognized and easily modified. Trial and error, corrigibility, flexibility, and monitoring are thus key properties of manageable technological systems. The relevance of these concepts to information technology in higher education and their usefulness in guiding technological development in ways that serve educational values will be assessed.  Articles resulting from this project will be submitted to relevant journals in the humanities, social sciences and educational administration.",
