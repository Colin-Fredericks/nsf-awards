 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  objective of this proposal is to fund the purchase of a gel  and blot analysis system  for investigators at FSU conducting cellular and molecular research.  Such a system which  produces rapid, quantitative analyses of data produced with molecular  probes (radioactive,  chemiluminescent, fluorescent, or chemifluorescent) is absolutely  essential to competitive  research in these areas. Four funded investigators comprise the major  users group, and an  additional group of seven minor users are included. The focus of  research in these laboratories  include a broad variety of cell and molecular questions in the areas of  structural cell biology,  developmental neurobiology, gene regulation and molecular biology in  multicellular  organisms. These investigators are currently conducting research  requiring such an analysis  system and \"making do\" with much less accurate and much more  time-consuming techniques  (autoradiography with X-ray film and subsequent densitometry).  Additionally, this  equipment will be available to 3 new faculty who are in the initial  phase of their research  careers as independent investigators, as well as several faculty with  established (but in some  cases unfunded) programs. A large number of undergraduate and graduate  students will be the  primary beneficiaries of the use of this equipment.",
