The study involves engaging a large community of organizations including the AAAS, accreditation organizations, school administrative groups, career counseling groups, and other appropriate organizations and is expected to provide the basis for formulating appropriate curricula and materials.  It is being carried out under the direction of an eight-member steering committee and includes extensive Internet-based input, a two or three day workshop and a two-stage review process on the report and recommendations of the workshop, which will then be widely distributed.",
