With his student Gnacadja, he is studying the idea of a phantom map between  represenations, an idea borrowed from topology. The second part of the   project involves the study of group actions via the theory of varieties for  modules, and the study of homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces.  The third part involves generalizations of his work with Jon Carlson on  Poincar&eacute; duality for finite groups. This theory has already been  generalized to compact Lie groups and to virtual duality groups in joint  work with John Greenlees, and they are currently working on the generalization   to p-adic analytic groups, based on the work of Lazard for the torsion  free case. The fourth part involves explicit computer calculations of  projective resolutions and group cohomology using John Cannon's MAGMA  program.    Representation theory is the study of how to represent abstract groups  as groups of matrices. Cohomology studies how matrix representations  glue together. Professor Benson's research centers around the cohomology   and representation theory of finite, infinite and compact Lie groups, the   algebraic topology of classifying spaces, and invariant theory for finite   groups. This subject is on the borderline between algebra and topology, which   seems to be a very fruitful area of interaction within pure mathematics.",
