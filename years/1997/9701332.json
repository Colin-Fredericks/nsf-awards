 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701332  Lewis  While biodiversity continues to be the focus of many ecological studies and  conservation efforts, its relation to ecosystem function remains unresolved. The literature  provides examples of both interdependence and independence between biodiversity and  functioning of ecosystems. The purpose of this project is to test three hypotheses, as  follows: (1) a given biotic compartment in an incrementally stressed ecosystem will show  suppression of biodiversity first, and suppression of biomass subsequently; (2) suppression  of ecosystem function is primarily related to suppression of biomass, rather than to  biodiversity per se; and (3) suppression of biomass differs among biotic compartments  according to a predictable series of thresholds: multicellular organisms < unicellular  autotrophs < microbial decomposers. These hypotheses will be tested on a group of  streams, some of which have been stressed by acidic mine drainage. These streams are  excellent model systems because they include a wide gradient of multiple stresses (low pH,  high concentration of metals, oxide deposition), each of which is quantifiable. Pilot  studies on these streams are consistent with the three hypotheses. The project will focus  on expansion of the information on benthic insects and periphyton as necessary to test the  hypotheses, and use of molecular techniques to obtain comparable information on  microbial decomposer compartments.",
