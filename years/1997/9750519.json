 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a result of rapid developments in the spectroscopic analytical and chemical separations fields, the focus of this department has been directed to instrumental techniques in the physical, biological, and analytical chemistry curricula.  The project involves the addition of modern instrumentation in gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography (analytical and prep-scale), mass spectrometry, ultraviolet/visible, fluorescence, Fourier-transform infrared, and Fourier-transform nuclear-magnetic resonance spectroscopies to the curriculum.  The department is now seeking to address the need for instruction in electrochemical methods to combat a lack of student understanding of basic ideas in solution chemistry and interfacial measurements.  This project is implementing a systematic program of electrochemical education that provides for (1) hands-on student exposure to modern electrochemical methods and equipment; (2) demonstration of the competitiveness of electrochemical methods with other techniques; (3) the development of new undergraduate laboratory exercises; and (4) the exposure of the modern methods and equipment to increased numbers of students in the areas of analytical, inorganic, physical, polymer, and biochemistry.  These experiments illustrate important chemical concepts and serve to demonstrate the use of electrochemistry in analysis.",
