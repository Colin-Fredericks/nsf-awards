The Project Summary should include a statement of objectives, methods to be employed, and the significance of the proposed activity to the advancement of knowledge or education. Avoid use of first person to complete this summary. DO NOT EXCEED ONE PAGE. (Some Programs may impose more stringent limits.)    Scaffolding Young Children's Data-Based Scientific Research  Narrowing the Gap Between Children's and Scientists' Inquiry    The habitual poor performance of US students on evaluations of both science and mathematics achievement, together with the many societal and individual needs for scientific and mathematical literacy, point to the importance of fundamental reform in these subject areas. The results from the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (1990) indicate that students continue to attain only a low level of understanding in these disciplines. For example, in mathematics only a minority of students demonstrate proficiency at solving non-routine, multi-step problems. In science, only a minority of high school seniors have the knowledge adequate to interpret scientific data in graphs or table form, or to design experiments.    Both the mathematics and science education communities have formulated recommendations for reversing this dire situation. This proposed project is framed in terms of a synergy we perceive between key recommendations from the mathematics and science education reform literatures, recommendations that when combined form the basis of an instructional approach powerfully addressing needed changes in both subject areas. In short, the influential National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) has argued for a stronger conceptual and applied orientation to mathematics curriculum, with the goal of attaining a curriculum where children come to view mathematics as a powerful means of sense-making and solving genuine problems. NCTM contends that the nature of the problems in the curriculum needs to be greatly expanded, to include  extended open-ended investigations, many involving the children's formulation of the question, decisions about how to go about solving the problem, and representing and interpreting their results. According to NCTM, even at the primary grade level children should be conducting data-based investigations and reflecting on ideas of statistics and probability (NCTM, 1989). Although more groups are involved in developing recommendations for elementary science education reform and there appears to be less consensus concerning realistic educational objectives (American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1993; National Academy of Sciences, 1995), the science education community shares with the math education community the long-term goal of developing independent and skeptical inquirers who hold rich visions of their respective intellectual enterprises --of what it means to think scientifically or mathematically.    The project will develop science curriculum prototypes where children design research and subsequently analyze and interpret their data. Grounded in current concerns to have math curriculum more applied and to have both math and science curriculum reflect the discipline's way of constructing and evaluating knowledge, the model of science underlying the curriculum encompasses preliminary explorations of the domain, fommation of questions, planning of experiments, subsequent collection, representation and interpretation of data, theory development, and revision and extension of research. In order to support children's data analysis and eventual independent inquiry, the curriculum prototypes will incorporate instructional support in fundamental statistical concepts, such as randomness, chance variation, the Law of Large Numbers and sampling. Since several cognitive literatures have identified domain-specific knowledge as a key detemminant in adequacy of reasoning, the project will concentrate the children's investigations in two interrelated domains: (a) animal behavior (such as insect s, rodents, and birds) and (b) child behavior. As technological tools can empower researchers in their access to domain-specific knowledge-bases and the task of data representation and analysis, the project reaming environments will provide technological tools and scaffold the children's strategic capitalization thereof.    The project will closely examine the data-based research that instruction based on these principles supports among children at the primary and upper elementary levels. Project research will take place in two contexts: (a) intact elementary school classrooms at the second and fifth grade levels, and (b) the laboratory. This combination of contexts allows the project research to reflect the richness of the classroom and the rigor and control supported by the laboratory. Analysis will be conducted at both the macro and micro levels across the longitudinal context of the school year, in order to examine the dynamics of children's developing data-based research, in interaction with their emergent scientific and statistical knowledge.    The project is designed to make contributions to both cognitive theory and educational practice. It integrates and advances the research literatures of children's reasoning about chance and children's reasoning about causality, through study of children's application of uncertainty, chance and causality in their scientific data analysis. It advances children's mathematics education, through design and investigation of children's practice of mathematics in a context of rich meaning and purpose. Finally, it narrows the gap between children's and scientists' inquiry, through scaffolding children's research design and data analysis.    NSF FORM 1358 (1/94)",
