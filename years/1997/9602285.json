 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Missouri-Columbia has a long tradition of excellence in the plant sciences and one of the strongest research and research training programs in the nation.  This strength is derived from the activities of the Interdisciplinary Plant Group, which consists of 39 faculty representing six departments and two colleges. An interactive group of faculty with diverse research interest in basic plant research utilizes state of the art technologies in plant physiology, genetics, cell and molecular biology, to investigate fundamental biological questions.  However, existing conditions of the University's greenhouse facilities, built before 1925, are inadequate to support experimental work.   Funding from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will be used to partially support the replacement and consolidation of six aged and inefficient greenhouses and their associated head houses into a modern facility for plant science research.  The new facility will consolidate existing research growth facilities, enhancing efficiencies and cooperation among users.  Included in the structure will be a centralized seed storage facility with temperature and humidity controls to ensure the viability of valuable genetic stocks. The existing ventilation and evaporative cooling systems will be improved to eliminate problems with stratification of air flow and non-uniform temperatures, and provide increased usability, and temperature control. This project will fortify and enhance interactions among research groups, assist in the institution's ability to recruit new faculty and research trainees, and expand the scope of research training for graduate students.  Improvements will increase opportunities for underrepresented groups to participate in basic research, and ensure accessibility for the physically disabled.",
