 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701500  Silvera    This  is  a  new  proposal to study solid hydrogen and  its  isotopes,  deuterium and HD in  the   multimegabar pressure range.  Pressures will be extended  beyond  300  GPa, where it is believed that the dissociative transition to atomic  metallic  hydrogen  will take place.  This will be accomplished  using  high  quality,  small  culet  diamonds in newly designed  precision  diamond  anvil  cells.  Transitions will be searched for by studying the strong IR  absorption, as well as the Raman scattering from vibron modes, in  the  A-phase  which  is believed to precede the transformation to the atomic  solid.  A detected phase  transition will then be studied by optical techniques to observe Drude  free-electron   behavior,  or  dc  electrical  conductivity   at   low  temperature,  in  order  to  determine the conductive state.  NMR will  be  used  to  determine  ortho-para conversion rates.  Optical techniques will be developed to  determine the index or refraction and the equation of state.  %%%  This  is  a  new  proposal to study solid hydrogen and  its  isotopes,  deuterium and HD in  the   multimegabar  pressure range.  Solid hydrogen and  its  isotopes  have fascinating high  pressure  phase  diagrams.  These molecular solids  are  predicted  to  become  molecular  metals  at pressures between 1.5 and 3 megabar  and  atomic  metals  at higher pressures.  The molecular and atomic metals are predicted to  be  possible room temperature  superconductors.  A transition to  a  phase  called  the  A-phase  at  about  1.5 megabars is still not  understood.  These  solids  will  be  studied  at  multimegabar  pressures  using  newly  designed  precision  diamond anvil cells.  IR absorption, as well as Raman scattering  will  be  used to search for new phases.  These will then be studied by optical  techniques or dc electrical conductivity at low temperature to observe  possible metallic behavior.  NMR will be used to determine ortho-para  conversion  rates.   Optical  techniqu es will  also  be  developed  to  determine  the index of refraction and the equation of state.  ***",
