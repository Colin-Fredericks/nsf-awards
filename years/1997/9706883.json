 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oskolkov will continue his  investigations of oscillatory sums and integrals involving  imaginary exponentials of real algebraic polynomials.   The coefficients of the polynomials are considered as  independent real variables. These sums and integrals  establish interconnections between such apparently   distant fields as Harmonic Analysis, Analytic Number  Theory and Partial Differential  Equations. He will also  elaboratee on   Radon-Fourier analysis for  functions of several variables. Special emphasis will  be made on associated problems of ridge approximation,  which consist in selection of best fit linear   combinations of planar wave type functions. These  problems are of highly non-linear nature, especially  with respect to optimal  selection of wave vectors.       Immediate ramifications of such research include  neural   network models that have found wide applications in  industry, engineering, computer science, finance and  medicine. The Radon transform is an acknowledged   powerful tool in several applied areas ranging from   classical quantum mechanics and optics to X-ray tomography.   In computational X-ray tomography, ridge approximation  can be interpreted as reconstruction of images  of non-homogeneities such as tumors. Another  extremely different field is recognition of main trends  in evolution of large systems such as bacteria  populations or the stock market, where an enormous  number of variables must be modeled.",
