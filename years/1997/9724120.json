 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kay    9724120    Circadian clocks are known to regulate many essential cellular processes in all organisms so far examined. In higher plants most major metabolic pathways are subject to circadian regulation, as well as developmental events such as the photoperiodic control of flowering. However, the molecular components of these biological clocks remain unknown. Using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model plant and the luciferase gene fusion  and bioluminescence imaging system developed in this laboratory, work will be continued on the identification and characterization of the DNA-protein interactions involved in regulated chlorophyll A binding protein (CAB2) gene transcription, the genetic analysis of the interactions between circadian and phototransduction pathways and genome-wide identification of clock-controlled genes in Arabidopsis.    The long term goal is to further our understanding of how circadian clocks are built in eukaryotic cells. Although they are known to regulate many essential cellular processes in all organisms thus far analyzed, the molecular components of these biological clocks remain unknown. Using Arabidopsis as a model plant, genetic and molecular approaches  will be used to enhance our knowledge of the mechanistic basis of the regulated response of gene expression to circadian rhythm.",
