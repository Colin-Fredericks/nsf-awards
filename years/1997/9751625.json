 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides scientific and computing equipment to be used by undergraduates to perform laboratory experiments and student research in seven biology, five chemistry, and three mathematics courses.  A computer learning center for mathematics and science provides for (1) expanded use of computers for instruction in mathematics and science courses; (2) the modification of existing laboratory experiments and the introduction of new laboratory experiments involving computerized data acquisition and analysis; and (3) enhanced student access to computers, facilitating computer-based assignments and follow-ups to laboratories.    Mathematical and scientific concepts are strongly linked through the more extensive studies that may be accomplished with the aid of computers.  Strengthening interdisciplinary learning is a major goal of the investigators involved.  Mathematics is developing course materials using examples from the sciences.  The sciences are introducing more sophisticated mathematical modeling and data analysis into their laboratories to achieve this goal.  The requested equipment can have a significant impact on students from a variety of disciplines that include both basic mathematics and science, as well as secondary education and allied health majors.   *",
