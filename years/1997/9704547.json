 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704547  Knupp        In a continuation of previous research, the Principal Investigator will pursue  investigation of the interactions between storm dynamics and microphysics in deep  tropical convection.  The analysis components include: (a) multiple Doppler radar  for determination of internal flows, (b) multiparameter radar for determination of  bulk microphysics, and (c) aircraft data for determination of in situ microphysics and  kinematics.  Integration of these data sets will yield a comprehensive description of  the interacting microphysical, kinematic and electric fields within deep convection.  Further integration of these data will facilitate evaluation of the accuracy of radar  measurements. In addition, numerical simulations will be used to further study the  dynamical and microphysical processes of deep convection, and will facilitate  interpretation of the various radar and aircraft observations.         Specific tasks included under this continuation proposal include:   determination of the time-dependent vertical profiles of latent heating, identification      of the important microphysical processes associated with latent heating within     deep convection, and the impact of latent heating on the dynamics of deep     precipitating convection;  investigation of the various mechanisms by which cells in proximity interact     dynamically and microphysically;  a) examination of the cell (storm) entrainment properties using aircraft and multiple     Doppler data, and 3-D numerical simulations;  b) quantification of errors and filtering associated with multiple Doppler wind     retrievals and multiparameter radar measurements.        Successful completion of this project will advance understanding of how  precipitation is produced in tropical convection.   ***",
