 "awd_abstract_narration": "Basic to the philosophy of the Plastics Engineering Technology bachelors degree program, a graduating student should be prepared to make a positive impact upon entering the plastics industry.  This requires possessing engineering technology skills in plastics materials, design, and processing, and the graduate must also be prepared to develop and present new ideas.  As a cornerstone to the program of study, the students use leading-edge computer technologies, including solid molding, finite element analysis, mold flow, mold cooling, and polymer flow; have a comprehensive laboratory experience resulting in an understanding of the operation of processing machinery and proper processing conditions to produce high-quality parts; are required to develop and range an engineering project; and present the project before their peers and professionals in their field.    The object of this project is to develop a national model for the appropriate integration of the interaction of the mechanical properties of a plastic, the effect of processing on mechanical properties, and the relationship of part design to overall part performance.  It is necessary to obtain an instrumented puncture impact testing system to accomplish this goal.  The justification for this equipment is based on the innovative way in which the new equipment is used.  *",
