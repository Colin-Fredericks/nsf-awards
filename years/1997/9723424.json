 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dickinson  9723424    Flight in insects is a complex form of locomotion that requires an             array of physiological and  morphological specializations. The research to be done under this award             to the PI will focus on  how muscles, skeletons, and brains function together to enable flying             animals to perform elaborate  aerial maneuvers. The research in this proposal focuses on flies, which             although using relatively   simple brains, are capable of elaborate flight behavior. Flies are  unique among all flying animals in possessing specialized sensory  structure called halteres that serve as a gyroscopes during flight. The  first goal of the research is to study how the halteres are used to  increase flight stability. These experiments will employ a  mechanically-oscillating flight arena to characterize the behavioral  responses elicited by angular perturbations. The second goal of the  project is to use a large scaled model of a flapping fly to determine  how changes in wing motion effect the production of aerodynamic forces.  The third goal of the research is to combine electrophysiology with  high-speed video imaging to characterize how steering muscles act to  change the motion of the wings during flight. These first three sets of  experiments will determine how animals use corrective reflexes to  maintain stable flight. The final portion of the project is to  determine how animals initiate voluntary maneuvers when they are  actively searching their environment for food or mates. This research  will contribute to the understanding of the rapid neural processing and  aerodynamic mechanisms that are required to produce sophisticated  flight behavior.",
