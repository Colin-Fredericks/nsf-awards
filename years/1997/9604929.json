 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the further design, construction, and  evaluation of data acquisition and analysis hardware to be interfaced  to a flow cytometer. This hardware employs digital pulse waveform  processing, and during the prior period of funding, we developed and  evaluated a first-generation design. In this proposal, we aim to  develop second-generation hardware, that will provide improved rates of  cellular analysis. We also propose a thorough practical and theoretical  examination of the types of biological information that can be obtained  using digital pulse processing in flow cytometry, and the algorithms  that are required to extract this information. We finally propose to  see whether we can improve the performance of the hardware through  increasing the spatial resolution of the optics of the flow cytometer.      The expected significance of the proposed research relies on the  observation that the instrumentation is novel in capability, and can  provide information about cells that is inaccessible using other  instruments. The development of a second-generation instrument will  allow full implementation of digital pulse processing in flow cytometry  and cell sorting. The ability to rapidly analyze and sort cells  according to novel optical parameters should greatly extend our ability  to probe the cellular and molecular factors that govern the operation  of living cells. This should facilitate a deeper understanding of  normal cellular growth and development, as well as of abnormal growth  and disease states. This might lead to instrumentation with improved  diagnostic and prognostic capabilities. We are convinced that the  interdisciplinary approach integral to this project, which combines  expertise in very different scientific fields (engineering, optics, and  biology), has considerable potential to produce instrumentation and  methods that will significantly extend our understanding of the  structure and function of living cells.",
