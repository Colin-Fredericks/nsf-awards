 "awd_abstract_narration": "The unprecedented speed, integration density, and economy of modern CMOS circuit  technology have fueled the rapid evolution of the computer industry, and hold the  promise of similarly fueling the personal communications industry.  However, the  circuit technology tends to be highly optimized for digital circuits wherein  precise analog performance is not critical.  Since communication systems must  transmit and receive analog waveforms, the most effective use of CMOS circuit  technology for such applications requires on-chip analog-to-digital (A/D) and  digital-to-analog (D/A) converters, and these are often the limiting factors in  overall system price and performance.  For low speed applications such as  telephone modems, delta-sigma data converters have emerged as the method of  choice for implementing the on-chip A/D and D/A converters because they are  particularly amenable to high-precision CMOS implementation.  The purpose of this  research is to eliminate a major limitation suffered by existing delta-sigma data  converters to facilitate their use in higher-speed applications such as personal  wireless communication systems.    Specifically, the research involves the development of practical multi-bit noise-  shaping DACs to be used in delta-sigma data converters. These DACs avoid the  severe component matching requirements of their conventional counterparts through  a digital signal processing innovation that causes the noise arising from  component mismatches to lie outside the signal band.  Such DACs have the  potential to significantly increase the present performance limits of delta-sigma  data converters by eliminating the need for one-bit quantization.  The primary  goals of the research are to develop practical high-order noise-shaping DACs that  extend the present performance limits of delta-sigma data converters, and to  theoretically and experimentally quantify their performance.",
