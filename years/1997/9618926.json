 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current   speech   recognition  technology,   while   useful   in  constrained  domains with cooperative speakers,  still  leads  to  unacceptably   high   error  rates  (30-50%)   on   unconstrained  conversational  or  broadcast speech.   An  important  difference  between  these tasks and high accuracy conditions is  the  larger  variability  in speaking style, even within data  from  a  single  speaker.   Existing  acoustic  models  do  not  account  for  the  systematic   factors   behind  this  variability   so   must   be  ``broader,'' leading to more confusability among words and  hence  high  error rates.  This work proposes to improve acoustic models  by  representing sources of variability at three time scales: the  syllable, short regions within an utterance, and the speaker.  At  the  syllable  level, automatic clustering will capture  syllable  position and phonetic reduction effects.  At the region level,  a  slowly  varying  hidden  speaking mode will  indicate  systematic  differences in pronunciations associated with reduced vs. clearly  articulated speech. At the speaker level, hierarchical models  of  the  correlation among speech sounds will improve  adaptation  of  acoustic  models  from small amounts of data.   Experiments  will  involve  large  vocabulary recognition of  conversational  speech  using  a  multi-pass search strategy to handle the  cost  of  the  higher-order  models  proposed here. By  representing  systematic  variability, the proposed work should significantly advance  both  the  target  task of unconstrained speech recognition and  human-  computer speech communication more generally.",
