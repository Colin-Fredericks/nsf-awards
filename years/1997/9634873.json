The project consists of two parts: (1) a study of  equilibrium and nonequilibrium aspects of ordering and  fluctuations in electrochemical adsorption, and, (2) a  fundamental study of metastable phases of matter and their  modes of decay.  Both parts of the research cross  traditional boundaries of physics, chemistry and materials  science and will require the use and development of novel  computational algorithms.  %%%  This theoretical research is comprised of two parts.  One  part will apply various models to study the adsorption of  molecules to the surface of materials due to  electrochemistry.  This electrochemical adsorption is  fundamental to a number of processes including  electrodeposition of metals (electroplating), corrosion and  batteries.  While there has recently been an upsurge in the  available experimental data, there has been a dearth of  modeling to interpret this data.  The second part of the  research will study fundamental issues of phases of  materials which are neither stable nor unstable.  These  unusual metastable states of matter are of high interest in  helping to understand the transition between stable and  unstable states.  They are also of interest in their own  right and apply to such systems as superheated steam.  ***",
