In addition, SIGPLAN will  sponsor an educational tutorial track and waive the tutorial  fees and conference registration fees for the selected  participants. The topics of the tutorials are chosen to  improve the effectiveness of faculty members teaching  undergraduate courses in the area of programming and  programming languages. The selection will be based on a  competitive process with several criteria, the most  significant being that the person be a teaching faculty  member at an undergraduate institution with a large minority  enrollment or a women's college. They will also be asked to  demonstrate that they lack independent institutional support  to attend without such funding. This activity follows the  lines of similar activities sponsored for PLDI in 1994 and  1996. It is expected that this opportunity for faculty  directly involved in the teaching of undergraduate minority  and women students will assist these students in entering  successful careers in computer or related sciences.  ***",
