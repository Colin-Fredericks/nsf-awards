 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wahba  9704758    This research involves the development and testing of improved methods for estimating functions of many variables, given scattered, noisy, heterogeneous direct and indirect observations and prior information of various kinds.  Theoretical properties of the methods under development are established, and properties of the methods are also studied in test beds with simulated data where the `truth' is known.  Efficient numerical algorithms are developed which simultaneously implement statistical and computational objectives.  Finally the methods are tested on real observational data sets.  A unifying theme in all of the research is the exploitation of reproducing kernel Hilbert space methods, combined with cross validation, unbiased risk and likelihood techniques.    The statistical and numerical methods being developed have applicability in several broad areas:  (1) to the analysis of complicated medical and demographic data sets for the purpose of risk factor estimation (2) to the analysis of very large environmental data sets with the goal of extracting and presenting the maximal amount of information available in the data set; particular emphasis is on application to climate change (3) to the improvement and better understanding of methods used in supervised machine learning, and (4) to the analysis of data that is obtained from dynamical systems such as the evolving atmosphere or ocean, and the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of mathematical models (such as numerical weather prediction or ocean models) that are used in the analysis of such data.",
