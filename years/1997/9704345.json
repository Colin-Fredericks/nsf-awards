The research   will focus on the development and application of dynamical systems   methods for nonlocal, nonautonomous and nondissipative systems. In the   area of nonlocal systems, the investigator proposes to study the effects of   nonlocal integral terms on the dynamics of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and   other partial differential equations. The proposed work in nonautonomous   systems will concentrate on the study of geophysical fluid particle motions.   In the area of nondissipative systems, the intended research is focused  on   dynamical behavior of the quasi-geostrophic equation and the rotating   shallow water equations.    The proposed research deals with complex problems in fluid systems,   especially geophysical fluid systems in the oceans and the atmosphere.   These problems are motivated by the need for better scientific   understanding of the environment or global change. The proposed research   is in the general area of differential equations and nonlinear phenomena.",
