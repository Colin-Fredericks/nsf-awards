 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702532  Hornbuckle  Deposition of persistent organic chemicals (POPS) from the  atmosphere to plant surfaces may control their fate and residence  time.  POPS, which include polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons, and organochlorine pesticides have an  affinity for plants due to the lipophilic nature of the compounds  and the waxy, lipid-like surfaces of leaves and needles.  Because  of this affinity, plants may act as sinks for atmospheric POPS.  Plants may also act a temporary 'resting points' for long-range  transport of the compounds from warmer regions to cooler regions  of the globe.  Whether vapor-phase POPs are taken up or released  by plants is expected to depend on characteristics of the  compound, the plant, and the local climate.    Theoretically, it has been predicted that temperature and POP  hydrophobicity should dominate vapor exchange.  In addition,  field data for ambient levels of POPs has indicated that relative  humidity and plant stomatal behavior may also play a role.  Research objectives in this study are to quantify the effect of  local temperature on POP vapor-plant surface exchange;  to  quantify the importance of relative humidity on POP vapor-plant  surface exchange; to determine to effect of UV radiation on  sorption of POPs to plant surfaces.      Experiments will be performed under controlled environmental  conditions in an environmental chamber populated with Ficus  benjamina, a common tree-like house plant.  Because of the size  of the chamber and its ability to reproduce environmental  conditions, the study provides a link between traditional  laboratory concentrations as a function of the three climate  surrogates.  The test chamber provides a unique facility for  atmospheric simulation, air pollution, cloud physics, and aerosol  research studies. The effect of climate surrogates on exchange of  gas-phase persistent organic chemicals with plant surfaces will  be examined in this chamber.  Climate surrogates include  temperature, relative  humidity, and ultra violet radiation.  Gas  phase POPs will be introduced from ambient air, in order to  measure, model and predict the dynamics at low concentrations,  and introduced via a gas-stream generation column.  ***",
