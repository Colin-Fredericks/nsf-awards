 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602939  Fernandez    This U.S-Mexico award will support Prof. Emmanuel Fernandez  of the University of Arizona in a research collaboration  with Prof. Rolando Cavazos Cadena of the Universidad  Autonoma Agraria in Saltillo, Mexico.  The investigators  intend to develop a collaborative program that integrates  innovative research activities and algorithmic software  development in stochastic control.  In particular, the  collaborators intend to pursue optimal decision and control  problems for controlled Markov models.    Discrete event stochastic dynamic systems (DESDS) constitute  a broad and interdisciplinary area of research at the  intersection of systems and control, operations research,  and knowledge-based systems.  The focus of DESDS research  are the complex, man-made systems that form the core of our  technological society, for example, telecommunications and  computer networks; production and manufacturing systems; and  military and service industry logistics.  A common feature  of many of the problems in the field attempts to obtain  rules for operating a system, which optimize an appropriate  performance measure, and which explicitly take into account  the stochastic and discrete event-driven nature of the  problems.  The proposed collaboration will bring together  experienced researchers with complementary skills: the  Mexican investigator is an expert on the mathematical and  probabilistic theory of stochastic control and the U.S.  investigator will contribute his skills in the engineering  and management applications of stochastic control models and  techniques, and in software development.  ***",
