This will make up the  earth sciences component in their renovated and expanded exhibit  area.  This section will include four related areas: 1) Plate  Tectonics, 2) The Earth's Amazing Climate System, 3) The Earth  Evolving Biosphere, and 4) An Ecological Whodunit.  Each area will  be anchored by an \"icon\" that will serve as a guiding image for  that exhibit and will be supported by a layered interpretation  using objects from the collection, workstations with selected  databases, simulated scientific investigations, and hot-links to  related Internet Sites.  Numerous interactives will highlight the  use of scientific research tools and methods.  A broad menu of  complementary educational activities will accompany the exhibit  including take-home activities for families; teacher enhancement  sessions and materials for students, and experiences for pre-  service teachers.  Cranbrook is working with the Detroit Public  Schools in their science reform effort supported by an NSF Urban  Systemic Initiative and with the Michigan Department of Education  through its NSF Statewide Systemic Initiative.  The exhibit  elements will support and reinforce the systemic reform efforts and  will be aligned with the science standards.",
