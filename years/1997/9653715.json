 "awd_abstract_narration": "The traditional presentation of mathematics and science requires that students reason their way to the connections between these fields.  This expectation is particularly challenging for many urban high school students and nontraditional college students. New York City Technical College, of the City University of New York, is building on its successes as a partner in CUNY's Alliance for Minority Participation and as a principal in the NYC Urban Systemic Initiative with a project that helps students make these connections and succeed.    The project team, including engineering technology, math and science faculty is revise the ten math and science courses in the core curriculum.  They are 1) explicitly identifying the mathematics and science connections in and among these courses; 2) developing problems that integrate science and math in experiential contexts and cultivating well-developed critical thinking skills; 3) identifying the most effective pedagogical strategies and technologies; 4) reviewing the sequencing of topics in the core mathematics, science, and introductory engineering technology courses students typically taken concurrently; 5) creating a database of common concepts and terminology, and 6) designing a program of training for full-time and adjunct faculty which includes video tapes.    This project is institution-wide, systemic and significant for much of the nation's higher education community, especially its technical colleges.",
