 "awd_abstract_narration": "With communication technology and the use of mentors, the   Disabilities, Opportunities, Inter-networking, and Technology   (DO-IT) program builds a communication network for disabled high  school students who would otherwise remain isolated and   segregated.  The network opens these students to new possibilities  in science, mathematics, and engineering and helps sustain them  through their high school and college academic experiences.   Another strength is the program's emphasis on developing college  faculty awareness of how the barriers and challenges for the  disabled can be overcome, contributing to a more positive and  diverse learning environment.  DO-IT has positively altered the  educational infrastructure by creating a self-sustaining community,  free from spatial constraints and creatively links new isolated   populations such as the Seattle Children's Hospital to its   communication network.  The strengths of the nominee include:        .  Innovative, strong and working.    .  Ninety percent of the participants have graduated from high       school and are pursuing post-secondary degrees.    .  Showcased in President's Summit for America's Future.      In summary, this nomination for the Presidential Awards for   Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring is  outstanding.  The program is innovative and timely.  The total  number of participants is not large but the level of quality is  high.",
