 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619163  Rudolph   To increase representation of females in science, engineering, and mathematics professions, Project Advance has been designed to improve classroom practices with respect to engaging and developing the interests of female students, primarily in science and mathematics classrooms, and to provide encouragement and role models for young women interested in these areas.  The project has three major components:  (1) K-12 teacher/ administrator training to address gender equity in the science and mathematics classroom; (2) elementary teacher training to improve the overall quality of science and mathematics instruction; and (3) a mentoring program for female secondary students.   The training targets administrators, secondary mathematics and science teachers, and all elementary teachers at the 44 campuses of the Central and Southwest management districts of the Houston Independent School District.  Mentoring will target female students interested in science/mathematics and will create a network of secondary and university students and female professionals from universities and other local institutions.  The anticipated outcomes include higher quality instruction in science and mathematics in an atmosphere that provides female students with opportunities to succeed from kindergarten to high school graduation and an institutionalized support network for female secondary students interested in science and/or mathematics.",
