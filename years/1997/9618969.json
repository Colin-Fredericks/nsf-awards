In addition the teachers would  receive training in leadership skills to enhance their roles as leaders in their home school building and districts.  This would be accomplished by selecting teams of from two to four teachers from the same school or district to attend a two week workshop followed by four-two day academic year sessions, a second one week workshop devoted to leadership in the second year with some additional follow-up during the second academic year. The project has projected a total of 56.5% of the award as cost sharing.",
