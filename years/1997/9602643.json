 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal Carolina University, located in Conway, SC, is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation and partial replacement of environmental chemistry laboratories.  Existing facilities in the Science Building are under stress due to a phenomenal growth in the number of students participating in the sciences.  Because the labs were not designed to accommodate a large number of student projects, adequate space has become the major impediment in expanding research activities for undergraduates in biology, chemistry, and marine science.  To increase the efficiency of space and time usage, the university has pledged to  modernize existing space for faculty and student researchers.  In conjunction to the reconfiguration of space, renovations will consist of:  upgrading electrical, plumbing and lighting systems, replacing aged fume hoods and water distiller, installing benches, cabinets and shelving, and  providing for gas cylinder and hazardous chemical storage.  Renovations will include additional safety stations and ensure space complies with ADA regulations.  Revitalized facilities will improve the department's availability to facilitate student research and will enhance collaborations between faculty and student researchers. Although the institution and science departments have been successful in increasing enrollments of female students, it is anticipated that this project will aid the university in its recruitment efforts to provide educational opportunities for minority students, including  prospects from minority families with no history of college matriculation.",
