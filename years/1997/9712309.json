By modifying  the conventional backlighting arrangement, through the use of novel phosphor materials, substantial advances in these directions are possible.  Standard backlit LCDs are known to have poor luminous efficiency and viewing angles.  The direct material costs of LCDs are high, which, when compounded with low production yields, have kept finished product prices high.  Despite this, the LCD is the most mature flat panel display technology commercially available.  The LCD has also captured the majority of the world's flat panel display market and consequently has the largest production capacity.  Therefore, there is a significant opportunity to improve the LCD. It is anticipated that these red phosphor materials will provide the basis for simultaneously improving the luminous efficiency by approximately 50%, maximizing the viewing angles, reducing direct material costs and improving production yields.         This technology will have applications in laptop and desktop computer displays, large-screen direct-view TV's, electronic billboards.  ***",
