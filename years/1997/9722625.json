 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722625  McCombe    This is a new project in which optically Detected Resonance (ODR)  spectroscopy,  which combines the sensitivity of near  IR/visible  photon  detection  with  far  IR  excitation,  will  be  used  to  investigate  basic  issues related to many-body  interactions  of  electrons  and  holes  in low-dimensional semiconductor  systems.  Intraband  electronic  excitations  of  very  low  densities   of  photoexcited  carriers and carrier complexes can be  investigated  in  this  way.   Specific projects include:  internal  states  of  neutral and charged excitons in high magnetic fields; effects  of  excess  electrons and holes on excitonic states  and  the  metal-  insulator  transition;  many  body effects  in  the  integer  and  fractional  quantum hall effect regimes through the influence  of  donor  impurities on the far IR excitations; and  ODR  echanisms.  This  research  will  yield  unique information  about  excitons,  effects  of  excess carriers on their internal states, mechanisms  of  energy  ransfer to the ground state recombination paths,  and  insight  into  the  any-body ground states of  electrons  at  low  temperatures and high magnetic fields.  %%%  This  is  a new project in which a novel technique that  combines  sensitive   near   infrared/visible   detection   with   resonant  absorption in the far infrared region of the spectrum,  Optically  Detected   Resonance  (ODR)  spectroscopy,  will   be   used   to  investigate the allowed energy states of charge carriers in small  (tens  of  nanometers)  man-made semiconductor  structures.   The  unique electronic and optical properties of these structures  are  determined  by  quantum  mechanics and the  interactions  of  the  charge  carriers, electrons or holes.  This research  will  yield  unique information about and improved understanding of the energy  states  of  electrons  and  holes bound together  (the  so-called  exciton), the effects of excess free electrons and holes on these  states,  and  how  e nergy absorbed in exciting the  electron-hole  system  is  transferred  back to the  lowest  energy  states  and  subsequently  leads  to recombination and light  emission.   This  work will also provide insight into the interesting many-electron  states  that exist at low temperature and in high magnetic field,  the Quantum Hall and Fractional Quantum Hall states.  ***",
