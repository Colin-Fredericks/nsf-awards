To test this hypothesis, the proposed collaborative research will collect and interpret observations on physical and biological features in the vicinity of the inner front to determine the availability of nutrients in the euphotic zone, the physical processes responsible for enhanced vertical flux of nutrients, primary production, the distribution, abundance and trophic ecology of near-surface swarms of euphausiids and other zooplankton, the distribution, abundance, and foraging ecology of shearwaters, and by stable isotope enrichment in trophic pathways from phytoplankton to shearwaters at and away from the front.  The proposed research is important because it will be the first examination of the physical processes of the inner front in post-bloom primary production, focus on the ecological role of this extended production, and relate the evolution of transequatorial migration patterns of seabirds to biophysical processes that create predictable sources of prey.",
