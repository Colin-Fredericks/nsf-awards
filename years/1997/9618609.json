 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. K.C. Chang, MS Tracy Hoffman will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct archaeological excavation at the site of Thanh Den which dates to the early Bronze Age (1500-1100 BC) and is located 40 km west of Hanoi. A small portion of the site was excavated in the early 1980s and this revealed the presence of a village settlement based on rice agriculture and metallurgical remains including molds for casting implements such as axes and spear points. It is one of a handful of sites in northern Vietnam which has yielded metallurgical remains. In collaboration with regional archaeologists, MS. Hoffman will expand research at Thanh Den. She will excavate an area of ca. 100 sq. meters which should be sufficient to determine the major activities that took place as well as to assess the amount of variability in cultural remains across the site. MS Hoffman will examine: 1. The extent and nature of bronze working at the site. This will include assessing whether bronze was imported in finished form or was locally produced; 2. The abundance and types of bronze as compared to other artifacts and whether bronze is restricted in spatial distribution across the site; 3. The presence and distribution of other types of `exotic` items which may indicate the existence of large scale trade networks. Research will be conducted in two phases. Six weeks will be spent excavating at Thanh Den in conjunction with field conservation and initial recording. This will be followed by two months of conservation and analysis in Hanoi.       Southeast Asia is an unusual area of the world in terms of the development of complex society. By the mid-second millennium BC, communities in Southeast Asia were practicing cereal cultivation (rice) and the production of copper and bronze. Despite the fact that these two conditions have been demonstrated to be important in the development of complexity in other parts of the world, in Southeast Asia it is only a thousand years later that the beginnings of social stratification and political centralization can be detected. Thus Southeast Asia may present an opportunity to develop new theories and models for the rise of complexity.       This research will produce widely used information on a region which, from an archaeological perspective, is poorly known; the results therefore will be of wide interest. The project will also assist in training a promising young scientist.",
