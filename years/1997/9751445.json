 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the purchase of backpack and hand-held Global Positioning Systems (GPS) receivers and related equipment.  These units upgrade the technology content of the field-based components in courses from the Departments of Geological Sciences and Geography.  A strong need exists to train students in data acquisition and navigation with GPS receivers, differential post-correction of GPS data with microcomputers, and GPS data acquisition for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) programs.  The need derives from the shift to gathering scientific field data with digital equipment rather than pencil and paper, and from employers requiring that potential geoscience applicants be well versed in this technology.    The two departments have joined in this proposal to (1) increase the number of students using the new equipment; (2) provide instructors who have used GPS equipment for different purposes; and (3) provide the university with a future basis for expanding field instruction with GPS units into courses in the biosciences and engineering.  The new equipment can be used in at least eight exercises, and in four courses that affect most juniors and seniors majoring in Geography, Geological Sciences, and Civil Engineering.  The students train in the use of different types of GPS receivers for determining position and navigating.  They are expected to determine the effectiveness of these different tools as a function of scale of mapping, ease of use, and accuracy.  Students are trained in differential post-correction calculations with microcomputers to demonstrate the improved accuracy in positioning and navigation with more advanced GPS receivers.  Students are also shown the uses of GPS data beyond just issues of position and navigation.  For example, they input data into GIS programs to construct geological maps with graphical databases, and input data into bitmap-based drawing programs to correct aerial photographic distortions.  *",
