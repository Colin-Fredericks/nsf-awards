S. participation in the   Fifth World Meeting of the International Bayesian Analysis   (ISBA) which will be held in Istanbul, Turkey during August   16-18, 1997. This meeting will be a satellite meeting for the   51st Session of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) in   Istanbul, Turkey during August 18-27, 1997. This meeting is   planned around the theme of linking Bayesian statistics to other   fields of science to stimulate cross-fertilization of theoretical,   methodological and computational research directions to meet   our societal needs by focusing attention to the arena of applied   problems in cross-disciplinary areas such as in computer science,   in engineering, in econometrics, finance, forensic and medical   sciences.     A primary goal of these funds is to present opportunities   for young researchers, international researchers, and   underrepresented groups, such as women and ethnic minorities and   persons with disabilities and graduate students an opportunity to   interact, to share, and to disseminate their research and   expertise with other researchers in many cross-disciplinary fields   in the international arena. Experts from several Western and Eastern   European countries, Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom,   Middle East, Russia, Independent States of the former Soviet Union,   India, Africa, and the United States are expected to attend.",
