To facilitate transfer to the classroom  teachers are expected to develop three Lesson Plans, to be used in  the Fall semester, based on the STRIVE experience.  This is  complemented by \"Knowledge Transfer\" meetings where they study  curriculum change for local schools and develop a STRIVE Team  Curriculum Change Report for their principal.  Additional follow-up  to facilitate transfer of the research experience to the classroom  is done through a 1-day STRIVE alumni workshop and participation in  4-mini-workshops.  The Arkansas-STRIVE program is a collaboration  among Arkansas business and industry, the University of Arkansas-  Little Rock, the Arkansas SSI, and the Arkansas Department of  Higher Education.",
