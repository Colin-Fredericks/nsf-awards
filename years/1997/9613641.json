 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Zlatko Bacic of New York University is being supported by   theTheoretical and Computational Chemistry program.  The project aims to   provide an accurate quantum mechanical description of the large amplitude   intermolecular vibrations and the intermolecular potential energy   surfaces of two hydrogen-bonded clusters, benzene-(H2O)n and (H2O)n, as   well as the ultraviolet photodissociation of H2O in argon clusters and   other rare gas matrices.  An efficient quantum 6D method will be   developed for the calculation of excited 6D intermolecular vibrational   eigenstates of a broad class of complexes between a large aromatic   molecule (e.g., benzene, naphthalene) and a small polyatomic molecule   such as H2O, NH3.  Vibrationally averaged structures and quantum   tunneling dynamics of larger benzene-water clusters will be explored   using a rigid-body quantum Monte Carlo method.  A methodology for   n-dimensional quantum calculation of the torsional energy levels and   far-infrared spectra of small (H2O)n (n=3-6) clusters will be developed   and extended to other intermolecular vibrations of the clusters.  Bound   state calculations of water and deuterated water clusters will   characterize their torsional vibrational dynamics, quantum number   assignments, and vibrationally averaged rotational constants.    Photodissociation of H2O in Ar_nH2O (n=1-12,54) clusters and rare-gas   matrices will be studied to gain an understanding of the mechanisms by   which the solvent modifies the photo-fragmentation dynamics of a   polyatomic solute (H2O), relative to that of the isolated gas-phase   molecule.  The photodissociation dynamics will be simulated using   classical trajectories, whereas the initial conditions will be generated   from the quantum 6D intermolecular eigenstates of the argon-water cluster   in the ground electronic state.    A quantitative understanding of the properties of, and processes in,   water and aqueous solutions ultimately depends on the detailed knowledge   of the water-water, water-solute, and solute-solute interactions.  The   quantum calculations of Professor Bacic for benzene-water and simple   water clusters are a tool for the determination of their intermolecular   potential energy surfaces from high-resolution spectroscopic data.  These   multidimensional potentials should allow characterization on a molecular   level of liquid water and water-benzene, systems which are of fundamental   and practical importance.  In addition, a deeper understanding will be   gained of the intricate dynamical properties of complex hydrogen bonding   networks, which shape the properties of condensed phases and biologically   important macromolecules.",
