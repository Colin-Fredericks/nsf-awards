 "awd_abstract_narration": "Endler  9700763         The proposed research addresses several key issues in  animal communication and signal design using wolf spiders of  the genus Schizocosa.  Building on strong evidence that male  wolf spiders have evolved  morphological and behavioral  traits used as signals during courtship, a series of  experiments will be conducted to examine 2 key factors in  shaping signal design:  (1) preexisting preferences for  signals (2) environmental constraints.  This study also  examines the importance of a motion-based visual display in  female preferences and signal efficacy.  To test the  influence of preexisting preference for signals, the  phylogenetic  relationships among Schizocosa spiders will be  determined using DNA sequence data.  By overlaying  morphological and behavioral traits (male signals and female  preferences respectively) onto the phylogenetic tree, it is  possible to determine the order in which they appeared  evolutionarily.  If signals used by males during courtship  evolved to qtimulate preexisting preference in females, the  female preference will precede the male trait on the tree.  In addition, a correlation between display and habitat  characteristics, independent of phylogenetic history, is  predicted if the environment plays a role in shaping signal  design.  Finally, be presenting females with 3-dimensional  animations of courting males, this research tests how  specific behavioral traits may influence female mate  preferences.",
