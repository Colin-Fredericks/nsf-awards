 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary  Incomplete contract theory is gradually becoming accepted as a useful way to understand the nature of organizations.  This project continues my work in this area. The project includes four main topics.  First, I investigate why parties typically contract bilaterally, rather than multilaterally, and what determines who contracts with whom.  For example, if someone wants a house built, they often will sign a contract with a general contractor, who in turn will contract with a plumber, an electrician, etc.  Why is this preferable to contracting directly with the plumber and electrician?  The second topic is a continuation of my work on entrepreneurial debt contracting.  So far my theoretical analysis has focused on a two-period relationship between an entrepreneur and an investor, although I have generalized the analysis to many periods, when there is perfect certainty.  In the current project I carry out a generalization to the case of many periods where there is uncertainty.  I also include a role for equity.  In the third topic, I continue my work on boundaries between public and private organizations.  In my work so far, I have developed a theoretical analysis of the choice between public and private ownership and applied the analysis to understand the case for prison privatization.  In the current project I extend the analysis to education and health care.  An important new intellectual issue that arises is the role of competition between providers in determining the choice between public and private ownership.  Finally, I conduct a theoretical analysis of the cooperative form.  Most commercial organizations are owned and controlled by people who do not work in them or consume their product.  Nonetheless, there are some important exceptions: for instance, in the service sector, partnerships or worker cooperatives are quite common; e.g., take the case of law firms. My work is an attempt to understand better the costs and benefits of cooperatives, and why cooperatives are so uncommon in the manufacturing sector.",
