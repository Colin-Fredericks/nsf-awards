 "awd_abstract_narration": "The small flowering plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, a member of       the mustard family, has become a model system for plant       biology. Its unique features allow it to be applied to a wide       variety of research problems, including plant physiology, the       molecular genetic study of organ development, and plant-       pathogen interactions. Arabidopsis has established itself in       this role for several reasons: its small size; short life       cycle; small genome size; low amount of repetitive DNA       sequences; and the relative ease with which it is manipulated       by molecular and genetic methods. The importance of       Arabidopsis to plant biology is increasing with the       international development of germplasm and DNA stock resource       centers, genetic and physical maps and their techniques, plus       expression sequence tag (EST, single pass cDNA sequences) and       genomic sequencing projects. Furthermore, because flowering       plants evolved recently, characterizing a gene in Arabidopsis       often simplifies the isolation of a corresponding gene in       another flowering plant.              This project will provide an electronic database containing       the genomic information for Arabidopsis thaliana including       convenient and correlated access to all published and       otherwise publicly available information about genes, their       products, their positions on the genetic and physical maps,       and their DNA sequences. Furthermore, this resource will       accommodate a diverse group of users, ranging from       Arabidopsis molecular biologists to other biologists whose       own research problems can take advantage of work conducted       using Arabidopsis. This database project will provide an       information resource on the Internet using the World Wide Web       using client and server software developed specifically for       genomic information presentation and analysis.              The primary mission of this project is to develop  a       scientific database using object-relational database       technologies as well as to develop an appropriate interface       through the WWW to the information needed by the worldwide       plant molecular biological community. The major product of       this project will be the creation of a database environment       which will validate and store information about physical and       genetic maps, DNA sequences and their features, plus cross-       references to the literature and detailed primary data.       Collaborations with the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI),       an international group of scientists working to determine the       complete DNA sequence of the Arabidopsis genome by the year       2004 have been developed to provide the plant biology       community with a easy access to the maps and sequence being       created around the world.",
