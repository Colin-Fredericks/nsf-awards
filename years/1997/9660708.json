 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Phase I project focuses on technology for prevention, control and rapid extinguishing of the earthquake-induced fires in urban regions and is particularly important in earthquake hazard mitigation.   The objective is to develop an Intelligent Prevention and Information System for Earthquake-Induced Urban Fires (IPIS-EF).  Earthquake hazards are serious threats and have caused heavy damage and casualties.  In addition to the shaking, the `fire` following an earthquake is a major cause for loss of lives and properties.  An earthquake has the potential for initiating a chain of events that can turn a moderately damaging seismic event into a holocaust of disasters.  IPIS-EF consists of three components:  (1) Automatic Shut-Down System(ASDS) for gas and electric power lines: ASDS is for prevention of the ignition of fires following earthquakes;  (2) Advanced Tele-Communication System (ATCS) for prompt and accurate report of fires: The recent advance of sensor and telecommunication technologies has lent the possibility to transmit information from sensors via satellite to the emergency response center almost instantaneously;  (3) Intelligent Expert System for Signal Process (IESP): the ATCS component provides prompt and accurate report of fires following a strong earthquake.  The remaining crucial point is the evaluation and interpretation of the fire signals properly.  IESP component will be developed to achieve this goal by using modern signal processing techniques.       The potential commercial applications of IPIS-EF are numerous.  Users of the system would include public agencies responsible for safety at all levels of government, and heavy equipment factories and industrial plants.  IPIS-EF can also be used for prevention and extinguishing of conventional, non-seismic induced fires.  This hi-tech product can also be exported to foreign countries in earthquake disaster prone cities and regions over the globe.  The commercialization of IPIS-EF can save lives and properties in both seismic and non-seismic regions and enhance the competitiveness of American business.",
