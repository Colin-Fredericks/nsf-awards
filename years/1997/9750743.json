 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project integrates design and manufacturing techniques in senior-level engineering and engineering technology courses.  The project's objective is to build an integrated design/manufacturing laboratory using industrial quality equipment so the students experience the complete product cycle from product inception through recycling the used product.  Topics covered by the courses using the new equipment include product inception based on customer needs; design requirements including function, service, and recycling issues; advanced product design using parametric solid modelers; building design models with a rapid prototyping system; using the models to refine the design; advanced manufacturing using computer numerical control machine tools and computer-aided programming systems; process control with modern coordinate measuring machines; and material reclamation systems when the product reaches the end of its useful life.  These topics are covered by having the students operate in teams to design and produce a real product.  New equipment includes a rapid prototyping machine with computer control and a CNC milling machine with tooling.  The equipment is shared between an Engineering and an Engineering Technology Department.  The new laboratory advances knowledge of the interaction between all phases of a product, from inception through re-use.  *",
