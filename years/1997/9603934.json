Aquatic      harps avoid freezing by hibernating underwater, but they  then must switch from      aerial to aquatic respiration, with its attendant  physiological challenges. However,      there have been no detailed physiological/ecological  studies of naturally      hibernating aquatic herps, and only two species, both  turtles, have been studied      extensively during simulated hibernation in the  laboratory. We propose to study      hibernation and overwintering in northern herps,  starting by expanding our      previous studies on turtles to include new species and  field work.      The field physiology and behavior of naturally  hibernating painted turtles,      map turtles, soflshelled turtles, and snapping turtles  from known northern      populations in New England will be studied by  radiotelemetric tracking.      Concurrently, laboratory studies of physiological  responses to simulated      hibernation will be conducted with all 4 species from  northern populations. Data      should allow generalizations about  physiological/ecological strategies concerning      this major portion of the life cycle of freshwater  turtles, lay the groundwork for      future studies of other harps, suggest general  strategies among herps for      overwintering, and provide information important to  conservation efforts.",
