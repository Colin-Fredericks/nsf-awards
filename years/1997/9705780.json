 "awd_abstract_narration": "Guckenheimer    9705780         The investigator studies dynamical systems with multiple    time scales as models of neural systems.  Data and models from a    small invertebrate neural network, the stomatogastric ganglion of    lobsters, guide the work and provide case studies.  Phenomena    observed in the stomatogastric ganglion, such as bursting    oscillations and spike frequency adaptation, can best be modeled    as dynamical systems with multiple time scales.  Previous    mathematical analyses of qualitative properties of multiple time    scale dynamical systems have dealt mainly with local phenomena    that occur in low dimensions.  The dynamics of neural systems    raise questions that are not addressed by existing theories of    multiple time scale systems.  The aim here is to extend the theory    by classifying qualitative features of the global dynamics and    bifurcations for systems with two time scales.  This is an    ambitious endeavor to extend theories of nonlinear dynamical    systems and singularly perturbed systems of ordinary differential    equations that have been developed over the past thirty years.    Using numerical investigations as a guide, the dictionary of    patterns that occur in this setting is described and their    analytical properties are characterized.  This work draws heavily    upon the theories of bifurcations of dynamical systems and models    of hybrid dynamical systems that combine continuous and discrete    components.  As needed, numerical algorithms are developed that    facilitate the simulation and analysis of multiple time scale    systems.  The initial emphasis of the mathematical work is upon    systems that have two slow variables and two fast variables.    Numerical investigations of conductance-based models for the    stomatogastric ganglion also are performed.  The results of these    studies are compared with data and used to guide the refinement    of the models.         Nervous systems of animals regulate and control muscular    activi ty such as locomotion.  Well developed theories enable the    construction of models for the electrical properties of nerve    membranes in these processes, but there is little understanding    of the dynamical principles used by organisms.  This project    investigates dynamical models of a small neural system consisting    of fourteen neurons that control rhythmic motions of the foregut    of lobsters.  This system is used because it is small enough that    unique properties of each neuron within the system have been    identified, but large enough that the network architecture of the    interactions among neurons is also important.  The system displays    a rich repertoire of rhythmic behavior.  The focus of this project    is on features of the behavior that involve different time    scales.  Mathematical theories have been successful at describing    universal properties of the dynamics observed in an astounding    array of physical and natural systems, but these theories need to    be extended to systems with more than one time scale.  The goal is    to construct classifications of dynamical patterns that are the    components from which the complex behaviors of neural systems are    formed.  Models of these systems are also complex.  Computational    investigations are required to predict their dynamical behavior.    This project seeks to implement algorithms that improve our    ability to extract useful information from the models and guide    the improvement of their fidelity.  Both the theoretical analysis    and the numerical methods that are developed encompass all models    of dynamical systems with multiple time scales and can be used    far beyond the context of the neural system that is the focus of    this study.",
