The UNOLS Office is the focal  point for planning, coordination and reporting of all UNOLS  activities.  It provides administrative staff services, prepares  and disseminates ship schedules, user requirements, analyses of  annual ship use, committee reports, new marine regulations and  other related information.  Support for special studies, the  Medical Advisory Service for ship's crews and scientists, travel  expenses by UNOLS Council members, committees and consultants is  also provided through the UNOLS Office.    This project will conduct the activities of the UNOLS Office  during the first year of a three year commitment to UNOLS Office  operations by five Federal agencies.  These agencies include: The  National Science Foundation, (Division of Ocean Sciences), The  Department of the Navy (Office of Naval Research), The U.S.  Department of Energy, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, and The U.S. Department of the Interior (U.S.  Geological Survey).    The UNOLS Office is located at the University of Rhode Island.   This project is under the direction of Mr. John F. Bash,  Executive Secretary, UNOLS.  ***",
