 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  96-31346  Dhar    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to build one marketable prototype of the self-humidified PEM (proton exchange membrane) fuel cell stack using the deposit of solubilized Nafion membrane as the electrolyte.  During the Phase I project, the feasibility of using this electrolyte was demonstrated in small single cells and one multi-cell stack.  The research objectives of the Phase II include the optimization of performance of self-humidified PEM fuel cells, operation of larger fuel cells, and design and operation of one 1 kW fuel cell stack.  The best possible fuel cell performance will be solubilized forms of electrolytes that can be used as proton exchange membranes in fuel cells.  Fuel cells will be operated with reactant combinations H2/air and H2/O2.  Emphasis will be given to the operation of fuel relationships, calculations of kinetic parameters, efficiencies of platinum utilization, and reactant cross-over currents.  Larger single fuel cells of areas up to 400 cm2 will be evaluated, and one multi-cell stack of capacity 200 W will be built and evaluated to gain experience at the level of a large cell stack performance, and other important issues such as effectiveness of manifolding, thermal and water management.  As the final outcome of this project, one 1 kW fuel cell stack will be designed and evaluated.  The anticipated results include the availability of developed technology for a high performance, simplified PEM fuel cell at substantial savings of the amount of electrolyte material, and a low cost alternative energy source.  The PEM fuel cell will be most suitable for use in electric vehicles.  The fuel cell will be equally suitable as a power source for use in homes, various industries, defense applications, and space missions.  As a standby power source the fuel cell will be useful for the utility and remote site operations.  The proposed project will make the fuel cell simplified and cost effective- important criteria for commerc ial viability.  ***",
