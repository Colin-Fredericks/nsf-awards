 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618865  Fisher   In 1999, the Educational Testing Service will change the programming language used in its computer science advanced placement test, from Pascal to C++.  This presents a singular opportunity:  most of the approximately 1,500 teachers of advanced placement computer science (APCS) courses will need to seek training in C++ as well as in appropriate pedagogy for the new language and its object-oriented style of programming.  This project seeks to develop a summer program that combines this retooling with training in gender equity issues and practices that will enable teachers to recruit and retain female students in computer science.  It also provides them with the tools needed to disseminate this knowledge to their colleagues.  APCS courses represent a particularly salient opportunity to increase women's participation in computer science since girls tend to be well represented in early computing courses, but continue to advanced courses in far smaller numbers than boys.  By integrating gender equity activities with needed training offered by an internationally prominent computer science department with close ties to the Advanced Placement program, we expect to attract a substantial fraction (nearly 20 percent) of APCS teachers, who are key players in high school computing education nationwide.  By presenting gender equity practices in the specific context of the computer science classroom, we expect to make their transition to practice by program participants especially effective, as well as to attract male teachers in equal proportion with female teachers, a goal that is seldom achieved in training programs focused solely on gender issues.   A substantial and permanent increase in the number of high school girls who elect and pass the Advanced Placement Computer Science course at their schools is expected.  Since this course and its instructors tend to hold positions of prestige at their schools, we also expect a substantial secondary impact whereby the climate and pedagogy of all  computing courses in participant districts' high schools are improved.",
