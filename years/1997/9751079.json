 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides support for equipment to improve and enhance instruction in a previously existing molecular genetics laboratory.  The new equipment can also be used to introduce new laboratories in cell and molecular biology in two core curriculum courses that are required of all biology majors (Modern Biology Laboratory) and many nonmajors (Principles of Biology II).  The Molecular Genetics course is designed to introduce students to current theories, techniques, and methodologies in cell and molecular biology.  A major limitation of this course is the lack of sufficient equipment for a large class.  Class size is currently limited to six students.  The new equipment allows 10 to 12 additional students to perform laboratory work simultaneously.  Key pieces of equipment allow students' exposure to additional experiments and techniques.    The equipment can also be used to enhance laboratories in other courses.  Some basic cell and molecular laboratories can be incorporated into two core curriculum courses.  These two courses affect both majors and nonmajors.  Other courses affected include Cell Physiology and Special Topics in Biology (independent student research).  Finally, the equipment can also be used in the department's outreach program for high school teachers and high school students.  New equipment includes an ultraviolet spectrophotometer, a refrigerated, high-speed centrifuge, electrophoresis apparati, microcentrifuges, micropipettors, a shaking waterbath, and a PCR thermocycler.",
