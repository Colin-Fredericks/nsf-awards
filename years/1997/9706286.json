 "awd_abstract_narration": "Early computers fetched data from memory only after it had been requested by the  processor.  When memory latency is high, this demand fetch policy also has high  latency.  Many modern computers prefetch data from the memory before it is  requested, which can reduce the latency of memory as long as the prefetching is  accurate, and timely.    This project is a preliminary investigation of a Markov prefetcher, which uses  a Markov model to predict subsequent memory references from earlier references.   The prefetcher acts as an interface between on-chip and   off-chip caches that predicts multiple references to the memory system and  prioritizes their delivery to the processor.  Cycle-level simulations show that  use of a Markov prefetcher reduces the overall execution stalls due to memory  operations by about 54% while also reducing memory usage.    This project is extending the initial investigation to provide more realistic  analysis of the effectiveness of Markov prefetching, reduce implementation costs,  and apply the technique to multiprocessor systems. In addition, new aspects of  prefetching are being examined, including prediction of access methods (read or  write), prefetching between processors, and prefetching between different levels  of the memory hierarchy.  The primary research method is cycle-level simulation.",
