Because of this, movements may vary  from time to time to support the behavior in an appropriate  way. It is now clear that the nervous system networks that  underlie rhythmic behaviors can each produce a variety of  outputs, allowing for this flexibility. These changes in  output are largely controlled by chemicals called  neuromodulators, which are released from nerve cells. There  are many such neuromodulators, each of which can alter  behavior in different ways. This project investigates how  nervous system output, and hence rhythmic movements, are  altered when several neuromodulators are present in the  system at the same time, as well as the how such  neuromodulators can alter the way nerve cells communicate  with each other over a long time period. These studies  increase the understanding of the roles of central nervous  system chemical substances in generating behavioral  flexibility on a number of levels, as well as increasing the  understanding of the way the brain controls rhythmic  movements so that they are most appropriate for a given  situation. Such movements are fundamental to such important  behaviors as walking, hand movements, speech, and visceral  functions.",
