 "awd_abstract_narration": "9752998  Ledley  The ENSO cycle is the largest recognized source of  interannual climate variability on a global scale.  Recent  work has shown that there is a statistically significant  relationship between the ENSO signal observed in the  tropical Pacific Ocean and the sea surface temperature and  sea ice concentration in the Ross Sea of Antarctica.  This  work will be extended in this program in which we will  develop a true student-scientist partnership between high  school students and the PI to investigate the extent to  which the ENSO affects the climate of the polar oceans.  In  the first phase of the project students will be introduced  to the various components of the Earth system and the  phenomena they will be investigating.  In the second phase  students will begin by finding data about the climate in the  polar oceans.  They will, with the PI, determine the quality  of the data and its appropriateness for use in the study.  Data will be examined spatially and spatially averaged over  the polar oceans to produce time series.  The spatial  analysis will be used to look for patterns of change, and  the time series will be compared to the ENSO record to  determine the relationships that exist between the ENSO  record and the climate of the polar ocean regions.",
