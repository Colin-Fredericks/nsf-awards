 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to write a history of the engineering  profession in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).  The  investigation focuses on the professional ethos and social  identities of East German engineers, as well as on the ways in  which the state remolded the engineering profession after 1949  and used it to pursue its own technological and economic goals.  Though revolutionary changes took place in the engineering  profession after 1949, the professional ethos of many GDR engineers  was still framed by a memory of what the engineering profession  had been up to 1945 and what it still was in West Germany.  Drawing on archival materials, interviews, and sociological  studies conducted in the GDR, the study will examine five main  themes:  (1) the recruitment, education and deployment  of engineers;   (2) professional concerns, such as earnings,  professional power, career placement, and on-the-job training;  (3) the actual work experience of engineers, particularly in  research and development;  (4) the relationship between the  engineer and the Socialist Unity Party;  (5) the social ties,  status, and family life of engineers.  Throughout, the analysis  will be informed by an awareness that, despite official efforts  to ensure equality for women, those of working-class origins,  and young people, that such characteristics continued to be  important determinants of power, authority, and status.",
