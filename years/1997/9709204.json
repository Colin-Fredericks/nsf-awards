 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Abstract  The usual justification for patents is that R&D decisions should be delegated to agents who are informed, namely, to firms that know the costs and benefits of their research programs better than the government does. Though compelling, this is hardly a conclusive defense of patents. Patents are a crude form of decentralization with many defects. They lead to monopoly pricing, encourage inefficient patent races (and perhaps efficient ones), permit duplication of research efforts, and do not encourage firms to share their private information on whether a particular research line is promising. Further, patents do not give firms an incentive to delegate research to the most efficient firms.  Alternative funding mechanisms that researchers have discussed include grants funded out of general revenue, prizes for specific accomplishments, and direct reimbursement of costs ex post. Like patents, all these solutions have defects, mostly arising from asymmetries of information and from the divergence between private and social incentives.  Most investigations of R&D incentives take the basic features of patent law as given. In particular they take as given that patents will be the primary incentive mechanism. The research described here starts from the other end of the problem. It takes seriously that firms have better information on the costs and benefits of R&D than the government has, but does not concede that patents are the obvious incentive instrument.  Following techniques in the now voluminous literature on mechanism design, the investigator develops a mechanism which (i) supports R&D if and only if it is efficient conditional on all the private information possessed by the firms, (ii) avoids patents, (iii) delegates research to the least-cost firm(s), and (iv) extracts all the surplus from the firms except that which is necessary to induce them to reveal their costs. The last point means that although some profit is lost because firms must be induced to reveal their costs, no additional profit is lost because firms must also reveal their private information on the value of the R&D project.  However the investigator also conjectures that there is a more limited role for patents in ensuring that the efficient mechanism has a unique equilibrium. Patents that serve this role can be arbitrarily short.",
