 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Maitland Jones, Jr. is supported by the Organic Dynamics   Program for his studies of reactive intermediates.  Professor Jones, of   the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University, uses   hydrocarbon-based precursors to carbenes in order to avoid interference   in subsequent chemistry by the more-commonly used nitrogen-based carbene   precursors and to assess the importance of such precursor chemistry in   previously studied reactions.  Formation of sterically-stabilized   bridgehead alkenes through the ring expansion of 1-norbornylcarbenes and   carbene interconversions via `zipper` mechanisms are also under   investigation.  Analogous zipper reactions of carboranylcarbenes will be   explored as a rational route for the synthesis of silicon-containing   carboranes, and mechanistic and synthetic studies will be carried out for   1,2-dehydro-o-carborane.  Professor Maitland Jones, Jr., of the Department of Chemistry at   Princeton University, with the support of the Organic Dynamics Program,   studies the formation and chemistry of highly reactive compounds known as   carbenes.  These compounds contain a central carbon atom to which only   two bonds to other atoms are present, in contrast to the more commonly   found four bonds.  Although carbenes have been studied for some time, it   has recently been determined that many of the reactions claimed to lead   to their formation in fact do not give rise to simple carbenes but rather   to materials still incorporating portions of their precursor molecules.    Professor Jones has developed a synthetic route which provides for the   unambiguous formation of carbenes and allows the exploration of their   reaction chemistry unencumbered by the complications of precursor   chemistry.  Given their instability, carbenes often form relatively   high-energy products, including molecules displaying patterns of chemical   bonds often assumed to be impossible to obtain.  These studies advance   our fundamental understanding of carbenes as reactive intermediates,   adding to our understanding and potential control of a wide variety of   significant chemical transformations.",
