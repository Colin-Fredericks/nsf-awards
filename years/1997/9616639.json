 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Katharina Schreiber, Mr. John Kantner will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He wishes to address a central anthropological question of how complex societies arise. Since this phenomenon has been observed in many parts of the world and appears to have occurred independently in each, understanding of this process should increase our understanding of the basic principles which underly social organization and social change. Considerable research on the prehistory of the Southwestern United States has shown that over time small egalitarian groups increased in size and transformed into socially stratified hierarchical societies. Anthropologists have offered several hypotheses to explain this process. One set of theories focus on the principle of `adaptation` and see this development as a means to respond to a changing and unpredictable environment. Another set envisions this outcome as the result of political competition in which opposing groups work to increase their own power each other's expense.  Mr. Kantner argues that this question can most effectively be examined at the level of regional system rather than individual archaeological site and it is this latter approach which has most often been employed. He has constructed a data base for the Chaco Anasazi area of New Mexico, has hypothesized the patterns predicted by each model and is currently employing GIS analysis to study a large body of material. NSF support will supplement this research through the chemical analysis of ceramic materials selected from a series of sites. It is important to understand whether or not the Chaco settlements were integrated into a larger cooperative unit or whether competition among them was the norm. Through compositional analysis it is possible to determine the sources of clay and on this basis determine the relative degree of interaction.  This research is important for several reasons. It will increase our understanding of how complex societies develop and shed new light on the prehistory of the United States. It will also assist in training a promising young scientist.",
