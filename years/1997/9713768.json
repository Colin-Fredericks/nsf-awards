 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the development of an integrated framework that supports information integration of multiple sensors for rapid surface digitization and agile metrology of high precision engineered mechanical components.  The objective is to develop an information integration technology that facilitates rapid acquisition of high precision coordinate data, and to demonstrate the developed technology using an integrated system.  This integrated system consists of a high precision coordinate measuring machine, a motorized probe, a high speed laser scanner, and a 3D vision system.  An intelligent information aggregation module for sensor fusion and feature recognition will be developed.  In this module, high level geometric abstractions will be extracted from discrete coordinates.  When CAD models are unavailable, the resulting geometric abstractions form a preliminary description of the surface geometry and feature topology of an unknown object. The obtained information is subsequently used to guide the laser scanner and/or the contact probe for high speed coordinate data acquisition and to strategically control the coordinate measuring machine for high precision/rapid sampling of critical surface areas.  By integrating the developed technology with the state of the art equipment, a highly automated, high speed, high precision, 3D coordinate acquisition system will be developed.       Rapid acquisition of high precision coordinate data from parts having complex geometry has many applications.  Typical examples include part localization and automatic calibration in inspection and agile machining, coordinate metrology in dimensional control, and reverse engineering in rapid product design and realization.  The primary goal of this work is to develop the required knowledge and technology that support multi-sensor integration and information automation in the context of rapid surface digitization and agile metrology.  If successful, the results of this research will lead to significant improvements in sensor integration and precision metrology.  It will have potential applications in a whole spectrum of manufacturing problems with a major impact on metrology, inspection, and reverse engineering.",
