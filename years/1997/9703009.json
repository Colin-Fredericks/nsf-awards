 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, aims to use state-  of-the-art scanning probe techniques to study the dynamics of ion  channel conformation changes at the single protein level.   Professor Dunn and his students at the University of Kansas will  use near-field scanning optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy  and confocal microscopy to study the mechanism of action of ion  channels to better understand a broad range of neurophysiological  processes.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be introduced  to and involved in the work supported by the CAREER research  project both in the laboratory and in the classroom.  The understanding of neurological processes that occur at ion  channels in membranes has been limited by the lack of methods to  see these processes while they occur.  Professor Dunn will use  newly developed methods to observe these reactions in real time at  the single molecule level.  The insights provided by this work have  potential impact in understanding a broad range of neurochemical  areas.  The research and educational objectives of this CAREER  proposal will have high pedagogical impact due to the application  of state-of-the-art methods to the study of these problems.",
