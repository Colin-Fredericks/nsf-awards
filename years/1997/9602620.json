 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR), founded as the Missouri School of  Mines in 1870,  is one of four universities in the University of Missouri System.  Officially designated as Missouri's technological university, the institution has been recognized as one of the best undergraduate engineering schools in the country.  Part of the tradition of excellence is reflected in the Electrical Engineering Department's research and training programs.  Faculty and students, including both graduate and undergraduate, actively conduct research in the fields of:  Power Systems, Electric Machines, Devices and Power Electronics; Electro-magnetic Compatibility; Digital Devices; Controls; Communications and Signal Processing; Optical Systems; and Solid State Devices.  However, current conditions of the Electrical Engineering Building, constructed in 1959, are less than optimal to support research activities.  Infrastructure utilities are inadequate, better facilities for communication network cabling are needed, and the building does not comply with current safety and ADA regulations.  The National Science Foundation and UMR will form a partnership to improve existing research space for research personnel in the Engineering Building.  Funds will be used to renovate experimental, computer, and undergraduate research facilities. Modernizing research space for undergraduates will encourage more to participate in research, stimulating students to pursue graduate studies in engineering.   In addition to providing a safe working environment, and increasing research productivity, the project will assist the Department in its efforts to recruit new faculty.",
