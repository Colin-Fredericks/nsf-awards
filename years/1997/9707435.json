 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Jean Chmielewski, Department of Chemistry, Purdue University is   supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Program of the Chemistry   Division under a Career Advancement Award to enhance her research   expertise in the area structural elucidation using heteronuclear NMR   techniques.   The interactions leading to the aggregation of five   amphiphilic alpha helical peptides, rather the expected four monomeric   units, and the unexpected formation of a 1:1 complex between synthetic   helical peptide monomers in solution are accessible by heteronuclear NMR.     Professor Chmielewski is a highly competent PI, and a sabbatical year   spent in the laboratories of investigators at the forefront of protein   structure elucidation by heteronuclear NMR will maintain her position at   the cutting edge of the protein assembly field.  Proteins and peptides are large, flexible molecules whose properties in   fluid solution are determined by the molecular structure and aggregation   of the monomeric subunits.   Heteronuclear NMR offers a means to   elucidate the structure of these molecules, and to probe the interactions   resulting in aggregation of the monomeric subunits in fluid solution.     Professor Chmielewski has embarked on a successful academic career, and   expertise in heteronuclear NMR will allow her to continue a very   promising research program.",
