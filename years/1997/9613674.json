The BLB houses one of the largest collections of recorded animal sounds in the world, containing approximately 23,200 recordings of over 1000 species of animals. A current catalog is available for browsing by Internet. The BLB is also a center of active research by faculty, staff, and students on animal sounds. This project will copy the entire collection to digital compact disc (CD-R), and restore and duplicate (if necessary) analog tapes of animal sounds; these copies will then be stored in the University archive.  Having the sounds in the new digital format will enable Internet transmission of the sounds, make possible the integration of audio and text data in a common file structure, and assist with rapid retrieval of requested sounds, as well as assuring permanence of the collection by enabling cloning of the data into newer digital formats as these become available. The OSU is partnering with the NSF in funding this project by purchasing a number of equipment items needed for the work being funded by this award.",
