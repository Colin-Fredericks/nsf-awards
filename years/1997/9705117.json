In  these  oxides,  the  large  magnetoresistance near the ferromagnetic transition  temperature,  Tc,  is now attributed to a novel coupling between magnetism, the  electron  system and local lattice distortions and, in  a  recent  paper,  we  have  shown  that  the transition  from  metallic  to  insulating behavior correlates well with a rapid increase in  the  amplitude  of  the  local distortions which are  believed  to  be  polaronic in origin.  However, the nature, symmetry and extent of  the  atomic  displacements are not yet known and are  needed  for  modeling these unusual transport effects.  XAFS measurements as a  function  of  temperature and magnetic field will  enable  us  to  probe  the details of the local structural distortions about  the  metal atoms and provide this crucial information.  %%%  This  is  a  new  project  which proposes X-Ray  absorption  fine  structure  (XAFS)  measurements on systems such  as  La1-xCaxMnO3  which   exhibit  novel features in their magnetic and  electrical  behavior  that appear  to be related to the atomic  structure  of  the   material.   Recent  theoretical  models  suggest  that  the  arrangement of the atoms become distorted at the same temperature  at  which  the magnetic properties disappear and it is  suggested  that  these distortions contribute to the large observed increase  in  the   resistance  to  the flow of  electrical  current.   Our  initial  study  supports  such a model,  but  details  about  the  arrangements of the atoms are not yet known.  We will  use  x-ray  absorption   techniques to investigate the  distortions  about  a  given atom at various temperatures and magnetic fields.  We  need  to  determine  which  atoms  are  distorted  and  the  range  and  magnitude   of the distortions to test and improve the  models  of  this  unusual  behavior.   This  novel  connection  between   the  microscopic  atomic  arrangement and  the  electrical  properties  involves new physics and may lead to new applications since  such  materials are potentially useful to make devices for reading  and  writing information on computer disk.  ***",
