 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603216  Hungerford    This award supports a three-year collaborative research  project between Professor Ed V. Hungerford of the University  of Houston and Professor Osamu Hashimoto of Tohoku  University in Sendai, Japan.  The researchers will undertake  an investigation of light hypernuclei by pion, kaon, and  photon beams.  The goal of the collaboration is to  selectively study S=-1 and -2 light hypernuclei.  They will  concentrate their investigation on those aspects of  hypernuclear physics which better elucidate unsolved  problems in hadronic many-body physics.    This collaboration requires close working relations between  theorists and experimentalists, which has been one of the  traditional strengths of this field.  The researchers plan  to take advantage of the fact that a number of new  experimental facilities have just been, or will soon be  commissioned, for the study of nuclei embedded with strange  hyperons.  These facilities should provide new, more precise  information thus anticipating a major advance in this field.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project  will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote  international understanding and cooperation.  ***",
