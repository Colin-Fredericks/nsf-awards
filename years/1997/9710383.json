 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mark Keil and Gregory A. Parker of the University of Oklahoma are   supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue   their investigations on state-to-state reaction dynamics for various   simple reactions:  (i) fluorine atoms plus hydrogen dimer to form   hydrogen fluoride; (ii) fluorine atoms and hydrogen chloride to form   hydrogen fluoride and chlorine atoms; (iii) chlorine atoms and hydrogen   bromide to form hydrogen chloride and bromine atoms.  The reaction of   interest takes place at the intersection of two crossed molecular beams.    A high-resolution chemical laser in conjunction with a bolometer detector   is then used to resolve the scattered product vib-rotational state and   angular distribution.  The PIs will explore the effects of varying   initial rotational and kinetic energies, and isotopic substitutions, upon   the vibrationally and rotationally state-resolved differential cross   sections.  Direct comparisons will be made with ab initio theoretical   dynamical calculations using quantum scattering codes developed by the   co-PI.    The principal goal of these studies is to deepen our understanding of   chemical reaction dynamics at the detailed state-to-state level.    Tremendous theoretical progress is currently being made using   approximation techniques for simplifying increasingly complex chemical   reactivity problems.  The validity of approximations used in such quantum   calculations is often based upon experience with tri-atomic A+BC systems   of the sort studied here:  detailed investigations of A+BC systems have   provided the foundation upon which larger systems can be understood.  The   field of detailed chemical reaction dynamics is helping elucidate   chemical reactivity very broadly, with obvious relevance to all branches   of chemistry.",
