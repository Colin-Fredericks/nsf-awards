Fortes, Jose  Oregon Graduate Institute and Purdue University     CISE Special Project: Understanding the Role of International Collaboration in Computer Science and Engineering    This proposal requests support for a workshop that will examine the   importance of international collaboration in computer science and   engineering. The workshop is motivated in part by the dramatic growth  of the Internet and advances in information technologies that are causing   profound changes in the way scientists learn about the world, conduct   research, and collaborate with each other.  As we move toward a single   global economy and a single, integrated scientific enterprise, it is   important to assess the mechanisms, institutions and policies that   support international collaboration in computer science and engineering.   The proposed workshop will bring together members of the computer science   and engineering community and government representatives to discuss the   benefits and risks of international collaboration, identify existing   opportunities, and discuss ways to serve the needs of the computer and   information science and engineering community as globalization proceeds.   The expected outcome of the workshop is a report that will summarize   these discussions, and recommend ways to advance knowledge and technology   through more effective international collaboration.",
