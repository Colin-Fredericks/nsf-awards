This award supports continued  research on the chronology of ice retreat from the western Ross  Sea and an  extension of areal coverage for this research to include the  eastcentral Ross Sea.  The study will use a series of piston,  Kasten, and grab samples from research cruises in 1994 and 1995  on the RVIB N.B. Palmer by researchers from Rice University,  University of Colorado, Boulder, and Hamilton College.  Various  physical and biological parameters of the cores will be used to  map changes in the environments over time with a concentration  on sediment properties, foraminifera, and diatoms.  At this  time, ninety-two carbon-14 dates (plus 18 pending dates, all  based on acceleratormass-spectrometry) have been obtained from  cores collected prior to 1994 and from the 1994 and 1995 cruises  by the research groups at Hamilton College and the University of  Colorado, Boulder. Emphasis will be placed on obtaining  additional radiocarbon dates supplemented by several other  chronological methods including: sources and ages of volcanic  ashes, uranium-series dating of solitary corals, and amino acid  racemization.  The three major research questions are:  1) What  was the position of the grounding line during the Last Glacial  Maximum from the western to east-central Ross Sea and what was  the timing of retreat from this limit, was it synchronous across  the region, and what was the rate of retreat ?  2) Is there  evidence from the history of carbonate accumulation on the outer  shelf banks, and from cores on the slope of the Ross Sea that  the  ice was grounded on the shelf break at some time prior to  marine isotope stage (MIS) 2, possibly at MIS 4 (Goodwin,  person. commun. 1996)?  3) What are the paleoenvironments in the  areas of the Ross Sea at the millenial/century time-scales  during the latest Pleistocene and the Holocene? In particular,  what is the history of changes in surface water productivity and  sea ice extent?",
