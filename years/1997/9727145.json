 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727145  Wiley  This project will combine approaches of biochemical  engineering, cell biology, and molecular biology to increase  the quantitative understanding and manipulation of growth  factor/receptor dynamics at both the cell and tissue level.  Work will focus on the dynamics of autocrine growth factor  signaling, particularly with respect to the spatial  regulation of ligand release and receptor occupancy.  A  major goal in this direction will be to determine whether  autocrine ligands provide information to cells regarding  their tissue \"community\" as opposed to their local  microenvironment, and how physico-chemical parameters  influence this information.  Work will also continue to  build on current models of receptor trafficking to include  new experimental information about the sorting compartment,  and to extend these models to incorporate key components of  related signal transduction pathways.  This will allow a  quantitative evaluation of the effects of altered receptor  trafficking on signaling pathways underlying previous  studies of cell proliferation responses.  Understanding  these sorts of integrated dynamical influences on growth  factor signaling will continue to generate a rational basis  for the design of improved pharmacological growth factor  mimics or antagonists.  By using the human epidermal growth  factor/receptor system transfected into defined cell lines,  tools for molecular biology such as monoclonal antibodies,  site-directed receptor mutants, and recombinant site-  directed ligand variants can be used for biochemical  engineering purposes.  The work for the new grant period has  been organized into three specific aims which are designed  to facilitate the understanding of receptor and ligand  dynamics in growth factor regulation of cell function.  ***",
