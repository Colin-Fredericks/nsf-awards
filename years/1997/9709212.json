 "awd_abstract_narration": "9709212  Packer  This project will analyze the extent to which male and  female lions invest in the survival of offspring.  Under most  conditions, male lions compete for food with the rest of their  pride, but resident males provide important defense against extra-  group males.  Pridemates forage apart and males spend  considerable effort trying to relocate the females and young.  Females should be most likely to reveal their whereabouts to  resident males when their cubs are in greatest need of protection  from infanticidal strangers but least helpful when feeding  competition would be most intense.  Females are also expected to  weigh the relative reproductive value of successive broods  according to the vulnerability of their younger cubs, being more  likely to resume exclusive investment in their older brood when  the  younger brood is virtually doomed.  Because male parental  investment is so important to cub survival, this research is  directed at  examining factors related to male-female cooperation and mating  behaviors, and includes a series of mate-choice and intruder-  simulation  experiments. Females are predicted to prefer to mate with males  with larger or darker manes, whereas males should preferentially  attack strangers with shorter or lighter manes.  The study will  investigate whether the mane is a condition-dependent trait, and  will  examine a variety of nutritional and hormonal factors that are  likely to contribute to variability in mane size and color.  Studies will  be conducted in the field at the NSF Long-Term Ecological Research  site in the Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Results of this  research will  allow a better understanding of the evolutionary factors  underlying the  complex social behavior of lions.",
