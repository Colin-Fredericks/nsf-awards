 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with the dynamics and control of  complex mechanical systems, and addresses the order  reduction problem associated with a large set of ordinary  differential equations having periodic coefficients. A new  approach in the design of controllers for large-scale  general dynamic systems with periodically varying  coefficients is suggested. The idea is based on the fact  that all quasi-linear periodic systems can be replaced by  similar systems whose linear parts are time invariant via  the well-known Liapunov-Floquet (LF) transformations. A  general technique for computation of the LF matrices for  large-scale systems is presented. Hence, the control problem  associated with linear systems with periodically varying  coefficients is transformed to a time-invariant form. The  time invariant equations are then used to develop control  strategies for the time variant systems. Next, the problem  of controller design for nonlinear systems with periodically  varying parameters is addressed. It is proposed that the  `time-dependent normal form` theory be used to simplify the  quasi-linear systems resulting from the L-F transformations.  For the non-critical cases (where the real parts of the  eigenvalues of the linear part of the system are nonzero),  the designs can be achieved via normal form transformations.  In the event when linear part contains a critical  uncontrollable mode, the control system design is pursued  through an application of the `center manifold' theory and  suitable Liapunov control functions. The practical  significance of this study is demonstrated through  applications to some typical problems including the  controller designs for an asymmetric magnetic rotor-bearing  system, columns and plates subjected to periodic loads.  Large models using finite elements are constructed for these  problems and the control algorithm are implemented on the  reduced order systems.",
