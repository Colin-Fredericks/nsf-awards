 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714161  Kastings    The project involves theoretical modeling of the effect of methane  and CO2 ice clouds on martian paleoclimate.  Early Mars appears to  have been warm and wet, yet existing climate models, which assume  a C02-H20 atmosphere, have been unable to explain this.   Preliminary calculations show that the addition of ~1% CH4 to the  martian paleoatmosphere could have brought the mean global surface  temperature above the freezing point of water early in the planet's  history.  Most of the warming is caused by the absorption of  incoming solar radiation at visible and near-infrared wavelengths.   Methane has a complex band structure in this wavelength region that  needs to be accurately parameterized in order to do the climate  calculation properly.  C02 ice clouds also need to be included in  the computer model to determine their effect on the planetary  radiation balance.  Calculations with an atmospheric photochemical  model suggest that a CH4 mixing ratio of 1% by volume could have  been maintained if there was a source of methane at the martian  surface comparable in magnitude to the present biological flux of  methane on Earth.  Such a source could, in principle, have been  provided by methanogenic bacteria living on the surface of early  Mars or within basaltic rocks.  The recent identification of  possible fossilized bacteria in the martian meteorite ALH84001 is  entirely consistent with this scenario.  Finding a solution to the  early Mars climate problem would help us to better understand Mars'  history and may have implications for the prevalence of life on  other planets both within and beyond our own Solar System.
