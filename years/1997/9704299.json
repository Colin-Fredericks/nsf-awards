 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704299  Basov      This award is provided to develop a submillimeter  spectrometer operating at He-3 temperatures for the studies  of fundamental properties of novel materials.  Experimental  methods of infrared and optical spectroscopy are extremely  informative in condensed matter science.  However, usually  these methods do not permit to perform measurements at  frequencies below 30-50 cm-1 and at temperatures below 6-12  K.  An immediate consequence of these common restrictions is  the existence of a vast unexplored territory of new  materials phenomena which lie beyond the scope of routine  spectroscopic techniques.  Instrumental prerequisites for  the experimental study of these phenomena include the  ability to reach frequencies as low as 2-3 cm-1 while  keeping the specimens at T down to 0.3 K.  Development of  the facility that meets the above stringent requirements is  the primary goal of this proposal.    The initial research project will be devoted to one of the  forefront problems of condensed matter physics which is  Unconventional Conductivity and Superconductivity in  Intermetallic Compounds.  The exotic transport properties of  intermetallic materials pose fundamental questions which  challenge the foundation of the theory of metals.  Currently  several groups at the UCSD physics department are involved  in the study of intermetallic systems with strongly  correlated electrons.  This spectroscopic program will  greatly enrich the joint research capabilities by extending  measurements in the infrared region where the effects due to  interactions and correlations dominate the response of these  correlated systems.    An infrared facility described in this project will provide  the means to launch experiments which were previously  impossible because of instrumental limitations.  In  particular, super-conducting state electrodynamics has not  been explored in heavy fermions, in organic materials or in  borocarbides.  A thorough study of the infrared response of  the above compound s is one the primary targets of the  initial research program.  Another direction will be  concerned  with Nd2-yCeyCuO4 which is an electron-type  cuprate superconductor.  Unlike all other cuprates this  specific materials shows certain similarities with  conventional BCS superconductors.  On the other hand,  transport experiments indicate that this system reveals  heavy fermion-like low-energy excitations.  The  controversial nature of this material may be clarified  through a survey of its electro-magnetic response in the  superconducting state.  Finally, experiments aimed at the  spectroscopic study of the superconductor-insulator  transition (SIT) and of a pseudogap in (Y-Pr)Ba2Cu3O7-x will  be performed.  %%%  It is expected that the detailed investigation of  superconducting state in synthetic metals and of the SIT  physics will enhance our understanding of unconventional  superconductivity and of general behavior of highly  correlated electrons.  ***",
