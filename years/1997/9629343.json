 "awd_abstract_narration": "9629343  Verlinde        Much of the energy that drives atmospheric circulations  is obtained through exchanges of heat, moisture, and momentum  with the surface.  Lake-effect events, where cold air masses  are rapidly modified over the Great Lakes, are excellent  natural laboratories for studying these exchanges. The Lake-  Induced Convection Experiment (Lake-ICE) is a multiple-  Principal Investigator  project which seeks to use this  natural laboratory to determine how boundary layer growth  processes are controlled by mesoscale boundary layer  convective structures and how the modified boundary layer  effects the production of precipitation and the larger scale   meteorological conditions         The Principal Investigator will use a variety of in  situ and remote measurements to attack the following  objectives:          Determine the extent to which mesoscale circulations modulate     the entrainment processes at the top of the boundary layer;       Determine if entrainment occurs through engulfment associated     with large-eddy circulations n the boundary layer or through     small-scale interfacial mixing and determine sensitivity of     the processes to large and mesoscale conditions.       Determine the impact of entrainment events on the drop size     distribution at cloud top.          These objectives will be accomplished by: Compiling a  statistical data base of the spatial extent of entrainment  events; The identification of cloud-top entrainment processes  through analysis of radar derived vertical layer profiles;  Categorizing the statistical data base according to large-,  meso- and cloud-scale conditions; Case studies of the  microphysical impact of entrainment events.        The final products of the study will be a composite  two-dimensional reflectivity and vertical velocity structure   of a mesoscale band, with corresponding cloud-scale and  cross-inversion turbulence intensity, and several  descriptions of detailed case studies.  These will provide a   better quantitativ e physical understanding of the interaction  between these different scales of motion.  ***",
