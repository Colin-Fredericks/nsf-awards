 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kenneth Shea, of the Department of Chemistry at the University   of California, Irvine, is supported by the Organic Synthesis Program for   his studies of the synthesis and reactions of strained molecules and   polymers.  Alkyl boranes initiate the polymerization of   dimethylsulfoxonium methylide, resulting in the formation of perfectly   linear polymethylene with an extremely narrow polydispersity index.    Adjustment of the initial ratio of ylide to alkyl borane permits control   of the molecular weight of the resulting polymethylene, while chemical   transformations of the carbon-boron bonds of polyhomologated alkyl   boranes allow the introduction of a variety of terminal functionalities.    Extension of this polyhomologation chemistry to more complex alkyl borane   initiators affords access to novel polymethylene architectures, including   star, comb, and hyperbranched polymers.  The chemistry may also be   adapted to the formation of block copolymers which covalently link   polymethylene with the incompatible polysiloxanes and polyethylene   glycols.  Development of control over the formation and structures of polymers,   macromolecules comprised of chemically-linked repeating units derived   from smaller molecules, is a central issue in the scientifically and   technologically vital area of polymer chemistry.  Professor Kenneth Shea   exploits an unusual class of polymer-forming chemical reactions, wherein   individual carbon atoms are added to a growing polymer chain one at a   time.  This chemistry affords synthetic access to a range of   three-dimensional polymer structures, including circular-, comb-, and   star-shaped materials, and will thereby permit the determination of the   effects of such unusual structural motifs on the intrinsic and bulk   properties of polymeric materials.  Additional studies address the   formation of block copolymers (two or more distinct polymers chemically   linked to one-another) in which the linked polymers display drastically   different properties.  Unusual physical and chemical properties are   expected to arise from such unions, including the formation of materials   which can change their shapes and/or properties as a function of their   environment.",
