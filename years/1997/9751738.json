 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the mid-eighties, mathematics and science programs were discontinued at William Woods University (until recently a women's college) and students were to sent to the neighboring Westminster College (formerly all male) for these classes.  Enrollment in these classes suffered significantly.  In the past six years, tremendous efforts have been made to bring science and mathematics back to the WWU campus.  As a result of these efforts mathematics and biology majors are now offered on campus. This program is bringing physics programs to WWU campus.   The objectives that are being addressed are (1) offering an introductory calculus based 2-semester physics sequence, (2) setting up the undergraduate physics laboratory, (3) exposing students to role-models, (4) conducting a summer workshop for teachers, (5) developing an interdisciplinary upper-division physics course, and (6) setting up a student support system.    The introductory courses and accompanying laboratories are being conducted in an investigative, hands-on approach, integrating technology and current research, providing students with the opportunity of constructing their own knowledge in an active fashion.  Cooperative learning is an inherent part of everyday activities and the emphasis will be on critical thinking and deep understanding.  Self-directed student research and presentations by students locally and at meetings is strongly encouraged.  *",
