 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9661722  Giancola     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I is directed at developers working with high performance parallel computers. The primary commercial application codes for these computers are thus tools for software development. To date, these tools have not been designed with an eye to the requirements of the high performance computing user, but rather have been ported from workstations, where their targets are much more limited in scale. The most important of these tools, and to date the most inadequate, are the symbolic debuggers. Experience in the supercomputer development environment on both CTSS and UNICOS has shown that the most essential feature for an effective debugger to have in addition to the standard ones of process control and variable evaluation is the ability to save the target's state for later restoration. Macro processing is another required capability; it allows the user to record complex sequences of debugging commands for easy reuse. Also essential is acceptance of an incomplete set of symbol table information to enable the maximum possible function on optimized code. This project will develop software technology for debuggers which it is believed no such debugger for high performance parallel computing environment exists.    This technology will be marketed to one or more parallel computer hardware vendors for incorporation into proprietary debuggers for bundled and unbundled sale with systems and to retain the rights to market a workstation version.  ***",
