 "awd_abstract_narration": "This new collaborative group award to Jonathan S. Lindsey at North   Carolina State University is supported by the Advanced Materials Program   in the Chemistry Division, the Electronic Materials Program in the   Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary   Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. The   collaboration is between Lindsey and David F. Bocian at the University of   California at Riverside and Dewey Holten at Washington University. The   expertise of the collaborators spans synthesis, static characterization   and dynamic photophysical studies of molecular electronic systems. The   focus of the research is the design, synthesis and physical   characterization of molecular optoelectronic gates based on   multi-porphyrin arrays. The gates are conceptual extensions of molecular   wires where the signal transmission can be turned on or off by placement   of a magnesium porphyrin moiety which by chemical, electrochemical, or   photochemical oxidation opens a channel that funnels excited-state energy   to the ground state. These redox-driven molecular gates parallel the   operation of transistor switches. The scope of the gating phenomenon,   optical gating methods, and and the combination of molecular gates to   achieve logic functions will be studied. Static and transient absorption   and fluorescence spectroscopy, resonance Raman spectroscopy and   electrochemistry will be used to characterize the systems both in   solution and as thin films. Time-resolved absorption and fluorescence   measurements will be made on the new arrays to elucidate the rates and   pathways of energy and electron transfer.  This research addresses the fundamental issue of whether molecular   electronics are a viable limit in the drive towards computer   miniaturization and whether information processing is possible at the   molecular scale. The molecular optoelectronic gates which will be   prepared will simulate the solid-state transistors in conventional   circuitry. If successful, molecular optoelectronic gates may find   applications as sensors or as components of other smart structures.",
