 "awd_abstract_narration": "A. Project Summary         Many scientific papers have been written that detail environmental  changes in the Black Sea, and many speculate on the implications of  further potential anthropogenic changes 1) in various drainage basins that  provide freshwater to this sea, 2) along its coastal margins, and 3) in  extraction of its resources. While the ecological effects of industrial  activity and changing land and water use are most apparent in coastal  regions of the Black Sea, they are also evident off-shore. For example,  the observed trend of increasing nutrient concentrations and doublings of  both phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity throughout the central  region of the sea between the mid 1970s and early 1990s, have been  attributed to anthropogenic causes.       Perhaps the most dramatic basin-wide changes have been associated  with the accidental introductions of carnivorous gelatinous zooplankton,  most recently Mnemiopsis leydii. These species have profoundly affected  Black Sea community structure. Many aspects of the Black Sea ecosystem  make it an attractive system for biological oceanographers to study. Major  food web perturbations allow for testing of hypotheses relating to the  influence of community organization and on the flow of energy and matter.  Basin scale physical processes are becoming increasingly well known, and  the physical scale of this sea allows for realistic state of the art  linkages among physical and biological processes in contemporary modeling  efforts. The foremost of these models are nitrogen based, and they lead to  conjecture regarding the sources of nitrogen that drive plankton  production.  However, there have been no actual studies of the dynamics of  the annual nitrogen cycle and, in particular, no determinations of new  production in the Black Sea. Moreover, generalizations that have been  made, such as in models, are predicated upon the generalizable behavior of  a Black Sea planktonic ecosystem prior to the environmental changes of the   last decade.  In conjunction with colleagues in Turkey, Dr. McCarthy has developed a  plan to fill these gaps in knowledge of the dynamics of the nitrogen cycle  in the euphoric zone of the Black Sea. Rates of N uptake, N2 fixation, and  nitrogen flux among dissolved components will be measured with stable  isotope techniques and interpreted within the context of plankton  community and geophysical structure. This study will serve to document  current conditions, provide a basis for inferring the effects of recent  environmental changes, and contribute to more realistic modeling efforts  of the Black Sea ecosystem.  This proposed collaboration responds to an  unprecedented opportunity to investigate the openwater nitrogen cycle in  the Black Sea very efficiently. Turkish scientists at the METU Institute  of Marine Science have just launched an intensive program to study the  \"Dynamics of the lower trophic levels of the Black Sea: Biogeochemical  processes, and system modeling\". The first field campaign in this program  has begun, but a critical component, the dynamics of nitrogen fluxes among  nutrient and particulate pools and trophic levels is missing. This Small  Grant for Exploratory Research will provide this critical component.",
