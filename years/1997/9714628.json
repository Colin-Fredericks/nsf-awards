 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714628  Heimbach     This grant will provide funding to upgrade the University of North Carolina's Department of Atmospheric Sciences UNIDATA-supported network.  New software, expanded products and increasing applications have rendered part of the present system obsolete.  Presently the department has four Sun workstations.  The existing server (a Sun LX) will be downgraded and a new server, a Sun Ultra 1-170E along with some peripherals, will be added.  The department will continue the popular PC-McIDAS by replacing the existing two PCs with high-end Pentiums to allow PC-McIDAS upgrades which are not possible with the current PCs.     This expansion will allow a wider dissemination of the UNIDATA services which have already been profoundly beneficial to the educational experiences of the majors, to research and to those enrolled in the department's support courses.  A majority of the department's offerings have been impacted by the UNIDATA products and three new courses have been developed which are specifically directed at UNIDATA applications.  A freshman-level atmospheric sciences course is being reorganized to include an interdisciplinary component.  The multidisciplinary aspects of this course will be supported by the proposed upgrade.     This equipment upgrading is essential to continue the department's rigorous instruction in both major and service courses, as well as to contribute to research which requires operational meteorological data.",
