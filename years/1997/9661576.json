 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9661576  DeMenthon     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will test a novel instrument for tracking the hand and the head of a subject, and has particular application to user-system interfaces for interactive 3D graphics and virtual reality.  A novel optical tracker using infrared Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) mounted on the hand and head of the user and a fixed camera equipped with a position sensing diode (PSD) will be developed. The system will modulate each LED at a distinct characteristic frequency from several kHz to several hundred kHz. The contributions from the LEDs to the PSD signal will all be measured simultaneously and separated by digital filters, each tuned to extract the contribution of a single LED. Sunlight and incandescent light sources do not produce components in the kHz range and will be rejected by high pass filters. This design will obtain accurate translation and rotation measurements at high rate, and with a low phase lag during rapid hand or head motion.    The proposed technology will result in the development of optical tracking systems which perform reliably in unconstrained lighting environments, while providing high update rates and high responsiveness.  Potential commercial applications include 3D mouse systems and Head Mounted Display trackers for the interactive 3D graphics market, the simulator market, and the entertainment market.  ***",
