 "awd_abstract_narration": "An examination of the transition states of surface reactions forms  the focus of this research project supported by the Analytical and  Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities.  Professor Gellman and his students at Carnegie Mellon  University are addressing the nature and energetics of the  transition state in various elementary surface reaction processes  including  -hydride elimination, alkyl coupling and phenyl coupling  reactions on Cu and Ag surfaces.  The transition state is probed by  fluorine substitution of reactants and the monitoring of reaction  kinetics and mechanism using vibrational spectroscopy and thermal  desorption spectroscopy.  Activation barriers and energetics  obtained experimentally will be compared with computational  investigations of transition state energetics.   The use of the methods of physical organic chemistry to examine  transition states in surface reactions is the subject of this  research project.  Fluorine substitution is used to probe the  stability and energetics of the transition state for various  hydrogen elimination and coupling reactions occurring on copper and  silver surfaces.  This information will provide the thermodynamic  background essential for an understanding of catalytic chemistry on  these surfaces, as well as for similar processes in electrochemical  and corrosion environments.",
