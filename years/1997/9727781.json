 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727781  Edwards    As part of A Change of Course evaluation, NFIE will document successful  innovations of individual and small groups of teachers who participate in long term reform efforts. The NFIE team has constructed a four phase model of the change process. These phases tend to be overlapping and dynamic rather than linear.  Phase I incubation-a period of time during which new ideas are developing among a small group in the setting; Phase 2 Small scale application-a time period during which a small group of people are trying out the ideas in a fairly isolated situation; Phase 3 Transition to broad application-a  time where conditions are getting aligned to support movement from a few isolated applications to widespread use; and Phase 4 Broad-baed application-a time where the innovation is widely used and accepted. NFIE will document and analyze Phase 3 experiences of sites engaged in the reform of professional development. This study will investigate and document how teachers have progressed through his process enabling the formation of a model of innovation based around professional development.  ***",
