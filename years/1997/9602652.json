 "awd_abstract_narration": "Loyola Marymount University, located in Los Angels, CA, is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation of selected biology research and training laboratories in the Seaver Hall of Science. Erected in 1963, the building is the principal laboratory building on campus, which houses the Departments of Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Physics.  No improvements have been made since it was built and many infrastructure systems and equipment, original to the facility, have reached their life span.  Poorly designed laboratories do not provide enough space for large instrumentation required for research activities.  Therefore securing equipment in small spaces create crowding conditions that are inefficient and potentially unsafe.  To rectify the problems, the National Science Foundation and Loyola Marymount University will jointly provide funds to modernize research and research training space for the Department of Biology.  The renovations are part of a major effort to enhance the laboratory-based research environment and expand student research training in the biological sciences.  The project will maximize the use of limited available space by establishing laboratories which can be shared by faculty whose research programs have common equipment needs and fundamental similarities in approach.  Renovations will include the reconfiguration of existing space, the installation of new fume hoods and laboratory benches, and the upgrade of the stockroom and preparation room.  Once completed, a shared genetics research facility, and a shared plant biology research facility will be created.  The increase in available research space and the increased efficiency of space is expected to significantly increase the productivity of research-active faculty and improve the quality and quantity of research training available in the Biology Department.",
