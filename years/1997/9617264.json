 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Joshua Goodman of the Department of Chemistry at the University   of Rochester, with the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, studies   the chemistry of 1,n-cation radicals.  The solution structure,   reactivity, and thermochemistry of these highly reactive, short-lived   intermediates, representing oxidized analogs of the comparatively   well-known biradicals, are studied through a combination of product   analyses, time-resolved absorption spectroscopy, and photoacoustic   calorimetry.  These studies provide insights into the influence of   structure and thermodynamics on the reactivity of the 1,n-cation radicals   and on the processes whereby they are converted into stable products.    Electron transfer reactions converting 1,n-cation radicals to the   corresponding 1,n-biradicals are also explored, allowing the comparison   of these biradicals with those formed through independent synthetic   routes in order to ascertain whether they display precursor-dependent   chemistry.  Study of the chemistry of reactive intermediates, compounds formed   transiently at intermediate stages of chemical reactions, sheds light on   the fundamental processes responsible for the chemical transformations of   molecules.  Professor Joshua Goodman, of the University of Rochester,   studies `1,n-cation radicals,` reactive compounds containing an atom   bearing a positive charge and an atom bearing a single electron,   separated from each other by n-1 atoms.  There is a mounting body of   evidence which suggests that such cation radicals play important roles as   reactive intermediates in organic reactions, some of which serve as   fundamental models for biochemical processes.  Development of an   understanding of their structure and chemistry promises greater insights   into the intricate details of these and related chemical and biochemical   processes.",
