The objectives of the conference are: 1.) to review major advances in superconductivity R&D since the last workshop in 1991; 2) to identify key problems that are bottlenecking progress; 3.) to specify areas where major breakthroughs appear possible; 4.) to identify new research facilities or techniques that may lead to new research opportunities.  The Conference plans to invite research leaders to discuss fundamental issues in superconductivity.  The workshop will be divided into four panels: fundamentals, materials, thin film and devices, and bulk superconductor, wires, and applications.  A proceeding will be put together by the Conference for the report. The P.I. and his colleagues have organized similar conferences in the past. The findings of the workshop would be able to provide NSF with  suggestions for research direction in the area of superconductivity materials processing in the future.",
