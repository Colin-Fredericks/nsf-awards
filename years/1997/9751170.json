 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to gain support to significantly enhance an interdisciplinary Integrated Systems Laboratory (ISL) technology teacher education facility for both pre- and in-service teacher preparation at the University of Missouri-Columbia. This will result in a model laboratory, unique in Missouri, for preparing secondary-level Technology Education teachers to work within an interdisciplinary environment. Additionally, the laboratory will be utilized by students throughout the College of Education, with specific emphasis given to science and mathematics education as well as students from the Industrial and Mechanical & Aerospace engineering departments. To insure this broadscale integration and use, the specifications for this laboratory were developed jointly by faculty from technology education, science, mathematics education, and engineering.    Wide-spread national calls for Technology Education and the integration of math/science/technology necessitate the development of a facility for thematic exploration and study. This facility will be the primary show place in the region for this new kind of learning, significantly enhancing undergraduate education in Missouri, and setting a standard for the midwest. A comprehensive undergraduate program in Technology Education has been approved by the University and is in place. The most significant barrier to full implementation of the program is a lack of state-of-the-art equipment necessary to deliver the program. The equipment listed in this proposal has been carefully selected to provide a solid foundation for preparing teachers for the 21 st century.",
