 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710160  A formal software architecture specification makes the analysis,  design, and construction of a complex system intellectually  tractable by characterizing the system at a high level of  abstraction. This project focuses on revealing defects in the  dynamic interaction and communication behavior of system  components through testing techniques applied at the  architectural level. While testing has historically concentrated  on the implementation as the target of inquiry, this research  instead considers the architectural specification of the system  as the target. There are five major contributions to software  architecture and software testing technology arising from this  research. First, a set of architecture-based integration test  criteria are defined to provide requirements for testing  architectural aspects of a system; methods are also developed for  applying these criteria to architectural styles and domain-  specific architectures. Second, methods are developed for testing  an implementation in terms of its conformance to a specified  architecture via architecture conformance oracles. Third,  architecture-level slicing techniques are defined for localizing  architectural defects and minimizing regression testing. Fourth,  methods are developed for using feature tests to discover the  architecture of a system from its implementation. In addition,  various approaches to formal architecture specification are  evaluated with respect to their suitability to testing  technologies.  ***",
