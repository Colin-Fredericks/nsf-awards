 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704203  Zhu    The main goals of this project are to investigate several important areas of   mathematical control theory in which nonsmoothness is intrinsic to the   problem and the usual assumptions of Lipschitz continuity or continuity   must be replaced by assumptions of lower semicontinuity even if the   original problem is defined by continuous or even smooth data. As an   important tool for such investigations, it is also proposed to further develop   a basic theory and a calculus of subdifferentials. The control problems that   are intended to be investigated by these methods include:   (1) Controllability properties of unbounded control and differential   inclusion systems;  (2) Bilevel optimization problems;  (3) Infinite horizon problems with both initial-value and natural system   perturbations;  (4) Necessary optimality conditions for distributed control problems starting   with those defined by quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations;  (5) Value function and sensitivity analysis for delayed control problems;   and  (6) Dynamical programming approach to control problems with discrete   stochastic variables.    The control problems proposed above naturally arise in resource   management, flexible manufacturing system scheduling,  transportation   scheduling and other industry and management problems. These control   problems have been studied with simplified models in which the system   performance is assumed to be free of abrupt changes. However, in real life   problems such abrupt changes are not only unavoidable but rather often   among the most important features of the problem. The discontinuous   aspects of these problems will be studied with recent methods of the   subdifferential theory.  New methods will also be developed as needed.   Research results in this project are likely to shed light on other applications   that involve similar discontinuous behaviors.",
