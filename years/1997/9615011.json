 "awd_abstract_narration": "OPP 9615011  Crowley    Abstract  The geologic record indicates that the earth has been subject to  four main phases of glaciation in the last one billion years: the  late Cenozoic, Carboniferous, Ordovician, and Late Precambrian.  In order to develop a uniform theory for glacial periods it is  necessary to identify the factors responsible for both general  conditions of glacial inception and growth and retreat of the ice  sheets.  Over the last several years our modeling group has  succeeded in identifying plausible boundary conditions for  glacial inception for the pre-Cenozoic glacial ages.  Separately  W. R. Peltier and colleagues have succeeded in simulating the  evolution of ice volume during the last glacial cycle with an ice  sheet model  coupled to a two-dimensional energy balance model  (EBM).  This award supports a project to combine these separate  lines of research in order to test whether an ice sheet model  developed for Pleistocene studies can, without any additional  tuning, yield changes in ice volume consistent with evidence from  the Carboniferous and Ordovician glacial periods.  This research  will entail conducting a suite of experiments with the Peltier  model that involve forcing the model with temperature and  (parameterized) moisture fields from EBMs with the model run  through a series of orbital insolation changes.  The objective is  to determine whether the paleo ice sheet grows to dimensions  commensurate with geological data and also whether \"hot\" summer  orbits melt the ice sheet.  To test for robustness of results,  some of the experiments will be repeated using temperature and  precipitation fields generated by a general circulation model.  If this work is successful in simulating the Carboniferous and  Ordovician glaciations, confidence will be enhanced in the ice  sheet model and a significant step will have been taken in  developing a uniform explanation for glacial periods in earth  history.",
