The proposed  research addresses the physical and chemical interactions of  arsenic with soils and sediments before it ultimately finds  its way into ground or surface water.  This topic is of  particular importance in all Latin American countries and  especially Mexico. Arsenic pollution of groundwater and  surface waters leads to human health problems such as  cancer, and is particularly problematic in mining areas  where complex geochemistries determine its fate.  To help  understand how the reactions of various minerals interact  under natural conditions and how the site geochemistry  influences the migration of As metals and metalloids, the  research will study As speciation and sorption as a function  of soil mineral composition, pH, Eh, and the presence of  dissolved organic and inorganic ions. The major objective is  to quantify the relative importance of the different  processes on As mobility.  Specific objectives include:  developing meaningful laboratory leaching tests to assess  how labile As and As-rich-tailings are;   developing  analytical and extraction techniques to determine As-  speciation in soils;  quantifying the importance of Fe and  Mn oxides in As retention;   quantifying factors controlling  As dissolution.  An understanding of As geochemistry can  lead to better means of  pollution prevention, especially  from mining sources.  The proposed work is part of an ongoing collaboration  agreement between University of Maryland College Park (UMCP)  and Universidad Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) to build a program  in Environmental Engineering which will facilitate the  visits by students/researchers,  develop an infrastructure  to facilitate \"sandwich' degrees (students from UMCP to  conduct field work in Mexico and students from Mexico to  participate in courses at UMCP),   train Mexican students in  topics  of interest to their own country, and identify and  establish new areas of common interest between the two  universities.  The proposed research will use both surrogate  contaminated soils spiked with different levels of  As under different pH and redox conditions, and  real As-rich tailings and will include a mixture  of laboratory and field work.   Well controlled  laboratory studies will be designed to elucidate  mechanisms.  The field studies, conducted in  Mexico, will elucidate the relative importance of  the different mechanisms from both a kinetic and a  thermodynamic approach.  The approach taken in  this proposal and the knowledge gained will not  only benefit the environment surrounding mining  communities but also extensive geothermal and  agricultural areas where arsenic concentrations  are often high.  Knowledge gained will provide a  basis upon which pollution control technologies  may be established.***",
