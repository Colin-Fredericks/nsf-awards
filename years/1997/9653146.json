 "awd_abstract_narration": "Providing undergraduate students with a deep appreciation of the geological evolution of the Earth requires that they visualize in three dimensions. Geological observations are intrinsically three dimensional, and yet we teach students using two dimensional instructional materials. Add to this the fact that the natural features observed in the Earth are the products of perhaps billions of years of processes that have occurred in three dimensions, and it is not surprising that the majority of non-science undergraduate majors leave undergraduate Earth science courses with a poor understanding of the processes that have shaped the physical features of the Earth, its resources, and its global environment.            Objectives of this project are to produce a variety of computer-based three dimensional visualization products to address incompatibility between learning styles of the non-science major and a highly visual field such as Earth science. Two types of 3D visualization products will be developed: 1) virtual reality fly-bys and landscape views that are manipulated by the user, featuring geologic, satellite, age, and geophysical information which are overlain on real world landscapes, and 2) true 3D models that represent the subsurface geologic structures, illustrating how these structures intersect the land surface to produce the observed features on the Earth. Animation of such models, to show changes through geologic time, will be an important component. In both cases, these products will feature real-world examples of geologic features, from the global scale to detailed regions; in the later cases, National Parks in the U.S.A. will often be used as examples.              Some of the products will consist of virtual reality, interactive multimedia \"tutorials\" for student's use, but a major part of this program will involve Group Learning environments where raw materials (data, interface templates, instruction) will allow students to produce their own virtual reality lessons. Students  of widely varying learning styles can each make their own unique contributions to such projects. The ultimate goal is to provide the student who is a non-science major an engaging science experience.  In addition to use in undergraduate instruction, it is anticipated that these products will also be used by the National Parks in their Visitor Centers, and by individuals with interest in the National Parks.",
