Sites will work in the Laboratory of  Conservation Genetics, with C. Moritz and N.  FitzSimmons, to learn methods of microsatellite  development and analysis for application to an  endangered reptile.  Sites will screen several nesting  rookeries of the Amazon River Turtles (Podocnemis  expansa and P. unifilis) for mitochondrial (mtDNA) and  nuclear (microsatellite) genetic markers to estimate  patterns and levels of female (mtDNA) and male  (microsatellite) gene flow within and between river  basins in the Brazilian Amazon.  Sites will learn both  new molecular methods which will strengthen his program,  and benefit from the pool of expertise available in the  Moritz lab, especially their experience in addressing  similar questions in marine turtles.  Moritz and  FitzSimmons will benefit from learning about the  application of their methods to a new species of  colonial-nesting turtle, and by extension to  conservation issues in the Neotropics in general.  Both  will also meet the Brazilian coordinator of this effort,  Dr. Nelson J. da Silva, who has secured government  permission for this project, and has collected some of  the samples.  Sites will prepare a full proposal for  submission to the National Science Foundation from these  data upon completion of his stay.",
