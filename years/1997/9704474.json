 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modeling and Statistical Analysis of Mental Test Data              William Stout           University of Illinois              Abstract    This research involves the probabilistic modeling and statistical  analysis of multiple question(item) mental test data.  The   investigator has in the past used the nonparametric item response   theory(IRT) paradigm to study test fairness, the statistical   assessment of complex latent IRT structures, and the cognitive   process/psychometric modeling and cognitive diagnosis of test  taking examinees using the investigator co-developed Unified   Cognitive Model.  Now, it is proposed to develop a nonparametric   item level geometric description of the item structure analogous   to the classical subtest score level factor analytic approach.    It is planned to develop a practical operational cognitive  testing procedures based on the Unified model.  It is proposed   to further develop the test bias procedure, SIBTEST, in various   much needed ways.  A practical need cutting across all three   areas is forour nonparametric procedures to be modified to match   on liklihood based latent ability estimates as well as on their   currently used number correct scores.    The research involves developing mathematical models and statistical  procedures to improve standardized and classroom tests and to improve  the measurement of examinee performance on such tests.  There is a   special emphasis on providing an educationally useful concept mastery  profile for each examinee based upon his/her individual test question   responses, on providing fairer tests, and on assessing the   substantive complexity of skills required for performing well on a   test.  In particular, it is desired to     (i) provide for each item a description of what it measures best,   (ii) to produce fairer tests -- in particular by informing the         construction specifications of future tests about biased         item types that should be excluded, and   (iii) to provide for educators detail ed feedback of concept mastery         and nonmastery for each individual examinee to be used to         guide further instruction and remedial efforts.    Because standardized tests are ever more ubiquitous in American   society and noting their gatekeeper role, the above work, if   successful, should have a major impact on how effective standardized  tests in America are and indeed could improve the educational   process in the classroom.",
