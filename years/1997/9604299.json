 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604299  Striedter    The ability to learn complex vocalizations has evolved only  in humans, songbirds, and parrots.  This project  investigates how the neural circuits controlling  vocalization have changed during the evolution of vocal  learning.  Particular emphasis is placed on an area of the  midbrain, as the function of this region is hypothesized to  have changed significantly as the capacity for vocal  behavior moves from being genetically coded to being  dependent on learning.  Neuroanatomical analysis of the  inputs and outputs of this area, observations of the  behavioral effects of damage to this area, and  electrophysiological examination of the activity of midbrain  neurons are all used to test comparative analysis is then  used to reconstruct how neural circuitry and behavioral  function of the vocal control system change during  evolution.  In doing so, this is one of the first studies to  examine how historical constraints can influence current  brain function.  The results of this study enhance our  understanding of the brain's systems for controlling vocal  behavior, including human speech, as well as improve our  understanding of how nervous systems in general evolve to  accomodate complex new behavioral abilities within the  constraints of preexisting circuits with preexisting  functions.  Such research is important in advancing  knowledge about how natural and artificial learning systems  acquire increasingly complex abilities as a function of  experience.",
