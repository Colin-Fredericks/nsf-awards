 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many endocrine glands and neurons release complex compounds that contain a \"main\" secretion, and co-secretions whose roles are poorly understood.  The identification of these co-secretions and their functions is of great urgency:  (1) malfunctions of neurons and endocrine glands due to co-secretions could be involved in so far unexplained pathologies; (2) an understanding of the co-secretions may pave the way the new treatments of neural and endocrine diseases.  The goal of the present investigation is to clarify the roles of co-secretions in the release of the stress hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline, and of their suspected antagonist dopamine.  Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline derive from chromaffin cells.  It appears that their release is controlled (a) by a cocktail of co-secretions released by the chromaffin cells themselves, and (b) by a cocktail released by the fibers that innervate the chromaffin cells.  Plasma dopamine derives from the wall of large blood vessels, and its release is affected by adrenaline, noradrenaline and opioid substances.  Using economic and highly efficient model systems, the chromaffin cells and blood vessels of the eel, the studies will focus on co-secretions such as messenger peptides, amines and endogenous codeine and morphine.",
