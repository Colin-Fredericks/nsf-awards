 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Career Advancement Award is supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program.  Professor Georgiadis and her students at Boston University  will study the interactions and properties of nucleic acids at interfaces using  in situ two-color surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy.  Self-assembled  monolayers of oligonucleotides on surfaces and the factors that control  hybridization selectivity in DNA and peptide nucleic acid films will be studied.   This work has potential for developing extended DNA arrays that will be useful  in studies DNA-drug interactions.  Monolayers of biomolecules on surfaces will be studied by an extremely sensitive  surface spectroscopic method, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, using two  colors of light.  This new method has been developed in this laboratory.  The  properties of the biomolecules as they interact with compounds that are  candidates for drugs will be measured and used to understand these chemical  reactions.  This information will also be useful in developing rapid nucleotide  sequencing data for DNA and other nucleic acids.",
