 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700667  Riley    This award supports a two year collaborative research  project between Professors Joseph Riley and Michael Padilla  of the University of Georgia and Professor Shigekazu  Takemara of Hiroshima University in Japan.  The goal of this  project is to compare and document the preservice and  inservice preparation of science teachers and the  effectiveness of this education on teacher development and  student achievement.  The research will focus on three  areas:  1) What teachers need to know (content, pedagogy,  knowledge of students);  2) What teachers need to be able to  do (ability to use various teaching strategies); and  3) How  the program should be structured to mirror the best practice  (school experience and modeling good teaching).  Researchers  from each institution will work together in six teams.  Each  team  will be responsible for one of the collaborative  research questions.  The teams will collect the research  data and then provide an analysis.    The study will engage the expertise of the faculties of Arts  and Sciences and Education in two of the leading teacher  preparation institutions in Japan and the United States.  A  significant outcome of the project will be the development  of a critical mass of researchers, who will have first hand  knowledge and experience about science education in Japan.  The project will contribute to a growing dialogue and  literature base on Japanese science education.  Specific  outcomes include development of a Word Wide Web site on  science education practices in Japan and the United States  which will be continuously updated.  ***",
