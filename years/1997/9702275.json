 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702275  Thelen  The issue addressed in this research is to determine why  elderly adults are not capable of arresting a fall that they  likely would have arrested when they were young.  It is  estimated that approximately one-third of persons over 65  fall each year and one-quarter of elderly fallers sustain  serious injuries such as wrist and hip fractures.  While all  humans are bound to encounter disturbances such as trips  while walking, avoiding a fall requires one to sense a loss  of balance, process, plan and implement a reaction using the  central nervous system, and then execute the movements by  the muscular system.  This study will use both experiments  and computer simulations to investigate how age-related  changes in these systems (sensory, central nervous or  muscular) contribute to balance difficulties in elderly  adults.    In the experiments, young and elderly adults will be  released from a leaning posture and will have to step  rapidly to regain balance.  Forces, muscle electrical  activities and movement will be recorded on a computer  during these tasks.  These data will be used to compare  reaction times, muscle coordination and muscle strength  development of old adults with young adults.  These  comparisons will provide a better understanding of the  underlying physiological differences that put older adults  at risks for falls.  In addition to the experiments,  computer simulations will be conducted to further estimate  how changes in physiological factors affect balance  abilities.  The simulations consist of a mathematical  representation of the human body in which muscle electrical  signals are inputted and the resulting human movement is  predicted.  Physiologic factors, such as muscle strength and  reaction time, can be easily adjusted in the computer  simulations and the effects on the stepping movement  determined.  The computer simulations can thus be used to  predict how reductions in strength and slowing of movement  speed (traits often observed in elderly) a ffect balance  recovery abilities.    The primary objective of the education plan is to enhance  the continuing development of a quality engineering program,  at a science strong liberal arts college, which prepares  students for direct entry into engineering graduate school.  A combination of innovative instruction techniques and  research projects will be used to accomplish this objective.  One important component of the education plan is the use of  collaborative learning in the classroom.  Collaborative  learning involves instituting extensive efforts to actively  engage students in classroom discussion and problem solving,  thus making the classroom a stimulating learning  environment.  Another important component is the educating  and challenging of undergraduate students by involving them  in summer research projects.  The ultimate goal of the  education plan is to create an atmosphere in which students  experience the excitement of intellectual challenge, gain a  thorough understanding of engineering concepts and have a  wording ability to solve real engineering problems  creatively.  ***",
