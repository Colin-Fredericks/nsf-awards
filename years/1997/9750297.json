This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled \"Pathogen  resistance as a model system for the perception of  environmental signals in plants.\"  To gain a better  understanding of plant responses to environmental signals,  mutants in the pathogen resistance signal transduction  pathway of Arabidopsis thaliana are being identified using  genetic selections based on a pathogen-responsive promoter  fused to selectable marker genes.  Mutants are being  characterized  with respect to altered expression of  pathogen-regulated genes, and the identity of the mutated  genes ultimately determined using positional map-based  cloning techniques.  An avirulent strain of  Pseudomonas  syringae and the RSP2 gene are being used in this study.",
