 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evaluations of existing undergraduate engineering programs continually cite three weaknesses: graduates lack technical literacy; graduates lack oral and written communication skills; and graduates lack design experience. To address these weaknesses, the School of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science (CEES) at the University of Oklahoma, is proposing a systemic reform initiative that will incorporate a single design project integrated throughout the curriculum. The common design project, entitled \"Sooner City,\" will be introduced during the freshman year and continue for the entire curriculum. Design tasks range from population estimates to the water supply system. A common design project can unify the curriculum and allow material learned in early courses to carry forward. Another advantage is that the students will have a professional design portfolio that can be presented to perspective employers.  The design project will be taught using the just- in-time learning paradigm. By focusing on real-world applications up front, students will be interested and motivated to learn. The involved courses will be restructured to incorporate team learning and group presentations, which enhances the students' interpersonal and communication skills.  In addition, starting in fall of 1997, all incoming engineering freshman will have a laptop computer with wireless communication technology so that each classroom becomes a networked computer lab.  A primary goal of the project is to produce graduates who are self-disciplined, responsible, computer literate, and who can communicate effectively with fellow engineers, management, and the public. It is anticipated that the reformed curriculum can serve as a paradigm for engineering programs throughout the country. Interactive design modules and hypertext tutorials will be disseminated to other institutions through a CD ROM, the world wide web and through traditional outlets such as conferences and journal articles.",
