One central  objective is the development of flexible models that can  accommodate the movements of a variety of  faunal  taxa,  their intra- and inter-specific interactions, and their interactions with the environment.   Characterizing the trajectories of animals traveling great distances through the oceans for example   requires models for diffusion processes on the sphere.  Stochastic differential equations will have to be  adapted to this situation and in particular to include covariates,  nonparametric coefficients and non- Gaussian processes.  Basic inferential aspects of diffusion processes, many of which are as yet unstudied  particularly with respect to animal movement, will also be explored in this study.    Two primary data sets will be analyzed. One consists of geographic locations (determined daily) and dive  depth (determined every 30s to 60s) of northern elephant seals during their migrations of 3 to 8 months in  the north Pacific. The second data set consists of hourly locations of Rocky Mountain elk and mule deer, together with geographic information on habitat types. Since animal movements are determined by biological and physical features of the environment and this may be anticipated to vary with the climate,  this research relates to the Strategic Area of environment and global change within the general framework  of the National Science Foundation. The movement models to be developed will allow formal assessment  of temporal and spatial aspects of change and of wildlife responses to them.",
