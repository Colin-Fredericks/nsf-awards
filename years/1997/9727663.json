Industrial ecology is an emerging field focused on the  environment which takes a systems view of industrial activity and  its external interactions.  It takes selected approaches of  biological ecology (resource cycling, energy flows, food webs,  etc.) and uses them to study such topics as materials and energy  cycling in industry.  The goal is to decrease impacts on the  natural environment and to increase the sustainability and  efficiency of energy and materials use.  It takes system-wide  views and is clearly multidisciplinary, involving (among others)  chemical engineers, industrial engineers, manufacturing  engineers, physicists, chemists, materials scientists, and  operations researchers.    Any emerging field lacks many of the traditional mechanisms for  the production and communication of research, particularly  periodic, broadly structured conferences at which the most recent  and exciting research can be shared and discussed.  To begin to  fill this gap, the Principal Investigator submitted a proposal  for a Gordon Research Conference on Industrial Ecology.  That  proposal was accepted, and the first such conference will be held  in the summer of 1998.  ***",
