 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface   Chemistry Program and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities, addresses the question of surface segregation of  polymer segments at polymer surfaces.  Professor Gardella and   his research group at SUNY-Buffalo use methods of surface   analysis including secondary ion massspectrometry and X-ray   photoelectron spectroscopy to probe the composition of various   polymer surfaces.  This collaborative multidisciplinary project  combines the efforts of synthetic polymer scientists who will  make selected siloxane polymers with this group's expertise in  the application of a variety of surface characterization methods  to the study of these materials.  The kinetics of diffusion of  the components of siloxane polymer monolayer films through  overlayer polymers will be determined using this array of  methods.  Segment length and molecular weight distribution for a  range of siloxane copolymers will be examined as a function of  polymer architecture and preparation conditions.  The  determination of structure and reactivity at polymer surfaces and  interfaces is the overall goal of this work.     The connection between the bulk microstructure of copolymer   systems and the surface composition is a little explored area of   polymer surface chemistry.  This collaborative multidisciplinary  research project uses state of the art surface analytical methods  of this group to probe the segregation of polymer segments at  copolymer interfaces that will be prepared by collaborators with  synthetic polymer expertise, and addresses the effects of these  compositional changes on the surface properties of these  materials.  This information is vital to the design of new  polymer systems with useful surface properties.",
