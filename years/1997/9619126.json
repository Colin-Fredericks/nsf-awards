 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  SRI  is  investigating the properties of human  interactions  with  a  graphical terrain model as they would  occur  in  a  crisis  situation, with a particular emphasis on elucidating  the  process  of  reference  through  natural  language  and  gesture.   First,  the research team is augmenting  existing  theories  of discourse salience to account for how  entities  are  introduced  through the visual display in  addition  to  speech,  and  extending theories of reference resolution  by  incorporating mutually constraining effects of gesturing and  properties of linguistic referring expressions.  Second, the  team is studying how discourse structure is affected by  the  structure  of  the  terrain model  and  of  the  task  being  executed, and how it can be determined through a combination  of  speech and gestural cues.  Third, they are studying  how  spatial terms are used in uniquely identifying referents  in  a  terrain  model, particularly with respect to perspective-  relative relational terms.  The data used are generated from  a  set  of wizard-of-oz sessions with an existing multimodal  route-planning  system.  The results  of  the  research  are  demonstrated in proof-of-concept extensions to this  system,  and  are measured by a systematic set of evaluation methods.  This research carries out the first step toward the flexible  integration of speech, gesture, and visual display that will  be  required by the interactive, multimodal systems  of  the  future.***",
