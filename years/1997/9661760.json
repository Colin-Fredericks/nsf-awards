Platinum clusters will be impregnated inside carbonaceous structures protecting the active sites from poisonous gases such as CO, CO2, etc. At least two different impregnation techniques will be tested in Phase I including CVD deposition technique and impregnation from liquid phase. The carbonaceous materials will be chemically treated prior to impregnation by using oxidative treatment procedure. Prepared catalysts will be evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, X-ray spectroscopy, AUGER spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The catalyst performance will be evaluated in a single fuel cell with 5 cm2 active area. Hydrogen and hydrogen with premixed CO will be used as reactant gases. A comparison between conventional Pt/Ru catalyst and the novel catalyst developed during Phase I will be performed.   The catalyst developed during the proposed research program will have commercial applications in PEM fuel cells for transportation applications as well as for stationary fuel cell power systems operating on reformate gas and methanol. ***",
