The first  system  to  be  studied is a large array of mesoscopic superconducting rings. The  magnetic     moments     in     such     rings     can     couple  \"antiferromagnetically\", via purely magnetic interactions,  which  have  been  observed in preliminary experiments.  Cleaner  arrays  will  be  studied  in  a search for true long  range  order.  The  microscope  will  also be used to study the  static  and  dynamic  properties  of vortices in superconductors with both  random  and  periodic pinning. In the random case the primary interest  is  in  spatially-resolved   dynamics  of  vortices   in   a   disordered  potential,  when  strongly driven by either  magnetic  fields  or  applied currents, with the expectation of getting new information  on  the depinning transition.  With periodic pinning, experiments  will probe the consequences of variations of two competing length  scales:  the  vortex-vortex  spacing  and  the  distance  between  pinning sites.  %%%  This   experimental  research  project  explores   the   magnetic  properties of superconductors, with particular attention  to  how  magnetic  flux moves through a superconductur when pushed  by  an  external  magnetic  field, or by a current  passing  through  the  superconductor.  Since  it is this flux  motion  which  generally  results  in  the  loss  of  perfect conductivity,  which  is  the  hallmark  of  superconductors, a deeper  understanding  of  these  issues  may  lead  to  improved  technological  applications   of  superconductors,  as  in power generation and  transmission.  The  flux  motion  will be imaged using the powerful new technique  of  scanning Hall probe microscopy. The further deve lopment  of  this  instrument, which may find use in many fields (such as hard  disk  technologies) where the local structure of the magnetic field  is  of  interest,  is an integral part of the project.  Results  from  this  research may include unusual new effects or materials which  may find new application in technology. This research project  is  interdisciplinary  in nature and involves graduate  students  who  will  be  excellently  trained to enter  positions  in  industry,  government or education.  ***",
