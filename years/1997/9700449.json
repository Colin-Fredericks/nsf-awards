 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ravi-Chandar  9700449  The University of Houston proposes a three-year effort aimed  at investigating the phenomenon of dynamic shear banding and  shear    fracture   in   ductile   polymers,    specifically  polycarbonate.   It  is proposed to perform  experiments  to  characterize the high strain-rate thermomechanical  behavior  of  polycarbonate, to study shear banding and shear  failure  and  the associated failure mode transitions, and to compare  these  with experiments on the metallic materials  that  are  known  to  exhibit  a  similar  behavior.   Split  Hopkinson  pressure  bar and torsion bar experiments will  be  used  to  characterize the high strain rate constitutive  behavior  of  polycarbonate;   high   speed  photography   combined   with  photoelasticity and high speed photomicrography will be used  to investigate the mechanics and mechanisms of shear banding  and failure mode transitions; temperature measurements using  high  speed  infrared detectors will be used to examine  the  role  of  temperature on the onset and growth of  the  shear  banding localization.  Similar experiments will be performed  in   a   metallic   material  that   also   exhibits   shear  banding/shear failure mode transitions for comparison.  This  basic  research will lead to a better understanding  of  the  mechanisms  and mechanics of shear banding and failure  mode  transitions  in  ductile polymers.  If the reasons  for  the  similarities  between the observed behavior of polycarbonate  and  some metallic materials are understood, this work  will  provide  insight  into shear banding  in  a  wide  range  of  materials.   The  effect of superimposed static  loading  or  displacement  constraints on failure mode transitions  could  have  significant technological implications for the  design  of  structures resistant to impact damage and is proposed to  be investigated.",
