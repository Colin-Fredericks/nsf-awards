 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Heuer  9710946    Research and theory from social exchange, group dynamics, and attribution perspectives support the claim that the relation between respectful treatment and fairness judgments is qualified by the individual's belief that he or she deserves respectful treatment.  Further, research indicates that decision makers and decision recipients define fair treatment differently.  This disparity has the potential to frustrate a decisionmaker's best efforts to implement procedures fairly.  In addition, motivational variables contribute to the link between procedural concerns (especially respectful treatment) and perceived justice. This research consists of three field studies.  The first 960 New York City police officers are surveyed about their encounters with other police officers and with the public.  This study is a 2 (in-group vs. out-group encounter) X 2 (respondent as authority/decisionmaker vs. respondent as decision recipient) X 2 ( officer as course of treatment vs. Officer as target) between subjects randomized factorial that permits a strong test of all three theoretical factors above.  In addition, 400 civilians are surveyed about their encounter with a sub-sample of the police thus permitting a direct comparison of police and civilian perceptions of the fairness of police treatment.  The second study asks 400 trial court judges to report heir perceptions of their treatment of a litigant or a lawyer who recent appeared in their courtroom and asks the litigant or lawyer to also complete a questionnaire assessing their perception of the treatment.  The final study surveys 400 employees of organizations using the same design. These studies contribute to procedural justice theories as well as make an applied contribution in facilitating decision makers' efforts to implement procedures in a just manner.     ***",
