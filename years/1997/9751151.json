 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing an integrated course employing realistic techniques and procedures needed to affect Phase I and II property assessments of Brownfields. Brownfields are previously used industrial sites that are presently not being used because of an uncertailty regarding long-term costs. Through actions taken by the Ohio EPA, a property owner may have the contaminants on a property assessed, prepare the land for eventual use, and receive a \"covenant not to sue\" from the EPA. Once received, the covenant will limit the liability faced by a property owner. The Phase II property assessment requires the integration of sampling, sample preparation, and analytical procedures with quality control, quality assurance, and good laboratory practices. There is data that suggest that an integrated approach may provide students of environmental studies, chemistry, civil and environmental engineering, biology, and geology, with an increased appreciation of what is often presented as independent functions. The dependence of an analysis protocol on size and type of sample collected, type of container and preservatives, collection procedure, and the method of sample preparation is being presented in an integrated format. The new microwave oven is permitting reproducible and safe preparation of samples collected at local Brownfield sites and enabling students to experience analytical method development on instrumentation encountered in a working laboratory. Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption and Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometers are necessary instruments to affect a Brownfield site investigation. They are being networked, through the Internet, to a series of existing data stations, permitting the analysis and data processing of Brownfields samples in the laboratory courses.",
