 "awd_abstract_narration": "Patterns of primate growth and development (ontogeny) appear to be highly unusual relative to other mammals.  Unfortunately, the principles that govern these patterns remain poorly understood.  Therefore, this research project conducts an integrated study of growth and development in a group of closely-related African and Asian monkey species (baboons, mandrills, mangabeys, and macaques).  The project is designed to broaden, refine, and clarify our perspective on human ontogeny.  This research will help reveal connections between brain development and evolution that appear to have played a pivotal role over the course of  human evolution.  In addition, detailed comparisons between human and nonhuman primate ontogeny will be accomplished.  Consequently, it will be possible to establish whether or not humans are unique in exhibiting an adolescent skeletal growth spurt, resolving a long standing debate in theories of human evolution.  In order to attain these goals, the research conducts comparative analyses of ontogeny in fossil materials, living captive specimens, and wild-shot specimens.  A substantial portion of the study focuses on growth and development of the skull and skeletal system.  In addition, the project undertakes innovative analyses of growth hormones using data from captive colonies of baboons and mangabeys.  Hormonal analyses enable assessments of evolutionary changes in growth control.  Several other areas of research also will be explored.  For example, the study evaluates the relevance of developmental data to taxonomic questions, and conducts quantitative genetic analyses of growth and development.  Finally, the study has direct biomedical applications because baboons and mangabeys are important animal models of human diseases.",
