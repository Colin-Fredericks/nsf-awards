 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704255  Johnson    A variable-temperature scanning probe microscope will be  installed in an ultra-high-vacuum system that already consists of  two growth chambers for molecular beam epitaxy and a surface  analysis chamber.  One growth chamber is currently used for the  heteroepitaxy of fluoride and IV-VI (lead-salt) materials on  silicon, while the other growth chamber produces InSb-based  heterostructures.  Incorporating the requested instrumentation  with this growth facility will result in a powerful tool for in  situ characterization of surfaces produced during the epitaxial  growth of dissimilar materials.  This instrument will operate as  a scanning tunneling microscope or an atomic force microscope.  Samples can be studied at temperatures somewhat higher than the  typical growth temperatures and the same region of a sample can  imaged every time the sample is transferred from a growth chamber  to the microscope.  Materials research issues that will be  addressed include:  the effects of buffer layers in large-  mismatch heteroepitaxy; the atomic structure of novel surface  reconstructions; mechanisms of alloy ordering and clustering, and  dopant incorporation; and the real time progression of strain  relaxation for systems with thermal expansion mismatch.  Some  information derived from the proposed studies will uniquely apply  to the material studied, while some effects will be prototypical  of many materials.  As in the past, improved understanding of  such issues will clearly lead to improved heterostructures and  devices.  In addition to the direct research benefits,  acquisition of the instrument will enhance the training of  graduate students from several different departments through  interdisciplinary research using state-of-the-art facilities.  ***",
