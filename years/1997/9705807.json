 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705807  Sherman  It has been hypothesized that male steroid hormones, particularly testosterone (T), suppress immune system functions.  Males with high T levels are said to be less capable of mounting an immune response that males with lower T levels.  If so, males with high T levels should be more susceptible to infections and parasitic infestations.    To investigate this hypothesis, the PI will use as a vertebrate model, the red-winged blackbird.  Birds (24) will be captured locally and maintained in captivity for 10 months.  Each will be injected with a non-pathogenic antigen (KLH) in the (I) autumn (natural T levels low), (ii) early spring (rising T levels), (III) mid-spring (peak T levels, during breeding), and (iv) late-spring (T levels boosted higher with an implant).  At each sampling period, immunocompetence will be measured with an ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) that was developed for quantifying humeral immune responses (antibody production) in this species; T levels will be quantified with a radioimmunoassay.    This research will yield precise information on how naturally-produced and enchanced levels of steroid hormones affect immune functions in a wild vertebrate.  It will also help us to understand why only some males express exaggerated T-dependent secondary sexual characters (e.g., plumes, crests).  Perhaps only extremely high-quality males can produce such characters and also maintain levels of immunocompetence necessary for survival.  Females that choose these males as mates benefit their sons and daughters genetically.  This exploratory project thus merges three fields of research (immunology, endocrinology, and behavioral ecology) and promises to open up a new area of investigation into how interactions between the hormone and immune systems affect sexual selection.",
