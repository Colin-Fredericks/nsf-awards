 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706260    Caffarelli    The project involves free boundary problems and optimal transportation.  Free boundary problems arise naturally when a constitutive relation  or a conserved quantity (a temperature, a pressure, a density)  changes  discontinuously its behavior across some value of the variables under  consideration.  Typical examples are solid-liquid interphases,  burnt-unburnt mixtures in flame propagation, and flow in porous media.  Understanding of the geometry and stability of the solution  and its interphase is important to select and evaluate simulation methods,  as well as to understand the models themselves.  The theory of optimal transporation discusses how to transport a variable  x from a state S  to a state T in a least expensive fashion (or how  nature would  do so).  The variable x could represent goods, trainees,  information, or, as in the quasi-geostrophic model, optimal disposition of  air  masses. The links of these models to non-linear partial differential  equations need much further exploration.      The focus is on several fundamental problems of nonlinear analysis in two  areas: fast and abrupt transitions, allocation and optimal transportation theory.  Fast and abrupt transitions occur in many fields.  Typical examples are  the evolution of solid-liquid interphases in melting or solidification, the  propagation of gases or fluids in porous media or the elastic to plastic  transition in  some materials in  continuum mechanics. In the field of  financial mathematics there is the threshold state of variables after which an  option is executed, a good is restocked, or, in short, when a \"discontinuous\"  decision is taken. We study the stability of such processes, the way to simulate them  numerically, etc. The second area of interest consists of the  equations that model optimal transportation.  This arises for  instance  when goods must be delivered from one set of locations (warehouses) to  another (distribution points).  Of course we want to do it minimizing transp ortation costs.  Not surprisingly,  the basic equations governing this problem reappear in meteorology (the   quasi-geostrophic equations of front formation), where air masses \"transport\"  themselves optimally, and in the numerical simulation of different  fluid flows (lubrication, bubbles in fluids, etc.).  We hope that this  approach will provide a new understanding of the phenomena and better  computational techniques.",
