 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on developing fundamental ideas and techniques for designing  fault-tolerant and highly reliable systems at the register-transfer level. In  today's and future technologies failure mechanisms are many, including:  manufacturing spot defects, hot electron effects, crosstalk and  electro-migration. In this project, the investigator   is exploring techniques for design-for-fault-tolerance and design-for-reliability  during the register-transfer phase of a system design process. Also being  addressed are design methodologies for fault-tolerance enhancement and  reliability improvement based on the statistics and physics of the targeted  failures. Finally, software tools for the design of fault-tolerant and reliable  VLSI systems are being developed and will be incorporated into existing CAD  systems.  These research results are being integrated into the curriculum.",
