 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713968  Beard, Johnson    Abstract    This award supports a project to develop a chemical method for  fingerprinting biological activity in meteorites using the  isotopic composition of iron (Fe).  It is supported by the Office  of Polar Programs, the Chemistry Division, and the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities.  Development of a biological  chemical fingerprint will be useful in:    1) evaluating the recent interpretations that meteorite ALH84001  contains evidence of ancient biological activity on Mars, partly  in the form of ultra-fine-grained magnetite and sulfide iron  minerals that are inferred to have been formed by iron-reducing  bacteria;    2) screening extraterrestrial material for biological activity  (meteorites or samples returned from future missions to other  planets); and    3) establishing the time limits for the earliest life on Earth.    Biologically produced iron-bearing minerals are ubiquitous, and  many iron biominerals are produced by bacteria that reduce ferric  iron to ferrous iron, resulting in  formation of iron-oxides, -  sulfides, or -carbonates.  The metabolic pathway for iron  reduction is the same as that used by bacteria which reduce  sulfate to sulfide.  Bacteria reduction of sulfate can produce  large fractionations in sulfur-34 to sulfur-32 ratios.  By  analogy to sulfate-reducing bacteria, iron reducing bacteria are  expected to be capable of producing Fe isotope fractionations  that are on the order of those observed for sulfate reducing  bacteria, based on the relative mass spread of Fe and S isotopes.  This magnitude of fractionation is suggested by preliminary  studies of Fe isotopes by Dixon et al., who interpret the Fe  isotope ratio variations they measured in terrestrial samples to  reflect biologically-induced Fe isotope fractionation.    The scope of this research will be to establish a baseline for  the isotopic composition of inorganic iron by analysis of  inorganically produced Fe-bearing minerals from a variety of  physical settings .  Evaluating the Fe isotope fractionation  produced by biological processes will be conducted by analyzing  iron biominerals that were grown from isolated bacteria strains  in a controlled laboratory environment.  With these limits  established, it will be possible to use the isotopic composition  of Fe to evaluate if inferred iron biominerals in Martian  meteorite ALH84001 were produced inorganically or by biological  activity.",
