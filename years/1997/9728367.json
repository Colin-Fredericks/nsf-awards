 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728367  Knipple  Pheromone-based mating disruption has been used  commercially for about 15 years, and has been shown to be  an effective, environmentally benign approach to control  several major lepidopteran pests, of which the most  economically significant is the pink bollworm (Pectinophora  gossypiella).  In contrast to conventional insecticides,  pheromones are nontoxic and highly selective, and thus are  well suited for use in conjunction with other IPM  techniques.  Despite these advantages, pheromones have met  with only limited commercial success, owing largely to the  high costs of their synthesis via conventional chemistry.  Thus, the goal of this proposal is to develop novel, low  cost biosynthetic process steps employing genetic  technology for pheromone synthesis.     The specific focus of the proposed research is the unique  acyl-CoA desaturases present in the pheromone glands of  adult lepidopteran females, which catalyze the formation of  key unsaturated pheromone intermediates.  The investigator  will isolate and sequence cDNAs encoding fatty acid  desaturases from Pectinophora gossypiella (pink bollworm)  that catalyze intermediate steps in the biosynthesis of  lepidopterin pheromones, characterize the substrate  specificity of these desaturases by expressing the  desaturase genes in a desaturase deficient mutant of S.  cerevisiae and examining the spectrum of substrate  desaturation in vivo in this heterologous system, and  construct hybrid moth/yeast desaturases that have novel  substrate specificities.    ***",
