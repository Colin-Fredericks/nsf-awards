Both  aspects of the study lie at the intersection of geometry and topology,  on the one hand, and theoretical physics (quantum field theory and  string theory) on the other.  One aspect concerns gauge-theoretic  invariants of four-dimensional manifolds, in particular, the Donaldson  polynomial invariants and the Seiberg-Witten invariants.  Here the aim  is to understand the relation of these invariants to more classical  geometric descriptions of a four-manifold, for example, a handlebody  description.  The other aspect is the study of holomorphic vector  bundles over elliptically fibered manifolds and the relation of these  to families of K3 surfaces that arise in F-theory in mathematical  physics.  Here the aim is to establish mathematical results for both  sides of the putative F-theory duality and then to check that the  predictions of this duality do indeed hold.       There has been a resurgence in recent years of the interactions  between the areas of geometry and topology in mathematics and the areas  of quantum field theory and string theory in theoretical physics.  This  interaction has proved very fruitful for both disciplines -- the physics  brings new methods to the study of low dimensional spaces, and the  mathematics provides the framework in which the studies in theoretical  high-energy physics are done.  This project will investigate in more  detail two of these interactions.  One is the study of four-dimensional  spaces, using tools provided by theoretical physics.  These tools  have yielded much insight in the last few years, and there is much more  information about four-dimensional spaces that should be accessible  using these tools.  The other aspect of the project involves the  mathematics of a new physical theory.  This theory makes very precise  predictions about two kinds of mathematical objects that, on the face of it,  bear little relation to each other.  On the other hand, these mathemat ical  objects can be studied in their own right by purely mathematical tools  that have been developed independently of physics.  The results of the  mathematical analyses of these objects can be used to check the  predictions of the physical theory in much the same way as physical  experiments are used.  ***",
