 "awd_abstract_narration": "9531289   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project involves the development of a monolithic oxidation catalyst to control the release of CFCs (cholorofluorocarbons) and related compounds into the environment. The release of CFCs and related compounds is believed to play a significant role in the decline in the earth's ozone layer. Compounds intended to replace CFCs, which include HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons) and HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbons) also possess ozone-depleting properties. As a result, the release of these compounds must be controlled. Catalytic oxidation is a technology well suited for controlling vapor phase emissions. However, catalysts capable of oxidizing CFCs and related compounds have rapidly deactivated due to degradation of the catalyst in the harsh acid gas environment. Under the Phase I effort, the feasibility of using a Pt/m-ZrO2 catalyst was investigated. The catalyst was highly reactive and was able to destroy 1,000 ppm of R22, R113 and R134a without deactivation for over 100 hours of continuous operation. The objectives of the Phase II proposal are to first modify the catalyst formulation in an effort to maximize the reactivity and durability of the catalyst, then incorporate the catalyst into the washcoat of a monolith and evaluate the reactivity and durability of said material. To meet these objectives, key physical properties of the catalyst will be systematically varied, with selected materials being evaluated for reactivity and stability. Once optimized, monolithic catalysts will be prepared and evaluated for reactivity and durability against selected CFCs, HFCs and HCFCs over a wide range of process conditions. Based on results obtained during the Phase I effort, it is anticipated that the monolithic catalyst will possess sufficient reactivity and durability to be employed in commercial pollution abatement applications.   Technologies capable of economically controlling the release of CFCs and related compounds are currently unavailable. Should the n ovel catalyst developed in this Phase II effort prove successful, economic pollution abatement systems may be designed around the catalyst to meet the needs of a wide variety of applications which include controlling plant fugitive emissions and fume abatement.",
