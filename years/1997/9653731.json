 "awd_abstract_narration": "The science and mathematics faculty of Hampshire College are revising  and refining their program of Inquiry Project Courses (IPCs), which constitute the introductory requirement in all science disciplines.  The IPCs address specific, often interdisciplinary, topics of interest to students in courses such as Pollution and the Environment, The Biology of Fat, Human Gene Therapy, AgroEcology, Optics and Holography, and The Structure of Randomness.   Building on this successful existing program of inquiry courses, the faculty are systematically incorporating skill development so that each student can better carry out, within the course structure, an original research project in the lab, field or using the scientific literature.  Students in the Inquiry Project Courses are developing skills in several areas:  critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, asking and refining scientific questions, written communication and revision, oral communication, and collaborative research.  The emphasis on group projects within courses is a critical new addition, providing a stronger basis for launching students into scientific inquiry; previously, virtually all student projects were started in courses but completed in individual tutorials.   Goals of the enhancements in Inquiry Project Courses include: I) improving student access to science, 2) enhancing student learning through more collaborative work, 3) supporting the college-wide curriculum with its emphasis on research, and 4) making the research-based course model more adaptable for faculty use at diverse institutions.   The Inquiry Project Courses are being refined by faculty and students working together in the. initial summer and then implementing these improvements in the following two academic years.  The evaluation assesses whether the IPCs have achieved the same or better results than tutorials in terms of engagement, skills, and drawing students into science.  The models of investigative laboratory courses are being disseminated through regional  and national workshops and talks, presenting both examples of Inquiry Project Courses and general strategies for faculty at other institutions to follow in designing investigative courses for all levels and types of students.",
