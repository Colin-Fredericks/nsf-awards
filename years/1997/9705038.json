 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705038  Salamo  Information technology has become the defining technology for our  world. Ultra-fast delivery of information to anyone anywhere is  to be expected in the near future. Such technology must rely on  the development of ultra-fast microelectronics and information  pathways. Fiber optic pathways have demonstrated transmission  capacity characterized by extremely high bit rates over the  longest non-repeated distances. Though impressive capacities have  been achieved, today's systems utilize only a small fraction of  the potential transmission capacity available through optical  fibers. The main reason is that electronic-photonic components at  the input and output ends of the fiber pathways are not capable  of operating at the ultra-fast speeds which would be commensurate  with the fiber's potential band width. A new generation of  ultra-faster electronic-photonic materials and devices is needed.  This research endeavor is the focus of the proposal.         Parallel to the need for new ultra-fast devices, a window of  opportunity for corresponding entrepreneurial ventures has  opened. University spin-off companies, inspired by new ideas for   smaller, faster, lower power photonic-electronics can emerge  wherever the needed mix of vision, talent and support resides.  Given the potential for small companies to seed and grow in this   area, there is little doubt that the next few years will be  witness to a burgeoning microelectronics economy which can be  located anywhere in the United States.         The University of Arkansas has decided to seize the opportunity  for research and entrepreneurial ventures in this area. The  approach is based on: (i) frontier research and development of  new materials with the potential for ultra-fast performance; (ii)  formation and development of a competitive interdisciplinary team  of scientists, engineers and students with the talents needed to  forge achievements; (iii) initiation of an organization which  will build bridges to industry and entre preneurial opportunities  for faculty and students, (iv) formation of a Center for  Ultra-Fast Electronic-Photonic Materials and Devices, and (v) an  innovative educational program which provides enhanced career  opportunities for students.         The technical approach is based on the development of indium  phosphide, InP, cubic boron nitride, cBN, and polymers to produce  ultra-fast electronic-photonic components capable of advancing  the rate of processing of information to and from high bandwidth   pathways. This effort is built around a unique Molecular Beam  Epitaxy - Scanning Tunneling Microscope facility, making it  possible for the University of Arkansas to gain a strategic  foothold in the global race to advance the frontier of ultra-fast  electronic-photonic materials and devices and inspire  corresponding spin-off companies in Arkansas.",
