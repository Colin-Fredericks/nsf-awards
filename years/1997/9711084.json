 "awd_abstract_narration": "9711084  Hsu  Evidence from structural failures in past earthquakes clearly  shows that shear walls offer excellent protection to buildings in  seismic regions.  This project is to develop a rational approach  to understanding and predicting the behavior of low-rise shear  walls and framed shear walls under cyclic loading.    The overall concept behind this approach is that the complicated  behavior of shear walls as a whole system, can be elucidated by  integrating what can be learned, experimentally, about its parts  and components, visualized as being an assembly of membrane  elements (panels).  The stress-strain behavior of individual  membrane elements will be studied to establish physical and  analytical models.  The resulting models will then be integrated  into a finite element program to compute and predict the load-  deformation behavior of whole shear walls under specified  conditions.    A unique universal panel tester was constructed at the University  of Houston in 1988 which is especially suited for the intended  testing.  A test program of 25 wall panels subjected to cyclic  loading will be carried out.    The results from the cyclic tests on membrane elements will be  used to establish the cyclic constitutive laws of concrete.   Concrete behavior such as stiffness deterioration, strength  deterioration, and \"pinching\" of hysteretic loops will be  determined and then used to calibrate their corresponding  parameters in an analytical model established by El-Borgi.  The  calibrated hysteretic models will then enable a nonlinear finite  element computer program be formulated, which can be used to  predict the behavior of whole shear walls.    The University of Houston in the United States and the  Polytechnic School of Tunisia in Tunisia will jointly carry out  this research.  ***",
