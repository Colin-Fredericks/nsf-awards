However, the interior of a cell is neither dilute, nor homogeneous.  The intracellular  concentration of certain enzymes is orders of magnitude higher than the  concentrations commonly used to assay enzyme activity in vitro, and the  total protein concentration may be as high as 200 to 300 mg/ml.  In addition, a large body of theological, biochemical, and electron  microscopic evidence suggests that cytoskeletal filaments interact to  form a three-dimensional network in the cytoplasm.  This network may  present a barrier to diffusion as well as providing a framework that  allows cells to establish asymmetric shapes and resist mechanical stresses.  The translational diffusion of test particles in the cytoplasm of living cells is observed to be hindered in a size-dependent manner.  A model developed from studies of these test particles in solution  suggests that in living cells diffusion is slowed by a combination of collisions with other macromolecules and sieving by a network of  entangled or crosslinked filaments.  In addition, particles  50 nm in  radius are excluded from some subcompartments of the cytoplasmic volume.  Many of the intracellular components involved in protein synthesis,  respiration and particle transport are also absent from these compartments, raising the possibility that they represent functional, as well as structural differentiation's of the cytoplasm. Although it is presumed that the cytoskeleton is responsible for both hindered diffusion and the differential partitioning of large and small  particles, this has not been tested directly.   In response to mechanical stimuli, cytoplasm does not behave as a simple, visous fluid.  A variety of evidence indicates that cytoplasm is viscoelastic.  That is, interactions among its constituent macromolecul es prevent it from flowing freely under shearing stress and cause it to  recoil when the stress is removed.  The most likely source of the elasticity of cytoplasm is the cytoskeleton.  Individual cytoskeletal filaments are highly elastic and solutions of these filaments exhibit viscoelastic behavior similar to cytoplasm.  However, direct tests of this hypothesis are few and none of them have been carried out under physiological conditions.  The objectives of this proposal are to define the constraints on   diffusion in non-excluding compartments, to determine the role of each of the three main types of cytoskeletal filament in restricting the diffusion and partitioning of test particles, and to examine the contribution of these filaments to the material properties of cytoplasm.  A multi-disciplinary approach will be employed, combining microinjection of proteins and inert fluorescent test particles into living cells,  fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and single particle tracking  to measure intracellular diffusion coefficients, and digital fluorescence microscopy to study the partitioning of injected molecules.  The mechanical response of cytoplasm to physiological tensile stress will be studied by using microinjected fluorescent microspheres as  markers of cytoplasmic deformation.  Drug treatments and molecular  genetics techniques will be used to disrupt specific subsets of cytoskeletal filaments.  Fluorescent antibody localization of endogenous  molecules will be used to correlate effects on the diffusion and  partitioning of test particles or on the mechanics of cytoplasm with  changes in the cytoskeleton.  Ultimately,  the information obtained from this research should lead to a better understanding of how cytoarchitecture affects the kinetics and mechanisms of biochemical reactions in the living cell, the transport and localization of intracellular components and the mechanical responses of cells.      Non Technical    The interior of cells is a fluid space termed cytoplasm that  has been characterized as a solution in which various subcellular structures freely move.  Recent results indicate that this model is incorrect and that the cytoplasm is highly structured.  Cytoplasmic structure is maintained by filaments of the cytoskeleton that traverse through the cell.  Dr. Luby-Phelps will study how the various components of the cytoskeleton mediate the partition of the cytoplasm into distinct domains.  Her research will define how the filaments of cytoskeleton constrain particles within the cytoplasm into specific domains.  This research is important because it addresses a fundamental question of how the fluid environment contained within all living cells is organized to facilitate the activities necessary to maintain the living state.  ***",
