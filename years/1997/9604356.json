 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding  the biophysical properties of single  neurons  and   how   they  process  information  is  fundamental   to  understanding  how  the  brain works.  Previous  studies  of  signaling  in  neuronal processes were limited to  electrode  recordings from a single site and to high-resolution imaging  experiments  using  intracellular  ion-indicators.  However,  regional    electrical    properties    of    neurons    are  extraordinarily complex and impossible to understand in  the  absence of detailed, spatially well resolved measurements of  electrical  signals. Recent developments in this  laboratory  now  permit monitoring membrane potential transients at many  sites   by   an  optical  imaging  technique  that   employs  intracellular voltage-sensitive dyes.     The long-term goal  is  to  use the information about individual nerve cells  as  the  basis for understanding of the fundamental question  of  how  networks of  interconnected neurons operate to  control  behavior.  The  main  objective  of  this  proposal  is   to  investigate by direct measurement how one particular  neuron  is   functionally   organized  and  to  build   a   complete  biophysical compartmental model.  The model would  represent  a  full  description of the computational  properties  of  a  nerve cell. For instance, the obtained information  will  be  used  to  test  directly  the   hypothesis  that  individual  neurons  can  be functionally subdivided, with some  of  the  processes   functioning as independent units. If true,  this  postulate   would  have  important  implications   for   the  functional complexity of individual neurons.      Individual  nerve   cells  will  be  selectively  stained  in  situ   by  intracellular application of  a membrane impermeant  voltage-  sensitive  fluorescent dye. Propagation of and  interactions  between  electrical signals evoked by stimulating  the  cell  will be  analyzed by optically monitoring voltage transients  at  multiple  sites  in  the soma  and  neuro nal  processes.  Standard  electrophysiological techniques for recording  and  stimulation  and  advanced modeling software  will  also  be  used.  One exemplar neuron, the giant metacerebral  cell  of  the  land snail Helix, will be characterized in detail.  The  complete description will include: (1) determination of  the  number,  size,  and  position of spike  trigger  zones;  (2)  determination  of  the propagation properties  of  different  axonal   branches;   (3)  determination   of   the   spatial  distribution  of  synaptic  inputs;  (4)   determination  of  spatial  and electrical distances between trigger zones  and  functionally  important  parts  of  the  neuron  (sites   of  synaptic  contacts and axonal branch  points).  The  results  of  this  analysis  will bear on the basic  neuroscience  of  signaling.",
