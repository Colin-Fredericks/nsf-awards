 "awd_abstract_narration": "Frank  9728962       The ecological limitations on successful hibernation and  subsequent over-winter survival by small mammals are poorly  understood. How natural selection influences the evolution of  hibernation is thus unknown. Recent laboratory studies with 8  rodent species and 2 marsupials have revealed that the level of  unsaturated fatty acids in the diet detE:D~dne; the hibernation  ability of small mammals. In these studies, it was found that  there is an optimal level of linoleic acid (a polyunsaturated  fatty acid) that must be present in the diet for maximal  hibernation ability, above or below which hibernation  performance is greatly compromised. It has also been shown that  high levels of oleic acid (a monounsaturated fatty acid) are  also required in the diet for proper hibernation. Mammals can  synthesize ~K~K~nrirburabed fatty acids, but they are incapable  of synthesizing polyunsaturated fatty acids.       Although the biochemical basis of this influence of dietary  fatty acids on hibernation ability unknown, it is quite clear  that these findings have strong ecological implications which  may explain the biogeographical distribution of hibernating  mammals, and the role of dietary specialization in the  evolution of hibernation. Despite this potential, there have  been no studies to date examining how the natural diets of  hibernating mammals vary in fatty acid composition, or how this  affects over-winter survival under natural conditions.                     The PI predicts that dietary fatty acid  composition influences the over-winter survival of free-ranging  S. lateralis, and that this influence is more pronounced in  areas where the hibernation period is longer.       These hypotheses will be tested in field and laboratory  studies involving S. lateralis from the White Mountain of  California. This will be the first study to examine the  relationship between dietary fatty acid composition and the  over-winter survival of a free-ranging hibernator.",
