 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT   DMS-9707022    The Twenty-first Summer Real Analysis Symposium will be held on the  University of Tennessee at Chattanooga campus June 18-21, 1997. The  chairperson for the meeting will be Harry Miller, Head of the UTC  Mathematics Department. Professors Ali Alikhani, Paul Humke and  Clifford Weil will serve on the organizing committee. It is anticipated  that  new results will be presented from the fields of one  dimensional dynamics, generalized derivatives and integration theory.   As in the past the symposium will continue to establish links to  different but related areas of analysis such as harmonic analysis,   measure theory and analytic set theory.   This conference will act as a staging area for future joint     research projects and will assist graduate students (it is   anticipated that several will attend) and junior faculty    along their career paths.      The Summer Real Analysis Symposium that will take place on   the campus of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga on   June 18-21,1997 has multiple objectives. The participants of the   Symposium will run the spectrum from graduate students, to untenured   young professors to established stars in the field of real analysis.   This mix, with three of the four invited  principal speakers being    young mathematicians, who already have very fine track records,   should be very stimulating for all the participants.   These symposia have been  successful in generating both   collaborative and independent research activity. The Chattanooga   symposium will be  attended by a  number of mathematicians   from Canada and Europe.",
