 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project from Technology International Incorporated of Virginia (located in LaPlace, LA) focuses on research leading to a complete set of specifications of features and applications of a computer-based, illustrated, interactive American Sign Language/Science (ASL) Dictionary for deaf and hearing impaired children.  Since deaf and hearing impaired children have a greater challenge in gaining fluency in English, traditional dictionaries are often of limited value as a means to acquiring knowledge.  The goal of this research project is to provide a means of expressing, teaching, and learning technical terms and science concepts in ASL as well as in English, using a format that makes academic content more accessible to children who are deaf and which promotes self-study.  The outcome of the Phase II research will be identification of the content, user-interface, and mode of presentation of the dictionary as well as incorporation of ASL features in a way that is unavailable in the extant educational material designed for deaf children.  The combination of ASL, written English, animation and graphics will enhance the learning of the English terms and the underlying science concepts.  The software architecture of the dictionary will allow for implementation on IBM-compatible and Macintosh platforms, as well as allowing accessibility over the World Wide Web.   As a resource, the Multimedia ASL Science Dictionary has various applications in the special education arena, inasmuch as it would reinforce both the learning of sign language as well as science concepts among children who are deaf.  The concept can be applied to a diverse body of education materials for a wide range of population, such as illustrated dictionaries for adults, games, entertainment, and training products.  In particular, the utility of the concept of such a dictionary extends to materials for English-as-a-Second Language (ESL) learners.",
