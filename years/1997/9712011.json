 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wind testing facilities in the United States are generally  limited to small scale and component testing. A very small  number of the existing full-scale facilities carry out only  partial destructive tests. To improve the understanding of  the action of extreme wind on structural systems large scale  facilities are needed which can model real structures at or  near full-scale to the point of total destruction.  Currently, different concepts for such a facility are being  investigated. A workshop will take place on May 1st. and  2nd., 1997 in Arlington, Virginia, to critically examine the  merits and shortcomings of these various concepts. The  American Association for Wind Engineering (AAWE)) will  organize this workshop with the purpose of evaluating and  recommending the concepts that meet the needs of the wind  engineering research community. A report on the discussions  and findings will be published and disseminated nationally  and internationally.",
