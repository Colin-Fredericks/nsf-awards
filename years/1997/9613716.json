Vogel    Astronomy with the BIMA Array    The Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array (BIMA) is a millimeter-wave  interferometer presently made up of 9 six-meter diameter  antennas; at least two other antennas will be added to the array  during the next 5 years. located at Berkeley's Hat Creek Radio  Observatory, BIMA was jointly capitalized and is jointly operated  by the University of California at Berkeley, the University of  Illinois and the University of Maryland through a combination of  NSF and State funding.    These awards are for identical proposals submitted simultaneously  by each institution, and support astronomical research,  technological development and student training carried out at the  BIMA array. Astronomical research at BIMA includes high  resolution studies of solar system objects, stellar envelopes,  star-forming regions in the Galaxy, and molecular clouds in  external galaxies. Notable accomplishments during the past three  years at BIMA include expansion from 6 to 9 elements, and the  extension of the array baselines to provide angular resolutions  better than 0.5 arcsecond. These technical advancements permitted  BIMA scientists to obtain the first resolved image of a young  circumstellar disk, and to discover a molecular bar at the core  of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, and to confirm the discovery of  interstellar acetic acid. Scientific plans under the new award  will focus heavily on exploiting the recently-achieved higher  speed and resolution of the array. In the technical domain, BIMA  staff will concentrate attempting to use total power fluctuations  to remove the phase fluctuations caused by the atmosphere when  operating over long baselines.",
