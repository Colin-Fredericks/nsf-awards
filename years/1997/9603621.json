 "awd_abstract_narration": "Barbehenn  9603621         Oxidative stress is caused by reactive oxygen species  (ROS), such as free radicals.  The consequences of ROS in  herbivorous insects range from no effect, in well-protected  species, to reduced growth or death, in species that are  less well protected.  The ingestion of prooxidant  chemicals  in plants can greatly exacerbate the production of ROS.  Research on the ways insects are protected from ROS has  focused on the role of antioxidative enzymes in the gut  tissues, rather than on mechanisms that may exist in the  lumen of the gut.  This work is designed to determine the  effectiveness of defenses that may exist in the gut lumen,  where ROS are first formed.  The investigators will test a  general hypothesis that the detrimental effects of  prooxidants on susceptible insects are the results of  ineffective defenses against ROS generated in the gut  lumens, whereas well-protected insects have effective  defenses against  ROS in their gut lumens.  The importance  of this work lies, in part, in developing a better  understanding of the different antioxidative strategies of  herbivorous insects that enable them to feed on \"toxic\"  plants.",
