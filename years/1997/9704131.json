The feasibility of this approach has been fully proven in Phase I.   Through replacement of  bronze-processed wire by internal tin wire, high field NMR system cost will be reduced significantly.  The Phase II research objective is to build, test and evaluate the proposed full scale prototype NMR magnet.  To achieve the objectives, Cryomagnetics, Inc. proposes a technical approach consisting of testing stability of each NbTi and Nb3Sn coil separately under persistent mode operation to insure each coil's performance, and then assembling coils and testing the magnet.  At the end of Phase II research, a full scale prototype 600 MHz wide bore high resolution NMR magnet will be developed and fully tested.  This prototype magnet will be the selling point for the Phase III program--the commercialization of 600 MHz wide bore high resolution NMR magnets.    The new technologies developed in Phase I and II will generate great commercial impact by reducing NMR system cost.  The proposed wide bore NMR magnet system will be ideal for micro-imaging and  in vivo spectroscopy as well as biological solid state NMR spectroscopy.  The successful completion of Phase II of this project will make inexpensive, wide bore, high field NMR magnets available in the market.  ***",
