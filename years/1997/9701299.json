 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701299  Pringle  Tropical streams are typically characterized by an abundance of omnivorous fishes and shrimps; however little is known about the relative roles of these macroconsumers in structuring stream communities. These species typically have migratory life cycles, inhabiting both lowlands and headwaters during their lifetime. High levels of water withdrawal from lower stream reaches are resulting in direct mortality of these biota and changes in their distribution and abundance. Proposed research will determine the effects of fishes and shrimps on benthic community structure along the continuum of the Rio Espiritu Santo in northeastern Puerto Rico.  In this study, the following questions will be addressed: (1) Do omnivorous fishes and shrimps significantly affect patterns of sediment accrual (i.e. the benthic depositional environment)?; (2) Do trophic cascades occur when omnivorous fishes and shrimps are excluded? and (3) How do effects of fishes and shrimps vary along the stream continuum? Effects of fishes and shrimps on insects, algal resources, and sediment accrual will be experimentally examined by manipulating their presence and absence at three sites along the river continuum using an in situ electric exclosure technique. Proposed research will provide information on the role of omnivory in structuring a tropical stream community and will expand our previous studies of effects of fishes and shrimps on leaf decomposition to include their effects on primary producers, sedimentation, and community structure along the river continuum. This research will also enhance our ability to predict how these threatened stream ecosystems respond to anthropogenic disturbance.",
