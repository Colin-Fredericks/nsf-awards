 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dan Neumark of the University of California at Berkeley is supported by   the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities to use his newly developed time-resolved   experimental technique, anion femtosecond photoelectron spectroscopy   (FPES) to investigate the photodissociation and reaction dynamics of   negative ions.  Specifically, he will use this method to probe the   potential energy surfaces governing photodissociation and bimolecular   reaction processes in isolated and clustered negative ions.  In anion   FPES, a femtosecond (fs) pump laser excites a negative ion to a   dissociative electronic state; the evolving system that results is   photodetached with a fs probe pulse and the photoelectron spectrum is   measured.  The photoelectron spectrum as a function of pump-probe delay   yields a picture of the dynamics initiated by the probe pulse.  Neumark   will first apply FPES to the isolated anion, then to the anion   chromophore in a size-selected cluster.  Systems to be investigated   include clusters of iodine dimer anions solvated with carbon dioxide or   water, bare or clustered iodine trimer anions, ozone anions and carbonate   anions, and time-resolved anion-molecule reactions.    Negative ions play important roles in atmospheric and solution phase   chemistry.  Results of this research will find immediate application in   chemical kinetics and spectroscopy, with subsequent application in   modeling a wide range of physico-chemical phenomena, such as atmospheric   pollution and transmission of optical and radio frequency waves in the   normal and perturbed atmosphere.  In addition, these studies should shed   new light on the nature of chemical reactions in solution, and the   methods may eventually be of utility in the study of protein dynamics.",
