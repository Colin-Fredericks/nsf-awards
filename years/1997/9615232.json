 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to participate in a new ice core deep drilling effort in North Greenland (NGRIP).  The effort will be led by the Danish ice core group with participation for scientists from six other nations.  This proposal is to measure stable isotope ratios of snow and ice in collaboration with scientists in Denmark and France.  Stable isotope ratios in snow record changes in air temperature, and are thus a basic component of ice coring efforts as they provide a temperature record of the past. The focus is on the isotopic record from the last millennium, and from sharp transitions in the past.  Comparisons with historical records of climate change have shown that isotopes in Greenland ice record regional scale climate change.  As the ice core records are extended into the past and compared with other proxy records of climate change, we are seeing that different modes of climate behavior may have existed prior to the historical record.  Thus, ice cores contain and annually resolvable record of past climate which can help form the baseline against which future climate fluctuations and shifts can be measured.  Also, previous ice cores from Greenland have shown that large and rapid climate changes, as much as temperature changes in only a few years, have occurred in the past. These changes need to be confirmed and models constructed to explain how they occurred in the past, and if they could occur in the future.   Finally, the nature of interglacial climate is an unresolved issue that needs to be addressed.  Past results from ice cores have suggested that the last interglacial was highly variable.  This result is questionable, however, and needs to be confirmed with a new deep ice core in Greenland.",
