Geochemical signatures potentially attributable to Fe(III)- and humics-reducing microorganisms have been found in modern and ancient extreme environments on Earth as well as on Mars.  However, there has been little investigation of Fe(III)- and humics-reducing microorganisms in extreme environments. The goal of this research is to recover Fe(III)- and humics-reducing microorganisms from a variety of extreme environments and to study their metabolism and potential geochemical impacts. A major focus will be on geothermal environments because they are considered to be analogs for the environmental conditions that may have supported life on early Earth and possibly other planets. Other extreme environments that may provide insights into potential forms of microbial metabolism on other planets such as cold soils and sediments from polar regions, alkaline and hypersaline environments, as well as acidic mine drainage will also be studied.    These studies are expected to suggest geochemical and/or biochemical signatures that may be used to evaluate the previous presence of Fe(III)- and humics-reducing microorganisms in ancient environments on Earth or other planets. These studies should greatly increase our understanding of the diversity of microorganisms capable of Fe(III) and humics reduction and may yield insights into the potential role of Fe(III) and external organic electron acceptors in the evolution of microbial respiration. Furthermore, the potential application of Fe(III) and humics reducers for environmental restoration, the recovery of precious metals, and the production of valuable minerals suggests that Fe(III) and humics reducers recovered from extreme environments may have economic value.",
