 "awd_abstract_narration": "One  of  the most important aspects in learning  how  to  do  research  is  early  and  detailed  discussions  on  various  aspects  of  the  research  plan with  experienced  mentors.  Unfortunately,  most students get little feedback  on  their  thesis  at  the  initial stages except from their  immediate  advisors.  Attending conferences can be a good way  to  meet  other researchers and discuss work.  However, the chances of  a  student  at  an early stage of his/her work  getting  the  opportunity  to  discuss their preliminary ideas  with  well  established  researchers are not very  good.   The  Doctoral  Consortium  (DC) at the American Association for  Artificial  Intelligence conference was planned as a way to improve this  situation.   Students about to begin their thesis  work  are  chosen  to present their research plans in front of a  group  of carefully selected faculty panelists.  Unlike traditional  conference presentations, the bulk of the time in  a  DC  is  devoted  to discussions between the students and the faculty  panelists.   Each student is also assigned a faculty  mentor  who  works  with  the  student at  a  more  detailed  level.  Students learn from both their own presentations as well  as  watching  other  students  being  advised  by  the   faculty  panelists.  A survey taken after the first DC held last year  found  all participants (both students and faculty) agreeing  that the DC was tremendously useful.  We anticipate that all  students  attending the DC this year (both as presenters  as  well  as  those  just  attending) will  leave  with  renewed  confidence  in  their work, suggestions for improving  their  thesis  plans  and  a clearer idea of what constitutes  good  research practice.",
