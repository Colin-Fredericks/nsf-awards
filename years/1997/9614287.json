This award supports continued research  on the chronology of ice retreat from the western Ross Sea and an  extension of areal coverage for this research to include the east-  central Ross Sea.  The study will use a series of piston, Kasten,  and grab samples from research cruises in 1994 and 1995 on the  RVIB N.B. Palmer by researchers from Rice University, University  of Colorado, Boulder, and Hamilton College.  Various physical and  biological parameters of the cores will be used to map changes in  the environments over time with a concentration on sediment  properties, foraminifera, and diatoms.  At this time, ninety-two  carbon-14 dates (plus 18 pending dates, all based on accelerator-  mass-spectrometry) have been obtained from cores collected prior  to 1994 and from the 1994 and 1995 cruises by the research groups  at Hamilton College and the University of Colorado, Boulder.  Emphasis will be placed on obtaining additional radiocarbon dates  supplemented by several other chronological methods including:  sources and ages of volcanic ashes, uranium-series dating of  solitary corals, and amino acid racemization.  The three major  research questions are:  1) What was the position of the  grounding line during the Last Glacial Maximum from the western  to east-central Ross Sea and what was the timing of retreat from  this limit, was it synchronous across the region, and what was  the rate of retreat ?  2) Is there evidence from the history of  carbonate accumulation on the outer shelf banks, and from cores  on the slope of the Ross Sea that th e ice was grounded on the  shelf break at some time prior to marine isotope stage (MIS) 2,  possibly at MIS 4 (Goodwin, person. commun. 1996)?  3) What are  the paleoenvironments in the areas of the Ross Sea at the  millenial/century time-scales during the latest Pleistocene and  the Holocene? In particular, what is the history of changes in  surface water productivity and sea ice extent?",
