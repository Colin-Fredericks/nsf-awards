 "awd_abstract_narration": "Taylor  9702885  This award provides funds for the principal investigator to continue his research into the relationship between representations of Galois groups and automorphic forms. There is, of course, an extensive conjectural framework in this area (Langlands' conjectures, supplemented by other conjectures such as Serre's conjecture and the Mazur-Tilouine conjecture).  In a sense there are two problems here. The first problem is attaching Galois representations to modular forms and, and the second is attaching modular forms to Galois representations. Until recently, most work, including the investigator's, focused on the first problem. Taylor worked on constructing Galois representations for Hilbert modular forms, genus 2 Siegel modular forms and modular forms for GL(2) over an imaginary quadratic field. He made heavy use of ``congruence techniques''. There are still fascinating open questions on this problem, but the PI's present interest has now shifted to the second problem.  Until recently there was only really one isolated result on the second problem --the Langlands-Tunnell theorem. The situation changed when Andrew Wiles initiated, and he and the PI completed, a proof that a suitable l-adic lift of a modular mod l representation was itself modular.  Combined with the Langlands-Tunnell theorem this proved the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture for semi-stable elliptic curves and hence (by the Frey-Serre-Ribet argument) Fermat's Last Theorem. Also using this work, Nick Shepherd-Barron and the PI have recently managed to show that many mod 5 and mod 2 icosahedral representations are modular. In the immediate future, the PI will look at extensions of these arguments. One extension is to relax the conditions on the ramification of the lift at l. Another direction to extend the argument to higher dimensional representations and automorphic forms on unitary groups. In the medium term, the PI will investigate whether or not this result can shed light on the Artin conjecture for 2-dimensional odd ic osahedral representations.    This project falls into the general area of arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.",
