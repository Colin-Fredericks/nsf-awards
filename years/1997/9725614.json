The promise of  microstructural engineering of ceramics relies in large part on  the ability to manipulate interface structure and chemistry.  Powder processing techniques for producing high density ceramics  rely on our ability to control short and long range forces at  surfaces and internal interfaces in a reproducible way.  Silicon  nitride and some electronic ceramics, such as lead ruthanate,  have unique properties as a result of short range surface forces  that create stable intergranular layers on the order of one  nanometer thick.  New measurement tools and new advances in  theory have enabled us to take a fresh look at our understanding  of the structure, chemistry, and properties of interfaces.  The  aims of this Gordon Research Conference are to examine new  interface phenomena from fundamental scientific and engineering  points of view, to take a critical look at interface science as  it applies to ceramic interfaces, and to learn how to exploit  these phenomena in materials and interface design.  The  conference format, in keeping with all Gordon Research  Conferences, consists of formal presentations by invited speakers  with roughly half of each session devoted to in depth discussion.  In addition, a poster session will be held which enables  conference participants, especially graduate students, to present  their current research ideas in areas relevant to the conference  theme.  %%%  The theme of the 1997 Gordon Research Conference for Solid State  studies in Ceramics, to be held August 3-8, 1997, at Kimball  Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire is New Perspectives in  Interface Science: From Fundamentals to Practice.
