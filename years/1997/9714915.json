This research in  ultrafast optoelectronics developed out of an  earlier collaboration (INT-9022623) between PI  Shah and co-PI Arora of TIFR that established  the first and only picosecond spectroscopy  laboratory in India.  The scientific focus is:  (1) energy relaxation processes and rates in  low-dimensional semiconductors and the effect  of relaxation dynamics on the performance of  optoelectronic devices fabricated from such  structures; (2) development of fabrication and  characterization techniques for photoconducting  switches and electro-optic samplers, and (3)  the use of such optoelectronic devices for  measuring the response of ultrafast electronic  devices.    Scope:  This award will provide the linkage  costs for US and Indian collaborators.  The  research, while in the realm of fundamental  physics, is in an emerging area that combines  ultrafast optics and electronics.  The topic is  of considerable current interest and the  devices under study may in the future be  integral to all communication and computer  systems.  In addition to initiating new  scientific collaborations, this project will  contribute toward the ultrafast spectroscopy  laboratory at TIFR becoming a world-class  facility.  All the experimental work will be  performed at TIFR and will include advanced  graduate students and postdocs.  The scientific  and technological benefits are mutual and the  research results will be published in  international journals.          ***",
