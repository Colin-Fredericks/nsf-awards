The Post-Doctoral Fellow will be  able to benefit from the expertise of both groups, and will act  as catalyst for transfer of knowledge between them.    The Post-Doctoral Fellow will be expected to help develop a  mathematical framework for the valuation of American-style  derivative securities on interest-sensitive (fixed-income)  instruments, and to develop accurate and fast numerical  techniques.  The problem is of considerable practical  importance, and requires advanced mathematical tools, such as  stochastic differential equations, martingales and optimal  stopping, partial differential equations and Monte-Carlo  simulations.        Department of Mathematics, Columbia University, New York, NY    Morgan-Stanley & Co., Incorporated, New York, NY    This project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS)",
