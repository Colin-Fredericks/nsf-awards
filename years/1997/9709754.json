 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computational Science in Biomedical Systems (CSBS) Group at Tulane University consists of faculty in both the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Biomedical Engineering.  These faculty are leading researchers in scientific computing, numerical analysis, mathematical biology, fluid mechanics and electrophysiology. Although these two departments are in different colleges within the University, the scientific and educational goals of the co-investigators are consistent and complementary.   For example, the techniques of applied mathematics and numerical analysis ought to be studied in the context of relevant physical systems.  In addition, the technical advances in scientific computing, as well as traditional applied mathematics,  must be  tools of a successful biomedical engineer.     This Group Infrastucture Grant will help  to blur the lines  between these disciplines, and provide a critical mass of investigators, so that the research and educational activity of the Group may flourish.   Tulane University, although a Carnegie 1 Research University, is small enough so that the atmosphere is one of a small liberal arts college.  Undergraduates frequently engage in research projects, with both faculty and graduate students as mentors.  The GIG funds will enable undergraduates to  participate in exciting interdisciplinary research through summer internships, courses, and seminars.   The funds will also provide training for three graduate students and two postdoctoral fellows.  The research activities will focus upon, but not be limited to,  pulmonary fluid mechanics, cardiac-electrophysiology, and medical applications of biofilm processes. The educational activities include a weekly journal club,  a seminar series, as well as the coordination of curricula in both departments.    Funding for this activity will be provided by the Division of Mathematical Science,  the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the Division Of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems.",
