 "awd_abstract_narration": "Founded in 1847, The City College of New York is nationally and internationally recognized as an institution with a diverse student body and strong graduate and undergraduate programs in basic and applied research in science and engineering. To maintain research excellence, the City College has made a commitment to improve the scientific infrastructure by renovating and refurbishing 40 research laboratories and support facilities in the Marshak Science and Physical Education Building, home to the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, and Physics.  With assistance from the NSF, laboratories and support facilities utilized by two highly successful research centers, the Center for Analysis of Structures and Interfaces  (CASI) and the Center for the Study of the Cellular and Molecular Basis of Development will be modernized.  CASI scientists are currently  interested in three areas involving the usage of light and its properties to study the structure and dynamical processes of molecules adsorbed on surfaces of materials; the development of new materials composed of small numbers of elements; and the usage of ultrafast laser techniques for light based, optical computers of the future.  On going research in the Center for the Study of the Cellular and Molecular Basis of Development focuses on biological structure and function, gene expression and regulation, and cell and organism function.  Current infrastructure conditions negatively impact research and research training activities by creating an environment incompatible with quality research, thus limiting the prospect of expanding research opportunities. Renovations will include redesigning space for greater utility,  replacing and installing lab benches, fume hoods, storage cabinets, and other fixed equipment.  Upon completion, the renovations will provide an environment conducive to academic and scientific pursuits and one that is attractive to researcher scholars.  In addition to enhanced productivity, students underrepresented in science will be better trained and therefore able to compete in an increasingly competitive job market.",
