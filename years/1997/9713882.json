 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the development of a trade-off based robust modeling and design methodology for identification of statistically optimal product specifications.  This research will exploit concepts from utility theory into a robust design paradigm to quantitatively incorporate qualitative knowledge and preferences of different attributes without loss of generality and accuracy.  Statistical exploration based design of experiment techniques will be developed to explore and generate system behavioral information, and to identify optimal product specifications from this quantitative representation of attribute data.  By incorporating explicit representation of higher level modeling and design knowledge in the design process, an interactive design system will be developed to enable designers make intelligent decisions during the design process.  Industry-driven design problems will be used as case studies to test and evaluate the proposed methodology.      If successful, this research will result in a unified methodology that offers a rigorous treatment of design process from an overall design perspective under conditions of uncertainty in data.  The primary goal of this research involves the determination of a trade-off based decision model formulation for direct and simultaneous treatment of multiple objectives and constraints in the design process, and its integration with a statistical exploration based robust optimal design generation strategy.  This research could lead to a better understanding of the engineering modeling process, and advance the state of knowledge by which the inherent complexities arising from representing physical design problems using idealized computer-based abstractions can be addressed.  Results of this research will also contribute towards the identification of a consistent body of synergistic, integrated engineering design methods based on design of experiments, utility theory, computer-based simulation models, finite element methods, and design optimization principles.",
