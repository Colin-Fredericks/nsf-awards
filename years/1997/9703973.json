 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703973  Khan       The Chemical Engineering Department at North Carolina  State University (NCSU) will purchase a Gel Permeation  Chromatography /Static Light Scattering  system to obtain  critically needed information in polymer, membrane and colIoid  science research. The equipment will be used for several funded  projects, including (1) The Influence of Chain Configuration  and Composition on the Extraordinary Permeation Properties of  Substituted Polyacetylene Vapor Separation Membrane Materials;  (2) Gas Transport and Barrier Properties of Novel Aromatic  Polyamides; (3) Enzymatic modification of water soluble  polymers; (4) Composite Polymer Electrolytes Using Fumed  Silica; (5) Synthesis Rheology and Microstructure of Polymer  Grafted Latex Systems for Water-borne Inks; and  (6) Asphaltene  and Discotic Mesogen Aggregation in Model Solvent System:  Effect of Aggregat on Emulsion Stability. To sustain these  strong research program and provide for new and innovative  research, a modern gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) / static  light scattering system (SLS) is essential. The GPC/SLS system  would provide the capability to determine molecular weight,  molecular weight distribution and chain configuration of block  copolymers substituted polyacetylenes that are being developed  as membrane materials, enzymatically modified guar  galactomannans for use in food and oil/gas applications, and  graft comb polymers that are being synthesized as low  water-borne inks. The success and completion of each of these  projects hinges on information obtained using the acquired  instrumentation. A sensitive GPC/S is required to characterize  microstructures resulting from polymer-fumed silica-lithium ion  interactions in novel polymer electrolyte materials.  This  instrument will also have the capability to measure the size,  topology, and fractal dimension of asphaltene aggregates.  These new capabilities will provide crucial information for the  growing interdisciplinary research program in polymer rh eology,  membrane, and colloid sciences at NCSU and enable it to remain  strong and vital in the years ahead.  The acquired equipment  would also play a major role in training undergraduates in the  newly-created polymer and colloid science track in the BS  Chemical Engineering program.  ***",
