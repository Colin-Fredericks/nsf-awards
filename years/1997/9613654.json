The work is divided into four tasks: 1) the construction of  the fuzzy rule-based model relating the time series of daily  Atmospheric Circulation Pattern CP types with flood events  characteristics and drought occurrence severity index; 2)  use of GCM based climate change scenarios to generate  possible future time series of CP type and consequential  flood and drought probabilities; 3) investigate the  uncertainties in the approach and the socio-economic  consequences of these uncertainties; and 4) develop and rank  robust mitigating actions.  The benefits from this research  are expected to be:  an easy-to-use model that will yield  time series of possible floods and droughts under climate  change that can be updated and coupled and can accept fuzzy  forecasts; and inventory of social and economic  consequences; an inventory of mitigation actions with a  preliminary criteria ranking of these actions; and the  application of the model to the upper Rio Grande and the  Missouri River basins.  ***",
