 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Gramila  This grant will support a Research Experiences for  Undergraduates (REU) site in the physics department of The  Pennsylvania State University at the University Park campus  during 1997.  The REU site will involve 14-20 students in  research projects each summer.  Students will be involved in  projects covering a wide range of frontier research. Such  involvement has been demonstrated in the department's  extensive record of undergraduate research.  As an REU site, the Penn State physics department will mount  an aggressive campaign to recruit students into the program,  with a wide recruitment area covering Pennsylvania and  surrounding, mid-Atlantic region states.  Active efforts to  encourage minority student enrollment will include personal  visits to targeted HBCU physics departments at Morehouse,  Clark-Atlantic and Cheyney, and will make use of the  Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC) of the Big 10  schools.  In addition to their own research projects, students will  attend special weekly seminars designed to broaden their  knowledge of physics and encourage interaction with faculty.  The summer program is completed in a day long seminar in  which talks by the student participants are presented  describing their research projects.  Throughout the program,  emphasis will be placed on encouraging the students'  interest in careers in physics.  ***",
