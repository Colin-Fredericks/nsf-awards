 "awd_abstract_narration": "The San Antonio Pre-Freshman Engineering Program (PREP) is based  within the College of Science and Engineering at the  University of  Texas at San Antonio (UTSA).  The program was established in 1979  at UTSA and has now been extended to eight community and senior  college campuses in San Antonio and to several other campuses in  Texas.  Through support from the Hispanic Association of Colleges  and Universities, PREP will soon be used as a model at seven  institutions outside of Texas.  Involvement in PREP is achieved  with minimal cost to participants.        The program focuses on developing the academic potential of   middle and high school students through summer activities (course  work, engineering projects, and career seminars).  PREP appears to  have influenced the introduction of Algebra I to 7th and 8th grade  students and increased Calculus and Physics offerings at the high  school level within the San  Antonio school system.  PREP is also  involved with the city's Urban Systemic Initiative.        Since its inception, PREP has served more than 6,600 students   though one or more summer sessions.  Minority and women   involvement has been substantive.  The program's summer impact has  grown from 50 students in 1979 to 1,154 participants in 1996.  The  strengths of the nominee include:      .  The high percentage of participants who complete high school       (99.9 percent).    .  The large number of high school graduates who opt for science       or engineering majors and complete the curricula (55 percent).    .  The expansion of the program to other Texas sites and its       recognition as a model for sites outside Texas.        In summary, PREP excels at quality academic preparation of high  school students in science, mathematics, and engineering and  provides access for all students.  Its success is shown in the  replication of the program throughout Texas and soon to other  national locations with Hispanic populations.  The program has  impacted large numbers of minority and  female students.  Materials  show good student success rates.  In addition, the San Antonio PREP  and the Texas PREP have received several citations and awards that  demonstrate organizational program distinction in the advancement  of student career development in science and engineering.",
