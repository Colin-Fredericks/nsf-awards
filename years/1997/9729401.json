 "awd_abstract_narration": "0HRD-9729401  Sterling    It is the intent of this research project to investigate the  facilitators and barriers to the participation of African-Americans  in science.  This study will not only attempt to determine to what  extent do these factors affect African-American science majors in  college, but it will also attempt to identify any existing  differences among these factors for African-Americans attending  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as compared to  those attending majority institutions.  The population sample  selected for this investigation consists of African-American  science majors participating in the Alliance for Minority  Participation (AMP) program funded by the National Science  Foundation.    Existing data, such as information complied in the Alliance for  Minority Participation Monitoring and Reporting Systems (AMP-MARS)  and databases created by the National Center for Education  Statistics (NCES), will be analyzed to determine the existance of  any documented facilitators and barriers to science participation.   Additional questionnaires and surveys will be created,  disseminated, and collected in order of answer more specific  questions that were not addressed and in the respective databases.   Personal interviews with students, faculty, and administrators will  also serve as a form of a research dissertation, defended and  completed by one of the principal investigators of this project.    As facilitating characteristics and barriers to the participation  of African-Americans in science are identified, this information  could be used in the preparation and planning of student programs.   The identification of effective program characteristics could also  lead to changes in the structure and implementation of existing AMP  programs, or any other program that seeks to increase diversity in  the scientific workforce.  This research investigation has the  potential to add new insights to the knowledge-base related to the  increased participation of und errepresented minorities in the  scientific and technological workforce.  This project will attempt  to identify many of these factors in the form of facilitators and  barriers and will also attempt to compare these factors for  African-Americans students attending HBCU's against those attending  majority institutions.",
