 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724132  Purcell & Kearly    This dissertation enhancement grant supports a US graduate  student, Ms. Elizabeth Kearly, working under the guidance of  Dr. Trevor Purcell, Professor of Anthropology at the  University of South Florida, to do field research in Kenya.  During the past two decades many of  Kenya's traditional  birth attendants (TBAs) have periodically attended  biomedical workshops where they have been trained in western  biomedical practices concerning maternal and child health  care.  As a result many TBAs have incorporated this  knowledge into their own indigenous health care methods,  resulting in an integrated approach which lets them select  the most appropriate biomedical or indigenous treatment for  each patient's situation.  Due to Kenya's long history of  colonization, even the untrained TBAs have some exposure to  western biomedical knowledge, but many of them still  continue to only use the traditional practices.  Ms. Kearly  hypothesizes that the untrained TBAs do not integrate the  two knowledge systems because they lack adequate access to  western medical facilities and supplies, and they view their  indigenous methods as having more authority, or relative  influence, as a result of the various cultural,  socioeconomic, and political factors embedded in their  traditional health care beliefs.  Based on information she  will collect on how trained and untrained TBAs in the rural  Migori District acquire and use both forms of knowledge, Ms.  Kearly expects to identify the various levels of authority  they ascribe to each form of health care knowledge and how  that authority then influences their selection of the best  method to be used in various health situations.  The  discovery of such selection patterns will prove useful in  predicting how people integrate and use knowledge systems  under different conditions.  In-depth interviews,  participant observations, and archival research at the  Indigenous Knowledge Center and the Kenya National Archives,  will be used durin g this study.  Staff members at the Maseno  University will collaborate with Ms. Kearly on this project.    This study will make an important contribution to existing  knowledge on the societal dynamics involved in the  integration of western and traditional forms of knowledge  concerning obstetrical practices in a rural area in a  developing country.  The grant will also provide support to  enable a promising study to establish a strong, independent  research career.    ***",
