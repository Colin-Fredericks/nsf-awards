The primary methods for studying the crust, upper  mantle, and the deeper asthenosphere is interpretation of seismic  data; either OactiveO through use of explosives or OpassiveO  using natural sources and interpreting various earthquake phase  arrival times and amplitudes.  Integrating passive and active  seismology can result in efficient use of resources to produce  detailed images of the lithosphere.  This award supports  development of a passive seismic network for the Antarctic  interior.    The Antarctic is a gaping hole in the rapidly improving field of  global seismic imaging and tomography.  On this huge continent  (surface area of 14 million square km) there are only eight  broadband seismic observatories.  Further, with the exception of  South Pole, all of those stations are along the margins of the  continent and none are in the West Antarctic.  By contrast, there  are 200 permanent stations worldwide in the FDSN (Federation of  Digital Seismograph Networks) and on the order of a thousand in  national networks not yet integrated into the FDSN.  There have  been innumerable temporary deployments (1 to 5 years) through  PASSCAL (Program for Array Seismic Studies of the Continental  Lithosphere), but which have rarely been attempted in the  Antarctic.  The obvious reason for this lack of data from the  interior is the need to supply power continuously and store data  on-site during the dark winter months.    This project will develop and deploy eleven long term broadband  seismic stations on the continent itself.  Because 98% of the  continent is ice covered, these stations will be installed at the  surface of the ice sheet.  The body-wave data thus recorded from  regional and teleseismic earthquakes can be analyzed at each  station for local crustal thickness, lamination, Poisson's ratio  (a measure of crustal composition), crust and mantle anisotropy  (a measure of  current and former stress regimes), and  identification of rift zones and crustal block boundaries.  In  addition, the data from all the stations (including the existing  peripheral ones) can be used for seismic tomographic analysis to  detail lateral variations in these properties.    Six of the stations will be installed at existing Automated  Geophysical Observatory sites (in East Antarctica) which will  provide heat and power for the data loggers.  The remaining five  stations will be in the West Antarctic and will be powered and  heated by wind turbines during the austral winter.  The wind-  powered stations are an experimental undertaking that will extend  our capabilities for installing seismic stations anywhere in the  Antarctic.    The stations on the periphery of the continent (and other  stations in the high southern latitudes---most notably the  stations of the French GEOSCOPE network) have been used to  measure surface wave dispersion functions for different paths  that cross the Antarctic.  These data have been successful in  measuring mantle properties, but the resolution (both horizontal  and vertical) achievable by this technique is limited compared to  body-wave analysis.  Nonetheless, this is a valuable existing  tool that would be greatly enhanced by the presence of data from  within the continent that will be available after successful  implementation of the unattended seismometers under this project.",
