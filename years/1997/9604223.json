 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal theoretical methodology proposed here is Brownian  dynamics (BD). The basic idea in Brownian dynamics simulations is  to model the complexation of two proteins undergoing relative  motion according to Brownian motion under the influence of  interprotein forces.  The forces are often electrostatic in  origin and continuum approaches such as the Poisson-Boltzmann  (PB) method have been employed.  In most BD calculations, the  associating proteins have been described by simple models and  while this has yielded qualitatively correct results, it has been  difficult to predict absolute association rate constants.  Also,  only simple models of hydrodynamic interactions have been  considered.      We propose here to a) develop a detailed residue-level model for  substrate/target and b) incorporate more accurate hydrodynamic  effects into the method. It is increasingly recognized that  simulations would serve as a valuable companion to experimental  investigations and we want to establish the validity of Brownian  dynamics as a useful method for studying kinetics of  macromolecular association.",
