The long-term goal is to make progress in  solving the long-standing problem of R. Kirby about the existence of elements  of order two in this group carrying the Rohlin invariant.  The investigator  concentrates his attention at the elements represented by the links of  algebraic singularities, in particular, Seifert fibered homology spheres.  His approach is based on application of the methods of modern gauge theory to  investigation of the invariant introduced in the 70's by W. Neumann and L.  Siebenmann for the so-called graph homology 3-spheres.  This application is  threefold.  First, he uses some special resolutions of singularities to  construct a 4-cobordism of an algebraic link with the prescribed intersection  form, and he then applies the gauge-theoretical results which prohibit  certain integral bilinear forms as intersection forms of such a resolution if  the link bounds a homology ball.  The result of this investigation is further  applied to show that Rohlin invariant one algebraic links cannot have order  two in the homology cobordism group.  Second, the investigator uses the  instanton Floer homology to introduce a new invariant for arbitrary homology  3-spheres, and he proves that it agrees with the invariant of Neumann and  Siebenmann when the latter is defined (graph manifolds).  This result also  gives new insights into Floer homology, in particular, answers positively  M. Atiyah's question whether there is a Milnor fiber description of Floer  homology of certain algebraic links, and whether it is related to the complex  conjugation action on the homology of the Milnor fiber.  Finally, the  investigator applies his new invariant to investigate Kirby's problem for  general homology spheres.  The first step in this direction is to prove that  his invariant should vanish on all hom ology 3-spheres that bound a homology  ball with just one 1-handle (and a 0- and 2-handle).  His technique is to use  the Floer exact triangle to keep track of the Floer homology along the  cobordism.       One of the central objects of investigation in both mathematics and  theoretical physics is a smooth n-dimensional manifold.  Although this object  looks locally like an n-dimensional Euclidean space, its global structure may  still be very rich and complicated.  Most major results about 2-dimensional  manifolds were obtained in the 19th century.  Manifolds in dimensions greater  than or equal to 5 were successfully classified in the 1960's.  Though some  major questions about 3-manifolds remain unanswered, it is manifolds of  dimension 4, the dimension of relativity theory, that occupy the most special  place in the manifold hierarchy.  On the one hand, they are not \"big enough\"   to apply to them the arguments that proved to be so useful in higher  dimensions.  On the other hand, their dimension is too big to apply more  intuitive methods that work effectively in lower dimensions.  Progress has  been slow here for a few decades until recent developments that involved the  application of ideas from the physics of gauge theories.  The main results  are due to S. Donaldson, who initiated the whole program in the early 1980's,  and most recently to N. Seiberg and E. Witten.  The gauge-theoretical  approach proved to be very fruitful and led to the solution of many hard  problems.  The investigator is applying these modern methods to make progress  on yet another long-standing problem in topology, the structure of the  homology cobordism group of homology 3-spheres, which would provide new  insight into manifold structure.  ***",
