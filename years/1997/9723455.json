These pathways allow cells to respond to short- and long-range signals that affect many aspects of pattern formation and growth in higher animals, including control of cell proliferation.  In response to signaling, Smads are phosphorylated and transported from cytoplasm to nucleus, where they activate transcription of target genes.  This lab has recently discovered that Drosophila Mad protein, a founding member of the Smad family and the homolog of vertebrate Smadl, is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein.  DNA binding activity and the ability to oligomerize are localized within a conserved N-terminal domain, while the conserved C-terminal domain inhibits DNA binding.  This research will focus on understanding the role of Smad-DNA interactions in determining the regulatory specificity in TGF-( pathways, and in determining the threshold responses of individual genes to short- or long-range signals.  The first aim is to characterize the DNA binding specificities of Mad, Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4.  The functional differences between Smads suggest that they may differ significantly in DNA binding specificity.  DNA binding specificities of Smads will be characterized by analysis of binding to wild-type and mutated natural binding sites, and by binding site selection.  The second aim is to identify amino acids within the Smad DNA binding domain that are responsible for any differences in DNA binding specificity.  Such specificity determinants will be identified by creating a series of Mad-Smad2/3 chimeras and testing these for specificity of DNA binding and reporter activation.  The third aim is to determine how the affinity of Mad for its binding sites affects threshold responses to Dpp signaling.  Visualization of reporter expression in Drosophila wing imaginal discs, will be used to investigate how responses to short and long-range Dpp signaling are affected by mutations tha t increase or decrease the affinity of target enhancers for Mad.  The effects of altering the number of Mad binding sites will also be determined.  %%%  Members of the Smad protein family have been identified as central components of TGF-( signaling pathways.
