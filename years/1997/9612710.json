 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research at an Undergraduate Institution project, supported in  the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the  preparation and characterization of stationary bonded phases on  high performance liquid chromatography packing material surfaces  and on the walls of open capillary chromatography columns.  During  this three year continuing grant Professor Pesek and his research  students at San Jose State University will continue studies on  silanization/hydrosilation reaction schemes that they have  developed for making these robust chromatography stationary phases.   These modified surfaces will be characterized using the  spectroscopic methods diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy,  cross-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy and electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis.   Differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis  will also be used in this work.  This project is intended to  develop new, rugged, and more efficient stationary phases for use  in separation science.  The materials that serve as stationary phases in chromatographic  separation methods determine whether a chromatography procedure  will be successful and whether the procedure will be reproducible  over an acceptable period of time.  This Research at an  Undergraduate Institution project will involve undergraduate and  Master's level students in the preparation of stationary phases  that are superior in use to existing materials.  These new  chromatographic stationary phases can be used to separate useful  amounts of desired compounds and to quantify and identify the  compounds present is a sample.  These new stationary phases have  application in chemical process control, synthesis, and  biotechnology.",
