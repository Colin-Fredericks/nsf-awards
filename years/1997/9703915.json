 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Khavinson      Using techniques of partial differential equations and complex   analysis, Khavinson plans to study several  problems in   nonlinear pde's, approximation theory and potential theory. He will  study the argument principle for solutions of the complex p-Laplace  equation and its relation to extremal problems for analytic functions,   qualitative properties of the best approximations in the mean by  analytic functions, the reflection principle and the \"antenna problem\",  and an inverse problem for double layer potentials.    Most of these problems although stemming from rather classical   mathematics will require the arsenal of the modern tools for their   solution and, though quite basic in their formulation, have been   resilient to all attempts to solve them. All of them have important   ramifications in other branches of mathematics and applications,   e.g. the \"antenna problem\" deals with the search for a best possible  \"receiving\" antenna for cylindrical waves beyond an obstacle, research   on double layer potentials would allow one to characterize the class   of plane curves and data for which one can solve the most important   boundary value problem - the Dirichlet problem - by direct formulae   involving the integrals of the double layer vs. standard procedures.  Khavinson will work in these projects in collaboration  with three graduate students which should have a strong positive   impact on the graduate program and human-resource development  in Arkansas.",
