Under this Program, the National Science  Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Office of Naval Research  are jointly evaluating and supporting research of high priority to the USWRP.                    Under the auspices of the USWR, the Principal Investigators will undertake a  comprehensive numerical modeling/data assimilation program that has as its  objectives to develop and test a coupled ocean/atmosphere tropical cyclone  numerical model and to utilize this model to investigate the dynamical role of the  ocean in rapid hurricane intensity changes near landfall.        The primary components of the coupled hurricane/ocean numerical system are  the operational hurricane forecast model developed at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid   Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and the Princeton Ocean Model.  These will be  combined with new coupled initialization strategies and well-tested data assimilation  techniques in establishing this coupled model as a trustworthy numerical model.   New operationally available data sets will be a central component of the prediction  system.          The Principal Investigators will employ the coupled model to test a number  of hypotheses concerning the oceans' dynamical role in rapid hurricane intensity  changes near landfall.  These include the effects of ocean eddies and strong ocean  fronts (e.g. the Gulf Stream) in determining the track and intensity of the hurricane.        If successful, this research will lead to improved operational predictive  capabilities.  This research will be conducted in active collaboration with  NOAA/GFDL.  ***",
