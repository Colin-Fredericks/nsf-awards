 "awd_abstract_narration": "Purdue's Women in Engineering Mentoring Program (WIEMP) was   created in 1992 to expand the number of women engineering   students.  A networking model was chosen as a way for students to  provide support to each other in personal and professional   advancement.  Mentors are experienced students and alumni who are  working in engineering fields.  The components of the mentoring  model focus on:  undergraduates in the first and third year;  undergraduates in the second and fourth year; and graduates  pursuing masters and doctorates.  As a consequence, the mentoring  programs provide constant support to women in the program.  There  is ongoing assessment of the women in the program as well as a  summative evaluation.  Results indicate that retention is 19  percent higher for women in the program.  Purdue has already  institutionalized Undergraduate Mentoring Programs of WIEMP in  their Women in Engineering Programs.  The success of the program  has been cited in professional publications, and presentations.  In  addition, information has been distributed internally as well to 35  higher education institutions throughout the country.  A thorough   proposal demonstrates changes the university has made to affect the  enrollment of women in their engineering program.  The strengths of  the nominee include:        .  Excellent continuity in its mentoring program whereby former       mentees become mentors.    .  Number of institutions acknowledging the success of the       program indicates possible replication.    .  Undergraduate programs introduced are being             institutionalized.    .  Active involvement is clearly seen as a bonus.    .  High rate of success.    .  Linking graduate students with Ph.D. alumni is great for       continuity.    .  Mentoring is mostly independent of faculty.    .  Recruitment of women in engineering is excellent.      In summary, WIEMP offers outstanding mentoring continuity for   female engineering students that stems from their first year as  freshmen to afte r graduation when they can serve as alumni mentors  for graduate students.  Throughout the program process, evaluation  is undertaken to ensure student satisfaction with the mentoring  support and strategies.  The retention and graduation data indicate  a very high success rate.  Linking graduate student participants  with Ph.D. alumni changes the traditional educational system in a  positive way by bringing the world of work closer to the students'   university experience.",
