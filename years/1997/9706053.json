The demonstrations of photospectral holeburning (PSHB) applications such as several gigabits per square inch memory storage and fast page oriented image storage with random frame access have established a definite superiority of this emerging technology over the existing ones. There is now, more than ever, a need to coordinate the activities of science, engineering, and technology community to systematically approach well defined goals in order to bring the PSHB technology to the marketplace. The proposed workshop is expected to foster an atmosphere of collective and coordinated effort between system engineers, optical scientists, material scientists, researchers and the end users at an international level to form a strategy to develop and exploit the PSHB based technology. In order to meet these goals selected 30-40 scientist and engineers will be invited to this workshop to be convened in Big Sky, Montana, Feb. 16-19,1997. The meeting has been organized with a view to encourage participation and to stimulate the interest of graduate students in the PSHB research and technology to meet the future demand of a well educated and trained research and development community. Several travel grants will be awarded to the students participating in the workshop on a competitive basis.  The workshop is co-sponsored by NSF and AFOSR.",
