 "awd_abstract_narration": "9711031  Moore    This spider silk study will determine molecular sources of  the mechanical properties that facilitate prey capture in  orb, funnel and cob webs.  The wide array of material  properties  found in spider silks offers an ideal system for  correlating material properties with molecular structure  within a single class of biopolymers.  This project will  recruit undergraduates to research in biology, chemistry,  physics and engineering at the Joint Science Department of  the Claremont Colleges.  Early exposure to crossdisciplinary  research will enable students to bring a valuable viewpoint  to their chosen careers.  Silks from the funnel weaver, Hololena, and the cob weaver,  Latrodectus mactans, will be compared to the known silks of  the orb weaver, Araneus. This comparison will integrate  information from five hierarchical levels: 1. primary  structure from amino acid analysis, protein sequencing and  gene expression;  2.  secondary structure from carbon13 NMR  spectroscopy;  3. higher order structure from atomic force  microscopy;  4. mechanical properties from materials  testing, and; 5. mechanical behavior of the whole web from  computational modeling.  Prey capture results from the  integrated function of these silks and webs.  Moreover, the  understanding of relationships between material properties  and molecular structure has implications for design of ideal  materials.    This project has been designed to enable undergraduates at  Scripps, Pitzer and Claremont McKenna Colleges to  collaborate with faculty in the study of spider webs and  silk from three different spiders.  Early exposure to inter  disciplinary research will bring a valuable viewpoint to  students' chosen careers.  Not all spiders weave orb webs,  although the familiar, circular orb web has been most often  studied by scientists.  Other webs are built in different  shapes and also catch insects differently. Three web types  will be studied:  funnel webs built by the spider Hololena,  the cob webs of the b lack widow spider (Latrodectus  mactans), and orb webs of Araneus.  Because these webs  capture prey in distinct ways, the silk from each web type  is expected to have different mechanical and molecular  properties.  The various webs and silks will be studied on  five different levels.  1.  Computers will be used to model  the vibrations of the webs when prey is caught.  2.  The  strength and elasticity of the silks will be measured.  3.  The structure of the silk fibers will be studied using a  recently developed instrument called the atomic force  microscope (AFM) which can image smaller than traditional  microscopes.  4. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  spectroscopy will be used to determine the folding and  twisting of the silk proteins that may give the silks their  strength and elasticity.  5.  The chemical makeup of the  silk proteins will be found by amino acid analysis.  The  understanding of relationships between material properties  and molecular structure of silk proteins, in addition to  being scientifically interesting, has implications for the  design of new materials.",
