 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops new fast adaptive filtering algorithms and structures,  which are characterized by a low computational complexity, and is applying them  to a broad class of applications, including modern communications systems and  advanced sensor array processing.  For the communications application, this study  demonstrates that such adaptive signal processing can effectively mitigate  interference in satellite and terrestrial CDMA spread spectrum wireless  communications as well as provide cross-talk cancellation in dense WDM fiberoptic  links.  The benefits of this new technology include power savings and increased  data throughput, leading to newer generations of receiver processing hardware  that are being developed from this study.  In the sensor array processing  application, it is demonstrated that low-complexity, reduced-dimension adaptive  CFAR detectors are capable of outperforming all existing detectors for modern  radar systems.  The technology developed from this research permits space-time  adaptive processing on platforms which are limited in terms of size, weight and  power; such as airborne and space-segment surveillance systems.    The key underlying innovation in all of these applications is the use of  transform domain adaptive signal processing utilizing the cross-spectral metric  and low-complexity filtering structures.  This metric permits a lower-order  adaptive filter to converge to a solution which is either identical or very close  to the optimal solution.  Since this filter has a smaller number of adaptive  weights, it converges faster and requires a lower computational complexity.  This  new technology represents a generalization of multiresolution and time-frequency  basis representations.  The full-dimensional transform domain representation  (realized using a filterbank, DFT/DCT, or wavelet) is then compressed to keep  only the most important information as selected by the cross-spectral metric.",
