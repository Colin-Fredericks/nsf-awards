 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612745  BEAVIS  Recently, there have been tremendous advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying traits that are controlled by single genes.  This knowledge has come from methods developed by molecular biologists.  However, most human diseases and virtually all economically important traits in natural and domesticated species are controlled by multiple genes with complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors.  Historically, knowledge about the genetics underlying such traits has come from statistical methods developed by quantitative geneticists.  The purpose of this Gordon Research Conference on Quantitative Genetics and Biotechnology is to promote exchange of information between scientists trained in molecular biology with those trained in quantitative genetics. It is one of the few meetings that brings together the specific mix of disciplines of evolutionary biology, human genetics, and plant and animal breeding.  This type of meeting is a valuable means of disseminating information and ideas to an extent that could not be achieved through the usual channels of publication and presentation at large scientific meetings. Funds from NSF pay for travel costs for invited participants.  This conference will provide insights into uses and limitations of various research tools that are not obvious in the individual disciplines.  In addition, molecular biologists and quantitative geneticists form collaborations among laboratories.  These synergistic collaborations have contributed to understanding the genetic basis of complex traits and evolutionary relationships in many organisms.  This information will result in the development of treatments for human diseases as well as in more productive agricultural products.",
