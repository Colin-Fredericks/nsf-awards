 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jennes  9712928         Many important findings are discovered in a  serendipitous fashion.  Dr. Jennes was attempting to  synthesize specific antibodies to the gonadotropin releasing  hormone (GnRH) which he hoped to used as neuroanatomical  tools to help understand this important hormone system.  As  a result of this work, he isolated two antisera, (antibody  #80 and #81), that did not recognize the GnRH receptor  protein but instead had unique neural properties.  Dr.  Jennes is now proposing that these two antibodies may lead  to the  isolation and identification of  novel neural  proteins important for the neuroendocrine system.   His  preliminary data strongly suggest that the antibodies  labeled #80 and #81 recognize two novel unknown proteins  that could possibly be a new neuropeptide and a membrane  receptor for a putative hormone, respectively.  Based on the  morphology and location  of antibody #80 in the axon  terminals of the outer layer of median eminence, Dr. Jennes  speculates that it may be recognizing a new neuropeptide  which can be released into the portal system and transported  to the pituitary gland to modulate its hormones.   On the  other hand, antibody #81 labels neurons in the supraoptic  and paraventricular nuclei, the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal  tract into the neural lobe of the pituitary as well as axon  terminals in the outer layer of the median eminence and it  is absent in brain regions not accessible to peripheral  hormones.  Dr. Jennes speculates that  #81 is actually  recognizing a novel membrane receptor protein.   Using funds  available through the Small Grant for Exploratory Research  Program which supports small-scale, exploratory, high risk  research, he will now characterize and sequence the two  proteins.  This is the first step towards understanding the  function of what possible could prove to be two novel  proteins important for understanding the endocrine system in  the brain.",
