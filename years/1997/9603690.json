 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603690  Omoto  Technical   Eukaryotic cilia and flagella are found widely in algae, lower plants, animals, and protozoa.  Their basic 9+2 microtubular structure, the axoneme, is common among these wide variety of organisms.  Dynein ATPases power ciliary and flagellar movement, yet it is not understood how the forces produced by dynein ATPases are regulated to produce oscillatory motion of cilia and flagella.  Previous results from this laboratory suggest that specific nucleotide binding may play a role in such regulation.  The aim of this project is to identify and characterize nucleotide binding sites in the axoneme involved in regulation.  By combining the classic genetic tools available in the model organism Chlamydomonas with biochemical, motility, and molecular genetic analyses, the investigator proposes to identify the nucleotide binding site(s) important for regulation of motion.  Two of the outer arm dynein heavy chains may contain regulatory nucleotide binding sites.  Biochemical evidence will be sought to confirm or refute the presence of multiple nucleotide binding sites on the outer arm dyneins.  Simultaneously, mutants with potential defects in regulatory nucleotide binding sites will be selected.  There are good reasons to believe that at least some of these mutants will be dominant; therefore, dominant motility mutants will be selected, focusing on dominant paralyzed mutants.  Mutants whose biochemical and motility phenotypes suggest that they are likely to have a defect in regulatory nucleotide binding site(s) will be characterized at the molecular level.      Non Technical  Many eukaryotic cell types use flagella or cilia either to swim through a fluid medium or to move the fluid medium around the cell.  Examples of the former include the swimming of sperm and protozoa such as Paramecium; examples of the latter include bronchial epithelial cells, which use their cilia to move mucus upward and out of the lungs.  The free-swimming single-celled alga, Chlamydomonas, has long been  used as a model system for studying how flagella work.  As a result of these studies, much is already known about the machinery of flagella, including the 9+2 (cylinder + core) arrangement of microtubules and their associated motor proteins, the flagellar dyneins.  The dyneins are mechanochemical transducing enzymes, which convert energy obtained by the hydrolysis of ATP into the sliding movement of one set of microtubules relative to another.  However, it is clear that there are still important gaps in our understanding of how the flagella work, particularly with regard to how these sliding movements are regulated to produce the oscillatory (back and forth wave-like) motion characteristic of the flagella.  There is reason to believe, from previous work by Dr. Omoto, that some of this regulation involves the binding of ATP or other nucleotides at sites in the flagella  (probably on some dynein molecules) that are not involved in the powering of the sliding motion.  Chlamydomonas mutants that are defective in flagellar regulation would be expected to be paralyzed in a genetically dominant manner.  Therefore, Dr. Omoto will select for and characterize dominant paralyzed mutants in order to determine where these specific regulatory nucleotide binding sites are in the flagella.    ***",
