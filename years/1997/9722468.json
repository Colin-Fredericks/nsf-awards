 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Toroidal Large Apertune Spectrometer (ATLAS) is a  general-purpose detector that will exploit the full  potential of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) proton-proton  collision program.  The LHC will provide 10 times higher  center-of-mass energy and 1000 times higher proton-proton  collision rates than previous colliders.  This opens up new  frontiers of physics which ATLAS will explore.  The Standard  Model, which is the established theoretical description of  the basic building blocks of matter and of the fundamental  interactions, has several unexplored aspects, all well  within the reach of ATLAS.  ATLAS will greatly increase the  resolving power with which the size of the building blocks  of matter, the quarks and leptons, can be measured.       The discovery of the Z and W particles was a large step  forward in the understanding of fundamental interactions.  ATLAS will be able to discover and measure particles with  similar properties but with masses up to 50 times larger  than those of the W and Z.  ATLAS is designed for a large  discovery potential and for precision measurements.       The detector designs are based on extensive R&D within  the collaboration and display many innovative features.  Over a period of six years, prototypes of progressively  increasing scale, together with simulations, have been used  to optimize the performance to meet the ATLAS requirements.       An international collaboration of 1500 scientists, from  145 institutes in 31 countries, including 250 physicists  from 28 US institutions, will construct and use the ATLAS  detector.       ATLAS has, in addition to detector coordinators, an  education coordinator who, with an ATLAS education task  group, intends to develop a significant program integrating  research and education.",
