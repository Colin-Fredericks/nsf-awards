This funding began in the early 1990s and the materials have now been developed, field tested, and are now available from commercial publishers.   Student performance data were collected by the development projects during the pilot and field testing and a number of reports have been published in the research literature concerning these results.  The Michigan State and South Florida researchers are studying this data and are reporting on the results in a form that is readily digested by the potential users of the instructional materials: parents, teachers, school administrators, and others interested in mathematics education.",
