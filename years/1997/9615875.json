The key approach is to employ the high-resolution oxygen isotopic  measurement on dated carbonate sediments retrieved from closed-  basin lakes located along a N-S transect in Oregon, California and  Nevada.  The basis for the approach lies in the fact that water  entering a closed-basin lake via rain and runoff mostly leaves by  evaporation, and the lake's isotopic composition reflects the  hydrologic balance that serves to monitor the regional climate  change, especially the precipitation variability, at a given time.   Past variations of lake water isotopic composition are recorded by  authigenic carbonate minerals of the lacustrine sediment.  The  feasibility of the proposed research has been tested in a recent  study conducted in Mono Lake.  The method will allow the PIs to  assess the moisture sources (from three climatic regimes: Pacific,  continental, and Gulf of Mexico) and their relative strengths and  detect any shifts in storm track in the time domain.  It is  anticipated that the study will allow the PIs to evaluate such  climatic anomalies as the Little Ice Age, Medieval Warm Period, and  ENSO, and contribute to the understanding of the causes and  dynamics of sub-decadal climatic variability.",
