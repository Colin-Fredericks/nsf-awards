 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jim Weisshaar of the University of Wisconsin in Madison is supported by   the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his reactivity   studies involving  gas phase reactions of bare transition metal atoms   (neutral or ionic) with small alkanes or alkenes, under controlled   conditions of initial electronic state and collision energy.  Rate   constants and branching ratios will be measured as a function of   temperature.  In the case of the metal ion, crossed beams will be   exploited to determine the time scale of reaction with 200 ns resolution    Ultimately, these measurements will be extended to reactions of ligated   metal atoms (MO, MCH3, MCO) and small metal cluster cations.  Finally,   laser spectroscopy will be used to determine bond dissociation energies,   geometry, and the electronic and vibrational structure of simple   organometallic radicals such as MCH2, MCH3, and their cations.   Saturated hydrocarbon molecules such as methane and ethane are abundant   sources of carbon, but they are relatively inert.  Their chemical   reactivities can be significantly enhanced, however, by catalysts of   transition metal atoms.  The physical chemistry of this activation   process is not well understood and this research is devoted to improving   our knowledge of the interactions between metal atoms and hydrocarbon   molecules.  Results of this research will affect our understanding of   solution-phase organo-metallic chemistry, heterogeneous catalysis and   surface chemistry.  Furthermore, the data obtained in these   investigations will be of use in the development of theoretical models   and techniques for the calculation of interaction potentials between   metals and hydrocarbon molecules.",
