 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program supports Professor Kung Wang's studies at   the University of West Virginia of new cascade reaction sequences leading   to the construction of novel chemical structures.  Reaction sequences   based on the cycloaromatization of enediynes and enyne-allenes, including   (Z)-3-hexene-1,5-diynes and (Z)-1,2,4-heptatriene-6-ynes, lead to   polycyclic carbon frameworks, while analogous cyclizations of   enyne-ketenes, enyne-ketenimines, enyne-isocyanates, and   enyne-carbodiimides afford access to novel polycyclic heterocycles.    Cascade electrocyclizations of dienediynes provide reactive   benzocyclobutadienes, the unusual polycyclic dimers of which represent   synthetic entry to compounds containing multiple dibenzocyclooctatetraene   units.  Cyclizations of enediallenes lead to the formation of   o-quinodimethanes and to the potential discovery of novel synthetic   routes to estrone and tetracyclic structures forming the basis of a   number of naturally-occurring diterpenes.  Many of Nature's biologically active compounds display complex molecular   structures, and the attempted synthesis of such compounds, whether for   purposes of structure elucidation, large-scale production of scarce   naturally occurring compounds, or preparation of next-generation   synthetic analogs, requires the continuing development of new strategies   to deal with their molecular complexity.  By exploiting unusual   cyclization reactions of electron-deficient precursor molecules,   Professor Wang develops facile synthetic routes to a wide variety of   polycyclic molecular structures containing all-carbon atoms as well as   compounds containing nitrogen and oxygen atoms within their cyclic   structures.  These cyclization reactions are significant in their own   right from a chemical perspective, addressing issues of fundamental   importance with regards to organic structure and reactivity.    Additionally, the reaction chemistry provides synthetic access to both   recognized and novel chemical structures, affording new synthetic routes   for the preparation of steroids such as estrone as well as other   tetracyclic structures characteristic of a class of naturally-occurring   compounds known as the diterpenes.",
