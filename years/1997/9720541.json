 "awd_abstract_narration": "With rare exceptions, hazards research has focused primarily on individual hazards at particular locations, an approach that does not fully explain the risks that exist in an area.  This project is aimed at moving away from these single hazard analyses to a multiple hazard perspective that looks at the hazardousness of a place.  Such a perspective will include both linked and independent events and will serve to develop an approach based on: 1) an examination of the functional relationships that best represent the linkages and probabilities of events; and 2) an examination of the functional relationships between probability of occurrence and levels of vulnerability as they are manifested through damage/loss potentials for discrete areas.  Using Tampa Bay, Florida as the research area, data on the spatial extent of events, variables on the physical and built environments, as well as social characteristics, will be incorporated in a GIS-based model.  Once these data are geocoded, models from the literature will be adapted to evaluate independent and linked events and to define variations in vulnerability.  Specifically, analysis will center on calibrating, testing, and refining these models using an integrated assessment approach with embedded submodels, influence diagrams, and functional dependencies drawn from the literature, from existing models, and from known relationships.  Because of the nature of hazards data, sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to determine which variables contribute most to the uncertainty inherent in the models.  This research breaks new ground by incorporating into the analysis of hazardousness those events that are linked to other events and the probability of occurrence of one or more events.  As such, this exploratory methodological effort represents an important advance in our ability to model the relationships among and between hazards.  This POWRE award makes it possible for the investigator to build on earlier research that dealt with development and testing of a methodology for determining the composite probability of occurrence of several independent hazards in a community.  At that time, linked hazards were considered conceptually, but there was insufficient time to develop that strand of research because of its exploratory nature.  Work by the investigator since then has indicated that this line of inquiry holds promise, but a concentrated effort is required to carry it out.  This award makes it possible for her to move ahead.  The investigator will be developing her technical expertise in modeling and methodological development at the University of South Florida.  This area of research holds great promise for future research as human interventions and climate change add further complexities to our understanding of natural hazards.  Thus, the award will serve to enhance the investigator's reputation as a leader in the area of natural hazards research.",
