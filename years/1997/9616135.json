 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract      Proposal Number:  CTS 9616135  Principal Investigator:  Lin,  Clarkson      This is a grant to investigate in more detail the discovery that the onset of instability in a vertical film can be suppressed completely in certain discrete bandwidths of frequency and amplitude of plate oscillation.  The physical mechanisms  remain unknown.  Linear and nonlinear stability theories of a liquid film flow down an oscillating inclined plane  are proposed.  Based on the numerical solution of the derived equations, the energy budget in wavy films and its spectral properties will be calculated to uncover the mechanism of suppression of instability.  Further insight into the control of wave interactions involving gravitational, surface tension and shear forces is of fundamental scientific significance, because the problem is a generic example of flow control.  The scientific knowledge to be gained from this study will be useful for a variety of applications including coating of photographic film or paper, protective layers such as insulation or anticorrosive material on high-tech surfaces, etc.  The ability to control stability will help make many coated products more reliable, safer and of higher quality.  It will also enable many coating processes to become more efficient, precise and material saving, and thus more environmentally friendly.",
