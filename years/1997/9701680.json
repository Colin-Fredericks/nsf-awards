 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a renewal award for the work of Professor Georges Guiochon at the   University of Tennessee-Knoxville for his on-going research in non-linear   chromatography.  The work, supported by a grant from the Analytical and   Surface Chemistry Program, will investigate theoretical and experimental   aspects of the operation of chromatographic columns in an overload   condition.  Working mainly on problems involving the separation of pairs   of enantiomers and of protein mixtures, research on the fundamentals of   preparative chromatography will be performed.  Techniques such as   simulated moving bed separations (SMB) will be evaluated.  Central to the   work is the prediction and optimization of individual band profiles of   multicomponent mixtures through insights gained from the thermodynamic   behavior and kinetics of mass transfer of these components measured under   various conditions.  Calculated and experimental band profiles will be   compared.  The main experimental studies will involve determinations of   competitive isotherms, enantiomeric separations by SMB and the   determination of mass transfer resistances in protein purifications.  This work is in the area of separations science and is concerned with the   theoretical and practical operation of chromatographic columns for   preparative chemistry.  The work will greatly improve our understanding   in this area and is of major potential impact on many industries which   produce pure compounds such as fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals.",
