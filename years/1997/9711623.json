One approach   to the integration of these effects across scales is to use hierarchical models that   incorporate contingencies and constraints in effects. This project seeks to develop such a   modeling paradigm by use of classification and regression trees (CART). The hexagonal   grid of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and   Assessment Program is used as the spatial grid, with about 12000 grid points within the   conterminous U.S. To test the approach, national Breeding Bird Survey data are used as   dependent variables (species richness, abundance of individual species). The independent   variables are derived from climate models, from remote sensing of land use from   Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometry (the Loveland prototype land cover   classification), from National Agricultural  Statistics Service statistics, and from Bureau of   the Census data. The CART modeling then determines the best combination of predictors   for each hexagon with bird data (ca. 1200), and the resulting model is used to predict   values for  all other hexagons. One can then map the regions with unique patterns of   environmental  effects on birds, can determine the location and degree of species losses   associated with the local or regional action of particular stressors,  and assess the location   and total impact of the overall stressor load on the system. Specific questions that are   addressed in the project include the value of different datasets as predictors, the influence   of spatial autocorrelation, improvement of model fit and assessment of prediction   accuracy,  and methods of visualization of the results.   The effects of climate, land-use and human demographics on environmental    resources are particularly difficult to estimate in an integrated manner because some   effects are broad-scale while others are very localized. If one could do so, a national   environmental risk assessment would be feasible in a cost-effective manner. Here a new   approach to the problem is tested, using a hierarchical model that first adjusts for broad-  scale effects and then assesses regional and local effects in turn. As a test, bird data for the   48 conterminous states are modeled against national climate data, remote sensing data on   land use, and agricultural and Census data. The resulting national map shows on a 12,000   point grid the extent to which species are lost to particular or to all stressors  at each   point, in effect a national risk assessment of environmental impacts as experienced by birds   in relation to the stressors tested. The approach can readily be extended to other   environmental response variables and to smaller or larger scales. This project   systematically investigates technical uncertainties that might limit the usefulness of the   approach.",
