However,  recent studies have shown that groundwater  inputs  might contribute a significant amount of terrigenous DOM  to  the  coastal  ocean  in areas such as the southeastern  U.S.  The  primary  research  objective of  this  proposal  is  to  understand how the diffused flow of groundwater constituents  affects the dynamics of carbon, nitrogen and other nutrients  in  coastal environments.  The research efforts are designed  to answer three specific questions:  1) What are the sources  and  characteristics of groundwater DOM?; 2)  What  are  the  seasonal   dynamics  of  groundwater  DOM   production   and  transport? and 3) What are the impacts of groundwater DOM on  the coastal ocean? Another important goal of the proposal is  to  link  the  research objectives outlined above  with  the  education of students at different stages of their  careers.  This  proposal  makes  students  key  participants  of   the  investigations   designed  to   understand   the   role   of  groundwater   in  DOM  cycling.   The  vehicles   for   such  participation include new field summer courses at the Baruch  Laboratories  in  North Inlet (SC) and new  laboratory-based  graduate and non-major undergraduate courses.",
