 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723484  Lynch  The previous characterization of enzymatic reactions involved in sphingolipid metabolism in plants serves as a foundation for the proposed research. The intracellular locations of the individual enzymatic steps involved in sphingolipid synthesis and turnover will be determined in bean and corn tissues using cell fractionation and marker assays. The specific sphingolipid content and composition in the isolated membrane fractions will also be determined. The transfer of labeled sphingolipids through the cell will be tracked by coupling in vivo labeling of sphingolipids and fractionation procedures. Using this approach, information on the route and kinetics of intracellular sphingolipid transport will be obtained. The topology of glucosylceramide synthesis in intact membrane vesicles will be investigated by examining the sensitivity of the reaction to proteolytic enzymes. As well, the role of steryl glucoside as the glucose donor for this reaction will be further investigated. Finally, the enzymatic reaction catalyzing the synthesis of ceramide phosphorylinositol, the biosynthetic precursor for inositol phosphorylceramides, will be demonstrated and characterized in microsomal preparations from bean and corn. Subsequently, its subcellular distribution and topology will be characterized. The proposed research will provide an integrated view of plant sphingolipid metabolism, intracellular transport/compartmentation, and the topology of key enzymes thought to be involved in establishing the asymmetric transbilayer distribution of glucosylceramide in the plasma membrane. It will also provide new information about the first step in the synthesis of inositol phosphorylceramides, a diverse class of complex sphingolipids in plants.    Sphingolipids are present in all organisms except bacteria and are known to function as structural components in cells and as regulators of various biological processes. Little is known, however, about the function and metabolism of sphingolipids in plants. The  proposed research, a continuation of previous work supported by the NSF, will provide an integrated view of where and how sphingolipids are produced, transported, and degraded in the cell. It will also investigate, for the first time, the synthesis of inositol phosphorylceramides, a novel and diverse class of complex plant lipids. The results from these studies will contribute to understanding the role of these unusual lipids in plant growth and development.",
