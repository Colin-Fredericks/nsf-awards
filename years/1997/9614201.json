 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614201  Costa  Sea ice forms an extensive habitat in the Southern Ocean. Reports  dating from the earliest explorations of Antarctica have  described high concentrations of algae associated with sea-ice,  suggesting that the ice must be an important site of production  and biological activity. The magnitude and importance of  ice-based production is difficult to estimate largely because the  spatial and temporal distributions of ice communities have been  examined in only a few regions, and the processes controlling  production and community development in ice are still  superficially understood.       This study will examine sea ice communities in the Ross Sea  region of Antarctica in conjunction with a studies of ice physics  and remote sensing. The specific objectives of the study are: 1)  to relate the overall distribution of ice communities in the Ross  Sea to specific habitats that are formed as the result of ice  formation and growth processes; 2) to study the initial formation  of sea ice to document the incorporation and survival of  organisms, in particular to examine winter populations within  \"snow-ice\" layers to determine if there is a seed population  established at the time of surface flooding; 3) to sample summer  communities to determine the extent that highly productive  \"snow-ice\" and \"freeboard\" communities develop in the deep water  regions of the Ross Sea; 4) and to collect basic data on the  biota, activity, and general physical and chemical  characteristics of the ice assemblages, so that this study  contributes to the general understanding of the ecology of the  ice biota in pack ice regions.",
