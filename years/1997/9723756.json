The B vitamin inositol is an essential biomolecule in metazoa. In every cell type that has been examined, starvation for inositol causes cell death, although little is known about the mechanism of this phenomenon. Termed inositolless death in 1959 by Lester and Gross, it was first described by G.W. Beadle in 1944, who stated that \"...death ensues when the reaction pathways which utilize the missing or limiting component cannot 'keep up' with the other reaction pathways and this in turn may reasonably be defined as a condition of imbalance\". Some of the cellular processes that require inositol are well-documented.  In eukarytoic cells  inositol is a component of a major class of membrane phospholipids that includes phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its polyphosphorylated derivatives (PIPs). In this capacity, inositol provides structure to the cell membrane (PI), and also functions in transmitting information (PIPs) from the environment to the interior of the cell.  Experiments during the previous funding period demonstrated that inositol uptake from the environment is subject to complex regulation. It was shown that the activity of the major inositol permease, encoded by the ITR1 gene, is regulated at multiple levels including both transcription of ITR1 and stability of the Itr1 permease.  Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation was found to be necessary for inactivation and endocytosis of the Itr1 permease. Remarkably, the same ubiquitin conjugating enzymes required for Itr1 degradation were also required for derepression of transcription of ITR1. In this case, the ubiquitin system could be bypassed by deletion of the OPi1 negative regulator. The research to be carried out will include the construction of mutations in OPI1 in vitro that will then be analyzed in vivo. Mutations will be introduced in ar eas of the gene encoding regions of Opi1p regions such as the leucine zipper and polyglutamine tracts, in PEST regions, and in potential ubiquitination sites. The consequences of these mutations on Opi1p stability, on Opi1p-mediated negative regulation, and on formation and stability of a high molecular weight Opi1p complex will be analyzed .  Additionally, the cellular location of Opi1p, and the effects of mutations in OPI1 and  other genes such as ITR1, ITR2, INO2, and INO4, on that localization will be determined.  Antibodies will be used to localize Opi1p in the presence and absence of inositol by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Preliminary data suggest that Opi1p is not located in the nucleus. There is evidence that other inositol-dependent processes exist; mutations that affect a variety of functions have been coincidentally found to perturb inositol metabolism.      The B vitamin inositol is essential for all higher organisms. The study of a eukaryotic model system in which mutations can be easily constructed and analyzed provides an opportunity to dissect the mechanisms that link inositol metabolism to membrane biogenesis and cellular growth. This work will further understanding of how the  supply and demand for inositol is sensed by the cell. The research is part of a broad investigation of the mechanisms that maintain metabolic balance and ensure normal physiological function.",
