 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Paleontological Research Institution (PRI) is the world's only private research organization dedicated solely to the science of paleontology.  It houses major collections of invertebrate fossils and Recent mollusks and one of the nation's largest collections of type and figured fossil specimens.  Due to the lack of permanent curation and storage facilities, the collections have been  allowed to deteriorate, and have been inaccessible to the research and educational communities for many years.  PRI has embarked upon an effort to replace and expand current facilities in order to consolidate collections of the Institution, Cornell University, and the University of Rochester.  Specifically, funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will enable PRI to replace existing space that is in poor condition presently used to house the collections.  For the first time in almost a century, this project will provide the needed space to adequately house and care for  collections, and  make them available for research use. As a result, the combined collection would be one of the largest and finest in the nation, with particular strengths in the Cenozoic of the Western Hemisphere and Paleozoic of the Northeastern US.  These are both areas of considerable current research interest in the areas of environmental and faunal change.  As the largest fossil collection within a 250 mile radius, the combined collection would have the potential to serve as a regional and national center for paleobiological research and education.  Most importantly, this project will improve accessibility of three large and scientifically important collections of fossil invertebrate and Recent mollusks to researchers, educators, and students who have previously not had access to them, thus having a direct effect on future research programs, and paleontological research on a national scale.",
