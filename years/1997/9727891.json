 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9727891  Neal    This research is to develop a set of enabling technology roadmaps which identify key cross cutting advances and capabilities required to meet near and long term goals of the U.S. manufacturing community.  This project is intended to build on the roadmapping work done for the Next Generation Manufacturing study by identifying specific research needs, opportunities, gaps and overlaps for the next 15 years.  The goal of this effort is to provide a focused national research agenda which will highlight opportunities for individual and collaborative R&D throughout the U.S. manufacturing community. The study will include:(1)a technology assessment - current state of the art needs and barriers;(2)requirements - goals and objectives to advance enabling manufacturing technologies over the next 15 years;(3) technology roadmap - timeline of required capabilities and advances; and(4)current programs-directory of related ongoing federal and private development activities. Subject areas will be drawn from the Next Generation Manufacturing study and will include: Adaptive Responsive Information  Systems; Pervasive Modeling and Simulation; Next Generation Manufacturing Processes and Equipment; and Enterprise Integration tools. There has been little concerted effort or collective focus to address the technical challenges associated with \"Next Generation Manufacturing\". Many of these challenges are too difficult for a single company or government agency to address. It is clear that there is a need to develop broad-based plans that address the infrastructure tools and capabilities essential to the evolution of the nations' manufacturing base. The U.S. manufacturing community would greatly benefit by having a more cohesive research agenda highlighting key technology needs in manufacturing infrastructure.  This is especially crucial in the current environment where the amount of R&D money available for manufacturing is declining. The results of this project would provide a mechanism for agencies  and industry to pool their resources in areas of mutual interest.",
