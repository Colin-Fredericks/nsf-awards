The instrument will be located at the Reactor  Radiation Division of the National Institute of Standards and  Technology in Gaithersburg, MD.  It will be shared by  investigators at Johns Hopkins University, Princeton  University, and the University of Maryland, College Park.  Researchers will use this instrument for NSF funded research of  magnetic and superconducting materials of fundamental interest  in condensed matter physics.  These include:  low-dimensional  antiferromagnets where quantum-induced disorder gives novel  cooperative phenomena, orgranic conductors (Bechgard salts)  that display a cascade of unusual field-induced phase  transitions between spin-density wave states, and heavy fermion  materials where interactions between local magnetic moments and  conduction electrons yield novel magnetic states.  Also  featured are high-field studies of the vortex lattice in high-  Tc superconductors, and exploration of the coexistence of  magnetism and superconductivity in the high-Tc materials and a  new class of quaternary intermetallic compounds.  All of these  are systems where the application of a large magnetic field can  proufoundly alter their behavior, particularly their magnetic  correlations and excitations.  By probing these effects  directly with inelastic neutron scattering, it will be possible  to greatly extend the understanding of these materials.  The  instrument will be made available to other researchers through  the neutron scattering users programs at NIST.  It will  therefore become an important world-class resource for the  entire United States neutron scattering community.  %%%  This award provides support for the acquisition of a cryo-  system consisting of a 12 Tesla superconducting magnet and a  dilution refrigerator for use in neutron scattering  experiments.
