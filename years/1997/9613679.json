 "awd_abstract_narration": "Helsdon/Abstract           The objectives of this research are charge separation process  in the influence of lightning on the electrical structure and  development of thunderclouds, primarily using the 3D storm  electrification model.  With respect to charging processes we plan  to examine the convective hypothesis, acting alone, to see if it is  capable of producing strong electrification within storms;   continue to investigate noninductive charging processes based on  the most recent laboratory findings;  look at the hail/cloud water  inductive mechanism to determine its importance in the  electrification during the mature stage of storms;  and examine  several mechanisms, including splashing of hail and supercooled  liquid water, to investigate the production of charge structures  that might favor positive cloud-to-ground lightning.  We also plan  to incorporate electrical effects on the vertical and horizontal  motion of charged hydrometeors as well as the calculation of  detailed hydrometeor charge budgets.         With respect to the lightning scheme, we will develop a more  randomized propagation for the simulated channel, incorporating the  electric field due to the channel itself.  We will continue to  investigate the termination criterion, with the intent of solving  the problem of channel propagation to ground.  Finally, we plan to  run simulations with multiple discharges to determine their  influence on the charge rearrangement during the active lightning  phase of storms.",
