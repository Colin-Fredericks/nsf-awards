 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724568  Bloxham    This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation  (MRI) Program, provides $178,885 as partial support of the  costs of acquiring a new computational facility at Harvard  University for modeling the Earth's dynamo using their  recently developed 3-d, dynamically self-consistent  geodynamo code.  Specifically, they will acquire a new  Silicon Graphics Origin 2000 server with sixteen CPU's, 45  Gb of disk storage and 2 Gb of expanded memory. The current  Kuang and Bloxham (Harvard) 3-d geodynamo model and the  Glatzmaier (LANL) and Roberts (UCLA) model, whose results  have recently been featured on the covers of the  international and multi-disciplinary journals Nature and  Science, are the only two currently developed and functional  models of the geodynamo in the world. The Kuang-Bloxham  model simulates a magnetic field that is generated well  above the inner core close to the core-mantle boundary,  while the Glatzmaier-Roberts model predicts a field  generated just above the inner core.  Both models show  dipole reversals after a few decay times and the Glatzmaier-  Roberts model, which was developed first and has been run  long enough to simulate other geomagnetic reversals at ca.  100,000 ybp and 200,000 ybp, is supported by the Earth's  paleomagnetic reversal records.  The difference between  these models lies in the setup of boundary conditions and  choice of initial parameters for each of the models and the  geophysical basis for each model representation can be and  is, argued.  Given limited computational resources for this  research, both groups are forced to make simplifications to  the models that result in codes that can be run in a  reasonable amount of time (the Kuang-Bloxham model currently  requires one month of dedicated time on their CARY computer  for simulation of the Earth's dynamo for only one decay  time).  Given these limitations, unrealistic values of  initial parameters are used (i.e. Ekman number, Prandtl  number, Rayleigh number; see rev iew by Merrill).  However,  it is clear that increased parallel processing and memory  are required to run this code within reasonable lengths of  time to model the Earth's geodynamo over geologically  significant time periods and it is important to support  continued development and subsequent simulations using both  of these competing models.  ***",
