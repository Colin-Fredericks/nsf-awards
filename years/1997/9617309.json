Rogers, Erika  Colorado School of Mines    CISE Research Instrumentation: Intelligent Assistance for Multiple Robots    This award supports the purchase of equipment to be used in the following research projects: -Intelligent Assistance of remote Robots using a Tactical Agent-Intelligent Assistance for Problem Solving for Multiple Robots.  Multiple autonomous robots have a wide variety of applications, including Urban Search and Rescue, hazardous waste cleanup, and planetary rovers.  Full autonomy for these robots is often unrealistic given the current state of AI and demands of the domain.  Two research projects will investigate aspects of semi-autonomous control for multi-agents.  One project will extend work in the search of physical spaces to address issues of how to use a tactical robot to intelligently assist in the coordination and control of remote robots.  The tactical robot will interpret the teleoperator's strategic commands for the inspection robots for the immediate situation and supplement and/or modify them in order to safely control the inspection robots.  The project will contribute a better understanding of cooperative heterogenous agents, thereby improving task performance, reducing cognitive fatigue, and minimizing teleoperator training. The second project will extend visual interaction methods for problem solving in order to allow a teleoperator to simultaneously control and diagnose failures in remote robots without cognitive fatigue. The expected contributions include a new paradigm of intelligent assistance, not restricted to robotics, based on differences in the agents' cognitive abilities.",
