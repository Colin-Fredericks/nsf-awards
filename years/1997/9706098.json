 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706098  Lewis        TOGA-COARE (for Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-  Atmosphere Response Experiment) was a observational field project conducted in  the warm pool area of the western tropical Pacific Ocean.  Some of the observations  span several years in the early 1990s.  Most are derived from an intensive observing  period of 4 months in winter, 1993.  It was a joint ocean/atmosphere project with the  focused goal of collecting the observations relevant to air-sea interactions and the  physical processes that couple the ocean and atmosphere in the region of the world.        One of the objectives of the TOGA-COARE is to determine the principal  atmospheric processes that organize convection in the Western Pacific warm pool  region.  To accomplish this objective, the Principal Investigator will derive vertical  motions, momentum transports, and heat budgets for different types of oceanic  mesoscale convective systems (MCSs).  She will relate these physical quantities to  different characteristics of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) including the modes  of convection, evolution and boundary layer modification.  The research will focus  on the combined use of in situ and Doppler radar measurements from multiple  aircraft including the use of a relatively new Doppler synthesis technique, quad-  Doppler.          Four distinct cases (Feb. 6, Feb. 9, Feb. 20, Feb. 22) have been chosen for  comparison.  Each of the four systems represent different types of MCS  organizational structure.  The exceptional quality of the winds, due to the quad-  Doppler technique, will be an asset for calculating the heat flux. The impact of the  different types of MCSs on the larger scale structure will be examined.  ***",
