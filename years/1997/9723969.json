The length of the poly(A) tail has been correlated with mRNA stability, translation and intracellular transport. This research will investigate the mechanism by which the mammalian nuclear poly(A) binding protein, PABII, in conjunction with the cleavage/polyadenylation specificity factor, CPSF, function to terminate polyadenylation of mRNA.  Poly(A) tails in the nuclei of mammalian cells are 200-300 nucleotides long.  Without PABII and CPSF, poly(A) polymerase will polymerize tails of more than 1000 nucleotides in vitro.  Preliminary electron microscopy studies carried out in our laboratory demonstrate that PABII forms a nautilus-shaped 21 nm oligomeric particle when bound to synthetic poly(A).  A single PABII particle of similar size and shape is found together with CPSF at the 3' end of mRNA in an in vitro polyadenylation reaction.  A combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches will be used to understand the relationship between the structure of the PABII particle and termination of polyadenylation.  The central hypothesis that PABII binds in a contiguous array to the nascent poly(A) tail during synthesis, eventually forming a nautilus-shaped particle of discrete stoichiometry which leads to the dissociation or inactivation of the cleavage/polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and or poly(A) polymerase.  The result is a transition from fast processive polymerization to slow  dispersive polymerization thereby limiting the length of the poly(A) tail.  The quaternary structure of the PABII particle will be studied using a combination of fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclease digestion, chemical cross-linking, and scanning transmission electron microscopy.  Snapshot blotting and immuno-electron microscopy will be used to examine how the PABII particle, CPSF and poly(A) polymerase change in size, shape and location during the various stages of the polyadenylation reaction.  %%%  Polyadenyl ation of messenger RNA (mRNA) is an essential process in gene expression.
