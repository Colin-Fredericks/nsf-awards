 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mechanical Engineering Department has not had any full-field temperature measuring capability.  Students graduate with theoretical and practical knowledge of traditional point-type temperature measurement methods, but do not encounter any full-field temperature measurement systems.  This project addresses these needs by purchasing a state-of-the-art infrared thermography system.     The four primary objectives of this proposal are (1) to integrate theoretical and experimental methods concerning infrared thermography systems into five existing undergraduate Mechanical Engineering courses (two of the five courses being designated as the primary users of the system); (2) to evaluate the impact and educational benefit of adding a state-of-the-art thermal measurement capability to an undergraduate engineering curriculum, a capability that is not available in most university environments because of its cost; (3) to make the infrared thermography system available for directed study courses in which work on selected projects under the guidance of a faculty member, with many of these projects often involving local industries; and (4) to introduce talented high school students to infrared thermography as part of a Young Scholars Program held every summer.  This successful program is now in its 18th year and includes a particular emphasis on the introduction of women and minorities to the fields of engineering and computer science.  This project directly affects about 350 undergraduate students per year.   *",
