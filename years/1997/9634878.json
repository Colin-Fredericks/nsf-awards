 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award made in the Office of Special Projects deals with the design,   synthesis and characterization of metal coordination complexes and   networks with interesting magnetic properties. Emphasis will be on the   synthesis of arylene and polyarylene rings bearing two or three o-quinone   or semiquinone structures which, depending on their oxidation state will   be paramagnetic and capable of binding to high-spin octahedral transition   metals. In the semiquinone state, the ligands will be radical anions so   that their metal complexes will not require any supporting counterions.   The resulting  neutral, three dimensional complexes and networks will   exhibit strong coupling in three dimensions and should exhibit bulk   magnetism. The ligands and complexes will be characterized by cyclic   voltammetry, electron paramagnetic resonance, crystallography and   magnetometry.  Organic molecular magnets are an area of high academic as well as   technological interest. Success of this project will advance the   fundamental understanding of the molecular basis for magnetism.   Additionally, air-stable, light weight organic magnets will find numerous   commercial applications ranging from small electric motors to information   storage.",
