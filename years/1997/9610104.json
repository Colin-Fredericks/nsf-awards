 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project, funded as a  Research Planning  Grant (RPG) is to perform preliminary studies and develop a  long term research proposal to investigate strategies for  implementation of file system extensions in widely used  operating systems. Examples of extensions under  consideration include disconnected operation, weak and  partial connectivity, informed prefetching and  file  reference tracing. The major difficulty in transferring  these technologies into commercial practice stems from  frequent inability to modify the native system source code.  Therefore, alternative mechanisms and tools, such as  microkernel augmented DLLs, installable file systems,  loadable modules, proxies and TSR programs, will be  considered.  The scope of the  study will span the families  of all widely used operating systems such as Windows family,  Unix family, and OS/2 family.  In addition to the inability  to modify the native system source code, constraints such as  hardware limitations, and the effect of the extension on  system performance will be investigated. The long term goal  of this research is to develop a set of guidelines for  practical implementation of file system extensions, and  study their impact on the native system, thereby furnishing  a vital missing link in the transfer of file system research  results into computer practice.***",
