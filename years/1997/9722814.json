 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722814  Henry Greenside           \"CHARACTERIZATION OF SPATIOTEMPORAL CHAOS\"         Renewal of support is requested for interdisciplinary research     (nonequilibrium physics, nonlinear dynamics, and computational     mathematics) concerning the characterization of spatiotemporal     chaos in large nonequilibrium systems such as those found in     biological, chemical, fluid, and laser systems. The research     will use numerical methods, parallel computers, and carefully     chosen mathematical models to explore two questions: (1) how     is spatiotemporal chaos related to the mathematical structure     of attractors in phase space? and, (2), can the infinite     hierarchy of unstable periodic orbits associated with a     strange attractor be used to characterize and control     high-dimensional chaos? The proposed research will: (a) yield     new methods for analyzing spatiotemporal data accumulated by     experimentalists and by computational scientists; (b) provide     new information about unstable periodic orbits (UPOs)     associated with extensive chaos and suggest new strategies for     their stabilization; (c) provide new insights about parallel     numerical algorithms for finding unstable periodic orbits of     partial differential equations in large spatial domains ; and     (d) give valuable training to students and postdocs at Duke in     the numerical analysis, simulation, and theory of complex     nonlinear dynamical systems.             Many problems in basic and applied science require a deeper     understanding of sustained nonequilibrium systems in which     complicated time-dependent behavior is caused by a steady flux     of energy and matter into a system. Examples can be found in     almost all areas of science but might include fluid     turbulence, fibrillation in a heart, epilepsy in a brain, the     design of high-power lasers, and instabilities of electrical     power grids. A fundamental question of high current interest     for many areas of science is how to re late the spatial     structure of a complex nonequilibrium medium to its temporal     state, especially when the system varies nonperiodically     (chaotically) in time. The proposed research suggests two ways     of addressing this question that have yet been incompletely     explored by previous research. This research will use applied     mathematics and computer simulation to study simplified     mathematical models in which spatial and temporal structure     can be examined in detail, and then various insights will be     tested with experimental data. Eventually, this research     should improve engineering control and design of complex     systems as well as provide a foundation for developing a     fundamental theory of sustained nonequilibrium systems.",
