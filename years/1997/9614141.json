It further sought to clarify the factors that contribute to the retention of particular ethnic or racial groups and which apply to most or all minority engineering students. The study hypothesis was that policy implications required change in the culture of institutions of engineering. The goals of the  study were to understand the processes of minority retention, to provide      information on the mechanisms that enable changes in policies and practices, and to generalize to a broader policy for other engineering programs in higher education.",
