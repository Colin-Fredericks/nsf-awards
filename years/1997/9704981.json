 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lipshitz and Robinson propose to continue their collaborative investigation in two distinct but related directions:  analytic geometry over fields with a non-Archimedean (ultrametric) absolute value, and the model theory of ultrametric fields with analytic structure (i.e., the theory of subanalytic sets). Classical affinoid rigid analytic geometry is based on rings of strictly convergent power series-power series convergent on products of \"closed\" discs.  The proposers have introduced new rings of power series convergent on products of \"closed\" and \"open\" discs.  These rings of separated power series share many of the desirable algebraic properties of the smaller rings of strictly convergent power series.  Lipshitz and Robinson propose to develop local and global rigid geometry over these rings, in analogy to the classical case.  This will represent an extension of the classical theory to the case of relative rigid geometry over \"open\" polydiscs.  On the model theory side, Lipshitz and Robinson propose to complete their development of the theory of rigid subanalytic sets based on the rings of separated power series by proving a Uniformization and a Singular Locus Theorem.  They also propose to continue their development of the theory of rigid subanalytic sets based on the rings of strictly convergent power series. The methods employed come from model theory, commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  The sets of points in real space defined by systems of equations and inequalities among analytic functions are called analytic sets.  The projection (i.e., the shadow) of such a set on a lower dimensional subspace is called subanalytic.  Real subanalytic sets arise in several branches of mathematics such as differential equations and geometry.  Similar classes of sets arise naturally, for example in number theory, over fields different from the real numbers, where the notion of distance has rather different properties.  These sets, however, share many of the nice properties of their real cousins.   Lipshitz, Robinson and their students will continue their investigation of the properties of these sets, using methods from mathematical logic, commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.",
