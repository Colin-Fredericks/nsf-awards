The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a three-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Bruce A. Armitage to work with Dr. Peter E.  Nielsen at the Panum Institute in Copenhagen, Denmark.    Dr. Armitage will study the interaction of peptide nucleic  acid (PNA) oligomers with RNA molecules.  His major  hypothesis is whether the interaction  of PNA with synthetic  ribozyme RNA will inhibit ribozyme self-splicing.  This work  will give increased understanding into the interaction of  PNA with folded RNA molecules, which are essential  components in the development of PNA as an antisense  therapeutic and diagnostic agent.    Dr. Nielsen is one of the inventors of PNA and therefore is  most experienced in the synthesis and application of these  molecules.  In addition, Nielsen's colleague, Dr. Henrik  Nielsen will contribute expertise in RNA and ribozymes.  Dr.  Armitage completes the collaboration with his experience in  quinone chemistry and photochemistry.  ***",
