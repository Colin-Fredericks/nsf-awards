 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish a consortium to promote incorporation of molecular modeling into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. The consortium will be initiated by summer workshops in molecular modeling for college chemistry faculty. The workshops will make use of computer hardware and software purchased In 1995 with the help of funding from the National Science Foundation. College faculty will sign up for a week of study in the theory and application of molecular modeling as it applies to the entire chemistry curriculum. The workshops will emphasize links between laboratory experimentation and modeling on the computer as well as the use of modeling in various lecture courses. After the workshops, participants will communicate through the Molecular Modeling Consortium. The follow-up and dissemination of  participant's results will be conducted electronically by use of the Molecular Modeling Home Page (www.molecules.edu) which is already in place.         The project will be directed by individuals having 10 years experience in molecular modeling and 20 years of experience using computers in chemical education. Dissemination of modeling experiments already developed is underway and will continue as other new experiments are refined.",
