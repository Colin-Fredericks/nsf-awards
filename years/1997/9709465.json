 "awd_abstract_narration": "When parents save money for their children's college education, a portion of their savings is later taken away in the form of reduced eligibility for college financial aid.  In this way, the college financial aid system levies a sizable implicit tax on assets.  Previous  studies  all find that this implicit tax substantially reduces savings.  This project will build on the authors' previous work to produce better estimates of the savings impact of college financial aid.  The first part of the project will use their tax rate estimates together with the methodology developed by Feldstein to estimate directly the extent to which the implicit taxes affect asset accumulation for the families in the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study 1986-1987 (NPSAS 1986-1987).  This methodology will not, however, provide an estimate of the steady-state impact on asset holdings nor the effect of alternative financial aid systems.  These limitations, together with others, argue for adoption of an alternative methodology.  The second part of the project will, therefore, estimate family preferences and use these estimates to simulate household responses to the financial aid system.  This part will begin by fitting data from the NPSAS 1986-1987 to a standard dynamic model of intertemporal savings and consumption decisions, adapted to incorporate choices regarding college expenditure.  This procedure will yield estimates of structural parameters corresponding to each family's propensity to save and to spend on college.  These parameters will then be used to simulate how each family would adjust its savings and consumption profiles as well as its college choices under several alternative financial aid systems.  Estimates of the long-run impact of each system on savings will be made by following each family through the life cycle and aggregating assets first across families and second across cohorts.  Finally, equivalent variations will be calculated for each family to assess the distribution consequences and the efficiency gains or losses from replacing the current financial aid system with alternative systems.",
