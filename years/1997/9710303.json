 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Grossmann - 9710303    Current techniques for process synthesis are aimed at creating process flowsheets in which each unit performs a distinct function such as reaction, separation or heat exchange.  It is known, however, that there are cases when integrating functions in one single equipment can lead to significant economic savings.  An example is the Eastman Chemical process for methyl  acetate that involves the use of reactive distillation.  From the standpoint of design research, one difficulty is that there are no systematic techniques for identifying and synthesizing such process flowsheets.  This research project deals with the synthesis of process flowsheets that involve units that integrate multiple functions, such as reaction and separation.  A major motivation is to simultaneously perform multiple tasks in a given unit, which simplifies the structure of the process flowsheet, possibly yielding large reductions in the investment and operating expenses.    The project will first address this synthesis problems at two different levels.  One is at a high level of representation in which new geometric composition diagrams that will allow the visualization of design alternatives will be investigated.  The objective at this level will be the identification of cases when the integration of functions in one equipment is likely to prove to be advantageous.  The second level is detailed in nature and involves the modeling and solution of the corresponding discrete/continuous optimization problems.  New representations of superstructures and mathematical programming models will be investigated to search for optimal flowsheets with units that can perform multiple tasks.  The integration of the two synthesis levels will be investigated through a multilevel synthesis strategy that relies on a modeling approach that allows the coupling of functions.  The project will involve collaboration with Eastman Chemical Company through joint work in the development of the synthesis strategy, in the  testing with real process examples, and through mutual visits by the PI's and a graduate student.",
