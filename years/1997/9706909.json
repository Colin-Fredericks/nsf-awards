 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706909  Gibson  A roxatane consists of a cyclic molecule physically threaded  onto a linear molecule with no covalent bonds between the  cyclic and the linear species; a catenane consists of  interlocked cyclic molecules.  The concepts of  supramolecular chemistry will be employed to synthesize new  polymeric roxatanes and catenanes.  Microcalorimetry will  provide fundamental data on the threading of cyclic  molecules by linear species with respect to factors such as  the nature of the two components (size, rigidity,  structure), the solvent and temperature.  Building on this  thermodynamic data base for small molecules, these building  blocks will be used to produce new polymeric materials.  Three prototypical supramolecular systems that possess high  association constants will be utilized to construct entirely  new polyrotaxanes, including main chain and graft systems.  A new class of hyperbranched and dendritic macromolecules  whose structural integrity is based on rotaxane repeat units  will be synthesized from psuedorotaxanes (without stoppers)  having AB2 functionalities; the repeat units will consist of  a linear species with macrocyclic end groups, the linear  portion being threaded through the macrocycle of another  unit.  Another new class of macromolecules, slip link  polymers, consisting of a rotaxane repeat unit in a linear  structure will be prepared by polymerization of standard BB  monomers with novel pseudorotaxane, AA topological monomers  in which one functionality resides on the linear guest  portion and one on the cyclic or host portion and the linear  portion bears a bulky blocking group; such materials are  expected to show novel behavior under longitudinal tension  and compression because of the compliance of the rotaxane  structure.  Since the complexation processes can reversed  under suitable conditions the properties (light absorption,  viscosity, solid state structure, solubility, mechanical  properties, etc.) of these systems are expected to be  sensitive the thei r environments, e.g., temperature,  solvent, redox conditions, the presence or absence of metal  ions or the acidity of the medium.  Finally the oldest  method of rotaxane and catenane formation, the so-called  chemical conversion method, will be applied for the first  time to prepare polyrotaxanes and polycatenanes.  This  method involves reaction of molecules that possess linear  components threaded intramolecularly through a macrocycle  attached via a \"temporary bond\".  Polymerization via  terminal functionalities on the linear thread will yield  polyrotaxanes after the temporary bond is broken.  On the  other hand, cyclization of the self threaded system will be  employed to make a series of functionalized  2 catenanes of  the AA, AB, and AB2 types, which will be polymerized to form  a variety of new linear, hyperbranched and dendritic  poly 2 catenanes.  %%%  The principles of supramolecular chemistry will be applied  to the construction of several new families of polymeric  materials which contain units that are mechanically rather  than chemically linked together.  Because of their novel  topological structures the physical properties of these new  materials are expected to be unusually responsive to their  environments and external stimuli.  Thus these systems offer  entirely new design principles for controlling physical and  chemical properties that could enable new sensors, smart or  adaptable materials and electronic devices.  ***",
