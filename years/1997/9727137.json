This is an attractive  strategy, but it is not universally applicable.  The  alternative processes can be major generators of  environmentally-harmful waste, and can involve materials  that are only marginally less hazardous.  Thus, other  options are needed.  This proposal examines a novel approach  to the problem of using reactive and hazardous chemicals: in-  situ generation.  Successful development of this concept  will create important new options in the area of environ-  mentally-benign chemical synthesis.    Formaldehyde is an example of a hazardous and costly  chemical that has traditionally been avoided in chemical  synthesis.  It is a suspected or probable' man carcinogen,  and it is so reactive that it cannot be stored or shipped in  pure form.  However, a number of important chemicals could  be produced with much less pollution and with greater safety  via formaldehyde than by their current commercial processes.  For example, substitution of formaldehyde-based processes  for the technologies currently used to produce methyl  methacrylate and styrene could eliminate the use of about 8  billion pounds of benzene and about 250 million pounds of  hydrogen cyanide annually, and could eliminate about 1  billion pounds of ammonium bisulfate waste and about 100  million pounds of aluminum trichloride waste annually, in  the United States alone.    The recent development of high-temperature slurry reactors  in our laboratory, coupled with steady progress in the  catalysis and reaction engineering of polystep reactions,  permits a new approach to utilization of hazardous  chemicals.  In essence, the hazardous chemical will be  generated and consumed in situ in a single reactor.  For  example, it is known that formaldehyde can react with methyl  propionate over various heterogeneous catalysts in the  temperature range of 300 to 400' C to form methyl  methacrylate.  It should be possible to simultaneously  dehydrogenate methanol to formaldehyde in the same reactor,  using a different catalyst.  The coupling of these two  reactions would result in the synthesis of methyl  methacrylate from methanol and methyl propionate.  Similarly, styrene could be synthesized from methanol and  toluene.  The key is to employ a slurry reactor containing a  physical mixture of a methanol dehydrogenation catalyst and  a catalyst for the formaldehyde-consuming reaction, with the  rates of the two reactions properly balanced.    This research will focus on in-situ formaldehyde generation,  i.e., the dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde, in a  high-temperature slurry reactor.  Emphasis will be placed on  understanding the effect of catalyst composition and  structure, and the reactor design and operating variables,  on the kinetics and selectivity of the reaction.  This  knowledge will provide a sound fundamental basis for  coupling in-situ formaldehyde generation with various  formaldehyde-consuming reactions.    The proposed research program has the potential to produce a  major advance in environmentally-benign chemical synthesis,  since the novel concept of in-situ generation should have  broad applicability as an enabling technology for process  substitution.  The proposed research will also provide an  important scientific advance, i.e., a more fundamental basis  for the a priori design of catalyst systems for polystep  reactions in slurry reactors.  ***",
