 "awd_abstract_narration": "The past few years have seen rapid advancements in developing and  constructing gene maps for humans. Because these maps are  constructed from different sources of data and methods,  a search of the genome databases may result in several different  maps on the same group of markers.  Therefore, it is important to  combine (integrate) them to form consensus maps so that they can  then be used for mapping new genes.    The long-term objective of this project is to develop sound  statistically-based procedures for integrating human gene maps.  This includes integrating genetic maps from several studies, and  integrating genetic maps with a variety of other maps, including  physical maps and radiation hybrid maps.  As a first step, the  focus is to develop a workable statistical procedure for  summarizing genetic maps, including summary statements of  uncertainty about the order of loci and genetic distances from  each study; and to develop statistical procedure for integrating  genetic maps from different independent studies.  The specific  aim of the current proposal is to carry out a preliminary  study to determine whether Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)  methods are feasible in addressing these issues.  We plan to  first explore various possibilities of constructing an efficient  MCMC scheme for sampling from the distribution of interest.  This  includes studying sensitivities of prior distributions,  efficiencies of proposal distributions, and feasibility of  existing methods for ensuring irreducibility in the current  application.  We will then consider what summaries should be  retained from MCMC outputs, and what statistical procedures  should be employed to combine the summaries from separate MCMC  runs.",
