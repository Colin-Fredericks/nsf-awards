The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Frances M. Hayashida to work with Dr. Ursel  Wagner at the Technical University of Munich in Germany.    Dr. Hayashida surveyed and excavated pottery workshops  discovered at Inka administrative sites on the North Coast  of Peru for her dissertation research.  For this research  project, she will work with Dr. Wagner to analyze the  composition of the pottery and clay.  Production in Inka  workshops can reflect both the traditions of potters, but  also mandates of the state government.  By investigating the  manufacturing process and to better distinguish what may  have been a part of a \"state technology\", pottery and clay  samples of both Inka and local style pottery from workshops  will be analyzed using thin section microsopy, neutron  activation analysis, x-ray diffraction, and Mossbauer  spectroscopy.        ***",
