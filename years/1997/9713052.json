 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713052  Chung    Past research has demonstrated that a major role of boron in  ductilizing intermetallic alloys, such as Ni3Al, is to  suppress moisture-induced embrittlement.  It is generally  agreed that the embrittlement arises from the diffusion of  atomic hydrogen to the crack tip and that the atomic  hydrogen is produced from the chemical reaction between the  water vapor and the freshly exposed intermetallic surfaces.  The mechanism by which the boron suppresses the  embrittlement process has not been explored in detail.  This  project examines three physical and chemical effects of  boron on the surface reactivity of single crystal Ni3(Al,Ti)  surfaces towards water vapor, viz. (1) physical site  blocking; (2) formation of surface hydroxyls in the presence  of oxygen; and (3) modification of the relative rates of  hydrogen desorption and surface diffusion.  To understand a  recent surprising finding that boron-doped Ni3Al is less  ductile than boron-free Ni3Al in dry hydrogen, the  dissociation of hydrogen on Ni3(Al,Ti) surfaces is  investigated.  These studies are performed in situ as a  function of boron surface concentration and temperature  using primarily x-ray photoemission and thermal desorption  on single crystal Ni3(Al,Ti) (100) and (111) surfaces.  Controlled dosing of boron is accomplished using a solid-  state, low-energy boron ion source.  %%%  Nickel aluminide, Ni3Al, belongs to a class of aluminum-  based intermetallics that are potentially valuable for high  temperature structural applications.  This work assists in  understanding factors affecting the ductility of these  alloys.  ***",
