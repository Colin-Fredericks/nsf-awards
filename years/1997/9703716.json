 "awd_abstract_narration": "Matalon  9703716    The objectives of the proposed work is to derive and analyze simple  mathematical models of reacting flow systems by means of asymptotic and  perturbation methods supplemented by numerical computations. The problems  that will be addressed are related to phenomena that have been observed  experimentally and are not yet completely understood. They fall in two  categories: the first class of problems is concerned with premixed flames  propagating in tubes, while the second class is concerned with diffusion  flames (non-premixed combustion) that result from evaporating liquid fuels.  The mathematical formulation of these problems can be reduced to a single,  or a couple, of evolution equations that contain the main ingredients of  the physical problem and are to be solved numerically. For premixed flames  propagating in tubes the evolution equation takes the form of an  integro-differential equation that describes the instantaneous shape and  location of the flame front. For the burning of liquid films one finds, in  general, two equations: one for the dynamics of the interface between the  liquid and gas phases, and the other for the diffusion flame sheet which is  the interface where the fuel vapor burns with the ambient oxidant.      Combustion processes are extremely complicated; they encompass subjects  concerned with energy generation and heat transfer, rates and mechanisms of  chemical reactions, fluid flow and mass transport. They cover a broad range  of important engineering technologies as well as topics of primary societal  and environmental concerns. A fundamental way to gain understanding into  the complex phenomena that one observe in various combustion systems is  through mathematical modeling. This approach enables one to identify the  underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the observed phenomenon, to  study the interaction between the various physical parameters and to  explore whether this interaction leads to the observed behavior. A deep  understandin g often leadq to suggestions of new directions for experiments  and design. The problems in this study are concerned with premixed flames,  relevant to internal combustion engines and aerospace propulsion systems  where the fuel and oxidant are intimately mixed prior to ignition, and  combustion of liquid fuels, relevant to accidental spillage and fire spread  where, under special circumstances, burning may occur with the available  ambient oxidant.",
