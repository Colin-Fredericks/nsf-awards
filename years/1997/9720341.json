 "awd_abstract_narration": "9720341  Ashley                 A clinical ethicist, cognitive psychologist, law professor/computer scientist, and computer  scientist/linguist team up to examine how students reason with and learn from case-based texts in  the context of a two-term required graduate engineering ethics course. Taught by the clinical  ethicist, the course is structured so that students regularly discuss and resolve cases as they are  introduced to ethical reasoning and a set of methodological tools developed to aid in the resolution  of ethical dilemmas.               The overall goal of this research is to help students learn to identify ethical components in  practical engineering problems and to enhance their ability to apply the methodological tools and  justifications as they resolve the dilemmas. More specifically, the project goals are to (1) examine  how engineering students adapt conceptual tools for ethical reasoning as they are introduced to,  discuss, and resolve dilemmas presented in the case-based texts; (2) descriptively model this  process using a Web-browser-compatible automated drafting environment (ADE) as a data  gathering tool; (3) examine how ADE's on-line data base of case-based texts, conveniently  accessible in ADE's Web-browser-like drafting environment, can assist this process; (4) explore  how to use computational models of the underlying case-based reasoning to enable ADE to  provide intelligent assistance in aspects of the process; and (S) evaluate how having access to ADE  compliments or interferes with students' developing ability to identify, articulate, analyze and  resolve ethical problems.               The resulting methodological tool, ADE provides convenient access, for both teacher and  student, to an on-line database of textual materials such as methodologies and cases outlined in the  required course texts, mid-level principles, professional codes of engineering ethics, decisions of a  professional association ethics review board and an existing on-line repository of engi neering  ethics cases and commentary. ADE acts like an intelligent assistant engaging students in a  dialectical process. It provides an \"argument worksheet\", a checklist to help the student analyze  an ethical problem, case-based access to information for constructing the arguments, and feedback.  ADE is evaluated empirically in terms of a cognitive model to be developed in an empirical  investigation of case-based learning to solve ill-defined problems. Building ADE also contributes  to three main research areas in Artificial Intelligence, Case-Based Reasoning, and Intelligent  Tutoring: 1. Case representation and relevance assessment, 2. Planning ethical arguments and  explaining those plans, and 3. Recognizing students' solution plans.",
