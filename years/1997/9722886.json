Augustine, Duke University    This application seeks funding for an international research  conference on Mechanisms of Secretion.  Function in the  nervous and endocrine systems requires chemical  communication between cells.  Neurotransmitters bridge the  gap between nerve cells whereas protein hormones delivered  to the  bloodstream trigger physiological processes in various  tissues.  Both types of chemical signals are released from  cells by a similar process that involves the fusion of  secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane.  Understanding this process of membrane fusion and its  regulation is the focus of much active research.  Dramatic  progress over the last 3-4 years led to the identification  of several proteins that are required for  neurotransmitter release.  The discovery that very similar  proteins are involved in many other intracellular membrane  fusion events indicates that common principles govern  membrane fusion.  The goal of this conference is to bring  together scientists at the cutting edge of this research for  a lively and timely exchange of ideas on the recently-  emergent general principles in membrane fusion, and to  promote a translation of insights from biochemical,  molecular and genetic research to understanding  physiological mechanisms.  The conference is sponsored by  the Society for General Physiologists and will be held  September 4-6, 1997 in  Woods Hole, MA at the Marine Biological Laboratory as a  small meeting (~250 participants).  In addition to 20  speakers in 5 sessions plus a keynote speaker, posters will  be presented at 3 sessions, and 8 short talks will be  programmed in 2 New Ideas sessions.  Accomodation awards to  10 grad students/postdocs will encourage participation by  young scientists. Sessions will cover: second messenger  regulation of secretion, proteins involved in secretion,  vesicle pools in secretion, membrane  fusion mechanisms and  endocytosis.  Dr. James Rothman will deliver the keynote  address on \"Mechanisms and machinery of intracellular  protein transport.\"",
