 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602579  Shore    This award will support the travel of  the principal  investigator, Professor Richard Shore, Department of  Mathematics, Cornell University, and two junior  investigators, Professor Peter Cholak, Department of  Mathematics, University of Notre Dame, and Professor Andre  Nies, Department of Mathematics, University of Chicago, to  New Zealand over a three year-period.  In New Zealand, they  will work with colleagues in the logic groups at Victoria  University, notably Professor Rodney Downey, and at Auckland  University, including Dr. Bakhadyr M. Khoussainov who  recently took up his position after serving as an Assistant  Professor at Cornell University.  They will each work on a  number of topics in recursion theory united by a common  theme of  studying how computation interacts with various  areas of logic, mathematics and computer science.  Most of  the work will be done by applying the methods of  computability theory such as the priority method and other  tools of logic such as the coding theories to the study of  effectiveness issues in other mathematics settings.  This  project combines the strengths of three of the leading U.S.  groups in logic with one of the leading centers of logic  research in the Pacific Basin at Victoria University in  Wellington.",
