 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hahnfeldt  9707991       When a cell population is subjected to toxic or transforming  doses of chemical or radiation agents, the net population effect  depends not only on the total dose but also on the time course of  dose delivery, i.e. one has dose-rate effects.  Dose-rate effects  are not only very important in themselves but give insight into  the underlying biochemical mechanisms and kinetics of damage  formation.  For ionizing radiation, DNA repair usually leads to  direct dose-rate effects, i.e. less damage if a given dose is  prolonged.  But, for dynamic cell populations, inverse dose-rate  effects, with more damage for prolonged irradiation, also occur.  The inverse dose-rate effects are due to the first part of a  prolonged dose delivery preferentially killing the more sensitive  cells in a diverse cell population, and biological processes then  driving the preferentially spared, more resistant cells into more  sensitive states, where the remainder of the dose can act upon  them more effectively.  Such resensitization is often due to  redistribution of the cell population attendant on movement  through the cell cycle.  The investigator studies dose-rate  effects for induced damage to a heterogeneous, dynamic  population, by combining standard models for cell population  dynamics with standard models for cell damage.  Various  population dynamics models are be used, having the common feature  that there is a well-defined asymptotic growth rate and an  asymptotically stable population structure.  Recent  resensitization theorems on the killing of cycling cells are  extended to theorems on cell populations having additional  diversity.  Biologically important examples under investigation  include: (a) populations consisting of more than one  age-structured subpopulation, (b) maturity-structured populations  (with cell cycle synchrony loss ascribed to variable age  progression over time), and (c) populations subjected to  environmental stochasticity.  Quantitative models, developed in  p reliminary studies, of the inverse dose-rate effect for in vitro  transformation, an indicator of cellular mutagenesis are  generalized.       Adverse effects of radiation (or chemicals) in the  environment often occur at low dose rates over long periods of  time.  For practical reasons, laboratory studies of the  parameters that govern the adverse effects normally use much  shorter time periods and much higher dose rates.  To bridge this  gap, modeling of dose-rate effects is needed.  One dose-rate  effect is observable for populations, e.g. of cells, that possess  any sort of susceptibility variation over time to toxic insults.  Under these conditions, prolonging the delivery of a fixed total  dose  e.g., by halving the intensity (or concentration) and  doubling the exposure time  will not have neutral effect but will  instead change the efficacy of that fixed total exposure.  This  is because more of the population members, as they undergo their  sensitivity variations naturally over time, will now have the  opportunity to display their more susceptible states in time to  be affected by the exposure.  This pattern is different from that  anticipated in most laboratory studies.  Over a wide range of  conditions, the difference can in fact make a given dose more  damaging when delivered over a prolonged period rather than  rapidly, but for some other conditions, the opposite result can  be expected.  Mathematical theorems are developed to elucidate  these dependencies.  Important implications of this investigation  include the prediction of cellular mutagenesis and transformation  frequencies due to ambient, long-duration stress conditions.",
