 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704864    Ostrov     This project is aimed at resolving issues of uniqueness and  computability for a class of Hamilton-Jacobi equations and related  Conservation laws that contain discontinuous spatial data.  It will  begin with the Hamilton-Jacobi equation that relates surface height  to spatial data collected by Synthetic Aperture Radar.  The  characteristic curves for this radar equation \"flow\" in one direction  like time dependent phenomena.  Due to a monotonicity property of the  Hamiltonian, one can establish -- for some cases -- a unique physical  solution for discontinuous data as the limit of continuous data  approximation viscosity solutions.  One can also prove that this  unique solution can be simulated by monotone numerical schemes.  The  first goal of this project is to combine viscosity solution theory  for Hamilton Jacobi equations with the theory of generalized  characteristics from Conservation Law theory to establish the  uniqueness of the solution for most (or all) cases.  The second goal  is to establish a unique limit for the case of surface reconstruction  from discontinuous optical data.  The optical data equation does not  have \"flowing\" characteristics and therefore requires Dirichlet, as  opposed to Cauchy, boundary conditions.  Generalized characteristics  are inappropriate for Dirichlet conditions, but recent Control Theory  approaches appear to work well in their place.  The Hamiltonian is no  longer monotonic, but it is now convex, which, it is hoped, can be  exploited in a similar manner to the monotonicity property.  Finally,  these methods will be applied to classes of Conservation Laws with  discontinuous media that correspond to the classes of Hamilton-Jacobi  equations previously studied.    Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is used extensively by NASA (who, for  example, collected SAR data for most of the surface of Venus in 1990  using the Magellan probe) and the military.  Ideally, one would like  to reconstruct a surface from the collected radar data.  Thi s  reconstruction (called Shape from Shading) can -- from previous   work -- be accomplished very quickly for noiseless, continuous  radar data.  For discontinuous data, which occurs in the presence of  ridges (e.g., mountains, cliffs, tank edges, building edges, etc.),  it is unknown (a) if only one surface corresponds to the SAR data and  (b) if the surface is computable.  Previous work has shown  that for a number of surfaces there is only one physically likely  surface and it is easy to compute.  First, this project hopes to show  that this is the case for all surfaces.  The next goal of the project  is to extend this result to optical data (i.e., reconstructing a 3-D  surface from a 2-D photograph), which has numerous applications both  in industry and in the military (where it is typically referred to as  \"computer vision\").  The final goal of this project is to apply these  results to Conservation Laws with discontinuous media (e.g.,  describing chemical separation with two or more solvents, describing  two phase flow, etc.), which is of interest, for example, to Chemical  Engineers, who must be able to compute simulations for these  situations to maximize chemical conversions effectively in industrial  processes.",
