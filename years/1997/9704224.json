Soltis at Kyoto University, Inuyama, Japan.  Dr.  Soltis will work with Dr. Yukimaru Sugiyama, director of the  Primate Research Institute, on a project entitled, \"Mate  Selection in Free-Ranging Japanese Macaques.\"    The conflicting mating strategies of males and females  interact to produce mating and reproductive outcomes.  The  proposed research will investigate the mating strategies of  males and females in a wild troop of Japanese macaques  (Macaca fuscata).  Japanese macaques live in complex, mixed  social groups, with mating strategies dependent upon factors  relating to aggressiveness and subordination.  The proposed  research will combine behavioral and genetic data on subject  animals to determine the influence of these varied factors  on mating and reproductive outcomes.  Previous research has  indicated that the primary determinant in mating strategies  is subordinate position among the troop.  The proposed  research is designed to generalize these results based on  data obtained from a wild, free-ranging troop of Japanese  macaques.  Results from the proposed research will provide  insight into the underlying strategies of male-female  interaction in Japanese macaques and the mating and  reproductive outcomes in complex social groups.  ***",
