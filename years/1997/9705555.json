The Partnership will use the existing Seattle Partnership for Inquiry-Based Science, funded by a National Science Foundation grant for local Systemic Change, as the framework for the proposed activities.  During the planning phase, the project staff will:    * identify barriers to participation by families in their children's education paying special attention to ethnic minorities and individuals with limited proficiency in English;  * develop and pilot-test an array of methods aimed at reducing these barriers;  * promote awareness and involvement of parents in inquiry-based science activities;  * develop new inquiry-based tools for science investigations; and  * establish collaborative partnerships among the Seattle School District, the University of Washington, the Woodland Park Zoo, and other informal science centers.",
