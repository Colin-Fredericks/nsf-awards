 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematics Department is committed to increasing the use of new and modern technology in the classroom and curriculum.  The introduction of mandatory mathematics laboratories as an integral part of selected courses is viewed as one significant way to increase the success and retention rate of developmental mathematics students.  The purpose of this project is to integrate a graphical, numerical, and analytical approach in teaching selected developmental mathematics courses taught at the college.  For this purpose, the project's specific objectives are to adapt and synthesize methods from other successful reform efforts in teaching of developmental mathematics; modify these methods to meet the needs of a diverse student population; and utilize various commercial and locally available or developed software to support the delivery of mathematics instruction.    This project secures the necessary laboratory equipment to expand and modernize the old laboratory so as to permit the incorporation of mandatory mathematics laboratories into the Basic Mathematics course and the Introduction to Algebra and Geometry course; provides faculty development activities to all instructors and laboratory assistants on the use of the new equipment, software, and instructional methods; provides additional mathematics instruction (an added 2 laboratory hours per week), in a laboratory environment, for our students which emphasizes graphical and numerical techniques, as well as more traditional methods.    With this project, the number of computers in the mathematics laboratory increases from 24 workstations to 78 workstations connected to a network supported by three servers.  The expanded laboratory has the capacity to support approximately 1,300 students who enroll in these two developmental courses each semester, and is available to another 3,000 enrolled in other mathematics courses.",
