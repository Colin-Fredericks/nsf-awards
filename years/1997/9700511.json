The  educational benefit of this project will be derived from the  undergraduate chemistry training to better reflect important  scientific and technological issues facing society.  %%%  The materials to be synthesized and characterized constitute  a  new  class of layered materials with potential uses  that  included electro-optic devices and frequency mixing devices.  These   device   materials   therefore   are   relevant   to  applications areas such as optical data storage and  optical  communications  technologies,  making  possible  educational  benefits  that  lead  to  a  better  understanding  at   the  undergraduate   level  of  education   of   scientific   and  technological issues facing society.  ***",
