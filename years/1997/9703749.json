Dr. Korde will work with Dr. Yukihisa  Washio, Senior Research Engineer, on a research project  entitled, \"Optimal Control of Floating Wave Energy Devices.\"    Over the last two decades, various types of devices have  been developed to absorb wave energy, with near-shore,  shallow-water devices being far easier to install and  maintain.  The practical problem currently confronted by  researchers, however, is how to develop applications that  absorb increased available wave energy in deeper waters.  The principal component of most devices is the primary  energy converter, a technique that oscillates in response to  the waves and converts these oscillations into revolutions  via a turbogenerator or reciprocations of a pump.  On  floating devices, the primary converter motion normally  occurs using the floating hull as a reference, a process  that reduces the energy-conversion efficiency.  Significant  improvements would result if one could provide on board the  hull an actively controlled body which serves as a steady  frame of reference. The primary goal of the proposed  research is to develop such a system.  The secondary goal is  to develop a time-domain control method that adjusts the  primary converter dynamics on a wave-by-wave basis to  optimize the energy absorbed in irregular waves.  ***",
