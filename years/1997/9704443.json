 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704443    Guest    The investigator will study topological and geometrical properties   of the space of  harmonic maps from certain compact Riemann   surfaces to compact Lie groups and symmetric spaces.   He will   continue his collaboration with Y. Ohnita and others to determine   the connected components and the fundamental groups of these spaces,   in the case where the domain is a two sphere. The method uses   suitable group actions on these spaces to produce continuous   deformations of harmonic maps, together with Morse theoretic arguments.   He will also collaborate with F. E. Burstall and others to establish   a common understanding of the construction of harmonic maps in the   cases where the domain is a two sphere or a torus, i.e. harmonic maps   of finite uniton number or harmonic maps of finite type, respectively.   The method here uses the geometry of loop groups, together with methods   from the theory of integrable systems. The investigator will continue   his previous work on the topology of spaces of holomorphic maps.    This is an essential ingredient in the study of spaces of harmonic   maps, and also of independent interest, being related to recent   developments in the topology of moduli spaces.    This work is motivated by the role played by symmetry in solving   equations of mathematics and physics.  Over the past thirty years,  mathematicians have come to realize that some of the most important   differential equations which describe the real world are subject  to very extensive but \"hidden\" (and therefore somewhat mysterious)  symmetries.  Even when the equations describe a finite-dimensional  process, such as a simple mechanical system, hidden symmetries can  be infinite dimensional in extent.  Such symmetries often turn out to  be the key to solving the equation. As a consequence, mathematical  research in this area aims to predict the existence of hidden  symmetries for a particular equation and then attempts to use  these symmetries to solve the equation.  The inves tigator aims to do   this for the harmonic map equation. Studying the symmetries of  individual equations like this will lead eventually to a general theory of  equations with hidden symmetries.  Such a theory would be a significant  advance in understanding the many natural phenomena which are  governed by equations of this type.",
