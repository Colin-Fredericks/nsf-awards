 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides resources for the development of  design and analysis tools that include uncertainties and that will address a variety of manufactured products. Unlike previous probabilistic methods for treating uncertainties in design, the developed method will treat uncertainties in terms of possible values expressed as conventional tolerances.  The methods and tools that will be developed have their foundation in fuzzy set theory, which allows the formulation to have a strong mathematical base with rigorous analysis of the developed methods.  The work will initially address the treatment of load uncertainty and loading combinations in problems of static stress analysis of mechanical components.  The methods and software developed will then be expanded to treat uncertainty of material properties and component geometry.  Along with developing the analysis methods, software tools will be written that are needed for implementations such as mesh generator for fuzzy geometry. Evaluation of results of the fuzzy based calculations will be compared to combinatorial solutions when possible.  The methods will then be extended to time dependent problems.      The results of this research will provide both the methods and software tools to include uncertainties in the stress analysis of components via conventional tolerances.  The expression of uncertainties in terms of tolerances will allow design engineers to include uncertainties in analysis using a familiar concept. The methods, while developed explicitly for solid mechanics, will be applicable to any finite element based engineering analysis (heat transfer, fluid mechanics, electric and magnetic fields).  The software tools will include methods for solving a sparse, fuzzy based system of equations and integrating element stiffness matrices and will allow the developed methods to be incorporated into existing commercial finite element programs.  When such methods are included in commercial analysis and design programs, designers will be able to routinely consider the effects of uncertainties in geometry, materials, and environmental loading in design decisions.  Hence, the reliability of product designs using these tools will be improved.",
