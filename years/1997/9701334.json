 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ketterson  9701334         Recent investigations have revealed the presence of  maternally-derived steroid hormones in the yolks of avian  eggs.  However, many questions concerning both the  functional significance and the mechanism of action of yolk  steroids remain unanswered.  By concentrating on the  interactions between hormones, physiology, and behavior, the  proposed research will elucidate the role yolk steroids in  the development and survival of offspring in the context of  hatching asynchrony.  In doing so, the mechanisms by which  yolk steroids facilitate growth and survival will be  identified.       Preliminary research on the eggs of red-winged  blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus, has shown that the  concentration of yolk testosterone varies with laying order  in such a way that later-laid eggs contain more hormone.  Therefore, this research will focus on the developmental and  fitness effects of yolk testosterone by:  (1) Establishing  whether yolk testosterone levels are correlated with growth  rate, muscle development, or begging intensity.  (2)  Demonstrating causation between yolk testosterone levels and  these physiological and behavioral variables by injecting  testosterone into yolks.  (3) Investigating the effects of  female age on yolk testosterone levels in a system where  older females produce a greater number of fledglings than  first-time breeders.",
