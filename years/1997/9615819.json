Earlier studies  making claims for face-specific recognition mechanisms include a  number of experimental confounds.  Addressing these concerns will  first require the use of computer graphics to create carefully  controlled three-dimensional objects for presentation in  psychophysical, neuropsychological, and functional neuroimaging  experiments.  These objects will include a set of non-face  control objects that will combine several properties of faces  (such as a fixed configuration of parts and homogeneity across  the class) but none of their superficial characteristics.  A  first set of psychophysical experiments will use these novel  stimuli, as well as familiar classes of objects, to assess which  of the several \"face-specific\" behavioral effects described in  the literature can be obtained for a) individual as opposed to  more categorical judgments for the same objects and, b) with  experts as opposed to novice participants.  New expertise  training procedures will provide methods for manipulating  participants' experience with the novel object class as well as a  better understanding of the reorganization of recognition  mechanisms that may occur during expertise acquisition.  A second  set of experiments will test brain-lesioned patients  traditionally classified as having a face-specific disorder in  neuropsychological experiments with the same object class to test  whether face-recognition deficits may be better described as an  impairment of exemplar-level processing mechanisms.  Testing of  these patients will be performed in a manner closer to what is  standard in the testing of normal participants, by improving the  control of object presentation and of response measurements, in  particular using reaction times and signal detection measure s.   Other experiments will use methods developed for studying the  creation of expertise in normals to explore the plasticity of the  visual system of patients with recognition deficits.  A third set  of experiments will study the neural substrate of exemplar vs.  categorical level visual judgments using functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI).  While the importance of comparing face  processing to exemplar-level processing of non-face objects has  been acknowledged, few studies have compared recognition  judgments at different levels of abstraction for the same  objects, in particular, under conditions where participants begin  as novices and then gain experience with an object class.   Longitudinal fMRI studies will assess the neural changes  underlying expertise acquisition at multiple levels of  categorization.  Overall, these experiments should shed some  light on the issue of face-specificity in the visual system,  provide data about the role of categorization level and expertise  for object recognition, explore rehabilitation possibilities for  patients with visual form recognition deficits, and extend our  understanding of the plasticity of the human visual system.  ***",
