 "awd_abstract_narration": "BROADIE, KENDAL   IBN - 9722213    Movement, behavior and higher brain function all require  nerve cells to transmit information to each other, and to  muscle cells. Information travels along the nerve cell in  the form of an electrical impulse, and is  transmitted to another cell via a special communication link  called a synapse. The objective of this research is to  understand the mechanisms of synapse formation and function.  One powerful approach is to use genetics and molecular  biology in the fruitfly Drosophila  melanogaster. Genetic  mutants which lack a particular component of the synapse are  studied to determine the normal function of that component  in synaptic mechanisms. The fly neuromuscular junction  (NMJ), a synapse formed between a motor nerve  cell and a muscle, is well suited for these investigations  because it is large and accessible for physiology studies.  Recently, a family of four integrin proteins were shown to  be present at the Drosophila NMJ. Integrins are proteins  which span cell membranes and are known to be important in  adhesion and for relaying information across the membrane.  Integrins are always found as pairs: one alpha subunit and  one beta subunit make a functional protein. At the  Drosophila NMJ, four of these integrin subunits have  intriguing expression domains; one alpha-subunit is present  in the nerve cell membrane, two alpha-subunits are present  in the muscle membrane and a single beta-subunit is present  on both sides of the synaptic cleft.  Unlike other synaptic proteins, these integrins show a  distinctive onset of  expression in the NMJ, following  embryonic development and concurrent with the onset of overt  synaptic plasticity, the use-dependent modification of  synaptic morphology and function. Moreover, a mutation in  one of these integrin subunits causes a specific loss of  short-term memory. These results suggest that integrins are  playing important, specific roles in the mature synapse,  possibly mediating a form of plasticity unde rlying higher  brain functions including memory. We propose to investigate  integrin function at the synapse by genetically modifying or  removing each integrin subunit in turn and in combination  and investigating their mutant  phenotypes with a combination of functional  (electrophysiology) and anatomical (light microscopy,  electron microscopy) assays at the NMJ. The long-term goal  is to completely characterize the function of integrins at  the synapse.",
