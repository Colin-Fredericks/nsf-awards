 "awd_abstract_narration": "Founded in 1887 as a graduate institution with a distinguished history in scientific research,  Clark University has rapidly evolved into a university-college, a combination of a small liberal arts college and research-oriented university.  This concept promotes the linkage between teaching and research, where undergraduates are closely involved in the scholarly activities of faculty and graduate students.  This synergetic relationship has been important to the success of  the Ph.D. program in Psychology.  The program has an excellent reputation, and is recognized as one of the institution's lead graduate programs.  The Department resides in Jonas Clark Hall, one of the university's keynote buildings.  Constructed in 1889, the facility in its existing condition cannot support training and faculty research activities.  As a part of Clark's efforts to strengthen its science graduate programs, the university has made a commitment to renovate and modernize Clark Hall.   Funds from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program will be used to partially support the renovation of research and research training space.  The project includes full asbestos abatement, replacement of the HVAC system, reconfiguration of research laboratories, and the upgrade of electrical and communications services.  Upon completion, the renovations will allow full utilization of existing space, accommodate an increased number of researchers associated with graduate training, and provide modern access to new communication technologies.  Improvements to the HVAC system will raise the building to modern research standards, providing ambient conditions throughout the year.  Modernizing the facility will strengthen a long-standing and renown research program that has had success in integrating undergraduate, graduate and faculty research activities.  This NSF project will enable the institution and department to purse its vigorous and expanding roles in research and research training for both undergraduate and graduate students.",
