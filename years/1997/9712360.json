Huband and Gan-Moog Chow  ASEE    Partial travel support will be provided to a group of about eight young academic researchers to participate at the NATO-Advanced Study Institute (ASI) on science and technology of nanoparticle synthesis, processing and nanostructured materials to be held on August 11-21, 1977, at St. Petersburg, Russia.  The Institute is aimed at providing advanced lectures on recent developments by invited speakers to selected advanced Ph.D. students, postdoctoral fellows and junior scientists; exchanges of scientific opinions among all participants from different countries;   and networking and fostering collaborations particularly among young scientists.  Tutorial topics include synthesis and processing of particles and thin layers, particle consolidation and assembly of structures, chemistry and physics of surfaces and interfaces, and related manufacturing processes and applications.  Besides plenary lectures, poster sessions, small group discussions, and informal interactions will be encouraged.  A book will be published in the NATO-ASI Series shortly after the meeting.  The NSF funds will be used for selected scientists and engineers to attend the Institute. Travel funds from this grant will be used only for U.S. citizens, nationals, and permanent residents.  Young scientists and engineers, advanced Ph.D. students or within five years after completion of their Ph.D., will receive priority.    By considering the emerging topic of research to be discussed at the Institute, the quality of the lectures, the exposure of young U.S. scientists and engineers to the international environment, this activity will contribute to the formation of young specialists in U.S. and to development of long-term ollaborations with top researchers in the world.",
