 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  award  supports  research into  a  methodology  under  which  autonomous   agents  can  develop  commonly   shared   rules   of  interaction  and  commonly shared communication languages,  while  interacting  in  a   multi-agent  environment.   Interaction  and  communication  are viewed as agents' attempts to  maximize  their  performance,  measured  as  expected  utility  of  outcomes.  The  research  aims to enable agents to benefit from rules of behavior  that  are  shared and that could emerge among interacting  agents  without  the necessity to recompute currently optimal courses  of  action.    The   research  also  seeks  to  enrich  the   agents'  communicative abilities by formalizing the role and usefulness of  shared  communication languages. The continuation of this  thread  is   the  precise   formalization  of  a  mechanism  of  language  formation.  The  most significant impact of  this  research  will  appear  in   multi-agent scenarios characterized by unanticipated  change,  such  as  those  in hazardous environments,  distributed  management of communications networks, and flexible manufacturing  systems.",
