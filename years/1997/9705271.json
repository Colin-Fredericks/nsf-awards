In this GOALI/Group  Award, supported jointly by DMR and the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities, the PIs will exploit the  unique tandem interplay of domain formation and alignment in  the block copolymer structure and self-organization of the  mesophase by use of liquid crystal block-coil block  copolymers and homopolymers in special applied processing  fields.  From their prior work, they have identified two  general applications which will act as vehicles to exploit  and test fundamental understanding of these tandem  interactions: (1)  to develop the knowledge and engineering  expertise to produce flexible plastic liquid crystalline  displays and switches and (2) to create new thermoplastic  liquid crystalline polymer materials with layered structures  for transparent, highly impermeable barrier film  applications.  To accomplish these goals they plan to  exploit the interactions of microphase separation, liquid  crystallinity and applied fields.  A 3 year program is  envisioned, with a team comprised of Superex Inc. and each  university PI with 1 graduate student and 2 undergraduate  researchers.  Complimentary areas of expertise of the PIs  will ensure a through approach to the investigation: Thomas,  characterization and properties; Ober, synthesis and  characterization; Muthukumar, theory and modeling.  %%%  Apart from the specific scientific and engineering  objectives of this program, the PIs plan to use this inter-  university focused research group collaboration to examine  several new approaches to graduate and undergraduate  education of the students connected with this program.  Both  graduate and undergraduate students will gain research  experience outside the normal university training: graduate  students will mentor undergraduates, and both groups will  learn entrepreneurial skills through exchanges with our  industrial partner and by taking business cou rses.  Communication skills will be improved through joint  seminars.  Students from all three university groups will  participate in special retreat-style meetings, traveling to  a site chosen by the host univeristy.  The location of all  three universities in the Northeast makes such exchanges and  visits very feasible.  They will also encourage both the  graduate and undergraduate students to carry out exchanges  with other university teams.  Each institution and research  group carries with it a unique style and tradition that  influences the way research is approached.  By experiencing  these different cultures, students at both levels (graduate  and undergraduate) will benefit.  The education approaches  found to be most successful will be expanded at MIT, UMass  and Cornell into other undergraduate programs.  ***",
