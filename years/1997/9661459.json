 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  96-61459  DeGregoria    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the use of elastomer bed heat exchangers to improve indoor air quality and occupant comfort for arctic structures.  It will investigate the use of a heat recovery ventilator based on a novel, patented, regenerative heat exchanger, the elastomer bed, which is compact, efficient, and robust in icing conditions.  The regenerative approach provides fresh air ventilation while controlling the loss of moisture, leading to a more comfortable interior humidity level.  A novel, proprietary ventilator design overcomes the seal icing problem of existing regenerative wheel designs.  The regenerative heat exchanger is constructed out of thin elastomer sheets, stacked and stretched into the theoretically optimum, parallel-channel, laminar-flow heat exchanger geometry.  Combining accessible, open channels with flexible elastomer sheets makes it possible to de-ice the heat exchanger mechanically, leading to an energy efficient, continuously available, compact ventilator for arctic regions.  Its compact size allows the unit to be installed practically anywhere, providing local heat recovery ventilation at the point where it is needed.  It would be well suited for both fixed site and modular, transportable structure ventilation, enhancing arctic worker's health and comfort.   Commercial applications are thought to be found across a wide range of building ventilation systems and personal comfort products.  Applications include home and commercial heat recovery ventilators and personal cold weather protective masks.  ***",
