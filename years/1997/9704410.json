Three main areas arise as follows: (1) One could consider  ``braidings'' of a finite number of higher dimensional spheres (or suspensions)  in a fixed manifold as an analogue of the classical Artin braid group.  The  main examples here arise as the universal Lie algebra that satisfies the  Yang-Baxter relations of classical physics, which concerns collisions of  particles.  The homology of the attached function spaces is precisely the  universal enveloping algebras of these ``universal Yang-Baxter Lie algebras.''  The spaces under consideration are loop spaces of classical configuration  spaces as well as ``orbit configuration spaces'' as studied by M. Xicotencatl.  The loop space homology of many of these spaces is shown to be the universal  enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra that is defined in terms of the Yang-  Baxter or infinitesimal braid relations.  The underlying manifold can be a  homogeneous space or a manifold with a Euclidean factor.  In the case of  ``orbit configuration spaces,'' these same relations also appear in knot  invariants as studied by L. Kauffman.  (2) The intimate link between the  structure of certain choices of function spaces in homotopy theory and moduli  spaces of curves within classical algebraic geometry is studied.  The  connecting tissue is the link between Dehn twists and Whitehead products.  These connections are used to give homological calculations.  Here, the space  of maps from a fixed surface to a sphere is considered.  These spaces stably  split, while the stable summands are Thom complexes of bundles with base  given by certain moduli spaces of curves.  In the case of finite genus with  marked points, homological calculations are shown to be an analogue of cyclic  homology, while some specific calculations are carried out.  The plus  construction for the classifying space of th e stable mapping class group is  shown to split.  One factor gives the stable homotopy groups of spheres.  (3) Classical methods in combinatorial group theory are used to attack  problems on the growth of the torsion in the homotopy groups of certain  spaces.  Simplicial methods are used as well as techniques from classical  methods of W. Magnus on embedding groups as units in certain associative  algebras.  Here, the homotopy groups of double suspensions all of whose  homology is torsion are studied.  The main tool is an inverse limit of finite  p-groups.  This tower is an algebraic analog of the Goodwillie tower of the  identity; the groups at each stage are central extensions with centers at  each stage given by the mod-p reductions of modules Lie(n), a module of the  symmetric group on n letters of rank (n-1)! that has occurred ubiquitously in  homotopy theory.       Ordinary braidings of strings are at the foundation of these problems.  One could also imagine braiding other geometric objects such as planes,  spheres, or torii.  These braidings force symmetries that have occurred  previously in physics from considering collisions of particles and are known  as the Yang-Baxter relations.  The first part of this project is a study of  these symmetries for higher dimensional geometric objects.  Next consider the  surface of a doughnut with many holes removed.  In a second direction, the  ``smooth deformations'' of this surface are considered.  The main thrust here  is to analyze the ``holes'' in these spaces of ``smooth deformations'' as  they appear in many contexts in physics, string theory, geometry, algebraic  topology, and holomorphic maps.  A natural continuation is to understand how  spheres of large dimension move around in space provided only continuous  deformations are permitted.  This problem has been the key to others and is  one of the main problems in homotopy theory on which there has been  interesting progress.  These spheres move in much the same way that the hour  hand moves  around a clock.  The actual numbers are quite complicated, and  part of this project is to understand the uniform structure here.  ***",
