 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dyer  960452  5    One of the most exciting frontiers in science concerns the  problem of how the nervous systems of animals and use  information about the natural environments in which they  must survive and reproduce. Studying this problem in  insects offers the hope that given the relatively small  size of the nervous system, we might understand such  cognitive phenomena on the neural level sooner than later.  A first step, however, is to find evidence of interesting  cognitive processes in insects, and to characterize the  behavioral capacities that these processes support. This  project takes on this challenge by considering how honey  bees learn the daily pattern of movement of the sun. A wide  variety of animal species, both vertebrate and  invertebrate, use the sun as a true compass, which requires  compensating for its movement relative to earth-bound  features of the environment. To compensate at a rate that  is appropriate for the season and latitude at which they  are living, most animals learn the current local pattern of  solar movement. What little is known about this learning  process suggests that animals do not merely memorize a list  of solar positions experienced at different times of day.  Instead, in several vertebrate and invertebrate species,  including honey bees, animals have been shown to estimate  the sun's position at times of day (or night) when they  have never seen it. This phenomenon is extremely attractive  as a focus for behavioral analysis. The animals exhibit an  apparently \"cognitive\" form of learning, acquiring an  internal representation of an environmental pattern in  which at least part of the information contained in the  representation is derived through computation rather than  through direct experience. The experiments in this project  are designed to characterize more fully just what honey  bees learn about the sun's course and how they learn it. A  major focus will be to study the interaction between a  bee's inborn knowledge of gen eral features of solar  movement and information that she acquires through  experience. A long-term goal is to obtain insights that can  contribute to a general understanding of the cognitive  basis of spatial orientation in animals.",
