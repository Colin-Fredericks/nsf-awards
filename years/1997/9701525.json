 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integrated-services communication networks that carry multiple traffic classes  with different Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements such  as voice, video and data are becoming a reality.  Each traffic class is characterized by the amount of  bandwidth that it requests from the network, and the  statistics of its arrival process and holding time in the network.  A key feature of emerging high-speed networks is that these  characteristics for the various traffic classes tend to be  widely different.  We focus on two important issues in such networks:  (i) resource sharing for traffic with different bandwidth requirements  and (ii) performance analysis algorithms to evaluate  routing and admission control for such networks.  High bandwidth calls typically experience  high blocking probabilities without some form of admission control that  reserves  a certain portion of the network's resources to handle these  calls. A goal of this research project would be to develop admission control  and routing schemes to improve the blocking performance of high bandwidth  calls  without adversely affecting the network utilization. The presence of a large  mixture of bandwidth classes also poses unique challenges in evaluating  the performance of such admission control and routing schemes.  We will develop a combination of  analytical and simulation techniques that would provide  fast and accurate estimates of the blocking probabilities  for all traffic classes in the network.",
