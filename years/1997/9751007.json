 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the creation of a center for the study of relativity.  The center is housing the equipment for students to study the effects of relativity through three activities.  The first activity involves the measurement of the speed and lifetime of cosmic ray moons.  These measurements confirm that the speed of light is the maximum speed, and that the moon lifetime is dilated during flight.  The second activity verifies the relativistic relationship between energy, momentum, and velocity by measuring the energy of betas from a radioactive source after they have passed through momentum and velocity selectors.  The third activity investigates relativistic effects with computer calculations that model phenomena such as scattering.  Advanced students are conducting research projects in the center using the new computer.  The laboratory is also serving as a center for recruitment.  The walls have posters, photographs, and explanations of the equipment and calculations.  Results of research by students are also being prominently displayed.  This tactic allows potential majors to feel the excitement of scientific research experienced by their peers. This center is, therefore, serving an important recruitment tool, as well as a state-of-the art laboratory and research station.",
