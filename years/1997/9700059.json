 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for the development of a decision support tool for concurrent design of multi-component systems, such as power tools, that are subject to multiple views, such as design, manufacturing, and marketing considerations.  The developed numerical tool will determine design attributes of a product system such that, given the product market demand, the highest possible utility of the design is achieved.  The utility of the product design at the system's level will be modeled by a single utility (or objective) function.  This function will be formulated to meet the goals of a business.  The objective function at the systems level will be a function of the objectives at the subsystems (or components) level.  The objective functions at the subsystems level will be formulated based on performance, quality, and cost metrics. Appropriate constraints will be imposed.  The model will allow interactions and tradeoff explorations by a top-level decision maker, at the system-level, and by decision makers at the subsystems level.  An application of the model to the design of a power tool will be demonstrated in order to obtain a compromise collaborative design solution.   If successful, the results of this research will lead to increased level of concurrency in the engineering design process, reduce product design development time, reduce cost, and as a result make the US industry more competitive in the global marketplace.",
