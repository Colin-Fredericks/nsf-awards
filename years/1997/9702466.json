 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to improve the ease-of-use  and performance of parallel systems by combining  state-of-the art compiler technology with an  enhanced  implementation of software distributed shared  memory (DSM). The programming interface, compile-  time analysis, and runtime support necessary to  achieve these goals will be developed.  Compilers that target the underlying message  passing on distributed systems offer good  performance for applications whose access  patterns are regular.  However, other types of  accesses, if compilable at all, currently  require complex run-time support. Run-time DSM  systems provide good overall performance by  fetching data on-demand, but incur additional  overhead for regular accesses  The research supported by this grant aims to  develop enhancements to the DSM interface that  will utilize static information about program  behavior, including data accesses and  consistency requirements, and provide a uniform  interface and implementation for different  levels of hardware support for shared memory, as  well as for the hierarchical structure of memory  in some architectures.  The proposed work will contribute to the better  utilization of distributed systems for parallel  computing. To further this goal, a course on  parallel computing will be developed that will  target not only undergraduate students in  computer science, but also potential parallel  computer users in  other science and engineering disciplines. Every  opportunity will be used to stress the  interaction among different system components,  and their effect on performance and programming.  ***",
