 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712852  Benoit  This project addresses the evaluation of a novel field  technique to be used at the Treasure Island National  Geotechnical Experimentation Site (NGES) in San Francisco,  California; the objective being to evaluate the insitu void  ratio and soil fabric at this site.    This technique consists of vertical and horizontal  measurements of soil electrical resistivity using two  specially instrumented piezocones simultaneously pushed into  the ground.  The method, designed by a research group in  Italy at the Hydraulic and Structural Research Center of the  Italian Electricity Agency (ENEL-CRIS), allows continuous  electrical resistivity measurements in the vertical  direction for each probe and in the horizontal direction  between the two probes.  The results, using groundwater and  soil samples, are calibrated against laboratory tests on  samples reconstituted at various densities.  This field  technique permits a large volume of soil to be tested,  avoiding the unwanted remolding effects surrounding the  device.  Because of the difficulty in obtaining undisturbed  insitu samples for laboratory testing of sands, this insitu  method shows great potential in providing parameters needed  for the prediction of the dynamic response of soils  subjected to earthquake loading.    The potential of this insitu electrical resistivity cone  penetration test to provide new soil parameters to evaluate  the earthquake response of natural sand deposits will  advance the state-of-the-art and permit rapid and cost-  effective methods for characterization of cohesionless  soils.",
