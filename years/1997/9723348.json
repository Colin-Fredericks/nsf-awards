For example, during confrontations, heart  rate and blood flow to the active muscles must  go up but blood flow to the kidney can be  reduced.  On the other hand, when it gets cold,  blood flow to the skin decreases while flow to  internal organs increases to retain heat.  These  types of changes in heart rate and blood flow  are regulated by a specific part of the brain  called the RVLM.  This study examines how these  nerve cells of the RVLM coordinate nerve  activity to regulate the cardiovascular system  during different behavioral states.  Particular  attention is paid to the characteristics of the  chemical substances released from cells in this  area that modulate the activity of this center,  and thus change the pattern of cardiovascular  activity. The results from this study contribute  to understanding how blood flow and blood  pressure are adjusted to meet the needs of the  body under different or emergency situations.  Such information is fundamental to a deeper  understanding of how blood pressure is  controlled.",
