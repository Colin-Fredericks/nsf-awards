Properties of interest include microstructure, residual  stress, dislocation density, porosity, and cure state.  This  symposium gathers together the technologists of  nondestructive methods with mechanical engineers and  materials scientists both to explore the applications of  nondestructive characterization and the solutions to the  problems encountered.  Papers include research and  applications for aging infrastructure, resonant ultrasound  spectroscopy, on-line measurements for process control,  precision and accuracy of nondestructive characterization  measurements, advances in computed assisted tomography,  non-contact ultrasonics, and microwave advances and  applications.  Research and applications in the  nondestructive testing and evaluation of material  characteristics such as yield strength, ductility, elastic  modulus, grain size, microstructure, texture, fiber  placement, and residual stress are discussed.  Of  considerable interest are state-of-the-art developments  where the complex nature of materials has been recognized.  Furthermore, discussions on the applications and  possibilities for multi-technique measurements of  interdependent parameters and the evaluation of the data  through sophisticated computer analysis are encouraged.  The proceedings of this symposium will be published as a  bound volume entitled ONondestructive Characterization of  Materials VIII.O  %%%  Advances in nondestructive evaluation are important to the  application of new and advanced materials, manufacturing,  and the monitoring of infrastructure performance and useful  life.  ***",
