Dr. Lakhani will work with Dr.Yoshiaki  Ohkami, Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering  Science, on a research project entitled, \"Force Regulation  and Contour Following in the Presence of Unknown  Constraints.\"    The proposed research will focus on the design of high-  performance force control systems geared specifically toward  industrial contour following applications.  While several  force control approaches have been identified in the past,  there is a dearth of experimental evidence to validate and  compare the various approaches.  In addition, much of the  hardware proposed up until now appear incompatible with  several strict industrial constraints, such as the need for  large-reach and maximum use of already existing factory  hardware.  The proposed research will take the approach of  designing a small, high-performance, lightweight force  control system that can be conveniently and effectively  affixed to a factory robot.  As part of the project, a 2-  link, high-speed force control system, appropriate  controllers, and other hardware will also be constructed.  The proposed research will specifically examine the design  of force controllers in the presence of unknown contour  variations, examples being factory environments.  The  primary goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate  through on-site experiments that the proposed force control  methods and hardware can be used to adequately perform  factory contour following tests with precision, speed, and  reliability.  Results would be easily applicable to a number  of important tasks, including the construction of sheet  plastic, plate glass, and other materials of this nature.  ***",
