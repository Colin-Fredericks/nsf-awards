The development of electrocatalysts that efficiently oxidize methanol and are tolerant to CO and impurities in the fuel is a key challenge for the commercialization of DMFCs. The primary hypothesis of this proposal is that multifunctional Pt/metal oxide/metal carbide (PI/MO/MC) electrocatalysts will be effective for the electrochemical oxidation of methanol. This design combines two previous strategies that have proven very successful in improving the efficiency and CO tolerance of anodic electrocatalysts. Highly dispersed bifunctional sites will be produced on high surface area metal carbide support materials. The bifunctional sites and carbide support are inherently active and CO-tolerant. During Phase I, three process variables used in preparing the supported electrocatalysts will be varied. The compositional and microstructural properties will be characterized and the electrocatalysts will be fabricated into electrodes for standard electrochemical activity measurements. In Phase II the electrocatalysts and electrode designs will be optimized, and prototype DMFCs will be fabricated. These results will allow issues related concerning the commercialization of DMFCs based on PI/MO/MC electrocatalysts to be addressed.   The widespread use of fuel cells would be positively impacted by the development of a low cost, high efficiency DMFC. DMFCs offers several advantages over conventional fuel cells based on hydrogen in particular with respect to fuel energy density, delivery and storage. The demonstration of efficient, poison-tolerant electrocatalysts will significantly improve the feasibility of using DMFCs in next generation vehicles. DMFCs may also compete with gas turbines for generation of electricity. ***",
