 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9707111  Boyd    Powerful new methods for various convex matrix optimization problems have emerged over the last few years.  Most of this research has concentrated on the semidefinite programming problem (SDP), i. e., the problem of minimizing a linear cost function over linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).  SDPs are convex optimization problems that can be solved with great efficiency using recently developed interior-point algorithms.  These matrix optimization methods have had immediate practical and theoretical impact in several fields, notably control systems and combinatorial optimization.  In control theory, the basic idea is to formulate the analysis or synthesis problem in terms of convex matrix optimization problems, which are then solved numerically.  The current state of research on LMIs in control can be summarized:    There has been intensive research on identifying control problems that can be cast in terms of LMIS, and those for which an LM1 formulation is unlikely to exist.  In the latter case, bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIS) have been recognized as a unifying form.    The combined activity in mathematical programming and control theory has led to very rapid progress in interior-point algorithms for solving SDPS, focusing on local convergence rates, worst-case complexity, etc., and on extending to SDP the sophisticated and efficient primal-dual interior-point methods developed for linear programming (LP).    Several basic software implementations of interior-point methods for SDP have become available.  These codes have proven useful for small to medium-sized problems, but tend to be too slow for larger problems, since they exploit little or no problem structure.  LMls are becoming basic tools in control, much the way Riccati equations became basic tools in the 1960s.  Thus, LMI/SDP solvers are becoming part of the infrastructure of control (computation and practice), just as Riccati equation solvers are now.  The same techniques can be applied in several other fields.  In  statistical signal processing, for example, SDP allows one to define optimization problems that involve representation and decomposition of covariance matrices.  Here many challenges are still to be found in the problem formulation area (i.e., identifying statistical signal processing problems that can be cast in this framework) but it is already clear that the approach will be rewarding.  Perhaps even more than in control, practical use of matrix optimization in statistics will require efficient algorithms for large-scale problems.  This proposal brings together researchers in the three key areas involved: control theory, statistics, and large-scale numerical optimization, in order to address the next logical areas of research: identification of the problems in statistical signal processing that can be formulated in terms of LMIS, and the development of more powerful algorithms (and practical codes) for the matrix optimization problems that arise in control and statistical signal processing.  The research effort will be complemented with a strong educational component, by integrating the effort with the newly developed course Convex Optimization with Engineering Applications.  We will transition new research results in statistical signal processing directly into the course material, which will help broaden the range of applications presented in the course.  The new research on numerical methods will enter the course in two important ways: first, as an advanced topic on implementation (missing from the current course), and second, by providing tools that students can use during the course, especially in projects.  Another important (but less direct) educational goal is to train two PhD students in a completely interdisciplinary fashion, equipping them with skills that range from, say, robust control theory or statistics, to optimization theory and implementation of large-scale numerical algorithms.  As the power of computing continues its exponential rise, researchers with this background will  be increasingly valuable.",
