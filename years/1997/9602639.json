 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colby College, in Waterview, Maine, is the recipient of $230,107 from the National Science Foundation for the renovation of advanced research training and research facilities for cellular and molecular biology and microbiology.  This project represents the capstone of the College's five year Plan for the Sciences that calls for a new science curriculum focused on -education through research.`  In support of the Plan, the Biology Department has established an interdisciplinary Cell and Molecular Biology and Biochemistry Program (CMBB).  Critically needed reconfigured space appropriate for research and advanced research training, suitable for a variety of research projects, is not available. ARI funds will be used to aid Colby in its endeavor to improve the physical infrastructure needed to support the CMBB Program. Constructed in 1959, renovations will occur on the third floor of the Arey Life Sciences Building. Spaces dedicated to investigative activities of three laboratories and support facilities including a cell culture room, an advanced microscopy suite, and a radioisotope laboratory will be reconfigured and utilities upgraded.  New casework, benches, and fume hoods will be installed, and laboratories will comply with ADA regulations. Consolidating laboratories for interrelated disciplines of cellular and molecular biology and microbiology, and locating them  near related biochemistry  laboratories, will facilitate efficient use of space, equipment, and foster interdisciplinary collaborations among bioscience students and faculty.  This  modernization will strengthen the biology curriculum by enhancing research training and by increasing the number of research opportunities for students through independent projects and research collaborations with faculty.",
