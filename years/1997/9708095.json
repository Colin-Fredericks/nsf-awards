 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  purpose of this project is to explore a manufacturing  process for a high strength fiber reinforced composite with  protein based polymer matrix. The major advantages of the new  composite include:  Compared to the petroleum based polymer, which is widely used in  fiber reinforced composites, the protein based polymer is tough  and ductile. These are the key factors affecting impact strength.  It should be expected that the protein based polymer composite  would absorb more energy created by collision and have a greater  impact strength than the petroleum based composite.  The manufacturing process proposed for the new composite is  environmentally friendly. Little toxic chemical materials will be  involved in the manufacturing process.  The cost of the protein polymer is relatively low. There are  abundant natural resources for the protein polymer, such as  soybean and various grains in the U.S.  Protein polymer has never been combined with high strength fibers  to manufacture composites. Therefore, a preliminary study is  necessary. During the preliminary research period,all the polymer  behaviors related to manufacturing process will be examined and  a test run of the prepregging process will be carried out. The  outcome will determine the feasibility of developing a high  strength fibrous composite with a protein polymer. By the end  of  the project period, a follow up proposal will be submitted.  The research conducted following the proposed planning period  will include two phases. Phase I concerns each step of the  manufacturing process and its effect on the mechanical  properties. An effective strategy will be proposed for the  development of the manufacturing process of the new composite.  In phase II static, dynamic and impact tests will be conducted  to examine the properties of the new composite, particularly the  toughness and impact strength. composite. An inexpensive high  toughness composite will have a big potential market in the  automobile, civil engine.  This is the first employment of a protein based polymer as the  matrix of a high strength, light weight composite. An inexpensive  high toughness composite will have a big potential market in the  automobile, civil engineering and infrastructure fields. However,  this research is still in a fundamental stage.",
