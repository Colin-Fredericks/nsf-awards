 "awd_abstract_narration": "Goncharov  9701302      This award funds research of Dr. Caterina Consani, a postdoctoral associate of Professor Goncharov.  The project describes a number of ideas relating algebraic cycles with  arithmetic. There are three main themes in the project.   The first theme deals with an interpretation of   the local Euler factor of a projective, smooth variety over a number field   at a finite prime of semistable reduction. Consani gave in her Ph.D Thesis a description of the local factor at an Archimedean place as a characteristic polynomial of an operator playing the role of the geometric  Frobenius at infinity. The Frobenius acts on an infinite dimensional real  vector space of invariants for the action of an arithmetic monodromy.  Supported by this description and by the fact that an Archimedean fiber  of an arithmetic variety should be thought as completly degenerate,  Consani hopes to show a corresponding description also at a place of semistable reduction.  Consani intends to better understand the analogy between the Archimedean and non Archimedean fibers by studying, in a quite concrete  way, the pole of the L-function of a product variety XxX at a non Archimedean semistable reduction prime of X, associated to the monodromy  map N. This represents the second main theme of the project. The operator  N can be interpreted as a cocycle into the middle dimensional cohomology  group of XxX correctly twisted. Via the spectral sequence of the nearby  cycles one should be able to read that element as a cocycle and eventually as an algebraic cycle, into the disjoint union of the 3-fold intersections of the components of the special fiber of a resolution of the model of XxX. The last theme reported in the project describes a closer relation between algebraic cycles and differential forms over the fiber at infinity of an arithmetic variety. Consani hopes to introduce a higher Arakelov theory and a higher arithmetic Riemann Roch theorem.    This project falls into the general area of arithme tic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact disks.",
