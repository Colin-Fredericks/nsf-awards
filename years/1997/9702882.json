 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702882  Schmidt  The  proposed  research  focuses  on  the  synthesis  of  a  novel  biodegradable   polymer  that  will  be  inherently   electrically  conductive.   This  research  is  motivated  by  past  work  which  demonstrates  that electric fields and electrical charges  improve  the  healing  of several tissues, including bone and nerve.  There  are  drawbacks  to  the presently available approaches.   External  electromagnetic  fields  suffer from the inability  to  accurately  localize the electrical effect to the desired tissue, and the  use  of  non-biodegradable electrically-conducting  or  electrically  -  charged  materials  can pose long-term risks that  are  associated  with  any permanent material.  Thus, there is ample motivation  to  develop  a biodegradable polymer, which has desirable electrically  conductive  properties  that can be localized  to  the  tissue  of  choice,  and which will not pose long-term health risks.   Such  a  polymer  does  not currently exist.  In addition to  its  possible  utility for peripheral nerve regeneration, the polymer could  also  be  applied to other areas of tissue engineering as well, such  as  spinal  cord  regeneration and muscle  tissue.   To  synthesize  a  biodegradable   electrically  conducting   polymer,   electrically  conducting  pyrrole oligomers will be coupled to one  another  via  hydrolyzable (degradable) urethane linkages.  Pyrrole was selected  based  on  extensive  previous research by  the  PI  showing  that  poly(pyrrole) is biocompatible and can be used to significantly  s  the  extension of axons from nerve cells.  Poly(pyrrole),  in  the  form  of guidance channels, has also been shown by the PI to guide  peripheral nerve regeneration better than inert materials such  as  silicone.       Unfortunately,  poly(pyrrole)  in  its  present  form  is   not  biodegradable  and  not  easily processed into  different  shapes.  Thus, pyrrole oligomers will be coupled with urethane linkages  to  render  it biodegradable an d more easily processed.  The  urethane  linkage was selected for many reasons, including urethane's  prior  use  in  clinical applications such as heart valves and  the  fact  that  urethane,  in  its uncrosslinked form, is biodegradable  and  pliable.  Other cross linking chemistries (e.g., an ester linkage)  will  be  utilized in the unlikely event that the polymer  product  proves  to  be  deleterious  to living  tissue.  In  summary,  the  proposed  studies  will  focus  on  the  synthesis  of   a   novel  biodegradable electrically conducting polymer, based  on  previous  work  showing  that  electrical charges are  beneficial  to  wound  healing,  and  in  particular, to nerve regeneration.   Thus,  the  resultant  polymer will be a useful material not only for  devices  to   aid  peripheral  nerve  regeneration  (e.g.,  nerve  guidance  channels), but for other tissue engineering applications as well.  ***",
