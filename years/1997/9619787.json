 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619787  Software testing is a critical part of software development.  A  new approach to software testing based on AI Planning is  investigated. The similarity of plans to test cases for some  systems (e.g., command language and transaction based systems)  makes the representation well suited for test generation. The  representation encourages testers to think at a higher level when  designing tests. To exploit these potential advantages, an  automated test generator is constructed with an AI planning  system at its core. This generator allows representation of  testing goals and testing criteria to support a variety of  testing tasks. The project's contribution to Software Testing is  to extend how testing goals are articulated. Its contribution to  AI planning is developing new search strategies for efficient  planning, and determining how to generate goals that conform to  tester's intent, and evaluating the efficacy of using AI planners  during software testing. Tasks include 1) improve planning  efficiency for generating large tests; 2) include representation  of test focus and various test criteria to make the approach  flexible; 3) represent high level testing goals to reduce tedium  for testers; 4) evaluate the efficacy of the new approach to  identify strengths and weaknesses of using AI Planning for  testing.  ***",
