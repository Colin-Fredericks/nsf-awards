Organizers are Dr. John  Reading, Texas A & M University, in collaboration with Dr.  Roberto Rivarola, Universidad Nacional de Rosario,  Argentina.  The seminar will focus on  recent developments  and future directions of research in the field.  The central  objective of the program will be to identify problems of  mutual interest to US  and Latin American physicists, in  order to delineate new ways in which recent advances, such  as use of storage rings and traps, relativistic collisions,  biological applications, and others, can be used to advance  new science.  Emphasis will be on areas in which cooperative  programs are being initiated or planned.    The U.S. and Argentinean participants have made important  contributions to the physics of atomico and molecular  collisions. The topics for discussion at this workshop are  likely to have an impact not only on various areas of  physics, but also in biology and chemistry, and may lead to  significant applications in weather forecasting, forensic  medicine, and other areas.    ***",
