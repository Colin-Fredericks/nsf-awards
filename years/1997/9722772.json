 "awd_abstract_narration": "Droegemeier  9722772    This award supports the participation of American  researchers in a U.S.-Korea seminar on \"Storm- and Mesoscale  Weather Analysis and Prediction\" to be held in Seoul, Korea  in October 1997.  The co-organizers are Professors Kelvin  Droegemeier of the University of Oklahoma and Dong-Kyou Lee  of Seoul National University.  This seminar will bring  together leading researchers to discuss storm- and mesoscale  meteorology.  The goal of the seminar is to integrate,  through scientific exchange and the initiation of specific  collaborative projects, research efforts in Korea and the  United States to significantly advance the technology of  operational weather analysis and prediction in both  countries.    The feasibility of site-specific weather forecasting is made  plausible by recent technological advancements, such as  improved means of sensing the environment at a relatively  high resolution, and the availability of powerful parallel  computer resources to run mesoscale numerical weather  prediction systems.  The potential impact and value of  locally accurate weather forecasts on society and the  economy are enormous.  The United States and Korea have  common research interests in this area and both countries  exhibit state-of-the-art observation networks.  The exchange  of ideas and data with Korean experts will enable U.S.  participants to advance their own work, and will set the  stage for future collaborative projects.  ***",
