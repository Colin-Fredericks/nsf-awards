 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wake  9700914             Ecomorphology is a sub-discipline that has emerged from  interest in the relationship between organismal morphology  and natural history. Morphology includes both structure and  function. Relating variation at these levels to variation in  whole-organism performance can help to reveal causality  between morphology and performance. This, combined with  demonstration of the importance of performance measures in  organismal ecoloey or behavior, makes ecomorphological  inference more robust. This is a proposal to study the  feeding ecomorphology of the monophyletic lizard family  Crotaphytidae. Crotaphytids show trends in feeding apparatus  structure, feeding behavior, and dietary ecology. Bite force  is an important performance variable influencing feeding  behavior and dietary ecology. Structural and functional  analyses of the feeding apparatus of three crotaphytid taxa  will be used to construct computer models. These models will  generate predictions of bite force that will be tested by  bite-force measurement. Simulated structural and functional  perturbations of the models will help to identify causality  between structural and functional variation and biteforce  variation. Identification of such causality links studies of  morphology to ecology and behavior and, ultimately,  facilitates rigorous evaluation of ecomorphological  evolution.",
