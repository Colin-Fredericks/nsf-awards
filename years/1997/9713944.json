 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713944  Bazant  The fracture mechanics of concrete has progressed greatly,  but only for tensile fracture, which is essentially a  uniaxial phenomenon.  The fracture mechanics of compression  fracture, which is  a triaxial phenomenon, is essentially  unavailable.   The present proposal, involving both  theoretical and experimental studies, attempts to fill this  gap.  The theoretical program involves:  (1) energy-based  mathematical model for the propagation of a  band of axial  splitting crack (with internal buckling of microcracked  material);  (2) asymptotic analysis of size effect and shape  effect, leading to simple `asymptotic-matching' formulas;  (3) formulation of size-effect method for deternining  compression fracture characteristics; (4) generalization of  the existing microplane model for damage in compression,  with consideration of the effect of time or loading rate;  and (5) application to the analysis of explosive failure of  high-strength concrete columns or walls subjected to fire.  The experimental program, designed to verify and calibrate  the theory, involves:  (1) size-effect tests of double-  cantilever fracture specimens with compression-tension  loading; (2) size effect tests of compression fracture of  cylindrical specimens with small or large notches; and (3)  tests of the influence of rate or time.  ***",
