Consistent with the reduction in budget, the objectives now include the demonstration of a hybrid version of a micromachined, rotating mass gyroscope; but the commitment to fabricating a fully monolithic gyroscope has been eliminated.  The performance of the hybrid gyroscope will not reach the full potential of a monolithic device, but the hybrid device is adequate for proof of concept and will serve as an excellent vehicle for continued investigation of micromotor technology and application.  The revised statement of Objectives and Significance is given below.    Objectives and Significance    The general objective of the proposed research project is to investigate the issues and advance the technologies that are key to the application of micromotors in real-world systems: control electronics, packaging (process integration), and reliability.  The focus of the effort is the electrostatic bearing which specifically addresses the issue of wear.  A micromachined, rotating mass gyroscope will serve as demonstration of the advanced technologies.    In the process of achieving these primary objectives, our understanding of micromotors will be increased by virtue of the measurements and experiments made possible by the closed-loop control electronics.  Analytical models for the new micromotors will be developed and experimentally verified.  Simulation models will be developed to aid future application of the micromotors.  Specific objectives for the three-year project are as follows:    1) a detailed control algorithm for the salient-pole micromotor with electrostatic bearing;    2) a circuit implementation that is suitable for monolithic integration with the  micromotor;    3) a fabrication process for making surface-micromachined levitatable discs and micromotors;    4) a hybri d, closed -loop system with electrostatic bearing that functions as a rotating mass gyroscope;          The achievement of these objectives will lead to motorized systems which are significantly faster and smaller than presently realizable.  Potential applications areas are widespread, including automotive, consumer, industrial, medical, and military.  ***",
