 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9661765  Mojtabai     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a technology that will allow the growth of crystals and other ordered micro- and nano-structures on a liquid in a fast and controlled fashion.  The technology will be integrated with real-time digital imaging laser fluorescence microscopy to allow for in-situ characterization of structure formation, throughout the fabrication process. The use of a robotics film transfer system facilitates preparation of specimens for use in atomic resolution measurements such as electron and scanning probe microscopies. These modifications will substantially improve the existing state-of-the-art of the technology.  The experimental program in Phase I addresses a new, simple and fast process for fabrication of ordered two-dimensional crystals of membrane spanning proteins. Unlike conventional techniques, this new process allow for variation of the experimental parameters to facilitate fabrication of crystals with both long- as well as short-range orientation order, suitable for high-resolution crystallographic analysis.  In addition, the process is orders of magnitude faster than conventional techniques, and maintains the native asymmetry of the membrane protein.  The success of the program will provide, for the first time, a general approach for crystallizing membrane proteins.  This may lead to new discoveries of significant biotechnological importance, since structural information at atomic resolution is indispensable for elucidation of the mechanism of action of key membrane proteins, and thereby understanding the nature of disease and for developing more effective drugs.     The unique performance characteristics of the technology provide many present and potential applications which range from fields such as microelectronics to biotechnology.  In biotechnology the technology has potential for developing more effective drugs, or screening drugs.  Other applications include fabrication of technologically useful tub ular microstructures that can be used as micro-vials for controlled delivery of drugs, and for immobilization of DNA/RNA on new materials for use in genetic screening.  ***",
