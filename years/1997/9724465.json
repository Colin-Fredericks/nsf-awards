 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724465  Duennebier    This project will enhance the safety and utility of an undersea   observatory being installed off Hawaii named HUGO - Hawaii Undersea   Geo Observatory. The main components of HUGO, including the shore   station, main cable installation between the Big Island and Loihi,   and the junction box, are being provided by OCE. The 45 km cable   was donated to the University by AT&T.  Because Loihi is an active   volcano, and because it is desirable for HUGO to survive as long as   possible, the junction box termination of the main cable will be   placed in a relatively quiet region about one mile from the area   most active during the July-August, 1996, volcanic event.     Funds are provided to build and install a HUGO Multiplexing Node   (Mux) to be connected to the junction box and placed within the   active area. This Mux will immediately provide a connection point   for more than 11 experiments within the active area, with a   potential for expanding to an additional 38 experiments at a later   time. Should Loihi activity destroy individual experiments or this   MUX, replacement will be relatively simple compared to replacing   many cables back to the junction box.    HUGO will be one of the world's first true ocean floor   observatories, supplying the infrastructure necessary for   scientists from many disciplines to perform experiments at a   particularly interesting and dynamic location. HUGO will have the   potential to accommodate more than 60 experiments, supplying 5 kW   of electrical power to the summit junction box, and collecting   real-time data over five optical fibers at nominal rates of 2,000   samples/sec per experiment over a 45 km electro-optical cable.",
