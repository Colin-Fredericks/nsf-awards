 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603360  Frohman    This award supports a two year collaborative research  project between Professor Michael Frohman of the State  University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook and Professor  Yoshinori Nozawa of the Gifu University School of Medicine  in Japan.  The project will investigate the biochemical,  cellular, and physiological roles of Phospholipase D (PLD),  an enzyme thought to be involved in signal transduction,  vesicular trafficking, and the control of cell division.  The major goals of this project are:  1) to continue  structure-function experiments using site-directed  mutagenesis to identify amino acids required for interaction  with cofactors such as protein kinase C and small G-  proteins, and intracellular localization; and  2) to  determine whether PLD1 or 2 are activated by stimulation of  specific signal transduction pathways in well characterized  cell lines, and whether such activation is necessary or  sufficient to generate the subsequent cellular responses  that have been ascribed to PLD activation in general.    The project brings together the efforts of two laboratories  that have constituted different parts of the process.  The  Americans have extensive experience with standard and  advanced molecular biology techniques, microinjection of  plasmids and proteins into cells, embryonic in situ  hybridization, and transgenic mouse technology.  The  Japanese have  been using approaches to study PLD for a  decade and have extensive experience with a wide variety of  pharmacological PLD activators and inhibitors, and with  measuring the cellular consequences correlated with PLD  activation, such as serotonin secretion, mast cell  degranulation, and diacylglycerol production.  PLD  activation has been linked to a wide variety of normal  physiological and disease processes in many different kinds  of cells and tissues.  Results of the research will provide  realistic expectation about the advantages and limitation of  the different model systems. This would serve as the basi s  to determine which models should be implemented.  Through  the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will  broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote  international understanding and cooperation.  ***",
