 "awd_abstract_narration": "New theoretical ideas and advancements in computer  technology have created a Renaissance in microscopic nuclear  structure theory.  More and more nuclear-theory groups are  turning to the problem of how to calculate the structure of  finite nuclei microscopically, mainly in terms of extremely  large model spaces.  Our research group was one of the first  to become involved in this renewed interest in microscopic  nuclear-structure calculations, our approach being one of  constructing the best possible interaction to employ in the  chosen model space.  This has led us to work in a large  model space, in which all the nuclear particles (i.e.,  nucleons) are active.  So far this approach has been  extremely successful in describing microscopically the  properties of nuclei with two to ten nucleons.  We plan to  extend this approach to nuclei with up to 16 nucleons or  even larger.  Extremely large nuclei with more than 100  nucleons, which cannot be investigated by the above  approach, will be studied using a model in terms of pairs of  nucleons, instead of individual nucleons.",
