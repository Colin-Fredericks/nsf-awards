 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615568  Mak       This award provides support for a continuing investigation  into the fundamental nature of winter storm tracks in the northern  hemisphere.  The project involves three topics:  (1) the influence  of surface sensible heat input over the north-western Pacific and  Atlantic Oceans;  (2) the impacts of condensational heating on the  dynamics of storm tracks;  and (3) an exploration of potential  factors responsible for the mid-winter minimum in the Pacific storm  track.  The first two investigations will involve modeling studies  of the role of diabatic heating processes in the evolution of storm  tracks while the third will involve diagnostic studies of the  40-year global reanalysis data set produced by the National Centers  for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).         Storm tracks are the regions where synoptic scale eddy  activity is statistically most prevalent and intense.   Understanding the dynamics of storm tracks is of fundamental  interest as it relates to the general circulation of the atmosphere  - storm tracks are where the most of the poleward transport of heat  and momentum by synoptic eddies occurs.  A considerable portion of  the precipitation in the mid-latitudes is associated with storm  tracks.  Understanding and accurately simulating storm tracks has  obvious bearing on improving numerical weather prediction and  regional climate forecasting.  ***",
