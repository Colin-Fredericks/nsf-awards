 "awd_abstract_narration": "9530981  Sambrotto    This project is part of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study  (U.S.JGOFS) Southern Ocean Process Study aimed at (1) a better  understanding of the fluxes of carbon, both organic and inorganic,  in the Southern Ocean, (2) identifying the physical, ecological,  and biogeochemical factors and processes regulating the magnitude  and variability of these fluxes, and (3) placing these fluxes into  the context of the contemporary global carbon cycle.         As the fourth U.S.JGOFS study region, the Southern Ocean in  potentially the most significant yet examined by this  interdisciplinary program. The Southern Ocean's vast size together  with its abundance of nutrients has led to extensive speculation  about its role in past and present-day exchanges of carbon with the  atmosphere as well as how this role may change in response to  future climactic perturbation. Thus project will measure nitrate  uptake and the uptake and regeneration of nitrogen from ammonium,  area, and dissolved amino acid sources in surface water. The light  response of nitrate uptake will be measured and the size  distribution analyzed to determine how vertical mixing can affect  the local rates of new production. Although all of the major  physiographic regions of the Southern Ocean will be sampled during  this project, the focus will be on the frontal systems at the  northern portion of the study area as well as the permanently ice-  free region immediately to the south. This extensive region  encompasses the largest, uninterrupted biogeochemical province in  the world ocean. Thus, the work addresses the JGOFS goal of  identifying the factors that regulate the magnitude and variability  of biological production and its ultimate export from surface water  and will be critical to the success of future models that intend to  predict the response of the Southern Ocean to climate change.",
