 "awd_abstract_narration": "This new three-year continuing grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program will  support studies of the fundamental growth mechanisms of self assembled monolayer (SAM)  systems.  Using scanning force microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,  Professor Daniel Schwartz and his students at Tulane University will study model self-  assembling systems, with the goal of identifying and understanding the various processes  involved in the nucleation and growth of self-assembled monolayers.  Alkylphosphonic acid  monolayers on mica will serve as the model system, and results will be correlated with  further studies of SAM systems involving alkanethiols on gold surfaces.  Growth modes,  surface patterning and kinetic growth parameters will be investigated.  Self-assembled monolayer systems for the formation of organic thin films show promise in  possible molecular electronics applications, as possible corrosion inhibitors, and in various  other new materials applications.  Very little is known about the process of nucleation and  film growth in the self assembling systems.  This research project will probe these questions  using state of the art scanning probe microscopy and infrared spectroscopic methods.  A  basic understanding of film growth processes should result from this work, which will have  wide applicability in the synthesis and use of new materials.",
