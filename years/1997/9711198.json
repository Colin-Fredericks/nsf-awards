This intensity is due largely  by  macroscopic animals that physically mix particles  and  cause  interstitial  water  exchange during their feeding,  moving,  and  burrow   irrigation   activities.   Such   activity   effectively  increases  the  effective surface of the seafloor  several  times  more that it would be if such animals were not present.    The  investigator in this project will be organizing a scientific  workshop  to  review the state of scientific development  of  the  field  of   \"organism-sediment\" relations and  to  assess  future  research directions and technological developments.  Participants  will   include  sediment  geochemists,  physical  oceanographers,  benthic  biologists, ocean engineers, sedimentary geologists  and  others  who  share a common interest in understanding  this  most  scientifically elusive boundary of the world ocean.",
