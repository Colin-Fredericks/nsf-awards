 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618840  Lovaglia    The proposed research extends a theoretical research program, status characteristics and expectation theories, that has been fruitful in explaining status hierarchies and stratification processes in small groups.  In certain situations, individual performance on standardized tests of ability may be included within the scope of status characteristics theory.  New theoretical developments identify those situations in which status processes should affect individual performance.  The extended theory can then be applied to a fundamental problem in social theory:  the unequal performance of group members who share similar histories and cultural backgrounds.  Social theory now explains differences in performance among group members as stemming from individuals' backgrounds: being rasised in cultural enriched settings is associated with not only high education and socioeconomic status, but high performance as well.  The extended theory seeks to explain differences in performance among group members with similar educational, socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds.  Lacking such social theory allows the presumption that genetics determines the differences in performance among those of similar background (e.g., middle class African-American and European-American students who live in the same neighborhoods and attend the same schools).  Countering the genetic explanation, status processes that stratify groups may explain differences in performance among those of similar background.  High status may increase the rewards and decrease the costs of superior performance.  Thus individuals relegated to low status positions may perform poorly despite innate ability that is identical to high status individuals who perform better.  We propose to conduct a series of studies that will test this theory in a new experimental setting.  Computer programs will create  a group situation that models high status and low status group processes commonly found in school and work situations.  Subjects are the n assigned randomly to a high status or low status position.  These experiments will determine the effect of different group processes on individuals' scores on several standardized tests.  The randomized experimental design rules out the possibility that effects found could have genetic origins.  ***",
