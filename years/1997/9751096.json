 "awd_abstract_narration": "The revision of the 10-year-old general chemistry laboratories curricula for science majors at this historically black university includes the use of technology and aims at the development of the scientific mind.  The students keep a laboratory notebook and design, carry out, and present a project.  Multimedia interactive pre-labs and post-labs extend the impact of each experiment on the learning process.  Simulated experiments not only eliminate the anxiety of following a procedure for the first time, but also give the student the opportunity to experience several related experiments.  The relation between daily experiences and concepts learned in the lecture is pursued.  Measurement and data analysis are emphasized as the best means of deriving the fundamental principles of chemistry.  Graphing calculators and spreadsheets are used to display data and to search for relations between variables.  Calculator-based laboratory units facilitate data acquisition, with less stress on instrument handling and more on data handling in the early laboratory sessions.  The use of numerical and graphical analysis, the experience with technology, and the development of written and oral skills better prepare the students for the more advanced laboratories and ultimately for graduate school and the job market.  *",
