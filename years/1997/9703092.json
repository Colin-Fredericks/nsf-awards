 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research plan in this CAREER project focuses on new  challenges in the robust control of linear and nonlinear,  passive and non-passive systems. There are two main research  objectives. One of the objectives is to extend and  generalize the existing robust stability results for  multibody nonlinear flexible spacecraft to include a broader  class of systems and develop synthesis methods for  dissipative controllers proposed for such systems. The other  objective is to develop new robust control methodologies for  open-loop stable nonpassive, open-loop unstable, and non-  minimum phase systems. Extensions of passivity based  techniques and development of new robust control  methodologies for such systems are pursued. In particular,  the new methodologies using Generalized Predictive Control  (GPC) techniques are developed. First, an investigation of  GPC controllers for linear time-invariant (LTI) single-input  single output nonpassive systems is carried out.  Subsequently, the extensions to LTI multi-input multi-output  and nonlinear non-passive systems are considered. `Proof-of  concept` laboratory setups, which can represent a class of  linear and nonlinear nonpassive systems of interest, are  also developed. These systems can be used not only as  benchmark systems for numerical simulation and experimental  validation of new control methodologies, but also as  laboratory experiments for education. Besides involving  undergraduates at various levels of research work, a well  structured industry-university cooperative education plan  for undergraduates, and a plan for providing advance  education opportunities for high school students is  designed. Three new graduate courses in the area of controls  are developed to help build a strong controls program in the  Department of Mechanical Engineering. An innovative study  abroad program for an international collaborative education  is also formulated.",
