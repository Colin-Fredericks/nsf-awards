 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the New Mexico Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation (CETP) is to improve the science, mathematics, and technology preparation of future K-12 teachers and their effectiveness as educators in these vital areas.  The goal will be achieved by accomplishing five exciting objectives:    Reforming content and teaching by designing an innovative, integrated curriculum    Developing policies which require improved math and science preparation of teachers    Supporting novice teachers through a strong support system during critical early years    Increasing diversity in the teachin profession through innovative recruiting, retention, and instruction which serve diverse groups, particularly American Indians    Disseminating results - including innovative materials - to instutions nationwide    The New Mexico CETP represents a partnership of five universities, four community colleges, 11 public school districts, two state agencies, and two national laboratories.   This proposal is the result of a two-year planning effort by these partners.    Among the innovative features of the New Mexico CETP are novel plans for:  1) Science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) departments to integrate future teachers into their culture; 2) Teacher placement in the schools and early professional development, and 3) Mechnisms to recruit individuals who already have degrees but either are not certified to teach or lack a strong SMET background.    The collaborative's partners believe this program will provide a grand change in teacher education in New Mexico by improving the preparation of teachers in SMET fields.",
