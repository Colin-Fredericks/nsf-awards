 "awd_abstract_narration": "Milewski  9704606    We propose to apply numerical and asymptotic methods to study several   problems of physical relevance in fluid mechanics and wave propagation.   In particular we propose to study, together with several  collaborators:   The resonance phenomena of equatorial Kelvin waves and of certain   waves in stratified flows; The strong interactions of solitary waves   on a beach, and of the rotational-irrotational components in free   surface flows; The diffraction of nonlinear long waves due to abrupt  changes in the lateral boundaries. These projects are relevant both in   developing efficient psudo--spectral numerical methods and in understanding   resonance effects in a large class of geophysical wave propagation problems.   We also continue ongoing collaboration on  Singularities in two- and three-dimensional free surface gravity flows  and similarity solutions of jets impinging on rigid walls;  The evolution of hexagonal patterns in reaction-diffusion   equations with applications to the dynamics of stabilized flame fronts.     In this proposal we use mathematical and computational methods to study   problems of physical and geophysical importance in fluid mechanics.   Specifically we work on 1) Equatorial and mid-latitude waves in the   atmosphere. These waves are thought have an impact on the  global climate and a mathematical understanding of their interaction   with other waves and with topographical features is therefore of   practical importance. 2) the diffraction and amplification of   waves approaching a beach.  Here we attempt to predict mathematically   the size and pattern of ocean waves near a beach. The mathematical   predictions can then be compared to real data from ocean waves during a  storm. 3) Shapes of the free surfaces   of fluids.  We study different types of singular free surface flow   (such as sharp wave coasts) and the shapes of fluid jets impinging   on objects. 4) The evolution of patterns in flame-fronts.  Here, we study the propagation and stability  of flame fronts in a fuel-air   mixture. The mathematical formulation and efficient numerical method used   here is applicable to a wide class of physical problems.",
