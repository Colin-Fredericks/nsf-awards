 "awd_abstract_narration": "9629259  Nept    The limnology and wetland research communities have recently selected metals transport as an area for priority research  (In The Freshwater Imperative,  Naiman et al. 1995).  This treaties calls attention to the need for transport models that can predict the short-and long-term fate of metals contamination in freshwater ecosystems.  Wetlands, an intrinsic part of most freshwater systems, have been observed to trap and store particulate metals, and thus can influence metals flux.  However, the specific factors which control this trapping and potential re-release are not yet fully understood.  In particular, the following questions still need to be clarified    What factors control the short-and long-term trapping of metals in wetland?  How does vegetation influence the trapping and shortage of metals?  How and when are major release or re-suspension events triggered?           The proposed project will address these questions through complementary field observation and modeling programs.  The results will strengthen the knowledge base needed to design and manage wetlands in order to alleviate the impact of metals contamination on freshwater systems.    The educational goals of this project emphasize the incorporation of environmental engineering case studies and current academic research into the undergraduate curriculum.  The first goal is to create case study instruction based on actual engineering problems drawn from the case files of local engineering firms.  The case study approach exposes student to the complexity of real systems, and demonstrates the relevance of the course material.  The second educational goal is to provide undergraduates with more opportunities to assist with and/or conduct their own field research.  Four field projects are proposed that can be conducted annually as an extension to existing undergraduate courses.  These hands-on research experiences will build physical intuition and creativity, as well as provide a forum for developing team-work skill s.  The field projects are designed to dovetail with the proposed academic research so that the undergraduates can draw from a larger research scheme to supplement their own observations.    The research and educational goals both emphasize the study and protection of freshwater systems.  The research program will focus on improving the prediction of metals transport and the remediation of metals contamination.  the teaching program will introduce undergraduates to the complex and interdisciplinary nature of wetland field study and environmental engineering design projects.",
