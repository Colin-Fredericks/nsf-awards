Students will be recruited from a variety of other schools, including primarily undergraduate institutions which are not research intensive.  Approximately 50%-75% will be students enrolled at schools other than polytechnic to provide an opportunity for a rich interchange of ideas.  Every effort will be made to attract at least 40% of participants from the minority and women student body.  The addition of a female faculty member as Co-PI, Professor Yao Wang, will help with recruitment of additional women interns and early announcement of internship awards will help attract top minority students who are heavily courted by many other academic and industrial summer programs.  The research environment will be enriched by additional undergraduate students funded from other sources.  Each participant will have regular meeting with an individual faculty mentor to plan work and review progress throughout the eleven week program.  Project topics in Information Systems will include image communication, VLSI, multivariable feedback control, wireless information networks, robotics, cache memories, and control systems.  Project topics in electrophysics will include microwave-plasma interaction, computational electrophysics, power systems and magnetic levitation.  All will benefit from extensive interactions with participating faculty and graduate students.  Participants will have informative tours of our research laboratories at both the Brooklyn and Farmingdale campuses.  There will be two or three seminar presentations to the group by leaders from industry, universities or government agencies.  A tour will be arranged at a nearby industrial lab or National Laboratory.  The program will terminate with a two- day research review during which each student will make a 20 minute formal presentation and answer questions.  A formal final written report of professional quality will be required of all participants.  A monetary prize will be awarded to the best project.  ***",
