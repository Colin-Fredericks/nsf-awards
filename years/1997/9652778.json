 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is create a national pilot program for encouraging engineering students to enter the teaching profession as teachers of science and mathematics in secondary schools.     We will plan for and implement a year-long program for senior engineering students that will include experiences in pedagogy, teaching techniques, and field trips to classrooms. A major part of the year-long workshop will be advice and counseling on career development. Options for certification will be discussed.     The program faculty for this project include an engineering professor interested in education, a mathematician teaching student teachers, a director of a Master of Arts in Teaching program and a public school teacher.  The program will be professionally evaluated and feedback from students will be an important component of this evaluation     An information kit will be prepared and a video presentation will be made of the experiences and this will be sent to all interested engineering schools.     Following the first year, the program at Duke University will be self sustaining and will become a permanent part of the School of Engineering curriculum.",
