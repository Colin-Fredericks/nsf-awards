 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF) Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the Department of Chemistry at University of Washington in the   purchase of a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. This equipment will enhance   research in a number of areas including exchange coupling in transition   metal polyhydrides; helix/coil transitions, cold-induced helix unfolding;   energetics and mechanisms of reductive elimination reactions; sequence   determinants of the folding of recognition domains; dynamics of local   angular motions of specific groups in DNA; determination of protein   structure and dynamics; and structure elucidation for lesion sites in   damaged DNA.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.",
