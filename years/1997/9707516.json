 "awd_abstract_narration": "Goda, Yukiko  IBN - 9707516  Information in the brain is encoded as electrical impulses.  The transfer of information between brain cells - a process  critical for myriad of brain function - is accomplished by  converting electrical signal into  chemical signal at synapses  which are specialized points of  cell-cell contact.  It is likely that cell surface  adhesive molecules play an important role at synapses much  like adhesion molecules present at cell-cell contact sites  of non-brain cells.  Nevertheless, little is known of the  role of cell surface adhesive molecules at brain synapses.  There are many different classes of cell surface adhesion  molecules that are classified according to their functional  and structural relatedness.  This project addresses the role  of protein family known as Integrins are important for  linking extracellular matrix molecules with intracellular  proteins crucial for maintaining the structural organization  within cells.  The aim of this proposal is to establish the  expression pattern of integrins at brain synapses, and to  determine the role of integrins in regulating signal  transfer across synapses.  The experimental system consists  of dissociated brain cells which after culturing in an  incubator, form synapses with physiological properties  indistinguishable from those found in living brain.  Preliminary results demonstrate that integrins are present  at synapses in cultured brain cells, and regulate functional  aspects of signal transfer at synapses. The experiments  outlined in this proposal are designed to further delineate  the mechanism by which integrins modulate information  transfer at synapses.",
