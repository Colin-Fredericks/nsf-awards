Hosted by the Center for Applied Optimization at the University of Florida, this  conference will bring together leading researchers working on many different aspects of  optimal control and on diverse applications in areas such as aerospace engineering,  superconductors, robotics, medicine, thin films, and manufacturing. It will also provide a  unique opportunity for cross-disciplinary exchange of research. The conference has  received endorsements from the Mathematical Programming Society and is organized in  cooperation with Working Group T7C of the International Federation for Information  Processing.    Problems of optimization and optimal control are pervasive in modern life, occurring in  applications areas as diverse as steel manufacturing, robotics, flight control, design of  materials, film deposition processes, and plasmas, to name just a few.  This conference  will provide a forum for researchers working on different aspects of optimal control to  present their recent discoveries and to interact with individuals working on complementary  aspects of the subject.  Papers presented at this conference will represent the state-of-the-  art in optimal control theory and algorithm development. These papers will be placed in the  public domain by the publication of special issues of refereed scholarly journals.  ***",
