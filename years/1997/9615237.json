This research will form the basis for development of the microdischarge cells to be used in plasma display panel (PDP) technologies. PDP technologies are the only flat panel display technology with large screen potential.  The PDP area is presently undominated, therefore this research offers an opportunity for significant contribute towards a leadership position for the United States.  The grant research activities will include several important investigations: (1) the behavior of gas mixtures; (2) investigation of voltage-transfer curves for multi-component mixtures using simulations and analytic theory in to learn how to optimize them  for maximum efficiencies and luminous outputs for given phosphor response functions; (3) expansion of the atomic database for the noble gasses used in discharge cells.  Additional cross-sections for (Ne, Ar and Kr) are needed.  Penning ionization, dimer ion formation, neutral kinetics and the tracking of photons (including radiation trapping) will be included in the simulation. (4) the inclusion of 3-dimensional effects such as barrier ribs and varying cell geometries.  The overall approach is based on careful study of the basic principles involved, careful computational design to include many synergistic plasma, atomic, and solid state factors accurately yet efficiently, and a serious reliance on matching predications with available experiments and practical cell design strategies.  Successful development of codes to accurately model these basic effects and to create a design tool of this sophistication will be of great value to the display technology industry. The research also provide s  a multidisciplinary learning experience for students in the strong growth flat panel display area.",
