The PI has pioneered the generalized current-  density functional theory to describe the high frequency  effects under weak perturbing potentials.  The generalized  theory has the prospect of a unified treatment of a large  class of phenomena ranging from standard linear response and  transport to nonlinear and nonperturbative phenomena and  parametric instabilities.  The PI will study exact solutions  as benchmarks, to learn about the rigorous structure of the  exact  exchange correlation potentials.  The theory will  also be generalized to include the electronic spin degree of  freedom.  The theoretical work will benefit from experiments  on the dispersion and lifetime of collective excitations in  metals and also on excitations in digitally designed quantum  wells.  In addition the PI is also planning to investigate  the excitations at the edges of quantum Hall systems.  %%%  This mid-career PI was a pioneer in the development of a  theoretical formalism to study the time dependent properties  of electrons in metals.  This work is widely known as the  current-density functional theory.   In the present grant,  he is planning to develop a unified treatment of the  response of atoms, molecules and metals to intense and high  frequency  electromagnetic fields.  The specific effects include a  study of nonlinear phenomena and also parametric  instabilities in metals and in digitally designed quantum  wells.  He is also planning to study the special properties  of electrons at high fields, the features associated with  the edge states in a quantum Hall effect.  ***",
