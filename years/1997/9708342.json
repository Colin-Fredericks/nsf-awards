 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research on phosphorus exchange reactions by Dr. Richard   L. Keiter of the Chemistry Department, Eastern Illinois University.    Kinetic and thermodynamic studies of phosphine exchange in dangling   ligand complexes of chromium and molybdenum will be carried out.  The   study is prompted by the observation that phosphorus ligand exchange in   some tungsten complexes is faster than previously assumed.  In cases   where one dangling phosphine arm of a ligand is capable of associating   with a cis carbonyl ligand on the tungsten, the second phosphine arm can   displace the coordinated phosphine more readily.  This idea will be   tested in other metal complexes using a variety of ligand combinations in   various solvents.  NMR and X-ray crystallographic methods will be   employed.  The significance of this reaction is that it results in isomerization,   that is, structural modification, of the complex and affects subsequent   reactivity.  While repulsive forces are often taken into account in   understanding reactivity, attractive forces often are not.  This opens   the possibility of controlling substitution rates by employing ligands   with dangling groups that have an affinity for other ligands attached to   the central metal of the complex.",
