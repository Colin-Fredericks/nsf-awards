Although TEM has been highly successful  in  the  study of defects in crystalline materials, it has been  less  useful  thus  far  in  characterizing  amorphous  materials.  The  present  project is based on the premise that the high resolution  TEM  image,  nonetheless, contains a wealth of information  about  the  microstructure in disordered materials. An important  aspect  of   the   proposed   new  technique,  which  will   be   pursued  experimentally  and theoretically, is the use of  the  three-body  correlation function to give new insight into medium range order.  Theoretical   methods  for  extracting  higher-order  correlation  functions directly from experiment will be explored. Materials to  be  studied  include amorphous semiconductors, gate  dielectrics,  and ferroelectrics. This work will be carried out collaboratively  by  two PI's , one from a university, one from an industrial lab,  and  by  a  jointly supervised graduate student who will  benefit  from a significant exposure to industrial research.  %%%  This  GOALI research project, which is supported in part  by  the  Office   of  Multidisciplinary  Activities  (OMA)  of   the   MPS  Directorate,  will  be  carried  out  by  a  team  of   materials  scientists,  both  experts  in use of the  Transmission  Electron  Microscope (TEM), one at a research university, and the other  at  a  leading industrial research laboratory. An excellent  graduate  student will benefit from joint supervision by the two PI's,  and  in  the  process of doing a significant portion of his/her thesis  research   at  the  industrial  laboratory,  will  gain  valuable  experience   and contacts in industry. The project is designed  to  extend  the  usefulness  of the TEM in assessing  the  degree  of  disorder  present in real materials, including gate oxides  which  are central in semiconductor transistor devices. Knowledge of the  degree  of  disorder  in  a  given  material  can  be  useful  in  predicting  its performance in a given application. The  outcomes  of  the  project are expected to include new knowledge concerning  the  use  of  the TEM, and an excellent training experience  with  significant industrial exposure, for a graduate student.  ***",
