 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in quantum gravity, a branch of theoretical  physics, will focus on the evaporation of black holes, the  microscopic structure of space and time, and the big bang.  The importance of quantum gravity research, in which one  tries to construct a theory of the force of gravity which is  compatible both with relativity and with quantum mechanics,  is that it opens a window to the most fundamental levels of  physical reality.  If there is ever to be a revolution  comparable to the discoveries of relativity and quantum  mechanics, the area of quantum gravity is where it may well  happen.       Work in physics education will concern introductory  mechanics and Einstein's relativity.  Dorm room experiments  for mechanics will be designed using high quality but  unintimidating equipment such as Mattel's `micro Hot Wheels'  toy cars.  This informal and interactive approach is  essential to students' becoming comfortable with physics and  building physics intuition.  Regarding relativity, a course  for non-physicists will be introduced.  Because Einstein's  `theory of relativity' is actually a well established  experimental fact, it is important that any student have the  opportunity to share this new understanding of space and  time.",
