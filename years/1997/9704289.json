 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is directed toward the development of a solid lubricated bearing suitable for high-speed, extreme-environment applications.  The research will extend the Phase I analytical developments and experimental results to demonstrate operation of a self-contained, solid/powder-lubricated, high-speed journal bearing.  The work will be accomplished in collaboration with end users, including Sundstrand, GE, and Pratt & Whitney.  Self contained backup bearings are needed for magnetic bearing supported rotors in flywheel energy storage systems, auxiliary power units/integrated power units (APU/IPUs), and gas turbine engines.  The specific objectives of this project are to:  1) identify a lubricant material and processing parameters to manufacture stick type lubricants for the powder lubricated journal bearing; 2) design test coupons and lubricant geometries; 3) conduct pin-on disk tests of the selected lubricant; 4) design a prototype powder/solid lubricated multi-pad journal bearing; and, 5) Conduct high-speed verification testing of the prototype bearing.  The firm has invested in the design and fabrication of two test facilities in support of the proposed Phase II bearing development effort.  APU/IPUs represent the most promising near term application of this technology and will be the primary focus for this effort.  However, the technology is also applicable to gas turbine engines and flywheels and the research will explore ways to ensure the generality and applicability of results to such applications.",
