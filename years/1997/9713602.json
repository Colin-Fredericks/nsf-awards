The collaboration in materials science is under the direction of  Jagdish Narayan, North Carolina State University (NCSU), Raleigh and  S.C. Agrawal, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur.  The  investigators will examine the structural and electronic characteristics of  diamond and diamond like films using laser and plasma processing  techniques. Complimentary research will be conducted by researchers at  the IIT, Kanpur.  Additional research will be done to improve the  adhesion of the films by employing electron donating elements to stabilize  SP3 bonding.    Scope:  Diamond and diamond like films constitute a very useful class of  advanced materials with applications ranging from corrosion and erosion  resistant protective coatings to advanced microelectronics and display  devices.  This research contributes to fundamental knowledge about the  basic physics of these films.  The NCSU group headed by Narayan is a  world-leader in this area; the IIT group has complimentary expertise in   the electronic properties of thin films.  The scientific results will be  published in the public domain. This research will provide training for  graduate students in advanced materials, nonequilibrium phenomena, and  advanced materials characterization.  This new collaboration supports INT  objectives.         ***",
