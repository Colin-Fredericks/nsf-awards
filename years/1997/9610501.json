 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9610501  HELLER  The Theoretical and Computational Ahemistry program is supporting   Professor Eric Heller at Harvard University to work on scattering theory.    First, Heller will take a new look at scattering theory at extremely low   energies.  This regime has become important because of laser cooling and   trapping of atoms, as well as carrier gas cooling and trapping of   molecules.  In this \"cold collision\" regime, Heller will study ultra-low   energy, three-atom collisions and recombination (molecule formation),   proximity resonances, which are a new class of low energy multiple   scattering resonances related to Efimov states, and ultra-low energy   molecule-molecule collisions, with an eye to the formation of long lived   resonances.  Common to these areas is the concept of \"boundary condition   engineering,\" wherein the effect of short range potentials can in fact be   ascribed to a change in boundary conditions on the wavefunction.  In a   related study Heller will extend and apply the theory of multiple   scattering and conductance in \"quantum corrals\" and other arrangements or   arrays of atoms into walls and sheets.  He will also investigate novel   approaches to dynamical tunneling in polyatomic molecules, and its effect   on high resolution spectra, deflection of beams in inhomogeneous fields,   and quantum control in Landau-Zener crossing.  This work, like the   ultra-low energy scattering theory above, addresses the extreme quantum   regime.  In a second class of problems, at the opposite end of the scale   at higher energy, Heller will extend his fundamental research in   semiclassical approximations to chaotic systems to include the theory of   scarring by classical periodic orbits and semiclassical quantization of   chaos.  In particular he is looking for an appropriate nonlinear theory   of wavefunction scarring.  Finally this work will undertake several   projects involving fundamental issues of quantization, including   quantization on constrained non-Euclidian spac es, and quantization of   chaos in maps such as the whisker map.    This research involves fundamental studies of quantum mechanics, and the   profound effects quantum mechanics has on matter, as energy is lowered   almost to absolute zero.  At very low temperatures, matter wave-like   behavior dominates over particle-like behavior.  Wavelengths get   extremely long.  The waves have to obey \"boundary conditions,\" which are   rules on how the waves behave when one atom or molecule approaches   another, or approaches a wall.  At ultra-low energies these boundary   conditions are uncommonly important, often determining the way the matter   behaves.  In this strange \"tail wagging the dog\" regime, anything that   can be done to change the boundary conditions may have profound effects.    For example, normal boundary conditions in quantum mechanics forces   minimum energy upon the system known as the zero point energy.  Removing   the zero point energy, by using walls made of special atoms,  may   drastically affect the usefulness of small devices such as wires,  and   may profoundly affect the outcome of the slow collision of two cold   molecules.  Related work involves the issue of quantization; that is, how   do we take a given system and correctly endow it with the proper quantum   behavior.  There are rules on how to do this in simple cases but the   rules are ambiguous when constraints are present, for example (requiring   that a given bond length to be a certain fixed value).  Heller is   developing some ideas which bootstrap the ambiguous cases as limits of   the easy cases, thus removing the ambiguity.    ***",
