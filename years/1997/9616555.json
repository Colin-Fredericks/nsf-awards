In order to understand  vision it is necessary to subdivide it into a number of stages.   This project will investigate the first of these stages, in which  visual information is sorted or parsed initially.  The result of  visual parsing is that as we look at the world, we immediately  and without effort get an impression of a world that is comprised  of things within a scene.  This research derives from a theory of  visual parsing, due to Baylis and Driver, that says that deciding  which parts of a visual scene are objects and determining the  shapes of those objects are intermeshed processes.  The  experiments will test this theory.    Imagine that one is looking at a cup on a table.  Recognizing  that it is a cup requires knowledge that there is a \"cup-shaped\"  object lying on the table.  This in turn requires that we  appreciate that the outline of the cup \"belongs\" to the cup;  otherwise we might think there is a strange \"cup-shaped\" hole in  the table!  Baylis and Driver's theory holds that deciding that  the cup-shaped outline \"belongs\" to the cup, not the table, is a  largely automatic process; from this premise, the theory makes  specific predictions about which perceptual acts will be easy and  which will be hard.  The experiments will ask people to make  judgments about what they see and measure the speed and accuracy  of their judgments; it will thus test the theory of visual  parsing.    The fact that visual parsing in people is very fast, efficient,  and effortless belies the importance of this system.  It is not  possible to understand the processes of vision and visual  recognition without a clear understanding of the initial  processes of visual parsing.  There are many potential  applications of a better understanding of vision, including the  creation of automated vision systems for use in industry and  medicine.  Many attempts at machine vision have faile d primarily  because of inadequate visual parsing.  For example, an automated  system for detecting cancerous cells in a blood sample needs to  be able to \"find\" which regions of a slide are the cells and  which regions are the spaces between.  Similarly, it is easy to  see how catastrophic even a partial breakdown of visual parsing  would be to a person's ability to make sense of the visual world.   Many neuropsychological disorders in patients with brain damage  caused by strokes include impaired visual parsing.  Thus, a  better understanding of visual parsing and how it relates to  other processes in vision will not only lead to a clearer  theoretical conception of how it takes place, but can also  ultimately lead to a better understanding of how visual parsing  breaks down in patients with brain damage, improve the  rehabilitation of patients with these problems, and help in the  design of machine vision systems.  ***",
