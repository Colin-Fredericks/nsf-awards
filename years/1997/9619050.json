It proposes to provide 25 teachers each who either are Native Americans or teach largely Native American children on or near the reservations.  The project will provide four week enhancement activities in chemistry and other disciplines within the context of current environmental issues of importance to the  tribal communities.  The primary area of interest and the basis of the enhancement activities are environmental issues.  The PI has clearly addressed concerns with the learning styles of Native American children.  All activities with teachers will model effective pedagogy. The teachers will work directly with secondary school students to determine how well their methods work in a classroom environment.  These students are/will be a part of a companion program not funded by this project.  The project director is a Native American and a teacher.  Extensive follow-up during the academic year as well as electronic communication using computer systems donated by other groups.    A cost share of gifts-in-kind will bring the total up to approximately 28% of the award amount.",
