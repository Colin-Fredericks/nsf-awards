 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703311  Lonergan    The research program in this CAREER award targets the development  of a new concept in conjugated polymer interfaces:  the use of  conjugated ionomers to form stable interfaces between  dissimilarly doped conjugated polymers.  The realization of this  concept will open a new avenue in the study of conjugated polymer  interfaces.  An avenue that has great promise for the fundamental  study ofthe electronics of conjugated polymers at interfaces and  that may lead to a number of exciting new device technologies.  The research program has three major elements: (1)  a synthetic  effort to develop ring-opening polymerization techniques for the  synthesis of conjugated ionomers with a controlled density of  ionizable functionalities, (2)  the development of innovative  doping methodologies for the preparation of truly self-doped  polymers and for the preparation of multilayer structures in  which each layer has different doping characteristics, and (3)  the fundamental study of interfaces between differentially doped  conjugated polymenrs, such as the polymeric pn junction, to test  traditional models of current flow and depletion at semiconductor  interfaces.  In this CAREER award, activities in support of  chemical education at a variety levels are also detailded.  At  the undergraduate level, a program of implementing tested  innovations into the general chemistry curriculum at the  University of Oregon is described; these include an emphasis on  the concepts of learning through inquiry and of learning from  peers.  The goal is to better involve students in their own  education and go beyond the facts of science to teach how science  is done.  On the graduate level, the projects works toward  improving Oregon's ability to better meet the educational and  career goals of individual students while maintaining the  scientific rigor and high standards befitting an Advanced degree  in chemistry.  %%%  The primary outcomes of this work will be: (1)  self-doped  polymers where the leve l of injected charge is precisely balanced  by the density of covalently bound ionic centers, (2)  a general  approach to all polymeric pn junctions and other device  structures involving contacted differentially doped conjugated  polymers, (3)  a systematic study of depletion in conjugated  polymers, and (4)  a clearer picture of the promise for  conjugated polymers in semiconductor device applications.  ***",
