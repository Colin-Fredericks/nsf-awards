In turn, this will significantly enhance these students' knowledge, experience, professional growth and confidence; it also is expected to be a major factor in their retention and has increased the likelihood of their going to graduate school.    Undergraduate students will be recruited for both summer and academic year research, with target numbers of 3 during the academic year, growing to 8 during the summer, at least 30-40% being non-MSOE students during the summer.  These students will work with other undergraduates and graduates in this vigorous and exciting Center of Excellence.    To ensure the continual improvement of the REU program, a periodic evaluation effort will be carried out in two ways: a) self evaluation of project activities by the student participants in the REU program and b) evaluation by a team that will include faculty members associated with the REU projects.  The project director will use these faculty researchers to ensure the success of the REU program.  ***",
