 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722823  Schoech  The primary goal of this project is to determine the  hormonal  mechanisms that mediate parental and alloparental behavior  in a social  species, the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens).  Because  prolactin is associated with parental behavior in many  species, including  Florida scrub-jays, the thrust of the project will address  the role of  prolactin in promoting helping behavior by nonbreeders.  Previous  correlative studies have linked helping and prolactin in  this species. This  proposal uses a protocol whereby manipulations of hormone  levels allow  more definitive assessment of hormone function.  It has long  been known that  until a hormone is removed and replaced experimentally, the  causal nature of the  compound can only be inferred. Recent advances in our  understanding of the  compounds 'upstream' from the pituitary that control the  secretion of prolactin  make it possible to remove prolactin with biological  elements. Using a prolactin  releasing agent, and by treating Florida scrub-jays with  anti-bodies against  this agent, prolactin can be immunoneutralized. Following  removal of the hormone of interest (prolactin), focal  observations of treated  individuals will allow the determination of whether  prolactin is responsible for  helping behavior.  Similarly, modern field endocrine  techniques allow  enhancement of an organism's endogenous hormone titres. By  removing and then  supplementing prolactin in free-living cooperatively  breeding Florida  scrub-jays, this proposal will pioneer the use of these  valuable  techniques under field conditions. In addition to greatly  enhancing our  understanding of hormonal mechanisms that mediate social  behavior, the  methods used in this proposal may prove to be useful in  manipulating behavior,  and may set the stage for future research in a variety of  species.",
