The novel approach is to interweave two  long-semester internships in the regional high-tech  semiconductor industry with courses in applied physics and  outside electives at Texas Tech.  These are aimed at  building on the undergraduate degree and are focused toward  basic principles of semiconductor materials, processes, and  fabrication.  The program offers students training in some  of the world's most sophisticated laboratories with state-of-  the-art equipment in subject areas of national need.  This  provides them with a vital edge in a highly competitive job  market.  This effort will assist in producing alternatives  for broadening the academic experience beyond traditional  graduate training.  %%%  This grant from the Division of Materials Research is one of  the first awarded in an attempt to find innovative methods  to integrate research and education.  It is also cosponsored  by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the  Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  ***",
