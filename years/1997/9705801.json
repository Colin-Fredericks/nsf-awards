 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705801  Chen       Existing, experimental techniques can not provide a  quantitative real-time measurement of the internal phase  transition associated with localization under different  loading, rates.  Since localization is usually accompanied  by local heating due to plastic work, an exploratory  research project is proposed here to fabricate the  experimental specimens with embedded state-colored cells to  measure the real-time phase transition.       It is proposed that the state-colored cells be made of  a certain kind of thermochromic (TC) materials, the optical  properties of which are able to chance reversibly upon  temperature.  Uniaxial compressive tests are then performed  with these specimens to investigate the internal phase  transition under different loading- rates.  Because of the  gel state of TC materials at certain temperature, it is  possible that the ultimate cell for the proposed measurement  may be composed of many smaller cells with a diameter of  less than I mm, each covering a range of temperatures.  With  regard tot he actual measurement, it is anticipated that the  cell will be subjected to radiation of the appropriate  wavelength(s) to monitor the color change.       The fabrication of the experimental specimens with  embedded state-colored cells involves interdisciplinary  efforts from chemistry, experimental mechanics, and material  science.  If  the project is successful, however, there will  be a significant impact on the modeling of localization,  experimental mechanics and industrial applications.",
