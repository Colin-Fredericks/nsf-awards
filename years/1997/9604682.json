 "awd_abstract_narration": "This group of researchers is interested in diverse aspects of  fundamental cell biology. Dr. Lemmon studies vesicular transport in  yeast. Dr. Brady-Kalnay investigates lgsuperfamily protein tyrosine  phosphatases and their link to the cytoskeleton through an association  with cadherin adhesion molecules. Dr. Kung's research focuses on  transcription factors and their regulation by the cell cycle. Dr. de  Boer studies the mechanisms of cytokinesis and septum formation in  bacteria. Each of the researchers uses immunocytochemical approaches to  address issues of protein localization. This group of investigators  require full access to a light microscope in order to explore basic  cell biological questions.          A committee, of the Pl and Co-Pls of this grant, was formed to do  an extensive analysis of the available microscopes that have phase,  fluorescence and DIC capabilities. Week long demonstrations were given  by the following manufacturers: Nikon, Olympus, Leica, and Zeiss.  During these demonstrations each of the investigators examined samples  from their particular research applications. A consensus was reached  that the Zeiss microscope best suited the needs of all the  investigators. A quote was issued by Zeiss that included only the parts  that we required to visualize each of our samples. This quote is  included in the application.",
