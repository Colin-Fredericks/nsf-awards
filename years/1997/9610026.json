 "awd_abstract_narration": "9610026    This research will experimentally test a promising  analytical approximation  for determining elastic moduli and strengths of jointed rock  masses.  The  approximation in question is an equivalent properties theory  that avoids  the usual restrictive assumption of a representative volume  element (RVE).  The non-representative volume element (NRVE) theory tested  here produces  results that compare favorably with the true equivalent  properties obtained  for detailed computations.  Comparisons form a series of  numerical  experiments in the elastic domain (Hooke's law), the seepage  domain  (Darcy's law) and the coupled domain (Biot's law) and  recently in the  elastic-plastic domain are usually within a few percent.  The additional  testing and verification undertaken here is therefore  expected to be  worthwhile.    The main benefit of a technically sound procedure for  estimating rock mass  properties from the properties of the joints and intact rock  between the  joints is more accurate engineering design of excavations in  jointed rock  masses.  Excavation analysis in very blocky rock masses and,  at the other  extreme, rock masses that are almost free from joints may be  handled by  existing methods.  However, there is a large class of  problems in between  that could benefit from a demonstrably more reliable  determination of rock  mass properties.  Benefits would eventually appear in the  form of improved  stability and economy of rock mass excavations.  *****",
