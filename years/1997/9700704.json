 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harrison  9700704           Pheromones are used by a large number of insects to  attract mates.  In the Lepidoptera pheromone binding  proteins (PBPs) play a role in the binding and transpmrting  of pheromones in the male antennae.  PBPs should be subject  to directional selection to bind new pheromones efficiently  when a pheromone changes, but this prediction has not been  tested rigorously.  Three different methods will be used to  detect selection; each method involves comparison of PBP  gene sequences obtained from a set of moth species.  The  first approach uses population genetic test that detect  excess nonsynonymous  substitutions that may occur in  response to a change in pheromone.  A second method uses  relative rates test to look for increases in nonsynonymous  substitution along branches along which a change in  pheromone has occurred.  Several different classes of  changes in pheromones will be examined.  The final method  for detecting selection involves analysis of PBPs in species  which have independently evolved to use the same pheromone;  the goal is identify convergence in the amino acid sequences  of these PBPs.  Demonstration of selection acting upon these  PBPs would be important for the study of protein evolution  and pheromone communication.",
