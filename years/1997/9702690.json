The proposed work will explore the magnetic and transport  properties  of such carrier-doped strongly-correlated insulators.  The  low  temperature  properties of  doped  insulators  will  be  measured  to  determine if the ground states  are  ordinary  band  insulators  in  the insulating state, and Fermi  liquids  in  the  metallic  state. Thin films of the materials will be produced  to  explore the potential of making electronic devices based  on  the  small  band  gaps  and  the doping-controllable  magnetic  ground  states  of these materials. The research will be integrated  into  an  education plan to help enhance student learning and to  train  future  scientists,  including  minority  scientists.  The   PI's  education  plan  involves  a physics laboratory  course  open  to  students  from his own institution and also to students from  the  nearby HBCU Southern University.  %%%  This  CAREER  program  project,  supported  by  the  Division  of  Materials  Research  and the Experimental  Program  to  Stimulate  Competitive  Research (EPSCoR), involves fundamental experimental  research  on  the classes of semiconductors and insulators  which  have  in  the  past  decade been found to yield high  temperature  superconductivity  when  the materials are  suitably  doped  with  additional  chemical elements which have the effect of  producing  electrical  conductivity. The materials to be  studied  here  are  magnetic  in  the undoped state, but lose this property  as  they  gain  electrical conductivity . One aspect of the work will be  to  assess  more  generally  the  opportunities  to  make  electronic  devices  based  on thin films of such materials.  The  long  term  results  of  this  project may include improved magnetic  sensing  devices,  such as are used in computer magnetic disk  drives.  On  the educational side the PI plans to enhance student learning and  to   train   future  scientists,  including  those  from   under-  represented  minority groups. A joint physics  laboratory  course  will   be  featured  which  is  open  to  students  of  the  PI's  institution   and  also  to  students from  the  nearby  Southern  University,  which  is  in  the HBCU  class  (Historically  Black  College or University).  ***",
