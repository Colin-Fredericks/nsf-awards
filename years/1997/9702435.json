 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research program focuses on the development of multigrid methods for convection-dominated flows on distributed architectures.  The research covers a wide range of activities from fundamental analysis and development of effective multigrid algorithms for convention-dominated flows, to the application of these algorithms to a distributed architecture of workstations.  In particular, this effort will focus on the two and three dimensional compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.  Particular areas of research will include an analysis of the importance of propagation effects in multigrid algorithms; the development of robust, preconditioners, which will not only enhance wave propagation but will also improve high frequency damping for the Euler equations; the extensions of these preconditioners to viscous, turbulent , and time dependent equations; the development of scalable full-coarsening and semi-coarsening multigrid algorithms for distributed compute architectures; and the development of a visualization toolkit to interactively monitor the results of the distributed multigrid algorithms.",
