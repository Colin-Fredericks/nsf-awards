 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves instrumentation of the introductory VLSI design course, adds instrumentation for an analog VLSI design course, and provides for a special topics course in VLSI that emphasizes design strategies usually not covered in undergraduate courses.  This is part of a goal in the Electrical Engineering Division to expand the VLSI curriculum from one current introductory course to a pyramid of courses structured to teach the students VLSI design from several aspects.  Emphasis of the new VLSI design curriculum is on design methodologies and specific applied design paradigms.  The new tools are used solely on personal computers, and the courses are designed so the instructor can teach the laboratories with little or no computer technical assistance.  The laboratories are designed so that one or two faculty can be used with help from workstudy students.  The introductory course is offered to both juniors and seniors.  Students taking the course in their junior year have the advantage of more detailed VLSI design experience in their senior year.  Expansion of VLSI design can increase the student's proficiency in analog design using full custom design and digital design using synthesis tools.  In the VLSI special topics course, students work as a single group on a design problem and emphasis is on design methodologies, time to market strategies, design for testability, and design for quality.    *",
