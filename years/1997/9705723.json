Liquid/vapor phase transitions are important phenomena in  science and engineering.  Traditional models for the  dynamics of phase  transition, exhibit gaps when compared with experiments.  We propose  to investigate the dynamics of liquid/vapor phase transitions through  an approach different from traditional models. The model is a system of  conservation laws with source terms (the system) based on equations for   two-phase reactive flows. Based our preliminary studies, this approach    promises to better fit experiment.  To accomplish our objective, the   following specific sub-objectives will be pursued:  1) Derive qualitative and quantitative  asymptotic models for the system.    2) Study issues such as basic wave patterns in the system and its asymptotic   models, e.g., traveling waves, admissibility criteria for  shocks and phase   boundaries, and the Riemann problem.    3) Develop algorithms to carry out numerical simulations on the system and  develop test problem to justify such computations.  Study issues related to  numerical schemes for the system   4) Study the well-posedness of the  system  or its simplified asymptotic   models.  The expectations are that, at the conclusion of the proposed period  of  support,  results will have been obtained  on qualitative and  quantitative behavior of the system, and numerical simulations will  have been carried out. Results on qualitative and  quantitative  behavior of the system  will be compared with experiments.  Based on  these comparisons, the adequateness of the modeling can be assessed,  and  the modeling can be further improved.  It is expected that the  results obtained will facilitate understanding of the dynamics of  liquid/vapor phase transitions.  Tools for numerical simulations of  such phenomena will also result from this work.    Most materials have four phase s: solid, liquid, vapor and plasma  phases.  Phase transition,  such as the change from water to vapor and  vice versa, is fundamental phenomena of materials that occur in  daily life and everywhere in our environment. Many manufacturing  processes, such as the growth of a single large crystal used in  semiconductor manufacturing, involve phase transitions.  Liquid/vapor  phase transitions happen during the flight of  airplane through clouds  and during underwater explosions.  Liquid/vapor phase changes also  occur at high speed moving parts of a vessel, such as the propeller of  a submarine, which consumes energy and makes noise detectable by  enemies' solar devices.  In summary, phase transitions are not only  fundamental scientific properties of materials but also vital to  industrial competitiveness and national security.  The proposed project  is to study the evolution of phase changes, in particular the rapid  liquid/vapor transitions induced by rapid moving body or waves.  The  objectives are to establish effective mathematical models for  liquid/vapor transitions that agree with experimental data, and to  develop numerical simulation tools for such phase transitions.",
