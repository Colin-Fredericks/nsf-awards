 "awd_abstract_narration": "An assembly of educational  professionals from biology and biochemistry have designed contemporary exercises that challenge students in undergraduate laboratories to solve modern molecular problems.  Specific new experiments from molecular biology and biochemistry are being added to the Biochemistry, Biology, Physiology, Anatomy/Physiology, Marine Biology and Microbiology courses at Ventura College. These lab course revisions will serve to better prepare students for transfer and high-tech vocations by providing varied contemporary problem-solving experiences, using modern techniques in molecular bioscience.  Improved preparation for those entering the biotechnology training program, and transfer programs results from an advisory collaboration with the UCSB Math/Sciences Division.  The addition of DNA isolation and characterization, restriction enzyme analysis, cloning prokaryotic vectors, mitochondria and chloroplast isolation and measurement, bacterial contamination spectroflurometic asssays, and analysis of protein and aromatic bioproducts, represent significant lab experience revisions.  The equipment that will be needed includes chromatography, electrophoresis, spectroflurometer, UV spectrometer, gas chromatogram (upgrade), and metabolic oxygen sensors (the associated restriction enzymes and reagents will be provided by a local biotechnology company).  The new Science building State Equipment Fund has been cut by more than 40%, making it impossible to offer these experiences without outside funding.  This project will provide the matching funds needed to purchase the equipment.  Each year, over 1,600 students at the college enroll in these courses.  Funding of this project will provide students with: 1. Comprehensive problem-solving activities in traditional classes: 2. Improved activities in majors and non-majors classes; 3. Opportunities for individual students to perform individualized research in special courses with equipment; 4. Increased hands-on learning meaningful to transfer requ irements.",
