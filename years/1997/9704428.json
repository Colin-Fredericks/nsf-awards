The experimental investigations are  carried out at the High Pressure and CVD Laboratory at the  University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and the National  High Pressure beamlines at CHESS, Cornell University and  NSLS, at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The focus of this  study is to establish phase diagrams for selected prototype  rare-earth metals and alloys in the megabar regime (100-400  Gpa).  The focus is on heavy rare-earth metals, lutetium and  ytterbium, where phase transitions and dramatic changes in  electronic structure and valence are expected at ultra high  pressures.  Pressure also causes delocalization of the f-  shell giving rise to \"collapsed - low symmetry crystal  structures.\" A high resolution image plate x-ray diffraction  technique is employed in conjunction with a synchrotron  source to investigate low symmetry crystal structures as  well as the phenomenon of crystal grain growth discovered  recently in rare-earth metals. Also examined is a  related  transition metal, yttrium, which is expected to simulate  rare-earth behavior at high pressures, and recently has been  predicted to transform to the bcc structure at 280 Gpa.  The  measured phase boundaries and pressure-volume (P-V)  relationships provide stringent tests for various models of  f-delocalization under pressure.  A second direction in the  research is on fundamental studies on CVD diamond growth for  fabrication of synthetic diamonds with low levels of  nitrogen impurity for applications in diamond anvil cell  devices,  In addition, high pressure materials research  facilities supported by this grant are employed in research  experiences for undergraduates (REU) projects during the  summer and for undergraduates in the Alabama Alliance for  Minori ty Participation (AMP) Program at UAB.  %%%  This research has the potential for making significant  contributions to the understanding of the structural and  electronic properties of rare-earth materials.  The research  on diamond has broad technological applications if  successful.  ***",
