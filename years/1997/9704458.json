 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jerome  9704458       The investigator develops, analyzes, and computes with  models of biological transport for ionic channels.  Ionic channels  are now known to mediate significant electrical activity through  cellular membranes.  The discovery of the patch clamp has made  experimental verification of such electrical currents possible.  Theoretical predictions proceed through a hierarchy of models.  For the simpler models, categorization of possible behavior is  sought, and the dynamics carefully studied.  In particular, gating  is analyzed in great detail; this includes both regular and  anomalous behavior.  An understanding of the relation of the  channel to its ambient environment is achieved through the  calculation of the heat exchange of the protein.  In addition, a  complex asymptotic procedure yields a high field model,  particularly appropriate for channels, yet originally developed  for semiconductors.  This proposal benefits from the  investigators' previous experience in semiconductor modeling.  The  common thread of electro-diffusion leads to mathematical models  of surprising similarity.  This analogy has facilitated some  interesting studies, as well as some provocative conjectures.  One  of these deals with the role of temperature in channels.  Another  deals with so-called active transport, and the association with  the molecule ATP.       Ionic channels are protein molecules in cell membranes, and  have been linked to such diverse applications as drug receptors  on the one hand, and irregular gating in the brain and mental  illness on the other hand.  The investigator and colleagues in  mathematics and biology model the electrical and energetic  activity of channels.  The project greatly benefits from the  similarity in the mathematical models developed for both ionic  channels and semiconductor devices.  Whereas electrical currents  are induced by ions in channels, a similar role is played by  electrons and holes in semiconductors.  Powerful electric fields  coexist with int ense biological activity in the channel pore.  The  principal investigator and his colleagues study these analogies,  as well as separate issues of biological import, including the  possibility of explaining, in mathematical terms, the pulses  associated with the opening and closing of channels and the  energetics associated with active transport, including the action  of various ion \"pumps.\" The work aims to clarify details  surrounding energy exchange, heating, and temperature variation.  The project uses both mathematical analysis and extensive  computer simulations.",
