Emphasis is placed on  the  relation  between  materials  structure  and  electronic  properties.  The  work  is  materials-based  and involves synthesis of new materials,  growth  of  single  crystals  and of epitaxial films, and  microstructure  manipulation. A wide range of experiments to be employed includes  SQUID    magnetometry;   magnetic,   elastic   and    dissipative  measurements using high-Q oscillators; surface analysis, NMR, and  heat  capacity. Specific topics will include magnetic excitations  and  anisotropy  of infinite layer cuprates; competition  between  Kondo/heavy fermion behavior and 3d transition metal magnetism in  two  Ce-based compounds; and effects of surface structure on spin  excitations  in  ultrathin  ferromagnetic  films,  including  the  engineering of specific magnon dispesion features. In this  work,  the   unity  in  one  project  of  a  wide  array  of  synthesis,  charcterization  and  analytical  techniques  will  provide   the  graduate  students  with  an  excellent  training  in  areas   of  materials science and physics.  %%%  This experimental research project is centered on discovering the  relations  between  structure of materials and  those  electronic  properties  which  may  be  particularly  useful  in  technology,  including  magnetic  properties and superconductivity.  The  work  includes  synthesis  of novel materials in  the  form  of  single  crystals,  epitaxial  films  and will  also  explore  effects  of  microstructure   manipulation.  Methods  will  include   use   of  sensitive  magnetic property measurements, surface analysis,  and  nuclear  magnetic  resonance.  Results  from  this  research  may  include  unusual  new  effects  or  structures  which  may   find  application   in   technology.    This   research    project    is  interdisciplinary  in  nature  and  involves  undergraduate   and  graduate  students  who  will  be excellently  trained  to  enter  positions in industry, government or education.  ***",
