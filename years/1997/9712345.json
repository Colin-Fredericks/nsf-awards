 "awd_abstract_narration": "The method of moving surfaces is a fundamentally new and  significantly better method for implicitizing rational surfaces.  This method has recently been applied to address the problem of  multivariate polynomial resultants.  Initial successes include  finding  determinental formulae for some sparse resultants.  The method of moving surfaces produces expressions that are more  compact than previous ones, and unlike previous determinental  formulae do not contain extraneous factors.    Multivariate resultants provide a powerful computational tool for  solving problems involving polynomial equations in several  variables.  While Groebner bases can also be used to solve  systems of polynomial equations (as well as answer additional  questions about polynomial systems), multivariate resultants are  generally more efficient at eliminating variables than Groebner  bases.  Preliminary examples suggest that the method of moving  surfaces might be even more efficient than current multivariate  resultant techniques.    The method of moving surfaces can be used to attack a wide  variety of problems in elimination theory including:  1.  constructing multivariate resultants without extraneous  factors  2.  building sparse resultants  3.  implicitizing rational curves and surfaces  4.  developing inversion formulas for rational curves and  surfaces  5.  intersecting rational curves and surfaces  6.  intersecting algebraic curves and surfaces.    The method of moving curves has already lead to a new  classification scheme for rational curves; a similar scheme for  rational surfaces will be investigated.  While rigorous  theoretical foundation for the method of moving curves based on  ideal theory has been developed, the method of moving surfaces is  currently substantiated only by several Mathematica examples  and a few preliminary theorems.  Thus the theoretical foundation  is far from complete.  For example, the method provides an  algorithm for determining the rows of a matrix whose determinant  is a sparse  resultant if it does not vanish.  So far, the method  has never failed to produce a non-vanishing determinant, but no  proof exists that the method will never fail.  A constructive  proof will be sought.    The method has thus far been applied to eliminating one variable  from two polynomials, or two variables from three polynomials.  The general problem  of eliminating n-1 variables from n  polynomial equations will be studied.",
