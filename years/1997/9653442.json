 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students in elementary statistics traditionally see experiments and data merely as words and numbers in a text. They plug numbers into formulas and make conclusions about briefly described experiments. They receive little or no exposure to the important statistical activities of sample selection, data collection, experimental design, randomization, development of statistical models, etc. In short, they leave the first course without a firm understanding of the role of applied statistics and the statistician in scientific investigations. Using previous support from the NSF, a successful prototype elementary statistics laboratory course has been established at the University of South Carolina. The laboratory, which can be taken in lieu of some traditional lectures or in addition to the traditional course, allows students to work in teams to design and perform experiments, collect and analyze data, and make written reports. It is proposed to train a nationwide cadre of elementary statistics teachers in the techniques of supplementing traditional elementary statistics lectures with meaningful hands-on laboratory experiences. Two groups of 24 teachers will be trained. Initial training will involve a five-day workshop. The workshops will allow the teachers to experience ten of the 17 laboratory sessions. There will also be discussions on effective teaching strategies in the laboratory setting, the logistics of obtaining supplies and equipment, and different possible formats for using the labs. Teachers attending the workshop will be expected to use at least two laboratory experiences in an elementary statistics course in the following year and encouraged to develop at least one new elementary statistics laboratory experiment. An electronic discussion group will be developed to allow for interaction among the teachers and the project team after the completion of the workshops.",
