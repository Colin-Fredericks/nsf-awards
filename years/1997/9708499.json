 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708499  Langreth  The work of this senior and distinguished PI contains  several related components.  One of them is a density  functional theory of long-range interaction between  microscopic and mesoscopic bodies.  Another looks at a  theory of electronic dissipation, non-adiabatic charge  transfer and potentials and rates for atoms and molecular  species moving and reacting at a solid surface.  A third  component  is an initial foray into the theory of transport  in quantum dots using techniques previously developed by the  PI for non-adiabatic charge transfer.  %%%  The work of this senior and distinguished PI is related to  the properties of metals and insulators at a surface.  The  work explores the new physical phenomena which are seen as  an electron, an atom or a molecular specie moves near a  surface.  These include very subtle, long range and  technologically important questions of forces between small  bodies and  between a small grain and a surface.  They  include complex questions of charge transfer, when does it  happen and how.  Finally there are attempts to understand  transport in very small metallic grains.  ***",
