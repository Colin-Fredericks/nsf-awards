 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616741  Thomas    This award supports the participation of American scientists  in a U.S.-Japan-Australia seminar on Molecular Interactions  of Actin, to be held in Maui, Hawaii from April 1-5, 1997.  The co-organizers are Professors David D. Thomas of the  University of Minnesota, Toshio Yanagida of Osaka University  in Japan, and Cristobal G. dosRemedios of the University of  Sydney in Australia.  This seminar will focus on the role of  actin in the process of contractility and cell movement, and  will examine how actin interacts with other proteins at the  structural level.    Actin is a biomedically important protein that plays an  essential role in the contraction of all muscles and is a  major component of the cytoskeleton which is crucial to the  function of every cell in both animals and plants.  This  seminar will bring together researchers from the United  States, Japan and Australia who have developed complementary  techniques to study actin biophysics.  The exchange of ideas  and data with Japanese and Australian scientists will enable  the U.S. scientists to advance their own work, and will set  the stage for future collaborative research projects.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve  postdoctoral researchers.  The  proceedings of the meeting  are expected to be published in a book entitled Actin and  Actin-Binding Proteins.  ***",
