 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most fundamental challenges pervading  theoretical nuclear physics for half a century is to  understand the properties of atomic nuclei in terms of the  basic forces between nucleons (protons and neutrons).  In  spite of the progress made in the past, our present  understanding still has many gaps and deficiencies.  It is  the purpose of this project to substantially advance this  field of microscopic nuclear structure.       First, we will improve the theory of the basic nuclear  force--the interaction between two nucleons.  We will  develop more quantitative nuclear potentials, which can  serve as reliable input for microscopic nuclear structure  calculations.  Moreover, we will also improve the foundation  of the nuclear force model: it must be based upon the  fundamental theory of strong interactions, quantum  chromodynamics (QCD), and the theory of relativity of Albert  Einstein.       The second stepping stone in our program is the three  nucleon problem which can be solved exactly. The final step  in our proposed research is nuclear matter--the stuff that  atomic nuclei are made of.  A topical issue is the question  of how the interaction between two nucleons changes in the  nuclear matter environment.  This information is important  for the theory of nuclear reactions involving heavy nuclei  (heavy ion collisions).",
