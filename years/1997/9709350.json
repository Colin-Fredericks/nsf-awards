 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Brenda Kesler, Department of Chemistry, San Jose State   University, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Program of the   Chemistry Division under a Research Planning Grant to explore the   synthesis of chiral sulfonium and selenonium reagents, and examine their   use in asymmetric synthesis.   Methods developed for the synthesis of   chiral sulfur derived salts will be extended to the synthesis of   analogous selenium compounds.   Optically active compounds will be   achieved through face selective activation of isolated double bonds by   these reagents with the appealing possibility of chiral catalysis through   regeneration of the chiral sulfur and selenium compounds.   A Research   Planning Grant at this stage in Professor Kesler's career will allow her   to explore a methodology for asymmetric synthesis that will form the   basis for a competitive NSF proposal in a timely area.  Addition across a double bond directed by a nearby functionality has been   a fundamental method of achieving chiral compounds.   Systematic studies   will be undertaken to elucidate the abilities of chiral sulfonium and   selenium compounds to discriminate between the different faces of   isolated double bonds in organic compounds.   In contrast to the previous   methodologies, face discrimination affords a wide variety of optically   active compounds in a more straight forward manner.                                                          ` _\u00c1/>\u00a2 ?\u00c2 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1   \u2524\u00c1\u2514\u00c1%?\u2551\u00c1\u2524 \u255d\u00c1/\u2502\u00a5\u2563\u2514\u2563\u00a5` _?\u2524\u00c1%",
