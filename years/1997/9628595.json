Bruce      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project has the ultimate objective of developing an object-oriented software toolkit for wavelet based nonparametric prediction.  The current theory and practice of nonparametric estimation with wavelets is limited to a small set of prediction problems.  Statistical prediction or function estimation is of fundamental importance, with applications to a broad range of problems.  In the overwhelming majority of situations, non-parametric prediction methods are the most appropriate.  Based on the wavelet transform, Donoho and Johnstone have developed a powerful methodology, called \"WaveShrink\", for nonparametric function estimation.  WaveShrink has  a  very broad asymptotic near-optimality property and has proven valuable in practice. The project will address itself to fundamental advancements that are needed to develop new wavelet methodology encompassing a much broader set of prediction problems.  The new and existing methodology will be collected into a coherent object-oriented software toolkit.  This toolkit will be of use to a broad range of statisticians, data analysts, scientists, and engineers.    The research will lead to a completely new version of the S-Plus software module S+Wavelets.  Other commercial opportunities include consulting and teaching, a Mathcad function pack and electronic book, software licensing and patenting innovative algorithms.  ***",
