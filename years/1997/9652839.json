 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first segments of this project (NSF DUE 92-53980 and NSF DUE 94-55379), began on 1 February 1993. Five modules have been developed: Biological Science (Evolution), Biological Science (Genetics), Psychophysics, Social Psychology and Personality, and Science and the Visual Arts. The construction of three new modules and the development of new media form the body of this proposal to move closer to completion of these introductions to quantitative and experimental science.     During the current period, the PI was invited to present the Psychophysics module in an invited address at the SUNY Farmingdale 8th Conference on Teaching Undergraduate Psychology on 16-18 March, 1994. The PI was also invited to deliver the 2nd annual Lecture in Introductory Psychology to the Eastern Psychological Association, 16 April, 1994. The Psychophysics module has been evaluated for adoption by various American universities, and the University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg. France, the University of Stockholm, Sweden, and the Bar Elan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel. The Principle Investigator presented this work to the Quality Education for Minorities Network on October 13, 1995, and testified before the NSF's Review of Undergraduate Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology on 1 November, 1995.  The publication of Psych Tech Notes (Galanter, 1994) provides auxiliary text for the module on Psychophysics. The computer-based experiments have been revised, and a lab manual, Experiments in Psychology (Galanter, 1995), was used during fall term 1995. These materials were incorporated into an open Laboratory Module, and tested again during the spring term 1996 (1460-S96). The module offers substantive knowledge in psychophysics, and psychophysical approaches to cognition (Galanter, E., 1992).     Assessment includes student feedback in the form of categorical scales and open ended questions on the merits and limitations of the module. These data are part of an independent study by the Office of the Univer sity Provost, and have not yet been made available for our review. We anticipate access in Summer 1996.   We have provided examinations (including multiple choice and constructive questions) on the Columbia Internet web site. We are using these data to compare machine scored constructive answers to our hand scoring. We continue to study the current literature on comparisons between (multiple) choice and constructed responses in cognitive measurement (Bennett, R. E. & Ward, W. C. 1993). To help us in this work Dr. Samuel Messick, Senior Scientist and Vice President of the Educational Testing Service joined our advisory board. We have also added Dr. John Swets, Vice President for Research at BBN Cambridge, MA. and Dr. Lawrence E. Marks, of the John B. Pierce Laboratory and Yale University to the board.",
