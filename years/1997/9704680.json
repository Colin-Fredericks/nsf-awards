 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704680  Fricke    Despite its potential to provide new inroads in the study of marine and terrestrial paleoenvironment, the isotopic analysis of phosphates has been hampered by the same quality that makes them so attractive; the strength of the oxygen-phosphorous bond.  Until recently, the chemical separation of the phosphate ion was difficult and time consuming, and its analysis required the use of relatively complex flourination techniques.  A new analytical technique has been developed which is much simpler, and it is now possible to process and analyze large numbers of phosphate samples relatively rapidly.  Nevertheless preparing samples for this technique is still relatively labor-intensive, and it is not possible at present to run samples smaller than -6 mg in size.  The P.I. will develop the excimer laser as a faster and microanalytical alternative to the methods described above.  The technique will drastically reduce the necessary sample size, allowing for in situ analysis and the isotopic investigation of small and rapidly formed skeletal structures.",
