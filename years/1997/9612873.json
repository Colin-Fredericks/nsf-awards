 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612873  Acrivos    This well integrated Research for Undergraduate Institutions  (RUI) proposal advances education and research by involving  undergraduate as well as graduate students in a study of low  dimensional solids.  It will focus on common properties exhibited  by a variety of compounds such as graphite, dichalcogenides,  superconducting cuprates and nickelates, and organic metals, all  of which have layered structures.  Common properties to be  studied include the ability to undergo intercalation reactions  involving different donor/acceptor groups as well as metal to non  metal to superconducting phase transitions.  Methods that will be  used in these investigations include electron spin resonance and  x-ray absorption spectroscopy.  %%%  Intercalation reactions are used for the synthesis of low  dimensional solids as materials for high-duty batteries,  catalysts, and solid lubricants.  The synthesis of these  materials and their evaluation by spectroscopic measurements will  promote solid laboratory experiences for the undergraduate and  masters degree students.  The integration of  research with  education through the training of students in this fundamentally  and technologically significant materials area, together with  strong collaborations at IBM and the Universities of Purdue,  Notre Dame, and Cambridge (UK), make this a most unique RUI  program.  ***",
