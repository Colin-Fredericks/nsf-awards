 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706855    Wang    Work on this project concerns several analytic problems arising   from the area of geometric variational calculus: weakly   harmonic maps, weak flows of harmonic maps into general   Riemannian manifolds, p-harmonic maps. Smoothness of solutions to   such problems often breaks down. Of particular interest are the   partial regularity and uniqueness of weak flows of harmonic maps   in suitable classes, sequential compactness of the solution space   including weakly harmonic maps and weak flows of harmonic maps,  relationships between flows of Ginzburg-Landau type and   harmonic maps, behavior of solutions near singular points, and  existence and geometric properties of self-similar solutions to   harmonic map flows. This work will involve geometric measure   theory and PDE methods in geometric fashion. The PI also proposes   to formulate heat flow of harmonic maps between Alexandrov spaces.     Partial differential equations are the basic tools to describe   physical problems. Harmonic maps model extremal (or optimal)   objects with respect to physically natural energy functionals  in families of objects satisfying common constraints. The heat  flow of harmonic maps studies the long-time dynamical behavior  of objects in such families.  The study will enhance our   understanding of these maps, improve methods to control the  singular sets, and predict singular behavior of solutions to  these problems. The results will have applications to material  science including liquid crystals and elasticity/plasticity.",
