 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604124  Barnes  Diadenosine tri- and tetra- phosphates (Ap3A and Ap4A) are present in all organisms examined.  They may serve one or more functions, and they are degraded by specific enzymes in those organisms.  In humans, a gene designated FHIT encodes a candidate tumor suppressor, Fhit.  Fhit is an Ap3A hydrolase that catalyzes the degradation of Ap3A.  The goal of this research is to determine the catalytic mechanism of specific enzymes from yeast and humans that degrade these dinucleotide phosphates.  The hydrolases will be analyzed for formation of covalent enzyme intermediates during catalysis as has been indicated for Ap4A phosphorylase I.  The amino acid residues required for the binding and catalysis of substrate will be identified.  Participation of postulated histidine residues and others will be tested by site-directed mutagenesis.    Enzymes that process dinucleotide polyphosphates (ApnA) and related compounds in yeast and mammals will be examined. The roles of dinucleotide polyphosphates in regulation of cell growth and proliferation are postulated, but not known. These include, intracellularly, regulation of DNA replication and the stress response. Extracellularly,  they act via purinogenic-type receptors. This area has become important in the past few years with the discovery, by Barnes,  that the tumor suppresser gene FHIT encodes an Ap3A hydrolase (Fhit).  Abnormal FHIT transcripts are found in 50%of some common cancers. The hydrolase enzymes are a family of nucleotide-binding proteins whose catalytic action is likely to be linked to regulation of cell proliferation.   ***",
