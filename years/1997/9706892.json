 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706892    Garofalo      The proposal is concerned with three projects: 1) Optimal regularity for  nonlinear pde's and systems in Carnot-Caratheodory (CC) spaces and the  applications of this theory to geometry, isoperimetric and Sobolev  inequalities, minimal surfaces in (CC) spaces and their regularity,  Dirichlet problem in nilpotent Lie groups: Connection between harmonic  measure and perimeter, harmonic maps between CR manifolds. 2) Symmetry in  overdetermined boundary value problems, both interior and exterior, in  Euclidean and CR geometry, minimizers in the isoperimetric and Sobolev  inequalities in the Heisenberg group, a conjecture of E. De Giorgi and its  parabolic counterpart. 3) Unique continuation for sub-elliptic operators,  applications to scattering, inverse problems on the Heisenberg group,  unique continuation for nonlinear equations of p-Laplacian type.      The proposed research sits at the confluence of two main areas of  interest in mathematics known as partial differential equations and  geometry. Both areas find their origin and motivation in problems arising  in the observation and description of natural phenomena, at every  scale. A main focus of the proposed research is, e.g., the  reconstruction of the shape of a body knowing some quantities that can be  measured on the surface that surrounds the body. Such a problem has a  great relevance in the applied sciences and is especially important in  areas of Federal strategic interest ranging from computerized tomography,  to biotechnology, to control of the core of a nuclear reactor, etc.  The proposed research will also contribute to the development of human  resources through the involvement of young investigators (doctoral  students). The principal investigator is also writing a book which will  focus on those aspects of the program that has been developed over the  past few years in collaboration with several doctoral students.",
