 "awd_abstract_narration": "Olson  9704471    The proposed research develops a new model of intergranular  stress corrosion cracking of metals, based on measurable features of  the polycrystalline microstructure.  In the model, the crack is  viewed as proceeding through a network of grain boundaries, causing  failure when the crack percolates through the material.  The first phase of this project will be to compare various   models for interface energy.  This analysis will largely  be a statistical analysis of data obtained from cracked  samples, followed by a comparison and modification of the   existing interfacial energy models.  Next, the model will   be used to compare the resistance to cracking of various   microstructures.  The microstructures to be tested will   include random textures, textures simulated through   numerical models of annealing, and textures from actual   materials measured by Brent Adams' experimental group at   Carnegie Mellon University.  The results for textures from   simulated processing models will predict the net effect of  material processing on material performance.    The lifetime of many engineering materials (for example,   metals and metal alloys) is seriously limited by   their susceptibility to the phenomenon called stress   corrosion cracking.  This type of failure occurs when  the material is subject to a combination of tensile   stress and a corrosive element, leading to a crack which   propagates through the material and causes it to break.  The main objective of the proposed research is to develop  and analyze a new model of intergranular stress corrosion  cracking.  This model is used to predict the growth of cracks   in metals and metal alloys, and it is unique in that it  incorporates measurable microstructural information from   the material.  Because stress corrosion cracking is a common   and catastrophic phenomenon in certain materials, it would be  invaluable for engineers to be able to estimate a material's  susceptibility to cracking by measuring microstructure  and u sing the model.  In addition, if one can correlate given   processing techniques with the resulting microstructures,    one could then use this model to prescribe processes which   would enhance resistance to stress corrosion cracking.",
