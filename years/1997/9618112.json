 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618112  Targett    Brown algal polyphenolics are acetate-malonate derived phloroglucinol (1,3,5-  trihydroxybenzene) polymers with putative biological activity (herbivore  deterrents, digestion reducers, antibacterial agents) that attain  substantial concentrations in many brown algal species, and hence, represent  a significant investment of plant resources. Ecological theories, such as  optimal defense, resource availability, and growth differentiation balance,  have attempted to provide an inclusive theoretical framework that balances  improvements in plant fitness resulting from secondary metabolite production  with the metabolic costs of these compounds. However, experimental tests of  these theories have yielded mixed results.  Our understanding of factors  that control plant production of secondary metabolites is limited because  experiments to date have focused primarily on correlations between plant  stresses and plant secondary metabolite concentrations, rather than rates of  metabolite synthesis and turnover. Information regarding phlorotannin  concentration levels as they correlate to various environmental factors has  been useful in establishing general trends, but increasingly, observations  of inter- and intraspecific variation in brown algal phlorotannin  concentrations are falling outside of the current theoretical framework. To  truly understand the observed patterns of plant phlorotannin concentrations,  it is essential to understand the effect that specific environmental factors  have on rates of phlorotannin production and turnover.         The goals of this project are: 1. To establish an accurate  understanding of brown algal phlorotannin synthesis, turnover, and exudation  rates, 2. To establish the magnitude of variation in these rates as a result  of changes in nutrient (nitrogen) concentration, irradiance bevels, and  grazing intensity, 3. To use the data as a framework for the evaluation of  the carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis (CNB) and the induction hypothesis  ( IND) in marine systems, 4. To quantitatively evaluate the cost of  phlorotannin synthesis and maintenance under varying nitrogen, irradiance  and herbivory regimes.  This research addresses several competing ideas that  attempt to account for variation in concentrations of carbon-based secondary  metabolites in plants. It does so with a direct experimental approach (lab  and field) to measurement of rates of phlorotannin synthesis, turnover and  fate in temperate and tropical brown algal species. Understanding these  mechanisms is central to understanding issues of resource allocation and  cost of allelochemical production.",
