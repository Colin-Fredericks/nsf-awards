 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data compression aims at producing an efficient representation for storage or  transmission in order to communicate or store the smallest possible number of  bits while retaining high quality in the reconstructed image.  Statistical  classification and segmentation are both concerned with labeling parts of an  image as being of a certain type or class, such as tumor or normal tissue in a  medical image or text, graphics, or photographs in a document page.   Classification and segmentation can be used to assist human users of images, as  in highlighting suspicious tissue in a medical image or defects in an imaged  circuit, or they can be used for the automatic extraction of features in  intelligent browsing of large databases.  All three operations have in common the  goal of efficiently representing an image as a whole, by optimally trading off  quality and cost or distortion, an din decomposing the image into useful  components.  Most of the systems involving these operations, however, focus on  each separate operation rather than on combining them into common algorithms with  multiple goals.  This project is devoted to the development of theory and  algorithms for jointly performing these operations and related signal processing  such as the estimation of probability distributions or models from observed data.   The approach involves optimizing single combined systems subject to possibly  conflicting combined goals, such as maximizing signal-to-noise ratios and  minimizing bit rates and Bayes risk.  Theory will be reinforced by simulations  for both artificial sources, where theoretical performance bounds can be used for  comparison, and real-world examples drawn from medical and document applications.",
