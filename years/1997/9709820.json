 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT :  Support provided by this grant will facilitate the continuation and enhancement of the regional workshop \"Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and their Representations\", which has been operating in the Western US for several years, and help establish it on a regular basis. Lie theory is a central discipline in modern mathematics, playing key roles in harmonic analysis, number theory, algebra, differential geometry and several aspects of mathematical physics. The goals of the workshop are to provide opportunities for graduate students and junior researchers to avail themselves of the expertise of the many researchers who are working in this general area in the Western US.    The three CO PI's will continue to organize four weekend workshops per year at various campuses of the University of California. These workshops will feature both local experts and a few outside speakers. Funds will be awarded to graduate students and junior researchers in order to both facilitate attendance at the workshops and to encourage collaborative research with senior researchers. It has been the CO PI's collective experience over the past few years that this type of activity, creating as it does a unique opportunity to learn, is a particularly efficient and beneficial way for graduate students planning to work in this important branch of mathematics to acquaint themselves with both current research and the researchers who are producing it.",
