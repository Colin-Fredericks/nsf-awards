Investigators  and co-investigators who have conducted and are conducting  research on this and related topics with support from the  National Science Foundation and others will present their  findings for the purpose of discussion, critical review and  identification of any further research needs on issues  associated with the survival of the HIV when subjected to  environmental stress beyond those addressed by current and  past awards.    Results of this conference and workshop are expected to  provide guidance for conduct of further research on issues  involving survival and fate of the Human Immunodeficiency  Virus (HIV) under various environmental conditions.  Conference participation is expected to include research  personnel from the National Institutes of Health, the United  States Public Health Service, the Environmental Protection  Agency and other Federal agencies.  The conference and  workshop will be held at the University of Pittsburgh.  ***",
