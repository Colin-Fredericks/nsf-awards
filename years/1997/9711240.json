 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues research in discrete and computational  geometry, developing new combinatorial ideas for the study of  algorithms in real algebraic geometry. The algorithm studied  include the existential theory of the reals, quantifier  elimination over real closed fields and constructing roadmaps of  arbitrary semi-algebraic sets.  An important development comes  from considering the situation in which these problems live on an  algebraic variety of dimension lower than the dimension of the  ambient space.  In this situation it has been possible to find  algorithms and structural bounds for which the combinatorial  complexity depends on the dimension of the variety rather than on  the dimension of the ambient space.    These ideas will be used to:    (1) Develop more efficient algorithms to compute a semi-        algebraic description of the connected components of a semi-        algebraic set.      (2) Investigate the complexity of a Whitney stratification of a        semi-algebraic set.      (3) Develop more efficient algorithms to compute the real        dimension of a semi-algebraic set.      (4) Investigate other parameters of complexity such as the        input fewnomial bound (the number of input monomials) and        explore broadening the class of input functions to Pfaffian        functions.      (5) Remove the genericity hypotheses in the recent breakthrough        result of Sharir, which gives nearly sharp bounds on the        complexity of the lower envelope of a family of        hypersurfaces (or patches of such surfaces) in general        position.      (6) Investigate whether the classical zone theorem can be        further extended to bound the complexity of an algebraic        variety in the midst of a family of algebraic sets.    The solution of these problems would have significant impact on  problems in motion planning and computer algebra.",
