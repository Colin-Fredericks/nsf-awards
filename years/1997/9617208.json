 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports David Pratt from the   University of Pittsburgh in his continuing studies of the electronic   spectroscopy of van der Waals complexes using rotationally-resolved   fluorescence excitation spectroscopy in molecular beams.  The goals are   to a) determine the intermolecular potential energy surfaces of the   benzene-water complex in the lowest two singlet electronic states, b)   determine the solvent-induced changes in the structure of the peptide   bond in the formanilide-water complex, c) study the influence of complex   formation on intramolecular relaxation processes, and 4) study   conformational control of chemical reaction dynamics.  Force field and ab   initio calculations will also be carried out.  The more global objective   of these studies is to investigate the point at which one goes from the   quantum mechanical to the classical limit, by studying larger asymmetric   rotors with smaller energy level spacings via excitation deep into the   ultraviolet.    Matter exhibits a hierarchy of structures at many length scales, with   `assemblies` at one scale becoming `component parts` at the next.  In   this hierarchy, van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding play   particularly prominent roles, leading to the aggregation of isolated   molecules into assemblies that become the characteristic component parts   of macroscopic liquid and solid phases.  Hydrogen bonding also appears as   a ubiquitous feature in the complex three-dimensional structures of   proteins, genes, membranes, and other macromolecular constituents of   living systems.  It is therefore important to identify and characterize   the basic `supramolecular` units that form the bridge between the   microscopic and macroscopic domains.  This is the purpose of these   studies.",
