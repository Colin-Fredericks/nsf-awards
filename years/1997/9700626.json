A major reason for this  has been the lack of data with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to resolve  mesoscale processes associated with precipitation bands.  One of the mesoscale  phenomena that has been suggested to play an important role in the formation and  modulation of precipitation bands is mesoscale gravity waves.  Gravity waves  present a real challenge to weather forecasters, because they have been nearly  impossible to detect with standard synoptic observations and are not routinely  predicted by operational models.  The major observational and modeling  improvements being brought about by the National Weather Service Modernization  now affords the opportunity for the research and operational meteorological  communities to work together to develop improved understanding of these mesoscale  phenomena.  Additional research is needed on wave dynamics and generation  mechanisms, and to differentiate them from the presence of other mesoscale  phenomena, notably cold fronts aloft        A definitive identification of gravity wave generation mechanisms and  vertical structure, their interactions with convection, and their role in the  cyclogenesis process remains elusive.  One cause for this confusion is that the  evidence often suggests more than one mechanism may be operative.  Recent  research by the Principal Investigator has focused on understanding the forcing,  dynamics, and vertical structure of weather-producing mesoscale gravity waves using  primarily surface, wind profiler, and mesoscale model data obtained during the  STORM-FEST project.  The Principal Investigator has found there to be a  predilection for strong waves to be generated in regions of dynamic imbalance  during lee cyclogenesis as a jet streak encounters the Rocky Mountai ns.  However,  in at least one of these cases, the evidence also suggests that a cold front aloft  occurred in close proximity to the waves.        The research to be performed under this award represents both a continuation  of the Principal Investigator s past efforts and an extension into new but related  directions. The ultimate goal is to incorporate observed precipitation band structure  and dynamics into a new conceptual model for lee cyclones in the central U. S.  The  first objective is to resolve the role of cold fronts aloft versus gravity waves, or  perhaps their interactions, in the generation of rainbands.  Secondly, the research  will help to remove ambiguities concerning the role of unbalanced dynamics in  gravity wave formation.  The third objective, will be to address the issue of  mesoscale predictability, in terms of what data and data assimilation techniques are  required for mesoscale models to reliably produce observed gravity waves.  Lastly,  the Principal Investigator will complete an ongoing investigation of solitary waves  and bores generated by cold fronts.        Results from this research potentially will have direct and immediate impact  on the ability to predict mesoscale gravity waves.   ***",
