Ms. Voelker's dissertation research involves acquisition of mitochondrial DNA sequences from 40 species of the avian genus Anthus in order to generate a well-resolved phylogenetic hypotheses among species of the genus.  Species of this genus are distributed world-wide, providing Mr. Voelker and Dr. Edwards an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the relative roles of dispersal and vicariance on a global scale.  Those roles are the subject of intensive debate, and the work proposed in this study represent one of the few situations where the effects of dispersal can be adequately assessed.  The research also will permit rigorous testing of two long-standing and competing hypotheses concerning the evolution of migration in avian groups, and in addition, provide the first phylogenetically-controlled study that will examine the evolution of morphology in relation to migratory behavior.  Consequently, results from the work will be of general interest across taxonomic and organismal groups.  Support for training of graduate students in modern technologies is critical to maintain the workforce of scientists capable of addressing questions and issues in global biology.",
