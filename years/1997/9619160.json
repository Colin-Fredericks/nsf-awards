Using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS), the project follows the 8th grade students (in 1988) for five years (through 1994).  By 1994, these individuals have had the opportunity to complete high school or obtain an alternative high school certification through testing (i.e., Graduate Equivalency Degree--GED), and begin college.  Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the project follows individuals from age 13-21.  Some individuals in the samples have completed high school and begun college, while others have not completed high school or obtained a GED.  The research studies  the changes in family composition during this critical period in the life cycle when most individuals are completing their secondary educational experiences and making decisions about post-high school activities, and the association between these changes and the educational achievement of the individuals.  In addition, the research will explore the association of changes in family structure with five key sets of mediating variables:  family income, residential mobility and school changing, social capital, self concept and locus of control, and behavior in school.  Finally, the research will examine the ways in which these mediating variables help to account for the association between changes in family structure and educational attainment.  ***",
