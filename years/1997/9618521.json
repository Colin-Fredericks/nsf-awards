The main objectives will be the description of the Grothendieck  groups G_0 and K_0 of these rings, the continued development  of the representation theory of finite dimensional Hopf algebras,  and the detailed analysis of invariant rings of multiplicative  group actions on Laurent polynomial rings.    Invariant theory and representation theory of groups are classical  algebraic themes that are ubiquitous in pure mathematics and are  indispensable in parts of applied mathematics and physics as well.  Both are formally subsumed in the theory of Hopf algebras, more  recent algebraic structures with a wide range of applications. In  recognition of their relevance in physics, certain types of Hopf  algebras are referred to as quantum groups. Hopf algebras further  naturally arise in knot theory, an area of particular interest to  molecular chemists as well as physicists.",
