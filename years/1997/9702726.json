 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award made to James E. Hutchison at the University of Oregon   is supported by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division.   The goal of the research is to develop new molecular approaches for   optimizing the conductivity, processability, nonlinear optical response   and/or electrochromism of pi-conjugated conducting polymers.  Two new   classes of self-organizing polythiophenes will be studied: (1)   regioregular poly-4-alkyl-2,2'-bithiophenes prepared by chemical   polymerization methods, and (2) polybithiphene/polypeptide hybrids   prepared by molecular templating. Physical studies of these polymer   classes will  determine their extent of conjugation, degree of interchain   charge transport, conductivities, band gaps and nonlinear optical   responses. The polythiophene/polypeptide hybrid polymers provide enhanced   supramolecular order and opportunities to prepare discreet molecular   wires of Angstrom-scale diameter which may be useful as interconnects   between molecular electronic devices such as transistors, molecular   switches or sensors.  The CAREER educational plan will provided research and classroom training   to better prepare students to excel in multidisciplinary research   environments. Objectives include integrating research into the   undergraduate curriculum, promoting peer- and self-learning and   instilling a `can-do` problem-solving attitude in all students.   Establishment of virtual office hours, and a surface science discussion   group will foster collaborations. Faculty-mentored, self-taught courses   will be designed to build problem-solving skills.",
