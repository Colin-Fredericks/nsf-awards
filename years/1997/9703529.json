The first project is an investigation  of  the nucleation of bubbles in helium liquid which is subjected  to  a  negative  pressure. We plan to study how  this  nucleation  process  is influenced by the presence of electrons and quantized  vortices. The goal of the second project is the detection of  the  nucleation of solid helium at pressures above the normal freezing  pressure of the liquid. The third experiment is to look  for  the  nucleation of bubbles at the interface between liquid helium  and  a solid wall. As part of this last experiment, we will attempt to  measure  the  equation  of  state of liquid  helium  at  negative  pressure.  %%%  The  way  in which bubbles form in liquids is important  in  many  technologically  important applications.  These  include  ink-jet  printers, ship propellers, and liquid pumps. Bubble formation can  occur  even  in clean liquids but is often greatly influenced  by  impurities or solid particles in the liquid. Studying bubbles  in  liquid  helium is worthwhile because the liquid can be made  much  purer  than  any other liquid, and hence it is easier to  perform  experiments which are unaffected by the influence of impurities.  *****",
