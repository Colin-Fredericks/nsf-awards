 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research in gesture, speech and gaze investigates automatic  discourse  segmentation  of multimodal communication  data.   The  goal  is  to  discern discourse structure from  video  and  voice  analysis  of  data that one can legitimately expect  from  common  video  and  its  audio  track.  The  research  will  address  the  interpretation  of  gesture,  speech,  and  gaze   in   discourse  management,  utilizing  psycholinguistic models  to  explain  how  these   modalities   combine  to  express  discourse   structure;  specifically,   by   developing   algorithms   for    recognizing  'catchments' as empirically grounded thematic segments  based  on  the  partial  recurrence of prosodic, gaze and  gesture  features  during natural discourse.  The research will be integrated into a  hierarchical   model  that  is  both  amenable  to  computational  implementation  and reflective of human communicative  realities.  The  approach  involves  experiments  designed  to  discover  and  quantify cues in the various modalities, and their relation  with  respect to discourse management; the development of computational  algorithms to detect and recognize such cues; and the integration  of  these  cues into a cogent discourse management  system.   The  team,  comprising  psycholinguistic, machine  vision  and  signal  processing researchers, gains strength from its interdisciplinary  scope.  Technology  developed will  have  significant  impact  on  natural  language understanding, human-computer interaction,  and  discourse and video databases.",
