 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anthropological studies of health and culture change emphasize that such change is frequently a significant source of psychosocial stress.  Numerous studies have now consistently demonstrated the negative effects of stress on human immune function.  This study proposes to introduce a developmental perspective to anthropological studies of stress and culture change, and to incorporate immunological measures into the anthropology of stress and adaptation. Individuals from 6 Western Samoan villages undergoing varying degrees of modernization will be assessed for Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels (a measure of cell-mediated immune function), cortisol (a measure of reactivity), and C-reactive protein (a marker of pathogen exposure).  These measures will be obtained from dried blood spots collected via finger-stick blood samples in collaboration with the annual Department of Health filariasis survey.  Data also will be collected on multiple dimensions of stress and culture change.  This study pursues a cross-cultural perspective on the relationships between stress and immune function and applies a developmental perspective to the problem of modernization stress.",
