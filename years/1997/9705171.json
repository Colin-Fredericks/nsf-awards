Two  goals  of  the work are to investigate  competition  between  the intrinsic and disorder-induced anisotropies  on  the  vortex  pinning and dynamics of cuprate crystals and  films  with  different static disorder; and to study the thermally-induced and  current-driven  vortex dynamics from macroscopic  to  microscopic  scales.  Experiments include measurement of the Hall conductivity  up   to   10MHz;  the  first-  and  third-harmonic  ac   magnetic  susceptibility  from 0.1Hz to 0.1MHz, and the microwave  magneto-  impedance from 6 to 26 GHz using high-Q sapphire-loaded microwave  cativites. Scanning tunneling microscope measurements  will  also  be made.  %%%  This experimental research project is centered on the effects  of  magnetic  field  on the cuprate high temperature superconductors,  which are important in potential applications such as filters for  communication  systems  and  current  carrying  wires  for  power  transmission.  The  research focuses  on  the  stability  of  the  magnetic  flux  lines  as they penetrate the superconductor,  the  types  of  motions  of the flux lines and how  to  minimize  such  motions by providing so-called pinning centers. Flux line motions  lead  to internal energy loss and heating and are detrimental  to  efficiency in most applications. The experimental tools  in  this  project  include  measurement  of  harmonic  generation  in   the  interaction of ac magnetic fields with such samples, and study of  vortex   geometries  using  the  scanning  tunneling  microscope.  Results  from  this research may include unusual new  effects  or  materials  which  may  find new application in  technology.  This  research  project  is  interdisciplinary in nature  and   involves  graduate  students  who  will  be excellently  trained  to  enter  positions in industry, government or education.  ***",
