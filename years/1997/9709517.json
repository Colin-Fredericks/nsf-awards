 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coleman  9709517    Plant growth and development depends upon the acquisition and use  of resources. In most environments, one or more resources will be  limiting  during  plant  growth.  Understanding  how  plants  use  resources  and the components that contribute to the  economy  of  use  are  basic to understanding plant growth, plant  competition  and  ecosystem function. The acquisition and storage of  nitrogen  is  thought to be an important component of woody perennial plant  nitrogen   dynamics.  Although  current  theories  suggest   that  nitrogen   storage  is  important  in  woody  plant  growth   and  development,  few studies have directly measured the contribution  of nitrogen storage or determined how the different components of  storage influence growth and development. This research will  use  plant biotechnology to determine how specific proteins contribute  to  tree  nitrogen  storage  and how altered  storage  influences  growth and development. The results will contribute significantly  to  understanding seasonal nitrogen storage in woody  plants  and  how nitrogen storage contributes to plant growth and development.  Such  knowledge will contribute to understanding the  utilization  of nitrogen in forest ecosystems",
