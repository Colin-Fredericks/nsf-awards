 "awd_abstract_narration": "Problem to be addressed:  The Biology Department has realized a 50% increase in student enrollments in biology courses over a five-year period.  Increased enrollments have stretched the college's ability to provide students with hands-on use of technology.  The purchase of Calculator-Based Laboratory (CBL) Systems will enable us to offer educational experiences to students which improve instruction by using inexpensive, durable, modern equipment.    Objectives:  Improve the scientific competencies of students to monitor, record and analyze biological data.    Methods:  Each CBL System will allow an average class of 28 students to work in groups of two students per station.  Students will perform a multitude of hands-on experiences in 1) Ecology, 2) Environmental Biology, and 3) Physiology.    Audience:  Twelve hundred  students enrolled in undergraduate biology courses at Waubonsee Community College.  Additional students enrolled in distance learning courses at community colleges in northern Illinois.     Collaborations:  None in project year.  Fox Valley Education Alliance which includes five community college districts after the first project year.    Significance of Impact on Undergraduate Education:  The project offers hands-on laboratory experiences using inexpensive modern technology and equipment and would serve as a model to extend biology laboratory instruction via distance learning networks both regionally and nationally.",
