 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712871  Brown    Research will be undertaken in response to an Announcement of Opportunity (NSF 97-38) for   Coastal Studies in the Great Lakes.  This is a collaborative research project involving eleven    investigators from five academic research institutions.  The research is being conducted under the   auspices of the NSF Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) program and the NOAA Coastal Ocean   Program.  This collaborative, interdisciplinary 5-year research program will entail an integrated   program of field and laboratory studies and mathematical modeling to quantify the role of coastal   currents and thermal fronts in mediating cross-margin transport in Lake Superior.      The western shore of Lake Superior's Keweenaw Peninsula exhibits a dramatic coastal jet known   as the Keweenaw Current.  A strong, shore-parallel density front, the thermal bar, also is   characteristic of this region and persists long into the summer. The goal of the proposed work is to   determine the physical, chemical, and biological effects that arise from the intense physical forcing   on this system, and specifically, to elucidate how these effects interact temporally and spatially to   define distinct nearshore and offshore environments in Lake Superior.  This project represents the   first effort to model coupled physical, chemical, and biological processes in the coastal zone of   Lake Superior where both vertical and horizontal thermal structure and transport processes are   important.    The research team is divided into three subgroups: Physical Processes, Chemical Gradients, and   Biological Communities.  The Physical Processes group will examine the relative importance of all   forcing factors (e.g., wind-driven variability, baroclinic instability) that govern cross margin   transport using in situ observations, numerical modeling, and satellite observations.  The Chemical   Gradients group will characterize nearshore-offshore differences in distributions of chemical   species, evaluate chemical tracers of wa ter and sediment movement, and investigate differences   (inshore vs. offshore) in chemical cycles induced by the current.  The Biological Communities   group will determine how gradients in primary production, trophic structure, and rates of material   transformation develop. All three groups will interact closely throughout the project to obtain and   share complementary data sets and to derive a coupled physical/chemical/biological model of the   system.  The detailed, process-level understanding achieved by this project will advance our   quantitative understanding of the processes that regulate the transport, transformation and fate of   biologically, chemically and geologically important matter in coastal regions and provide a firm   basis for future management decisions on how best to preserve the pristine nature of Lake   Superior.        Under this award, moorings will be deployed through three full years so that conditions in all   seasons, including under the ice, can be monitored.  Ground-based measurements will be enhanced   by concurrent satellite determination of surface temperature and archived images will be employed   to obtain a record of interannual variability in thermal structure. Work will also lead to   development of chemical tracers of water and sediment movement by fingerprinting particles   originating within the study zone in order to track and quantify present-day and historic patterns of   particle transport from nearshore to offshore. Measurement of radionuclides on particles within the   nearshore zone and in cores from the offshore zone will play a critical role in identification of   sediment transport and deposition pathways.",
