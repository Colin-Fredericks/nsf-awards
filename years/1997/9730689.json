Academic, industrial  and government laboratory educators and researchers will consider  four topical areas together with another three areas to be  addressed by panel discussion.  The four topical areas are:  (1)  Strategies for New Materials Discovery;  (2)  Structure /  Property Relations and Theory;  (3)  Hybrid Materials and  Interfaces;  (4)  Societal Needs and Technological Opportunities.  The three areas to be discussed by panels are:  (1) Education and  Training;  (2)  What is Materials Chemistry?  (3)  Facilities and  Resources.  The Workshop will be held as an open meeting at NSF  on January 15-16, 1998.  A document summarizing the findings will  be prepared by the Solid State Chemistry and Materials Planning  Committee on January 18-19, 1998. This document will be made  public and circulated among government agencies such as NSF, ONR,  DoD, and DOE for their internal use.  %%%  The present workshop arose in response to a recent review process  at NSF.   A committee of visitors (COV) consisting of Susan  Kauzlarich (UC Davis), Jack Johnson (Exxon), and Thomas Bein  (Purdue U) was selected to study the procedure by which proposals  are reviewed and selected for funding within the solid state  chemistry program at DMR.  Susan Kauzlarich represented this  group in a larger COV, which consisted of representatives from  all DMR programs,  and this larger committee prepared a report  for the Assistant Director of NSF in April, 1996.  In that report  the COV voiced concern over the lack of continuity between this  and previous COVs which had been drawn from the Materials  Research Advisory Committee (MRAC).  The COV recommended that the  Division find ways to benefit from c ommunity input and also to  provide the needed continuity for the COVs.  Thus, the Division  of Materials Research is responding to a recommendation by the  MPS Advisory Committee to enhance the COV process.  This will be  accomplished through a three year plan: (1) In the first year,  hold a seies of topical workshops tied to each of the programs  within the Division of Materials Research.  This would provide a  focus for the exacting scientific opportunities within a  particular subfield.  Near  the end of the year, a workshop would  be held calling together some of the members of these workshops  to set priorities among the various new opportunities.   (2) In  the second year, hold a series of workshops on areas at the  periphery of the Division's interest.  The interfacial areas  would be identified through community input and from outgrowths  of the first year workshops.  For continuity, some of the  workshop members from the first year panels would be invited to  attend this series of workshops.  (3) The Divisional COV would  then be held in the third year.  The members of the COV would be  drawn, although not exclusively, from the attendees at the  workshops held the previous two years. Also, the COV noted in  their report to the Assistant Director that funding statistics by  scientific area were not available, and in response to this DMR  is now developing a taxonomy of the field of materials research  and the programs.  This taxonomy will be useful in evaluating the  balance of scientific effort in the programs and across the  Division.  ***",
