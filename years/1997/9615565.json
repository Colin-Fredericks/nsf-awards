 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615565  Zhou  This project will investigate the possibility of modeling  biological phenomena such as hormone release, neuron  firings, and electrophysiological profiles, by viewing  pertinent measurements as events with random occurrence  times.  Such time series and their transformations are known  as point processes and filtered point processes,  respectively, and their application to biological signals  will offer additional insight into their mechanisms.  In  collaboration with a neuroscience research group at Emory  University, biologically meaningful models will be explored  and state-of-the-art statistical signal processing tools  will be adopted to extract model parameters.  Directly  interpretable models and advanced signal processing  methodologies are capable of explaining certain biological  phenomena which may not be evident from the raw data.  A  formal joint proposal (with collaborators from life science  fields) will be submitted at the end of the twelve-month  planning period.  The present planning proposal will provide  support for one graduate student and release time for the PI  both of which are instrumental for the success of a junior  faculty entering a new interdisciplinary field.  ***",
