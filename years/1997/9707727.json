 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Dunn-Rankin      This is an industry-university cooperative research project between the     University of California at Irvine and Metro Laser of Irvine, CA.      Resonant holographic interferometry (RHI) is a laser-based diagnostic that     combines the three-dimensional imaging capability of holography, the phase-    sensitive detection of interferometry, and the species specificity of resonance     spectroscopy.  It accomplishes this by recording two simultaneous holograms     at two different wavelengths, one tuned near an absorption line and the other     tuned off this feature.  Upon reconstruction, the resulting interference fringes     correspond uniquely to the  density of the species under interrogation while     phase contributions from background species, thermal and pressure     instabilities and optical aberrations are subtracted out.  The approach has     been successfully demonstrated in gas-phase combustion systems.  In this     effort, RHI is applied to multiphase systems for the first time.  Specifically,     products from droplet and spray combustion systems will be analyzed     quantitatively.                Now intrusive optical diagnostic techniques are commonly used in study of     gas-phase combustion systems and other reacting flow systems.  These     methods are also being considered for incorporation in active control systems.      However, most such techniques are limited to single-phase systems, making     them unsuitable for many important combustion systems that use liquid fuels.      It is speculated that RHI can overcome this hurdle.",
