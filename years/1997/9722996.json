 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9722996  Warr        The bony fish have immune systems which are similar to those of  higher vertebrates but seem to be less complex.  The channel  catfish is a well developed experimental fish model, and also a  commercially important aquacultured species.  This laboratory has  previously isolated and mapped the gene that encodes the heavy  chain of the major antibody (IgM) of the channel catfish, and the  proposed studies are focused on the mechanisms by which this gene  is expressed.  In this grant they will investigate the nature of  the enhancer that drives transcription of this gene, and the  transcription factors that are essential for the expression of  the gene.  In preliminary experiments they have identified the  catfish transcription factor that bind to the \"octamer: motif  which is characteristic of immunoglobulin genes.  This  transcription factor and the octomer motif to which it binds  appear to have undergone co-evolution.  The catfish oct  transcription factor has a strong functional preference for a  motif that has a different sequence from that found in mammals.  They propose to determine the basis for this preference by  looking at the binding affinity and other protein factors that  bind to DNA. The role of the transcription factor or other  possible transcription factors will also be determined.  These  studies will not only provide information on the regulation of  the catfish immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, but will provide  information on regulation of immunoglobulin genes in general, and  will also indicate how immunoglobulin gene expression has evolved  in vertebrates.  %%%      Studies of the immune system in fish, show similarities and  differences from the immune system of mammals.  Understanding the  relation of the immunoglobulin genes of the catfish, will provide  information on the general regulation of immunoglobulin genes,  and also will enable us to understand how immunoglublin heavy  chain gene expression has evolved in vertebrates.    ***",
