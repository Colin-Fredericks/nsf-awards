The researchers will undertake studies  of the metabolic control of the reproductive system by the  brain: signals, sensors and pathways.  The goal of the  project is to unravel how metabolic signals reflecting  energy state are sensed centrally or peripherally and routed  through neural pathways in the brain to regulate the  specialized neurons which secrete gonadotropin-releasing  hormone, the neuropeptide that controls the entire  reproductive system.    This collaborative research is being driven by fundamental  questions relating to nutrition, growth, and reproductive  activity. The research may lead to determination of the  sensors and pathways by which glucose and Leptin regulate  gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion during development  and adulthood.  Through the exchange of ideas and  technology, this project will broaden our base of basic  knowledge and promote international understanding and  cooperation.  ***",
