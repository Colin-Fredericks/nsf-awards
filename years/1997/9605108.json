 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Graf  The Stony Brook Research Experiences for Undergraduates in  Physics program brings 13 undergraduate students to the  Stony Brook campus each summer for participation in  forefront research in the laboratories of Stony Brook  physics faculty members.  The aim of the program is to  foster interest in, and appreciation of, scientific research  in physics and to facilitate career planning, by the actual  doing of research in a collegial setting, by site visits to  research laboratories at Stony Brook and Brookhaven National  Laboratory, by weekly seminars on current problems in  physics and finally by student presentations of research  results in a formal symposium at the conclusion of the  program.  Outstanding projects will be presented at the  national student symposia.  The program offers research opportunities in the areas of  nuclear physics, particle physics, lasers and optics, solid-  state physics and atmospheric physics.  Most projects are  experimental, but a few are theoretical.  Recruiting efforts concentrate on sophomore and junior level  physics majors of high academic standing, many from colleges  in which research opportunities are limited.  Particular  efforts are made to attract women and students from under-  represented minorities.  ***",
