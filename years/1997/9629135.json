 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9629135    In recent years, much progress has been made in theory behind molecular simulations; it is important to recognize, however, that available methods are still in their infancy and that much more work will be necessary before large scale problems can be addresses.  I am currently developing further the theory behind molecular simulations and implementing novel simulation methods for the study of macromolecules.  I am particularly interested in applying such methods to investigate equilibrium structural and thermodynamic properties of complex macromolecules in confined geometrics, as in porous media, surfaces or as in model biological membranes.  I am also applying such methods to study phase equilibria for both concentrated and dilute polymer solutions, and to investigate at a microscopic level the rheological properties of polymer  melts in simple flows.  These simulations have provided a fundamental understanding of these systems at the atomic level, thereby leading to improved theoretical models and novel engineering applications.    We are currently investigating the mechanisms through which complex, articulated molecules diffuse in fluids and in random media.  To this end, I have developed strochastic methods that try to mimic the motion of flexible molecules through such media.  For several models systems, comparison of the results of the stochastic approach to those of non-equilibrium dynamic simulations have been favorable.    We have also found that mixtures of cryoprotectants can act in a synergetic manner to form improved and unique cryoprotectants.  We have developed molecular models that describe quantitatively these findings, thereby providing much needed guidelines for the selection and design of new cryoprotectant systems.  Our work in this area will have an impact not only in the preservation of living systems, but also in that   of pharmaceutical products.  One of our goals is that of designing room-temperature glasses for long-term storage of proteins and  enzymes.  If that goal is achieved, it will be possible, for example, to store vaccines at room temperature for extended periods of time, thereby facilitating use and distribution in underdeveloped areas where refrigeration is a problem.    A college education must comprise the following elements:  fundamental principles, realistic applications, experimentation, self motivation and independent research.  These elements are not unique to engineering disciplines; they are essential components of any complete educational program.  More than ever, with modern technology and communication systems it is possible to incorporate all of  these aspects of education into our undergraduate and graduate curricula.  I am committed to doing so not only in the department of chemical engineering but also at a campus-wide level.",
