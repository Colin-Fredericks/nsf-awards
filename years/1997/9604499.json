 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604499  Miledi    Understanding how the brain works is, undoubtedly, one of  the major scientific challenges of this century.  This task  is daunting not only by the sheer number of nerve cells that  compose the nervous system, but also by the complexity of  their interactions.  Such interactions are fundamental to  all functions of the brain.  Therefore, it is imperative to  understand fully how nerve cells communicate with one  another in order to comprehend how the brain functions.  Nerve cells (also called neurons) communicate by sending  chemical signals termed neurotransmitters.  The \"sending\"  cell releases neurotransmitter molecules, which act upon  neighboring \"receiving\" cells.  There, neurotransmitters  bind to specialized proteins called receptors.  Neurotransmitters and receptors act much like a key and a  lock: if there is a match, the receptors are activated, and  the neuron is excited or inhibited.  Neurons possess various  types of receptors, each specific for a given  neurotransmitter.  The major type of inhibitory receptor in  the brain is called GABAa, because these receptors recognize  the neurotransmitter GABA.  GABAa receptors are the target  for a great variety of pharmaceutical drugs, including  benzodiazepines and barbiturates.    Recently, a new type of GABA receptor was discovered in the  eye (which is an extension of the brain).  This new type of  receptors, called GABAc, features properties that make it  very distinct from the two other types of GABA receptors  that were known.  Although GABAc receptors recognize GABA,  they are not affected by benzodiazepines or barbiturates,  unlike GABAc receptors.  The aim of this project is to  understand how the GABAc receptor works, by studying how its  molecular structure influences its properties.  This project  will eventually lead to a better understanding of the role  of this receptor in the eye and in the brain.  In addition,  this knowledge could prove very useful to rationally design  new medicinal drugs that target  specifically given types of  GABA receptors.",
