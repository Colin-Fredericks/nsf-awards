 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop a statistical framework for nonlinear signal  processing for communications by using a recent extension of maximum  likelihood estimation, the maximum partial likelihood (MPL) theory.  MPL  allows for dependent and missing observations and sequential processing of  data using only the information that is available at the time of  processing. The inclusion of the dependent data in the framework allows  development of techniques for joint detection and estimation in the  presence of sources and channels with memory, for example to combine  maximum likelihood sequence detection with adaptive equalization. The  proposed research includes development of a new class of real-time adaptive  signal processing algorithms based on MPL estimation by using both gradient  optimization and information-theoretic alternating projections, study of  their statistical and dynamic properties, incorporation of order/complexity  determination into the scheme, and implementations in equalization, joint  equalization and sequence estimation, and variable rate speech coding.    The educatimn goals of the PI are shaped by the commitment to equip the  students with the necessary theoretical and practical facilities to solve  real-world problems; to help them mature into resourceful and creative  engineers who could meet the challenges of a discipline rapidly growing in  complexity. Information on projects in this area and on maximum partial  likelihood research can be found at http://engr.umbc.edu/~adali.",
