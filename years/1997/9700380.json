 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hadji  9700380       The objective of this project is to conduct an analytical study of  the interaction between a growing crystal interface and insoluble  spherical foreign particles. A directional solidification set-up  is considered to study the coupling between the distributions  of temperature and concentrations, fluid flow due to particle  movement, convection, solute segregation, interfacial deformations  and particle presence near the moving interface. The mathematical  model, based on the conservation equations of energy, solute, mass and  momentum, is complemented by a set of appropriate boundary conditions.  The resulting non-dimensional system displays several dimensionless  groupings, all of which have a role in the subsequent analysis.  This will predict the dominant crystal morphology, stability criteria  for interface shape, convection and density advection effects  and  determine the threshold parameter values that separate pushing  and capture of particles. A weakly nonlinear bifurcation analysis  will be used to determine if the theoretical predictions can  be verified experimentally. The methodology requires the use  of perturbation techniques, asymptotic analysis, the bispherical  coordinate system, bifurcation methods  appropriate to weakly nonlinear  analysis, and some numerical methods.         As we approach the twenty-first century, scientists and  technologists are under increasing pressures to satisfy  society's need for materials of lower weight and higher reliability.  For instance, in the aerospace industry, a reduced weight facilitates  an increased payload capacity in flight, operating cost savings, higher  speeds and longer range flights. However, lighter materials need to be  strengthened by the addition of tiny particles of a different  substance. This in turn complicates the manufacturing process.  The final cast should have these particles uniformly distributed  but, in practical terms, this is difficult to achieve. Imperfections  arise due to the migration  of the particles in the melt during  the solidification process, and are detrimental to the quality of the  end product. Some indications of how to overcome these difficulties  have been provided by experimental work. In view of the large number  of processing and physical variables, these partial solutions  are unable to clearly relate the processing history to the constitution  of the cast. There remains the crucial task of quantifying the  influence of the various processing parameters on the final cast,  and this is the aim of our analytical work.",
