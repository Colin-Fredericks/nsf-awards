 "awd_abstract_narration": "Toward  the long term goal of developing computational tools  for  dealing  efficiently with the complexity and the  constraints  of  physical tasks, the research targets the solution of several well  defined  robotics  problems  and the  improved  understanding  of  algorithmic  techniques that are useful for applications  arising  in  the  physical world. The core areas of research  include  the  application  of  randomized methods to  geometric  problems,  the  incorporation of physics-based models and techniques in geometric  frameworks,   and   the  development  of  data   structures   for  storing/searching  geometric data and for  supporting  continuous  motion.  A  few key problems have been identified  to  guide  and  inspire  research in the above domains. These are: assembly  with  emphasis  on  virtual  prototyping  for  maintainability  studies  involving  rigid and flexible parts, path planning  in  cluttered  environments, and manipulation with emphasis on part orientation.  Practical  solutions will be sought for the above problems.   The  proposed   research   plan   thoroughly  integrates   educational  activities at Rice University. The main focus of these activities  will   be   (a)   the  immersion  of  students,  and   especially  undergraduates, into research projects, (b) the introduction of a  course  in robotics and the restructuring of basic theory courses  to include algorithmic techniques that have been proven useful in  graphics  and robotics, (c) the mentoring of women students,  and  (d)  the  promotion of industrial and interdisciplinary  training  for Ph.D. students.",
