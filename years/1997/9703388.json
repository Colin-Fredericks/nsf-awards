The research part of the award  will focus on mesoscopic systems in which electron-electron  interactions play a crucial role.  Analytical and numepical  techniques will be used to study Luttinger liquid effects in  quantum wires and quantum Hall systems, concentrating on  such issues as the coupling to the Fermi liquid reservoirs,  paraconducting effects in inhomogeneous Luttinger liquids,  Luttinger liquid to Fermi liquid crossover, electron-phonon  scattering in Luttinger liquids, AC transport and noise in  inhomogeneous Luttinger liquids and quasi-one-dimensional  effects in strong magnetic fields in the presence of long  range Coulomb interactions.  Mesoscopic superconductivity  will also be investigated.    A special emphasis of the research will be to look at  qualitative features of the effects under consideration.  This part of the research will be incorporated in the  educational activities.  Qualitative methods in physics will  be used as a basis for courses at both the undergraduate and  graduate levels.  These courses will teach students how to  use simple techniques to gain insight to complex physical  phenomena.  %%%  This is a CAREER award which combines theoretical research  with education innovation.  The research part of the award  will focus on mesoscopic systems in which electron-electron  interactions play a crucial role.  Mesoscopic systems are  ones in which various submicroscopic quantum effects become  apparent on size scales of everyday phenomena.  Examples  include many microelectronic devices. Analytical and  numerical techniques will be used to study a variety of  phenomena.   Mesoscopic superconductivity will also be  investigated.    A special emphasis of the research will be to look at  qualitative features of the effects under consideration.  This part of the research will be incorporated in the  educational activities.  Qualitative methods in physics will  b e used as a basis for courses at both the undergraduate and  graduate levels.  These courses will teach students how to  use simple techniques to gain insight to complex physical  phenomena.  ***",
