The IEC attracts scientists from over 40 nations, and it is the only international gathering that brings together scientists interested in all aspects of animal behavior. In addition, since its inception nearly 50 years ago, the IEC has fostered links between animal behavior and related disciplines. Indeed, a major theme of the Vienna conference is identifying and forging connections between traditional fields in animal behavior (e.g. sensory mechanisms, behavioral ecology, development), and related fields, including neurobiology, endocrinology, conservation and evolutionary biology. Over the years, previous NSF travel awards to the IEC have gone to 111 young investigators, many of whom have subsequently become leaders in the field. The IEC is enriched by the participation of outstanding young investigators at the outset of their careers, while colleagues and potential collaborators from around the.world.",
