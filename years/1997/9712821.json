 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712821  Mathiowitz  The aims of this research are to develop a novel  magnetically based system for bioadhesive measurements and  to develop local bioadhesive drug delivery systems, which  provide enhanced bioavailability of therapeutic agents to  treat peptide ulcers.  This research includes the  objectives:  (1) to finalize the development of a new  magnetic method to study bioadhesion between polymeric  microspheres and living tissue, (2) to use this method to  study bioadhesion of drug-delivering spheres to  gastrointestinal tissue, and (3) to track orally  administered microspheres in experimental rats.  The  adhesion forces will be measured by quantifying the magnetic  force required to hold an iron-loaded microsphere  stationary, while the adherent tissue is separated at a  constant rate.  The polymers selected for trial, hydrogels  and thermoplastic polyanhydrides, will be used to  encapsulate and deliver two different drugs, fibroblast  growth factor and platelet derived growth factor, which have  been shown to be useful in the treatment of ulcers.  ***",
