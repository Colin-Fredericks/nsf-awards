The project is directed by  Dorothy Parker, University of Wisconsin and  L.C. Rai, Banaras Hindu University.  This  project will examine the accumulation of toxic  metals by cyanobacteria and cyanobacterial  polysaccharides from Indian waters.  In  addition to having unique metal content, many  Indian ponds are a  biologically-reliable and  environmentally-constant source of the   cyanobacterium Microcystis which adsorbs  specific metal ions.  The research will  contribute to fundamental knowledge on:  cyanobacterial polysaccharides with affinities  for toxic or valuable metals; the role of these  polysaccharides in the cycling or accumulation  of metals in aquatic ecosystems; the range of  extracellular polysaccharides produced by  cyanobacteria from two continents; and the  utility of these polysaccharides in metal-  related biotechnology.         Scope:  This collaboration was initiated by an  INT supported planning visit for Dr. Parker,  plus a sabbatical visit to Baneras Hindu  University.  The collaboration which links two  university research laboratories expands the  capabilities of both groups and  makes it  possible to examine novel questions that  pertain to environmental concerns and  biotechnical applications affecting India and  the U.S.         ***",
