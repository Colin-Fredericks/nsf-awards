 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712081  Wongsaroj, Ben  Florida Memorial College    CISE MII:  FMC/FIU Integrated Dual Engineering and Enhanced Computer Science Program    This proposal supports the development of a plan that integrates the Dual-Degree/Pre-Engineering Program at Florida Memorial College, a historically Black institution, with Florida International University's   Engineering and Computer Science bachelor degree programs.  The endeavour is expected to increase the retention and graduation rates of FMC computer science students by giving them access to FIU's advanced research facilities and of FMC pre-engineering students by allowing them to register for FIU upper-level engineering classes, including computer engineering. Graduates will be positioned for employment after graduation and for entrance into graduate programs at FIU by the enhancement of the computer science and pre-engineering programs at FMC.  The net effect will be to increase the number  of minority computer scientists and engineers in the workforce.    The integration of the programs utilizes strong collaboration between the faculty at FMC and FIU through distance learning, parallel course development, and collaborative computing through the Internet.  Hands-on laboratory exercises and design projects create an exciting and innovative academic environment.  A structured and well-organized management process is being developed through which the responsibilities   of all personnel can be delegated and an attainable schedule for appropriate milestones developed.",
