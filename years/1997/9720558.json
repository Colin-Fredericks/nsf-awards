 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is funded through the Professional Opportunities for  Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program as a  Research/Educational Enhancement Project.    This proposal concerns with  both research and educational  activities in mathematical biology. The research project focuses  on the use of differential equations and dynamical systems theory   to study the role of heterogeneity on the dynamics of infectious  diseases and host-parasite interactions.  Two particular  host-parasite systems are used: the human-tuberculosis   (microparasitic) and the  human-schistosome-snail  (macroparasitic) to highlight the generality of our approaches  in the study of host-parasite interactions. This project will  look at:    the impact that the host heterogeneity in infectivity has on the  coexistence and coevolution of  competing strains of TB --  regular TB and  drug resistant TB strains; the effect that the   long and variable latency period of TB has on the evolution of  parasite virulence;  and to study how control programs of  macroparasites (schistosomiasis) affect parasite genetic  diversity.    In spite of the long and lasting connection among many fields of  mathematics and biology, few students have sufficient training to  work effectively at the interface of these fields. The  educational project centers on introducing courses in  mathematical biology at both undergraduate and graduate levels at  my home institution. Such courses are currently non-existent at  Purdue University. This project consists of developing curricula  for the two courses, preparing lecture notes and designing  research projects suitable for Purdue students, as well as   teaching these courses.  Both courses will be designed for  students majoring in either mathematics or biology. The goal of  these educational activities is to give students  experience in  interdisciplinary studies, as well as in mathematical biology,  thus strengthening their backgrounds and making them more  versatile for employment.    This award  is funded through the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities (OMA).",
