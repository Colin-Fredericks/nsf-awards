The project described  below is being jointly supported by the Divisions of Atmospheric Sciences and Earth Sciences.    This project addresses the environmental occurrence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and its effects in biota. TFA is a product of the atmospheric degradation of certain hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons, which are replacement compounds for chlorofluorocarbons. The primary objectives of this project are: (1) To measure environmental concentrations of TFA in air, wet deposition, dry deposition, surface waters and plants at selected sites downwind from source regions, and to relate them to atmospheric concentrations of the precursor compounds; (2) To determine the uptake and effects of TFA in higher plans and the effects of TFA on microbes representative of seasonal wetlands under controlled exposure conditions. In addition, the experimental data on TFA occurrence and distribution will be compared with modeling efforts carried out at Harvard University. Seasonal wetlands in California and Nevada will be identified which might be particularly susceptible to effects of TFA from buildup over time.   Environmental sampling will include both proximate downwind sites and more remote sites in the Sierra Nevada and Great Basin. TFA will be analyzed as its methyl ester using GC/MS, a technique recently developed by the PI. Controlled exposures of plants to known amounts of TFA will be conducted using misting chambers and long-term hydroponic exposures for selected wetland and crop species. The flux of gaseous and fog-dissolved TFA to and from plant surfaces, and the root uptake and emission of TFA from selected crop and wetland plant species will be measured to determine bioconcentration and toxic effects of TFA. For the microbial study, soils collected from wetland environments will be amended with TFA at several concentrations and the effect on  microbial communities monitored by measuring microbial respiration.",
