Shaw  SUNY Buffalo    Partial travel support will be provided to speakers at the ultrafine particle engineering meeting to be held on May 12-13, 1997, at NSF.  The purpose of the meeting is to bring together selected NSF grantees, and invited guests from NIST and industry to evaluate progress made, the state-of-the-art  and research needs, and promote collaborations among researchers from universities, NIST and industry.  The focus of the meeting will be on synthesis and processing of nanoparticles, their characterization, applications.  There will be about 25 technical presentations, with time left for discussions on research trends and opportunities for collaborations.  The presentations will be published in proceedings, that will be made available to the scientific and engineering community at large.    This conference will increase the dissemination of NSF results, promote collaborations and interdisciplinary synergism paticularly between academic and industrial researchers, and continue the NSF-NIST partnership in the area of nanoparticles and nanostructured materials.",
