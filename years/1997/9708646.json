The research is funded by the  Mathematical and Physical Sciences Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities and the Divisions of Materials  Research, Chemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology, and  Physics.    One aim of the research is to study electrostatic forces  between macro-ions of mixed dimensionality, such as  interactions between charged spheres and planes, and charged  rods and planes.  Under conditions of mixed dimensionality  and opposite charges on the macro-ions, release of  counterions into the solvent by the rod and/or the sphere  produces an unusual entropic mechanism for binding in the  plane.  Adsorption of charged biopolymers onto oppositely  charged lipid membranes by counterion release attraction  will be studied.    A second aim will be to address various deficiencies in  Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory, the main analytical tool  available to describe the electrostatic interactions between  macro-ions.  Whereas PB theory predicts repulsive  interactions between like-charged rods, simulations show  that attractive forces can appear due to counterion  correlation effects.  A theoretical, many-body description  of macro-ion attraction between rods by polyvalent  counterions and by flexible polyelectrolytes will be  undertaken.  In the former case, a linear response approach  will be used to treat the interacting rods as coupled one-  dimension plasmas.  In the latter case, the polymer field  theory of Edwards will be generalized to include  electrostatic effects for this special rod-chain-rod  geometry.  Brownian dynamics simulations of cylindrical  macro-ion interaction with both ordinary polyvalent  counterions and with flexible polyelectrolytes will be done  by Dr. Gronbech-Jensen of UCLA/LANL.    A final aim of the research will be to examine the effects   of intra-bilayer fluidity on binding of macro-ions to  membranes which consist of non-ionic/ionic lipid mixtures.  A new degree of freedom is associated with a variable, and  inhomogeneous, surface charge layer.  Charged biopolymers  bound to such membranes are expected to develop a two-  dimensional variant of the well-known Manning condensation  of charged rods in bulk solvent.  Motivated by experimental  studies of condensates of DNA on cationic membranes, either  with solid support or in stacks, the self-assembly of ionic  amphiphiles in membranes during macro-ion adsorption will be  studied.  %%%  This is a grant to conduct theoretical research to develop  further a fundamental understanding of the electrostatic  interactions in aqueous media between lamellar, cylindrical  and spherical macro-ions.  The research is funded by the  Mathematical and Physical Sciences Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities and the Divisions of Materials  Research, Chemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology, and  Physics.    The study of the electrostatic interactions between large,  macro-ions of various shapes is a challenging problem of  fundamental importance.  It is also a problem of great  practical interest when one realizes that these systems are  also comprised of the biopolymers (DNA) and membranes which  make up living systems.  ***",
