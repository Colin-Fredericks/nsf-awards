 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project integrates computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) into the term projects in four engineering courses:  Computer-Aided Design, Solid Mechanics, Finite Element Analysis, and Capstone Engineering Design.  Students are enthusiastic about conducting term projects in engineering courses, but are often frustrated in their attempts to apply the theories learned in lecture to the practical challenges faced in applied projects.  The frustration stems largely from the simplifications needed to permit isolation of underlying effects, and to facilitate simple closed-form solution of relevant governing equations.  Such simplifications create a gap between theory and practice that engineering students often view as irreconcilable.  The project is bridging this gap by introducing the informed use of numerical methods of CAD and CAE in the four targeted courses.  A 16-seat computer laboratory is being established to accomplish this objective.  The laboratory is being used to teach professional CAD (solid modeling) and CAE (finite element analysis, dynamic simulation, and numerical analysis) software applications through structured exercises conducted under faculty supervision.  Term projects can increase in sophistication each year and build on skills learned in prior years.  Therefore, seniors can enter their capstone course with a range of CAD and CAE skills that they can call upon to conduct their hands-on design projects.    This work can result in the integration of undergraduate engineering project experiences that demonstrate the modern application of engineering science and include all of the challenges of actual engineering design problems.  The outcomes of this work can be presented to the engineering education community and other schools interested in integrating computer-aided engineering analysis into the undergraduate curriculum.  *",
