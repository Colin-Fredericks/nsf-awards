The goal of the experiments is to  provide  critical experimental data to stimulate the  development  of an analog of the Nambu-Eliashberg theory for momentum resolved  spectral  function in systems where the quasiparticle  excitation  is  strongly coupled to collective excitations such as phonons or  spin  fluctuations. Materials of interest are organic  conductors  and superconductors, doped C60, A15 compounds, BiK BiO3, and high  Tc  superconductors. Synchrotron radiation and a UV laser will be  used as the excitation source.  %%%  This  experimental research project uses the technique  of  angle  resolved  photoemission spectroscopy to measure  the  energy  and  crystal  momentum  of characteristic excitations  in  crystalline  specimens  of  materials of current scientific and  technological  interest.  In  this  techniq  light  photons  of  well  specified  direction  (momentum) and energy (wavelength) fall upon  a  clean  surface  of  the  material of interest. The photoelectric  effect  leads  to  emission of electrons from the surface layers  of  the  material.  These photoelectrons are detected in such a  way  that  their  number,  direction and kinetic energy  are  simultaneously  measured.  These  data, making use of principles  of  energy  and  momentum  conservation, allow detailed information to be obtained  on  the  collective excitations of the sample. In this  work  the  materials of interest include several different unusual electonic  conductor, including films of electronically conducting  (alkali-  metal   doped)  carbon-sixty,  and  several  unusual   types   of  superconductors, including a cubic Bismuth Potassium Barium Oxide  and  high  Tc  cuprates. The intent of the  work  is  to  provide  excellent  data  which may permit  theorists to propose  and  test  detailed models for the interaction of electrons in these systems  with  \"collective  modes\" including lattice vibrations  (phonons)  and  spin  waves.  It  is hoped that a theory  analogous  to  the  successful  Nambu-Eliashberg theory for electrons and phonons  in  conventional superconductors such as lead and mercury, might also  be  found  for  these  more  complicated  materials  of  possible  technological    application.   This    research    project    is  interdisciplinary  in nature and involves graduate  students  who  will  be  excellently  trained to enter  positions  in  industry,  government or education.  ***",
