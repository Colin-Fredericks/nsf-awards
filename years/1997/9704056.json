 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9704056  Cappo   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project from Learning in Motion, Inc. proposes to combine cognitive research, mathematics theory, and technology in a CD-ROM for primary mathematics.  Students early success in mathematics depends upon a solid concept of number.  To that end, 'Telling Mathematical Stories' proposes to synthesize four important elements:  1) students' intuitive sense of number and multiple perspectives on number, i.e., transference of conceptual development from number (counting) to weight and volume; 2) sound used to transition from acoustic counting to estimating number; 3) multiple tools to encourage students' own strategies and a move toward formal mathematizing; and 4) experimentation with three-dimensional figures.  Four- cycles of developmental research are planned to test the uses of technology in ways not currently seen.  These include the design, programming, and field testing of:  1) contexts and mathematical objects, 3-D, and sound; 2) models and their visual representation and interface, and 3) 'look ,and feel', character hosts, and features of the 'worlds' that will encourage own productions.  The fourth cycle is a field test of the integrated program.   The commercial potential for a K-2 Math program that combines research on cognition and mathematics with new technology is very high.  Currently, most products are drill and practice and relegated to counting and calculating with symbols.  The proposed product builds students' intuitive sense of number.  It offers multiple model tools, incentives for own productions and communicating mathematics, and new uses of sound and 3-D animation.  ***",
