 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project  probes the nature of psychological representations  of  discourse and applies the results to a computational model of  \"who  knows what\" in text about multiple agents.  Many  kinds  of  inferences and pragmatic effects depend on knowing who has access  to  which  information,  as  well as who  shares  common  ground.  Computational and psychological models of text understanding have  largely  ignored the ramifications of multiple agent  sources  on  the   representation  and  use  of  textual   information.    Our  objectives  are:  A) to examine how people process and  represent  the  distinct  knowledge states of agents depicted or  quoted  in  both constructed and naturally occurring texts, B) to investigate  how  readers'  representations  of  texts  are  affected  by  the  perspectives they bring to these texts, as well as by how sources  are  presented,  and C) to apply these empirical results  to  the  construction   of  a  partly-automated  system  for   extracting,  representing,  and coding \"who knows what\" in a large  corpus  of  naturally  occurring texts - news stories from  The  Wall  Street  Journal.   This  research  will  contribute  to  practical  goals  concerning the modeling and extraction of information  from  text  and  reported speech, as well as to theoretical goals  concerning  how people process and represent texts about multiple agents.",
