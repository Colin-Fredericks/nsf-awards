 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603234  Bina    This award supports a one year collaborative research  project between Professor Craig Bina of Northwestern  University, Professor Fumiko Tajima of the University of  Texas in Austin and Dr. Yoshio Fukao of the Earthquake  Research Institute at the University of Tokyo in Japan.  This project involves a seismological study of the upper  mantle transition  zone associated with the Northwestern  Pacific subduction zones.  The major goal of this project is  to improve the 3-D images produced by tomographic inversion.    The project brings together the efforts of two major  laboratories that have constituted different parts of the  process:  the Americans will produce thermal and bulk  compositional models for the mantle and subduction zone and  the Japanese will correct for residuals and modify the 3-D  travel time inversion code to include travel time data for  later arrivals.  The seismic structure of the upper mantle  transition zone, from 400-700 km depth is of fundamental  importance for understanding the mode of convection within  the Earth's mantle.  Improving the 3-D whole mantle  tomographic models will provide for better understanding of  this structure.  Through the exchange of ideas and  technology, this project will broaden our base of basic  knowledge and promote international understanding and  cooperation.",
