 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9660827  Finzer   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project to be carried out by Key Curriculum Press proposes to prototype and test software tools and curriculum resources for teachers and students to engage in data exploration, collaborative data gathering, and analysis among remote sites.  The new curriculum materials and Internet-based software tools will be integrated with the DataSpace (TM) computer learning environment for data analysis and statistics.  The new software will give learners direct access to data on the Internet, eliminating the downloading and importing processes.  With DataSpace, teachers and students will be able to publish new data sets on the Internet with a defined level of access read, add--to, or modify--by others.  The prototype curriculum materials will provide classroom-based examples of how to use these new capabilities.  Finally, the project will draft standards for storage of data sets on the Internet and begin discussion of such standards among interested organizations.   The proposed research will lead to significant enhancements to the DataSpace Software and additonal curriculum materials, all of which will be of great utility in the rapidly expanding secondary school statistics market.  The new curriculum materials based on networked collaboration and exploration of timely, remote data sets will be very attractive to teachers as they will provide highly motivated methods for teaching mathematics and statistics.  ***",
