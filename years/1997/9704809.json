 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704809  Foster and Stine    The research studies the use of information theory for selecting   statistical models.  The first component of the research characterizes  statistical model selection criteria as methods for data compression.  From this viewpoint, criteria for model selection choose the model   which minimizes the length of a compressed version of the observed   data.  The proposed research will allow one to make these   characterizations precise and to extend this paradigm.  The second   area of research exploits the relationship between model selection   and data compression, leading to methods of adaptive model  selection.  This research builds on and extends context trees which   are the underlying statistical devices used to obtain some of the   most effective data compression algorithms.  The third body of   research concerns the statistical properties of the  information theoretic estimators implied by these techniques. In   order to allow one to estimate such statistical properties from   observed data, the research also seeks to develop practical   bootstrap resampling methods to determine the accuracy of the   statistical estimates.  Each phase of the proposed research   combines statistical theory and  information theory with computing.  In addition to the use of  simulations to validate the proposed   methods, the research will provide publically available software   distributed via the Web that implements the various selection   criteria and associated modeling techniques.  Further numerical   simulations will benchmark the various large sample results,   measuring the practical performance of these procedures.    Given the increasing prevalence of large data sets in science and  economics, traditional statistical model building faces new   challenges.  The use of traditional variable selection methods   lead to overfitting, characterized by overly complex models   that result from chance variation.  This research attacks this   problem in several ways, first by using in formation theory to   construct a common framework in which to study the latest   developments in statistical model identification.  Building on   this framework, the research expands the scope of model selection   to encompass models that can adapt to structural changes.  In   addition, this work develops the associated statistical properties   of these methods, allowing comparison to classical procedures and   practical use in real-world applications.",
