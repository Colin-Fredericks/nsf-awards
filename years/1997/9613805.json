 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient solution to optimization problems is of great  interest and importance in practice and theory.  Unfortunately, many important optimization problems turn out  to be NP-hard, which implies that they do not have efficient  solutions based on current computer techniques.  However,  this does not obviate the need for solving these problems.  Approximation algorithms and heuristic algorithms for these  optimization problems have been studied.  Recent progress in  computational optimization has greatly advanced the  understanding of the approximability of optimization  problems.  In particular, recent study of the SATISFIABILITY  problem (SAT) and the MAXIMUM SATISFIABILITY problem  (MAXSAT) has played an important role in recent advances in  computational optimization.  Motivated by such an exciting  progress in the area, Dr. Jianer Chen from the Department of  Computer Science at Texas A&M University (TAMU) of the  United States of America and Dr. Guillermo Morales-Luna from  the Computer Science Section at the Mexican Research and  Advanced Studies Center of National Polythecnic Insitute  (CINVESTAV_IPN) of Mexico have formed a research team for  performing the U.S.-Mexico collaborative research.  The  primary objectives of this collaboration are: to establish a  long term cooperation among the theoretical computer science  groups in the computer sciences departments of TAMU and  CINVESTAV-IPN; to strengthen the graduate program in  Computer Science in CINVESTAV-IPN, and to increase the  international competence and accomplishments of the  theoretical computer science research group at TAMU; to  develop new techniques for designing better approximation  algorithms and to develop new methods for analyzing existing  approximation algorithms; and to develop a computational  environment for testing and experimenting with approximation  algorithms, in particular, approximation algorithms for  MAXSAT, with special care to examine the efficiency and  approximation factors of the tested algorithms .",
