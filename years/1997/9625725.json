 "awd_abstract_narration": "9625725  Lee    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a prototype confidence-estimator module that can be integrated with real-world neural-network applications.  Reliability of neural nets is affected by (1) input novelty, (2) data consistency, and (3) time-varying system dynamics.  Confidence measures can gauge network reliability by indicating when a neural network's output should be trusted and when periodic retraining should occur in slow time-varying dynamic systems.  Confidence-generation algorithms complement virtually all neural nets and can help their integration into production environments.  Phase II will address confidence algorithms for all reliability factors and a method for scaling and combining confidence measures to generate a single probabilistic value.  Algorithms will be tested on data from an electrolytic chemical process, metal smelting process, a polymer formulation process control, and an artificial control optimization problem for supply-chain inventory management.      A confidence-estimator module potentially can be used in virtually every real-world neural-network solution to improve both the acceptance and performance accuracy.  Commercial applications are expected in process control, finance, retail, insurance, and imaging.  The confidence-estimator module will be useful to 200-300 rapidly expanding companies currently selling neural-network-based products.  ***",
