 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research aims to intestigate models of dialogue that  can  support robust and flexible interaction between  people  and  computer systems.  When computers are used to teach users about a  new  topic  or technique, users may have difficulty understanding  the  knowledge  and  reasoning behind the system's  answers.   To  address   this   difficulty,  this  research   will   specify   a  computational  theory and methods to allow systems  to  vary  the  presentation   of  material  dynamically.    Specifically,   this  project  will address two important research issues.   First,  it  will   provide   a  specification  and  representation   of   the  linguistic,  intentional, and social information  that  influence  people's  understanding of an ongoing dialog and that  allow  for  the  detection of misunderstanding, if it should arise.   Second,  the  research will provide methods for integrating and  employing  these  information sources to produce relevant utterances and  to  identify  and  resolve  communication  problems  as  they  arise.  Evaluation of the approach will employ two tutoring systems  that  are under development: one that explains medical concepts and one  that  teaches  general life skills, such as  good  nutrition  and  budgeting.   Final  evaluation of the proposed research  will  be  based  on testing with end-user populations, runtime performance,  and technical correctness.",
