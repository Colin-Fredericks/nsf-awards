 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main force of the Association for Women in Science (AWIS)    Mentoring Project model stems from its ability to be    replicated nationwide.  With AWIS presentations made    throughout the United States, at a UN Conference on Women in    Beijing, China (1995), in the former Soviet Union, South    Africa, and throughout Europe, this mentoring model has    realized international influence and distinction.  The program    has reached across disciplines with diverse organizations    participating such as Americorps, Association for Women in    Mathematics, U.S. Department of Energy, Iowa Department of    Transportation, and the U.S. Forest Service; corporations such    as Bell Atlantic Foundation or The Scripps Research Institute;    and institutions such as Edmunds Community College, Iowa State    University, and Stanford University.  The strengths of the  nominee include:        .  Have created a national model for attracting female students       into science.    .  Model strategy has been adapted in many institutions.    .  The multi-strength nature of the program.    .  The program has mentored over 6,000 female students since       1990.    In summary, this nomination for the Presidential Awards for  Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring is  an excellent one.  The program has produced numerous written  materials that other institutions/organizations have used to  implement successful mentoring models of their own.  Through its  large scale operation and influence, the AWIS mentoring  project is significantly increasing the number of women  scientists who can in turn be mentors for others just beginning  their training.",
