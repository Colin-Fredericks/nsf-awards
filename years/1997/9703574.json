 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  CTS -9703574    Water Configuration and Transport in Wet \"Unsaturated\" Porous Media     This project is an investigation of the location, surface area, and movement caused by surface tension gradients, of water held in wet \"unsaturated\" porous media.     By \"unsaturated\" is meant a condition where only part of the available pore space is filled with water, the remainder being filled with air or a second fluid.  Examples of the condition are soil above the water table and any other porous solid or particulate material which has been exposed to but is not saturated with moisture.     The necessary surface tension gradients are established by applying surfactants with very specific properties to part  of a wet unsaturated system.  In optimum cases, 80-90% of the water moves.  Previous work has established criteria for surfactant effectiveness and the mechanism through which water movement is effected.  It has led to the first direct experimental means of determining the area of the air-water interface in wet \"unsaturated\" porous media.     The goals of this research are to better understand these systems and to apply this understanding to solution of important technological problems which involve them.  Specific objectives of this accomplishment-based renewal (ABR) proposal are to:  (a) complete development of a model to calculate the air-water interfacial area, (b) determine the kinetics of surfactant spreading and water movement as a function of system saturation, (c) scout for surfactants capable of effecting two phase oil-water transport and (d) investigate water and dissolved solute transport in practical systems.  The model is based on the first application of simulated annealing to determination of surface areas in wet \"unsaturated\" porous media.  The kinetics of surfactant spreading will be followed by radiotracer methods.  The kinetics of water movement will be followed by a new gravimetric technique based on the changes in the center of gravity which occur when water moves withi n a standard column.  Systems to be studied include glass spheres and sand, clay minerals and model soils.  Comparison will be made of the movement of water with and without dissolved electrolytes, and in the presence and absence of an insoluble nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL). Attempts will be made to relate the kinetics of surfactant spreading and water movement to the abnormally high viscosity which has been reported for water near capillary walls.     This study has great potential technological impact.  Results may lead to more efficient drying/de-watering processes in industries where these operations are now conducted with a steam dryer.  The ability to move water in soils by means of a cheap nontoxic and biodegradable \"chemical pump\" has important applications in environmental remediation and in agriculture.  Knowledge of the area of the air-water interface is fundamental to modeling interfacial mass transfer processes, and for understanding oxygen transport in soils.  The surface area model should be applicable to non-aqueous petroleum systems, and to water-oil as well as to the water-air interface, in wet \"unsaturated\" porous media.",
