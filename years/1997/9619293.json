 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues a long-term effort in the area of language  learning,  a  problem of great scientific and applied importance.  The   same formalisms that are used to describe natural languages  such  as English are being applied in a wide range of areas  from  physics  to  biology  enhancing  the  general  applicability   of  results.   A characteristic of these language-like formalisms  is  that  their  learning takes place on both a structural  syntactic  plane  and a semantic plane, and these are both integral  to  the  system.  Although this research started from first principles  in  biology,  linguistics  and computation, intermediate  results  of  practical importance are being produced.  The research now  seeks  to  overcome some of the limitations that have been uncovered  in  the   original   problem  formulation,  using  a  more   utilized  previously.  A  new  approach to meaning representation  involves  active  components,  in combination with the more  static  visual  scenes  previously used.  If successful, this continuing  project  will  provide the first scientifically coherent theory  of  human  concept  formation  and language learning that  covers  the  full  range of essential issues.",
