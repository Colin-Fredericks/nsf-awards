 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701548  Schiffer    This is a CAREER proposal on magnetic materials that are employed  in all facets of modern technology from computer discs to  automobile engines.  In these materials, the magnetic moments  (which can be thought of as microscopic quantum mechanical bar  magnets) interact with each other, and the nature of the  interactions has a profound impact on the material properties.  The proposed research will investigate two classes of magnetic  materials: geometrically frustrated magnets in which the  geometrical placement of the magnetic moments results in a  precisely balanced competition between interactions and colossal  magnetoresistance manganites in which the interaction between the  magnetic moments is closely tied the conduction of electrical  current.  The proposed educational initiative will be the  development of a seminar course in modern condensed matter  physics.  Since standard condensed matter physics courses  typically do not cover the developments of the past three  decades, this course will give students a broad overview of  research areas of current interest.  %%%  The proposed CAREER research will investigate the properties of  novel magnetic materials at low temperatures.  One subject of  research will be geometrically frustrated magnets, in which the  magnetic ions interact antiferromagnetically, but the  interactions are frustrated by the lattice geometry.  Thermodynamic measurements on these systems are planned as a  function of magnetic field, temperature, and non-magnetic  impurity concentration in order to elucidate their novel low  temperature behavior.  A second area of research will be  investigations of the rare-earth manganites which have been  recently shown to display large magnetoresistance.  In particular  the compositional phase diagrams of these materials will be  examined to understand the observed transitions between various  magnetic and electronic phases.  The development of a new course  in modern condensed matter physics is also planned.   The intent  of the course is to expose graduate students and advanced  undergraduates to modern research topics (such as spin glasses,  liquid helium, and high temperature superconductors) which are  typically excluded from standard courses on condensed matter  physics.  ***",
