 "awd_abstract_narration": "The calculus curriculum is being augmented with a series of self contained engineering and scientific modules into the laboratory sections of the first year calculus course. These modules are specifically designed to challenge students and require them to apply basic principles and develop mathematical descriptions of physical systems. These modules are unique in that they will be presented by engineering and scientific faculty with the purpose of demonstrating how calculus is a vital aspect of the curriculum.    The advantage of the proposed approach is that it offers a method to present real applications and be able to accommodate large student to faculty ratios. The exercises associated with each module are designed so that students are required to employ spreadsheets on computers in the resulting analysis. This allows the use of real data (with noise), but it also requires a minimal amount of technological sophistication on the part of the students.    The proposed method is specifically designed to accommodate large student to faculty ratios. While many programs have been designed to introduce applications and modeling to students, a vital component of any addition to the curriculum is the ability to be effectively implemented with a minimal amount of resources. Each module consists of an introduction into a basic physical system and concentrates on the application of a basic principle (for example, conservation of energy or momentum). By design, the modules offer an effective method to present open ended, applied problems and do so with a minimal amount of resources.",
