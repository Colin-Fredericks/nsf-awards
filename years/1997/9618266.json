It has been translated into other languages for use in other countries.  There have been requests to provide a Spanish/English edition to provide Hispanic students a tool to improve their science education, their scientific literacy, and their language skills.  There is evidence that supporting limited English proficient students with both primary and secondary language materials increases their academic understanding.  Professors and teachers of physics fluent in Spanish and in English do the intellectual work of translating narrations and accompanying written materials and supervising the recording and synchronization of the Spanish narrations.   Narrators are chosen by a committee of Spanish speaking high school and university educators to ensure that the accents of the narrators are universally understood.  Distribution will be through the Edgroup Publications.",
