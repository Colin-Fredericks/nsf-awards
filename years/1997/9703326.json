 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703326  Bischof  Uterine fibroids are the most common organ disease in gynecology  and the most common reason for major surgery in women.  Current  treatments include hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus),  myomectomy (surgical removal of the fibroid), and most recently  myolysis (destruction of the fibroid in the body).  The proposed  work will investigate the potential of cryosurgery of the fibroid  or cryomyolysis as a conservative alternative for women who  suffer from fibroids but do not wish to undergo a surgical  operation to remove either the fibroid or their uterus.  The  hypotheses are: 1. The effectiveness of cryomyolysis is due  primarily to vascular injury (damage to the vascular network  nourishing the fibroid) as opposed to direct cellular injury  (damage to the fibroid cells themselves), and 2. The extent of  cellular destruction can be predicted based on the thermal  history imposed on the tissue during cryomyolysis.  By testing  these hypothesis in the specific aims of the proposal, we will be  able to answer the following questions:  How low a temperature  held for what length of time is necessary to destroy single  fibroid cells and tissues?  Is there a difference in the ability  of cryosurgery to destroy the cells and tissues when they are in  the body (in vivo) vs. when they are outside of the body (in  vitro)?  If a difference exists, can it be attributed to a  vascular in injury mechanism inside the body (in vivo)?  And  finally, how does the size of the ice ball that is formed during  the surgery correlate to the amount of tissue destroyed as a  result of the technique?  The answers to these questions are  critical to a thorough understanding of the mechanism of  cryosurgical destruction and, consequently, to the prudent and  effective application of this surgical technique in uterine  fibroids.  ***",
