 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9604233  Curras    The task of the nervous system is to receive, send, process,  store, and retrieve information.  Communication between  neurons are accomplished through electrical and chemical  signals.  Glutamate is a neurotransmitter which serves as a  chemical messenger in transmitting excitatory information  between neuronal connections known as synapses.  It is  released into synaptic space, diffuses across the narrow  gap, and binds to specific protein receptors.  NMDA (N-  methyl-D-aspartate) is a class of glutamate receptor that is  involved in fundamental processes like development of the  brain  and learning and memory as well as brain disorders  such as epilepsy and excitotoxic neurodegeneration.  Recently,  molecular cloning studies have identified five  subunits which can be used to form NMDA receptors.  Dr.Curras is using state-of-the-art electrophysiological,  molecular-pharmacological, and anatomical technology to  first identify the subunit composition in individual neurons  and then to delinate each subunit's contribution to the NMDA  receptor function and NMDA-mediated processes.  She will  examine the NMDA receptor properties in magnocellular  neurosecretory neurons located in the supraoptic nucleus of  the hypothamus.  This brain region produces and releases  vasopressin, an antidiuretic hormone essential for body  water regulation.   Dr. Curras will determine the changes in  subunit expression of these neurons under various  physiological conditions.  These results will  provide novel  information on how specific NMDA receptor phenotypes  contribute to the plasticity displayed by these neurons in  order to adapt to different physiological processes. It will  not only lead to a better general understanding of how  neurons communicate but will help define the relation  between NMDA receptors, neuroendocrine function and  regulation, and water balance.",
