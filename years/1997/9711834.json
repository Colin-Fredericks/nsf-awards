 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research studies the geometric aspects of motion generation  and  control  for  a large class of locomotion systems  involving  cyclic   internal   shape  changes  (often  called   undulatory).  Particular  emphasis is placed on the geometry  and  dynamics  of  robotic  swimming  motions, with models derived  from  the  basic  locomotion  mechanisms found in eels, fish, and paramecia.   This  requires   investigating  continuous  (in  terms  of  shape   and  actuation)  dynamic systems and addressing the associated  design  and control theoretic challenges.  Optimal control theory is also  employed  to  study  both  the  optimality  of  gaits  found   in  biological systems and to design more efficient forms of  aquatic  robotic  locomotion.   Swimming  robotic  mechanisms  offer  many  potential   advantages  over  rotor-driven   devices,   including  increased efficiency, flexibility, and agility, and can  be  used  in  underwater  search and rescue to enter  areas  that  are  not  easily  accessible  by  traditional  vehicles.   In  this   work,  theoretical  results  will be tightly coupled  with  experimental  verification  and  the  development  of  robotic  systems.   This  research  also builds a foundation for future work in areas  such  as  dynamic  analyses  of  biological gaits  and  group  swimming  patterns,  underwater  surveillance  and  detection,  and  micro-  locomotion.   A long-term goal of this research is  to  fabricate  locomotion  devices on the cellular biological scale  using  MEMS  technology.",
