 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recognition of general three-dimensional objects in cluttered  scenes  remains a challenging problem. In particular, the  design  of  a  good  representation suitable to model  large  numbers  of  generic objects that is also robust to occlusion and segmentation  problems,  has been an stumbling block in achieving  success.  In  this  research, a new representation using appearance-based parts  (ABPs)  and   relationships (ABRs) is proposed to overcome  these  problems. ABPs  and ABRs are defined in terms of closed  regions,  segmented  using the Minimum Description Length principle,  whose  appearance  is obtained from collections of images and  compactly  stored  in  a  hierarchical structure of parametric  eigenspaces.  This  new  representation allows the representation of free  form  objects and has several appealing features, namely (1) robustness  to  segmentation  problems, since it is  learned  from  segmented  images; (2) robustness to occlusion steming from the fact that it  is  based  on  parts  rather than on global properties;  and  (3)  ability to handle large object databases, due to its hierarchical  nature.  As  part of this research a probabilistic model  of  the  discriminatory power of the proposed representation will be  also  developed.   This  model  will be used in a  Bayesian  framework,  based  on the PI's previous work, to design a recognition system.  The  new  representation and the associated probabilistic  model,  coupled  with  a   Bayesian  reasoning engine,  will  enable  the  system  to automatically recognize and locate generic objects  in  cluttered  scenes.  The main contributions of this research  are:  (1)  a  new  object representation capable of representing  large  databases  of generic objects that is also robust to segmentation  problems  and  occlusion;  (2)  a  probabilistic  model  of   the  discriminatory  power  of  the  proposed  representation  and   a  recognition  system based on a Bayesian framework that  does  not  require  the  use  o f  ad  hoc heuristics;  and  (3)  a  rigorous  experimental  protocol  to characterize the  performance  of  the  system in the presence of occlusion.",
