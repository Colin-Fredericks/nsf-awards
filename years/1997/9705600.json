 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705600  Waters  Cells lining the airways of the lung protect the lung from  inhaled toxins and harsh environmental conditions.  Maintenance  of this protective barrier depends upon the contacts between the  cells and the re-growth of cells following injury.  The cell  barrier can be injured by oxidative species due to ozone,  cigarette smoke, or infectious agents.  The response of the cells  to such injury and the repair of disruptions in the barrier are  not well understood.  Furthermore, although air flow in the lungs  causes variations in the expansion of the airways, little is  known about the effect of such mechanical strain on airway  function.  This proposal will investigate the maintenance and  repair of the airway cell barrier following oxidant injury.  A  major goal of the proposed work is to develop techniques for the  evaluation of barrier function while cells are mechanically  stretched.  There is currently no method for measuring the  barrier properties of stretched cells.  A novel device will be  used to apply stretch to lung cells grown on elastic membranes.  The barrier properties of the cells will be determined by  measuring the electrical resistance across the cells.  Using this  tissue model, the response of the cells to oxidative damage will  be measured, and the repair of the tissue will be evaluated.  In  addition, factors which may be important in protecting the cells  or in enhancing repair will be investigated.  This will lead to a  better understanding of the injury and repair of the lung.  ***",
