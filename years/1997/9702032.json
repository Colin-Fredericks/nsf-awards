 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fitt  9702032         The majority of reef building corals throughout the tropics contain  high densities of the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium sp.commonly  called zooxanthellae. These algae are vital to the health of the  individual coral colony as well as major contributors to the overall  primary productivity that allows these reefs to flourish in the  oligotrophic waters in which they reside. Recent wide spread bleaching  events, correlated to elevated water temperatures, have occurred world  wide in which corals have lost their zooxanthellae at alarming rates.  While it has been shown that these algae are adversely effected by  elevated temperature, the precise mechanisms of the cellular events that  lead to a loss in photosynthetic ability have yet to be established.         Objectives of this proposal are: (1) to investigate if different  types of zooxanthellae in vitro exhibit differential levels of damage or  protection to specific polypeptides of photosystem II at the biochemical,  translational, and post-transcriptional level, and (2) to determine if  similar processes exist for dinoflagellates living in different hosts that  reside within habitats with different levels of temperature variability.  These mechanisms of damage and protection appear to play a major role in  determining the ecological distribution, as well as the ultimate fate of  algalinvertebrate assemblages during periods of environmentally relevant  stress.",
