 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615023  DeVries  The project includes on-going and new studies on the role of  antifreeze glycopeptides (AFGPs) and peptides (AFPs) in freezing  avoidance of Antarctic fishes in five specific areas:  (1) relationship of severity of environment and association of  ice in fish; (2) the uptake of endogenous ice and its fate;  (3) structure-function of antifreeze proteins including the  molecular mechanism of AP adsorption and inhibition of ice  growth; (4) structures and organizations of AP genes and gene  families and their relationship to protein characteristics and  gene evolution; (5) tissue specificity of AFGP expression.    The extent of exogenous and endogenous ice will be determined for  McMurdo area fishes, which experience the coldest and most  ice-laden waters of the Antarctic region. The severity of the  environment will be investigated by deriving freezing isotherms  from CTD data in McMurdo Sound and waters beneath the McMurdo Ice  Shelf and correlated with physical and biological measurements of  the presence of the ice. Similar experiments will be conducted  for the less severe marine environment of the Antarctic  Peninsular. These studies will correlate freezing extremes with  circulating levels of AFGPs in the fishes associated with these  environments. The uptake of endogenous ice and its fate will be  determined by experimentally introducing labeled ice into the  fish to find out its route of disappearance from the blood and  ultimately its fate. Experiments will be designed to test whether  macrophages can increase solute concentration and \"melt\" or  dissolve ice crystals.    The relationship of AP structure to function will be determined  for some of the eel pout AFPs. Detailed structural information  will be obtained from X-ray crystallography and computer aided  modeling to determine the nature of the lattice match between the  surface polar residues and the water molecules in the ice lattice  on the adsorption plane. A new unique AP will be characterized in  the Antarctic  smelt Pleuragramma antarcticum and its ice crystal  size-dependent antifreeze activity investigated.    Molecular characterizations of AFGP and APP genes and gene  families, and their arrangement in the genome will be carried out  to further our understanding of the genetic parameters governing  gene dosage versus environmental exigency, protein abundance,      complex protein heterogeneity, and the evolution of these gene  families. Cellular and molecular aspects of the expression of  AFGPs in pancreas, the newly discovered major synthetic tissue,  will be investigated.",
