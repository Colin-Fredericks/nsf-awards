 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707571  Steele   In a plant systematic project emphasizing undergraduate involvement at California State University-Hayward, Dr. Kelly Steele is studying the genealogical or phylogenetic relationships among groups of herbaceous legumes in the genera Medicago (alfalfa), Melilotus (sweetclovers), and Trigonella (fenugreek), in collaboration with scientists in Canada and elsewhere in the U.S. Focusing on a representative collection of c. 75 species of these mostly Old World plants, Dr. Steele is emphasizing DNA sequencing of both chloroplast and nuclear genes, to amass evidence of mutational differences between species. In turn, the molecular data will be used, alone and in conjunction with traditional morphological characters for these plants, to construct genealogical or phylogenetic trees for the groups. Work in several laboratories on related legumes provides a tribal level framework in which to nest the results on subtribe Trigonellinae. A phylogeny constructed from independent molecular evidence allows evaluation of the several competing notions on the origin of the coiled fruit types found in Medicago and of the specialized pollinator \"tripping\" mechanism that seems characteristic of certain species in this group.   Species and genus level diversity within the temperate and subtropical tribes of legumes is relatively well known, from generations of taxonomic work on morphology and anatomy. The evolutionary origins of various distinctive features, like fruit types and floral mechanisms, is complicated, however, by the likelihood of parallel or convergent development of similarly looking characteristics, from different ancestral forms. Molecular data from nucleotide sequencing of chloroplast and nuclear genes provide independent evidence of mutational differences between species. Phylogenetic trees constructed from this evidence help in understanding the direction and paths of change in form that accompany speciation and migration.",
