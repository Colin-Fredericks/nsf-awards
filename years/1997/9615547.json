The SIUC collection has been heavily used as a regional resource, and contains unique and valuable materials used in systematic and ecological research and training, and in environmental analysis and monitoring of changes in biodiversity.  The funding for the overall project, clearly, is an excellent example of partnership between the Southern Illinois University and the NSF.
