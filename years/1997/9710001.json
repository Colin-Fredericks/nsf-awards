The novel structures will be formed by  first inducing the growth of certain molecular sieve  crystals and mesoporous ordered channel structures on  modified sensor substrates, followed by encapsulation of  receptor sites into these channels.  Using this approach, it  will be possible to create chemically sensitive  nanostructures on optical fibers that combine unique  chemical selectivity with high stability due to  encapsulation in rigid host cages.  %%%  The focus of this research is on nanoporous films as hosts  for selective chemical sensors derived from assembled  ordered nanostructures composed of optically responsive  receptors encapsulated in thin films of micro- and  mesoporous hosts.
