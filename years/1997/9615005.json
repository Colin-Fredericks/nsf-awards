 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615005  Jain  The present grant is to support the extension of earlier  work by the PI on composite fermion description of the  fractional quantum Hall effect.  More specifically, the PI  has devised a formalism to calculate the wave functions of  the ground as well as the excited states for large systems  using Monte Carlo techniques.  The possibility of  calculations in thermodynamic limit promises a quantitative  understanding of various outstanding experimental issues.  In particular the grant plans to calculate the energy gaps  and collective mode dispersions at general fractions, degree  of polarization including the Zeeman energy, transitions  between the fractional quantum Hall states and a Wigner  crystal and finally the response of a mesoscopic quantum dot  to applied high magnetic fields.  %%%  The subject of fractional quantum Hall effect has been an  active area in recent years, in significant part due to this  PI's discovery of the composite fermion description.  A  serious limitation so far has been that the theoretical  calculations are limited to system of smaller sizes, as  opposed to the experiments which are generally for larger  sizes.  A significant development recently by the PI  suggests possible removal of this limitation.  This grant is  to support calculations of various experimental observable  in the large system limit.  ***",
