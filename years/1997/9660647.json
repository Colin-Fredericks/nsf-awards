The project will amplify the use of resources already established and supported by Federal funds by utilizing plant material obtained through genetic and germplasm stock collections.  These materials will be used to develop experiments with problem-based approaches for teaching and learning various concepts in biology and biotechnology.  The project places emphases on incorporating information and feedback from science educators and strives to maintain consistency with the published aims of major science curricula reform strategies to enable students to develop higher-level critical thinking skills.  The focus of research will be on identifying and testing new plant resources which can be used for problem-based experiment activities.  During the next phase of the project, these activities will be tested at three levels by engage practicing educators in evaluating the performance and reproducibility of experiments outside the research laboratory environment; by evaluating the performance and reproducibility of experiments in classrooms by students; and by assessing the efficacy of prototype experiments for meeting educational objectives.   It is anticipated that this project will help promote a revitalization and renewal of interest in plant-based studies in science education.  Products will include computer interactive plant-based biotechnology education experiments, plants, sees and related reagents, laboratory manual, teacher training workshops, and products for informal science education for the high school and college levels and for technology training.  ***",
