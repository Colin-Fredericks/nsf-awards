 "awd_abstract_narration": "Curricular materials are being developed that complement mathematics courses in the first two years at colleges and universities throughout the nation. The unifying theme of these materials is the subject of inverse problems in the mathematical sciences. All materials are designed to integrate scientific knowledge with mathematical analysis and basic modeling and the units will exploit graphing calculators and modern mathematical software when appropriate. The aim is to provide a seamless blending of mathematical analysis and basic physical principles. The curriculum guide has the goal of providing instructors with tools for kindling physical intuition, fostering model building, encouraging conjecturing, stimulating the application of basic mathematical analysis, and generally promoting critical thinking by their students. The courseware is classified by mathematics course level and cross-indexed by application area and mathematical tools used. It consists of modules of related exercises, projects, and computational experiences, all inspired by (but not necessarily strictly limited to) inverse problems. In addition, software programs are provided in some modules. The material will be widely disseminated in print and electronic forms. A network of undergraduate teachers who took part in the Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement Workshop on the Mathematics of Inverse Problems, the regional Mathematical Association of America special session on Inverse Problems in the Undergraduate Curriculum, or the Mathematical Association of America's Mini-course on Inverse Problems in the Undergraduate Classroom will form the core group for initial distribution and testing of the materials.",
