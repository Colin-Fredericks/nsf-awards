Recent work has demonstrated the   utilization of symbolic dynamics representation of controlled chaotic orbits   for communications with chaotic signal generators. The evolution of   trajectories of a chaotic dynamical system is  equivalent to symbolic   dynamics in an appropriate symbol space.  The recent advent of controlling   chaos using the OGY (Ott, Grebogi, and Yorke) technique and a variety of   targeting algorithms, with physical applications, has demonstrated that   chaos can be mastered, and inherent instabilities can be used as an   advantage in allowing small deliberate perturbations to cause large signal   variations. Coupling control of chaos through small perturbations with   learning the grammar of the corresponding symbol dynamics means that the   control perturbations are actually a coding scheme on the original dynamics.    Controlling symbol dynamics using a map based description of the   dynamics  requires resolution of the following issues: learning the response   of map iterates to variations in the control parameters, learning the semi-  conjugacy, or coding function, between the dynamics of the map on the   attractor and the grammar of the corresponding symbol dynamics, and   finding the minimal grammar which is dependent on the appropriate choice   of  the partition in phase space. In particular, extensions include on-going   work on communicating in higher dimensional dynamical systems.     Investigations include issues of practical noisy environment control versus   bandwidth trade-off and issues of ergodicity,  learning system response to   controls, and symbol dynamics of a chaotic dynamical system which is   known only by time-series embedding of experimental data, and the further   development of practical grammar learning algorithms.    This new field of nonlinear communication theory promises to develop into   a  new paradigm offe ring a  general information transmission technique,   useful to both electronic and optical media, which should find wide   applications in civil and military  communications infrastructures.  A great   deal of recent research in applied and theoretical dynamical systems has   been focused on taking advantage of the fact that a chaotic dynamical   system can be controlled.  The sensitive dependence characteristic of chaos   is actually advantageous to building a highly agile control system in which   a small  deliberate system variations can cause a large response; the so   called ``butterfly effect\" allows us to steer the system responses with   extremely small powered controls.  Ergodic theory tells us that a chaotic   system can be considered as an unlimited information source; and control of   chaos allows us to manipulate this information flow with extremely  low-powered controls.   An example application is  a high-powered signal   generator (e.g. an electronic circuit), which operates intentionally in the   chaotic regime, so that a small-scaled piggy-back controller circuit,  on the   micro-chip scale, has the ability to accurately manipulate high-powered   message bearing signals. This method is in contrast to standard linear   communication techniques, in which a high powered electronic circuit   requires an equally large-scaled switching device to affect the large power   variations required to transmit a high powered message.  Not only is   communicating through control of chaos applicable to one-dimensional   dynamics, as previously demonstrated, but also applies to the more widely   typical class of higher dimensional chaotic dynamics found in nature.    Communicating by control of chaos promises numerous practical   applications including the engineering of new and simple electronic   communications devices, and new and simple optical communications   devices, as well as the modeling of phenomenon in biology, chemistry, and   cognitive science.",
