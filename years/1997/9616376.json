The CUNY Conference is the primary research  meeting of psychologists, linguists, and computer scientists who  study how humans comprehend language.  The special session is  necessary because researchers who study human adult language  comprehension typically have not taken advantage of work  indicating how children learn language.  There is now good  evidence that the way in which language is learned in childhood  affects the way in which it is represented and comprehended  in adults, and so the time is ripe for presentations at the CUNY  meeting.  In addition to offering important insights into the  nature of human capacities for learning and language, a better  understanding of language comprehension in humans may have  important practical applications to computer language  comprehension systems, as well as possible clinical applications  with children or adults with language disabilities.",
