 "awd_abstract_narration": "A previously developed relativistic, separable  potential model of the pion-nucleon system will be extended  to higher energies and to a larger number of coupled  channels, including a photon-nucleon channel.  An exchange  model will be developed as an alternative to the separable  potential model.  These models will be used to calculate  meson-baryon scattering and production processes, properties  of the baryon resonances, and meson photoproduction from  nucleons.       Previously developed one boson exchange models of the  two-nucleon system will be extended by including other  exchange processes, and by allowing for coupling to nucleon  delta and delta-delta states.  Inclusion of this coupling  will make it possible to account for inelastic processes.  Various schemes for calculating the electromagnetic form  factors of the deuteron will be investigated, with  particular attention paid to the restrictions imposed by  relativity and gauge invariance.       Calculations on the three-nucleon system will be  carried out using invariant three-nucleon mass operators  constructed from two-nucleon mass operators.  Such  calculations lead to results for the three-nucleon bound  states and scattering amplitudes which satisfy the  requirements of relativity, and therefore make it possible  to study relativistic effects in the three-nucleon system.",
