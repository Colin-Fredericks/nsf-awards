 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nevai              Abstract    Nevai plans to continue his research in  approximation theory, orthogonal polynomials, and related areas of   analysis involving various extremal problems, ordinary and   generalized polynomial inequalities, difference and differential   equations, spectral theory of real, complex, and matrix-valued   Jacobi, Hessenberg, and banded matrices, Toeplitz and Hankel forms,   and Hilbert space operators.  In addition, he will continue  working on his \"Orthogonal Polynomials\" software project in   Mathematica and on numerical aspects of orthogonal polynomials.   The primary focus of his research will be concentrated on three  areas: orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle and on arcs of   the unit circle, generalized polynomials and polynomial inequalities,   and linear difference equations and growth of their solutions.        Approximation theory and orthogonal polynomials form an essential   part of mathematical analysis in the sense that (i) they provide   theoretical foundations for real life applications of various   results in \"pure\" mathematics, and that (ii) they yield a natural   bridge between theory and practice. The extraordinary usefulness   of orthogonal polynomials stems from the facts that  among others    (i) they are easily computable by a stable three term recursion   formula, (ii) they are a natural medium for expanding  \"general\" functions into well behaved series, and that (iii) their   zeros are especially suitable for interplation and quadrature   processes. Quadrature processes enable one to evaluate very   complicated expressions involving integrals with high degree of   precision. The primary subject of this proposal, that is, extensions   of Szego's theory of orthogonal polynomials, is  especially useful for theses purposes. The proposer hopes to   find efficient methods with solid theoretical foundations.",
