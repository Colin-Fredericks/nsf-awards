This equipment will support research projects in image/video processing and compression, and transmission over wired and wireless networks.  Additional image and video communication equipment will be acquired to support research projects on channel characterization, performance analysis and simulation for image and video communication.    NJIT, Princeton University and Rutgers University are founding partners of a recently established New Jersey Center for Multimedia Research (NJCMR).  NJCMR has been designated as a Research Excellence Center by the New Jersey State Commission of Science and Technology with a funding level of over $1 million per year for the coming 5 years.  The MRI-funded equipment will form part of a new laboratory for Multimedia Signal Processing and Communication to support research projects within this Research Excellence Center.    NJIT has a leading position in the State as a distance learning provider and the requested equipment will also be used to support multimedia technologies research and their application for educational and learning environments, as well as in advanced-level graduate course work on multimedia signal-processing, compression and communication.",
