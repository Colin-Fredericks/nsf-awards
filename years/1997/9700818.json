Unfortunately, the cost of facilities  for producing these devices has also increased exponentially,  and although the market for devices has grown rapidly, it has  not grown exponentially.  Thus we are rapidly approaching the  time when facilities for new generations of conventional  devices may be too expensive to build.  In the past it seemed  that novel devices could not compete with conventional ones.  However, the economic limitation to future fabrication  facilities provides a new motivation for research into  classes of devices that may have cost advantages.  Single-  electron devices may be one of these classes.  Whereas single-  electron devices have, in the past, operated only at very low  temperatures, recent reports of operation near room  temperature bring useful applications much closer to reality.    This project builds upon past work at MIT in which it was  discovered that when a transistor is made very small it  behaves in an unusual way.  Whereas a conventional transistor  turns on only once as electrons are added to it, and whereas  such a transistor requires the addition of about 103  electrons to change from the off-state to the on-state, the  new transistor turns on and off again every time an electron  is added to it.  The single electron transistor is made by  isolating a very small droplet of electrons in such a way  that electrons can move into and out of the droplet only by  quantum mechanical tunneling.  The MIT work has shown that  such a transistor behaves like an artificial atom, in that  the number of electrons in the droplet and the energy are  both quantized.    The transistors made so far have used the semiconductor GaAs  with metal electrodes on the surface, patterned using  electron-beam lithography, to confine the droplet of  electrons.  Beca use the electrons in such GaAs structures are  typically 100nm below the surface, the droplet of electrons  has typically been ~100nm in radius r.  The energy for adding  an extra electron to the droplet scales like r-1, and this  limits single electron operation to temperatures below ~1K  for r=100nm.  The goal of this project is to explore ways of  increasing the operating temperature of single electron  transistors and to better understand their physics.  In  particular, the MIT group has recently discovered a series of  phase transitions in the droplet of electrons confined in the  artificial atom at high magnetic fields.  The acquisition of  a higher-field magnet and dedicated refrigerator are proposed  here to study these phase transitions further.  %%%  New artificial atoms will be fabricated using Si instead of  GaAs.  Since the electrons in these devices can be as close  as 5nm from the surface, much smaller droplets and,  consequently, much higher energy and temperature scales are  expected.  The devices will be fabricated in collaboration  with MIT Lincoln Laboratory using the outstanding electron-  beam and optical lithography capability developed there under  Air Force sponsorship.  In this way, the effect of the NSF  funds will be strongly amplified.  In addition to higher  operating temperatures, Si offers the advantage that single  electron devices can be easily integrated with conventional  ones.  It is expected that single electron devices in Si can  be made to operate well above liquid nitrogen temperature.  Higher magnetic fields are required for the study of the  state of electrons in these smaller structures.    It is also proposed to fabricate devices in GaAs in which the  droplets of electrons will be smaller.  This will be  accomplished by growing structures in which the electrons are  closer to the surface.  A collaboration has been established  with the Weizmann Institute in Israel where the expertise in  making such structures has already been developed. Like the  col laboration with Lincoln Laboratory, this amplifies the  impact of NSF funding.    Single electron devices have the advantage that they can be  capacitively coupled.  It has been proposed that, because of  this, an array of such devices may function as an associative  memory.  That is, any set of input voltages close to, but not  exactly equal to, a special set will give the same output.  It is proposed that such an array be fabricated and studied.  Although the first such memories will be read-only,  understanding their physics may lead to ways of writing as  well.  ***",
