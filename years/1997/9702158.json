Diatoms are one of  the  most  abundant  groups of aquatic eukaryotic  microorganisms  found in nature, with a wide distribution in both marine and  freshwater  habitats.   Due to their  dominance  in  oceanic  upwelling zones and in regions over the continental shelves,  diatoms  play a critical role both in generating the earth's  oxygen  and  in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  The research described in this CAREER project is designed to  dissect,  at a molecular level, how marine diatoms  perceive  and  respond to environmental change.  Environmental  stress  frequently  induces a transition from essentially \"immortal\"  vegetative  growth  to the terminally differentiated  sexual  stages.   The  change  in patterns of gene  expression  that  accompanies this transition will be identified.  The methods  and  logic  of  molecular genetics will also be incorporated  into a graduate course on the use of molecular techniques to  address  ecological questions and an undergraduate fieldwork  and  research  course.  Additionally,  a  short,  \"hands-on\"  laboratory  course  on  the use of molecular  techniques  to  study  marine  organisms will be provided  for  high  school  teachers.",
