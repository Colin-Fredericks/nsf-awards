The students will work on projects involving 1) programming tools for parallel and distributed systems, 2) high-performance solutions for scientific and engineering problems, and 3) high-performance solutions for medical sciences.  Substantial effort is placed on recruiting minority students and students from non-research institutions with at least 50% of the students from undergraduate institutions or community colleges in the Detroit Metropolitan area.  A special feature of the project is that the students work with industrial research mentors during their second year.  Student growth and the fostering of independence in research is encouraged through regular guidance, including weekly discussions and thorough evaluations of objectives and summaries of work accomplished.  A cooperative learning system, whereby students provide constructive criticism to improve work of other students, is also employed.",
