 "awd_abstract_narration": "To stimulate interest and activity in mathematical  research,  the National Science   Foundation each year supports a number  of NSF-CBMS Regional  Research Conferences   in the Mathematical Sciences.  Each five-day conference features  a distinguished lecturer   who delivers  ten lectures on a topic of important current  research in one sharply  focused   area of the mathematical sciences.  The lecturer subsequently  prepares an expository   monograph based upon these lectures, which is  normally published  by the American   Mathematical Society or the Society  for Industrial and Applied  Mathematics, or jointly by   the American  Statistical Association and the Institute of  Mathematical Statistics.  Certain   features differentiate these conferences from typical research  conferences.  These are: (1)   Focus on a single important and timely area  of research by a  leading practitioner, (2)   Continued effect and local  stimulation through regional emphasis,  (3) Panel review for   quality,  breadth, and timeliness, and (4) Published monographs  for a wider  audience.  This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research  Conference in the   Mathematical Sciences on the Numerical Analysis of  Hamiltonian Differential Equations to be held June 2-6, 1997  at Colorado School of Mines.  Professor J. M. Sanz-Serna of Universidad  de Valladolid will be the principal  lecturer.",
