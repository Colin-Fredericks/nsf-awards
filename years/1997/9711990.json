 "awd_abstract_narration": "9711990  Wang  There are two major goals for the research work proposed: (1) design, microfabricate, and test a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pump which can be used for pumping electrically conductive fluids; (2) design, microfabricate, and test a power relay using a MHD pump for switching actuation and liquid metals, such as mercury, as the conducting medium.    The MHD micropump to be developed can be integrated with any of the commonly used chemical and biological sensing techniques and may have significant applications in various biomedical and chemical analyses.  It can be used to directly deliver electrically conductive fluids. For samples with very low conductivity, or even non-conductive samples, a \"carrier liquid\" with higher electric conductivity can be used as is commonly practiced in capillary electrophoresis.  Advantages of a MHD micropump include: no moving parts; reduced risk of failure due to mechanical fatigue; relatively simple fabrication, and therefore potentially lower cost; reduced risk of clogging and damage to molecular material being pumped; potential for remote or tele-operation by control of an applied external magnetic field; potential for massive parallelization for rapid processing.  The advantages of a MHD actuated power relay using a liquid metal, such as mercury, as a conducting medium include: high current capacity, high off-resistance, low on-resistance, low power consumption, and high dielectric strength, and elimination of spark corrosion. The downside with using mercury is toxicity and handling.  Specifically, the research work in this proposal focuses on the following two key areas:    Characterization of the magnetohydrodynarnic effect and its applications in micropumping and switching applications.  The magnetohydrodynamic principle has been applied for pumping liquid metals, as well as in various acoustic transducers and flow sensing applications.  However, almost all of the previous studies and applications have concentrated in macro-systems.  Different pro blems may be faced when the principle is applied to micropumping and sensing.  Effects such as surface tension and friction may become important factors.  Fundamental dynamic and static modeling and experimental research will be carried out in order to fully understand and develop guidelines for optimal designs of MHD-based Microsystems.    Suitable microfabrication processes for the proposed MHD micropump/relay will be developed and documented.  Thorough experimental studies will be conducted on the micropump/relay to be developed and compared with the dynamic and static modeling results.  Based on the test results, guidelines for the optimal design and fabrication of MHD micropump/relay will be developed.  ***",
