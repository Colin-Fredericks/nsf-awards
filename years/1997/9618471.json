Funds from NSF will be used to partially support costs of  travel, accommodations and registration fees for graduate students  and post-doctoral fellows from U.S. Universities to attend the  conference.  The International Congress on High Speed Photography  and Photonics is the primary international forum for exchange of  the latest knowledge about high speed photography and photonics.   NSF, due to its involvement in both education and in fundamental  research in photonics and imaging, supports this grant to enable  graduate students and post-doctoral fellows to attend the 22nd  International Congress on High Speed Photography and Photonics.  ***",
