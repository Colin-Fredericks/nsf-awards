A  central  interest  of   the   researchers  participating  in this workshop is the commercialization  of  new  technology based on superconductivity.  %%%  This  grant  supports  a US/Japan Workshop  on  High  Temperature  Superconductivity, which is a two day meeting of leading academic  and  industrial  researchers with an interest in applications  of  high   temperature  superconductivity.  Technical  knowledge   is  shared, along with information on the status of projects in those  firms  in  the  US  and  Japan  which  will  lead  to  commercial  technological products based on superconductivity.  Some  of  the  product   areas   are   filters  and   related   components   for  communications  and particularly cellular telephones;  wires  for  use  in magnets, for power transmission, for energy storage,  and  for   motors  and  generators;  medical  applications   including  magnetocardiography and magnetoencephalograpy based on  sensitive  magnetic   field   sensors   of   the   Superconducting   Quantum  Interference Device (SQUID) category; and digital devices such as  fast switches for communication systems.  ***",
