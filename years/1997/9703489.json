 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wollkind  9703489       The investigator and his colleagues organize a three day  Workshop on mathematical biology at Washington State University.  The workshop is interdisciplinary and should be a focal point for  the meeting of theoretical and experimental scientists of  numerous backgrounds, especially from the Pacific Northwest  region.  An important emphasis is attracting young scientists to  attend the workshop, and providing them a fertile ground for open  communication with senior scientists on topics at the cutting  edge of theoretical and mathematical biology.  Because of the  geographical location, young scientists from eastern Washington,  Idaho, and Montana very rarely get such opportunities for open  discussions with experienced researchers.  Similar workshops have  been held regularly since 1991.  In these workshops, topics have  ranged from developmental biology and medicine to ecology and  epidemiology.  In many instances, the informal contacts made at  these workshops proved valuable in forming new research  collaborations.       There has been a recent surge of interest in the use of  quantitative mathematical approaches to understand better the  exceedingly complex phenomena exhibited by living organisms.  To  further this goal, the investigator and colleagues organize a  workshop in mathematical biology.  The workshop is  interdisciplinary, attracting researchers with both theoretical  (mathematicians, geneticists , physicists, physical chemists) and  experimental (biologists, biochemists, epidemiologists,  ecologists) backgrounds.  Contributed papers and discussion focus  on ways in which quantitative, theoretical, and experimental  methods can be combined to augment each other in an effort to  explain more fully specific problems arising from areas such as  developmental biology, medicine, ecology, and epidemiology.  An  important emphasis is attracting young scientists (recent Ph.D.'s  and graduate students) to attend the workshop, and in providing  them a fertile ground  for direct communication with senior  scientists on topics at the cutting edge of theoretical and  mathematical biology.  Given their geographical location, young  scientists from eastern Washington, Idaho, and Montana very  rarely get such opportunities for open discussions with  experienced researchers.  Similar workshops have been held  regularly since 1991.  In many instances, the informal contacts  made at these workshops have proved valuable in forming new  research collaborations.",
