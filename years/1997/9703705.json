 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT      Richards      Richards will continue his program of research on  hypergeometric functions defined on matrix spaces and on  symmetric cones.  Special attention will be paid to the theory of  operator-valued hypergeometric functions on the symmetric cones.  In the second part of the project the principal investigator  will continue his research on applications of these special  functions, and general techniques in harmonic analysis and  representation theory, to the areas of multivariate statistics,  total positivity, probability inequalities, and related  combinatorial problems.       Richards is interested in research problems Modern Analysis, a   subfield of mathematics, for two reasons. First, Modern Analysis   is an important branch of mathematics with fundamental links to   astronomy, chemistry, physics, statistics, as well as to other   areas of mathematics.  Richards primary expertise in Modern Analysis   is in the study of new classes of hypergeometric functions which  generalize the classical theory developed by Euler, Gauss, Bessel,   Ramanujan and many other famous scientists. Second, the principal   investigator is interested in these new types of hypergeometric   functions because of their fundamental importance in multivariate   statistics.  The research program will study these new hypergeometric   functions and their properties with the aim of finding solutions   to unsolved statistical problems which are of importance to applied   researchers in medical and environmental fields.",
