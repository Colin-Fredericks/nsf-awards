 "awd_abstract_narration": "Even apparently simple tasks like reaching for an object involve the simultaneous graded activation of a large number of joints and muscles.  This project investigates the principles that underlie the generation of such multi-joint movements, and how perceptual information guides these actions.  Whereas many of the current theoretical approaches are limited to either rhythmic or discrete movements, this project will develop an integrated framework that encompasses both movement types and therefore can be applied to complex movements.  The investigation will proceed in three interrelated directions.  First, theoretical work will develop a model for movement generation on the basis of a network of coupled dynamic systems.  Second, experiments with human subjects will study the specific features of movement trajectories in tasks involving multi-joint arm movements.  Third, the model will be used to synthesize movements of a human-like robot arm in order to compare these model-driven movements with the movements of the human participants.  In this way the model's validity and robustness will be tested in a real physical environment.  In addition to increasing our basic understanding of complex movement generation the results should be applicable to the control of artificial devices such as robotic systems or limb prostheses, and may also contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of movement disorders.",
