 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing a model for curriculum reform that focuses on problem-solving and real world applications in introductory mathematics at two-year colleges. The courses of focus are college algebra and statistics, two courses of great importance for the technical workforce. Three objectives are being accomplished: 1) revision of the mathematics curriculum, incorporating work-based experiences technology, an interactive learning environment, and traditional curriculum development activities; 2) expansion of faculty dialogue throughout the mathematics community (secondary, two- and four-year postsecondary); and 3) provision of faculty development opportunities to support collaborative teaching methodology, student engagement in learning, and curriculum development. Methods used to accomplish these objectives include: 1) interaction with local businesses and industries through site visits, shadowing, and internship opportunities; 2) participation in professional development activities to increase teamwork and interaction; 3) increase in understanding of learning styles, collaborative learning, and use of technology as a tool for problem-solving; and 4) team efforts to develop, pilot, refine, and implement new teaching methods, work-based problems, and student interaction. Diaries of math applications in the workplace are being kept by faculty participants as they visit, shadow, and intern with local businesses and industries. Teaching portfolios are being developed by faculty participants for dissemination, detailing the types of learning activities and methodologies introduced into classes, what was successful and why, and students' reactions.",
