 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many commercial database products and application tools are  beginning to support data replication to provide ready  access to data in distributed, mobile, and disconnected  environments. Most of these systems have chosen to use  asynchronous replication schemes in which updates to  replicas are not synchronized. Although these schemes  perform reasonably well for single object updates (i.e.,  environments such as file-systems), they are not suitable  when a single update involves multiple objects (i.e.,  transactional environments). This project investigates the  benefits of using synchronous and asynchronous broadcast  mechanisms for managing replicated databases. Broadcast  primitives, viz., reliable broadcast, causal broadcast, and  atomic broadcast, will be used to design new protocols for  synchronous replication.  In synchronous replication,  transactions accessing replicated data are synchronized with  other transactions in the system.  In asynchronous  replication, transactions execute locally and other means  are used to disseminate their effects globally as well as to  detect and correct inconsistencies.  The epidemic model of  communication will be used as the transport mechanism here.  Pessimistic as well as optimistic replication protocols will  be developed to maintain replicas asynchronously. Finally, a  simulation framework will be developed to evaluate the  protocols for synchronous and asynchronous replication.",
