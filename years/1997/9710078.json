 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710078  A formal software architecture specification makes the analysis,  design, and construction of a complex system intellectually  tractable by characterizing the system at a high level of  abstraction. This project focuses on revealing defects in the  dynamic interaction and communication behavior of system  components through testing techniques applied at the  architectural level. While testing has historically concentrated  on the implementation as the target of inquiry, this research  instead considers the architectural specification of the  system as the target. There are five major contributions to  software architecture and software testing technology arising  from this research. First, a set of architecture-based  integration test criteria are defined to provide requirements for  testing architectural aspects of a system; methods are also  developed for applying these criteria to architectural styles and  domain-specific architectures. Second, methods are developed for  testing an implementation in terms of its conformance to a  specified architecture via architecture conformance oracles.  Third, architecture-level slicing techniques are defined for  localizing architectural defects and minimizing regression  testing. Fourth, methods are developed for using feature tests  to discover the architecture of a system from its implementation.  In addition, various approaches to formal architecture  specification are evaluated with respect to their suitability to  testing technologies.  ***",
