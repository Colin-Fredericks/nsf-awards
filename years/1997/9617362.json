 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617362  Bandy     The objectives of this study are to develop and test instrumentation for determining dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) with a lower limit of detection of 1 part-per-trillion-by-volume (pptv) with a signal to noise ratio of 3 at a sample frequency of 1 per second.  The approach to be employed will be based on atmospheric pressure ionization quadrupole mass spectrometry (APIMS).  Positive ion APIMS for DMS, DMSO, and DMSO2 and negative ion APIMS for SO2 have been demonstrated in the laboratory.  The APIMS instruments will be based on Extrel Mass Spectrometry quadrupole systems, which have many years of field use in the investigator's previous projects.     The accuracy and precision of these APIMS instruments will be substantially enhanced by using isotopically labelled variants of the analytes as internal standards that have been deployed in the past using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry with isotopically labelled standards (GC/MS/ILS).  Using this approach the precision and accuracy of the instrument are independent of the instrument sensitivity and other factors, such as, analyte loss in sampling.  Furthermore, because the signal from the standard is available for each sample and the concentration of the standard is known, the instrument sensitivity and lower limit of detection can be precisely computed for each sample.     To validate this new instrumental approach for field measurements of these sulfur compounds in ambient air, the APIMS instruments will be intercompared to an existing GC/MS/ILS instrument, which was a part of the NASA-CITE-3 and NSF-GASIE evaluations.  To minimize the cost of the proposed work the mass spectrometers on hand will be used to build and deploy the APIMS for field tests.  This will require some modification to laboratory instruments to attain airworthiness standards in safety and operation.  The end goal is to achieve measurement times 200-4000 times faster than the curr ent GC/MS techniques for this suite of sulfur compounds.  These new instruments will be much smaller, lighter, and consume lower power for high altitude aircraft use.     If initial field tests with the single quad APIMS indicate that interferences are significant, a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer will be employed to further evaluate the ion chemistry for the required analyte specificity.  Successful tests of the APIMS for initial field measurements of these sulfur compounds will be followed by development of an APIMS for eddy correlation measurements of DMS fluxes in regions where significant DMS levels occur.",
