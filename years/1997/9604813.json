The major objectives of this planning visit  will be  to gain insight on the stratigraphic sequence of  marine shell beds and seabird guano deposits exposed on the  coast and in the Atacama Desert.  Small samples of marine  vertebrates and invertebrates from selected stratigraphic  units within these deposits will be collected to determine  their significance for future investigation.  The visit will  allow the establishment of professional relationships  between U.S. and Chilean scientists and initiation of a long-  term research program that will benefit researchers and  their students in both countries.    Climate on the west coast of South America fluctuates  considerably today under the influence of shifting ocean  currents and temperatures from the El Nino Southern  Oscillation (ENSO) events. The impact of these events not  only affects human responses to the environment, but also  the entire marine ecosystem.  The planned project will be to  document the long-term climatic record in this dynamic  region in an effort to determine how climate change has  influenced marine communities and faunal turnover.  ***",
