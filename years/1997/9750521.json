 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biology Department is implementing experiential learning in anatomy and physiology through the use of computers and other digital technology.  The new equipment, coupled with an on-line laboratory manual and Internet access in the laboratories, allow both major and nonmajor biology students to explore physiological and anatomical concepts in both supervised and independent laboratory experiences.    The equipment is used to meet two identified curricular needs.  The first need is for students to become active participants in physiological experiments by using computer interfaces to record, compare, and analyze data.  A single MacLab station has been used with great success; however, it has been limited to instructor demonstrations.  Four new mobile computer workstations, each equipped with digital data acquisition technology, can be used in conjunction with an on-line laboratory manual to allow students to have hands-on experience in physiological investigation.  The second need is for students to have the ability to learn sophisticated anatomical relationships by using a computer-based anatomical package and digital camera to capture, modify, and link three-dimensional anatomical images and to record dissections.  Students are able to compare homologous structures from representatives of multiple taxa.  The equipment also allows biology faculty to help students link form and function in physiology and anatomy courses.    The project greatly enriches introductory-level courses for nonmajors, many of whom are preservice teachers.  By modeling computer-enhanced instruction and experiential learning for preservice teachers, the project has a significant impact on science teaching at the K 12 level.  It also allows biology majors to do more sophisticated senior research projects in physiology and anatomy.",
