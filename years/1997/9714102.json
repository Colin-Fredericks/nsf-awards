 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714102  This project sponsors a Workshop on Higher-Order Operational  Techniques in Semantics (HOOTS II) held at Stanford during  December 8-12, 1997. The workshop provides an opportunity  for researchers working on various techniques based on  operational semantics for reasoning about higher-order  programs to work together to gain an in-depth understanding  of the full spectrum of existing techniques, including those  outside their immediate area of expertise. The workshop  builds on the preliminary exchange of ideas promoted by  HOOTS I, which took place at the Isaac Newton Institute for  Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge, England, October 1995.  The structure is that of a working meeting rather than a  forum for presenting technical papers and includes a mix of  activities. The workshop will result in progress towards a  richer and more elegant framework for operational techniques  to a wider range of languages using combined expertise of  the participants in diverse areas of specialization.  ***",
