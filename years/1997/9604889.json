 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604889  Zinsmaier    The signaling pathway of depolarization-dependent  neurotransmitter release is a product of trafficking  synaptic vesicles through repeated cycles of secretion,  membrane recycling, and vesicle genesis. Each stage of this  cycle requires the cooperative action of proteins. This  proposal  studies the cysteine-string protein (csp)  intrinsic to synaptic vesicles.  The loss of csp protein in  Drosophila mutants progressively reduces evoked  transmitter  release at higher temperatures, but not spontaneous release.  Such a failure of neurotransmitter release in csp mutants  could be due to a  defect at any stage of the vesicle cycle.  To gain a better understanding of  csp function this  proposal will determine which stage of the vesicle cycle  requires csp function by imaging the dynamics of the  synaptic vesicle cycle in the csp mutant flies.    From earlier studies it has been proposed, that csp might  serve as a cofactor to catalytically recruit an unknown  protein to cooperate protein  interactions critical for  evoked neurotransmitter release. To explore this working  hypothesis the proposal plans to identify protein domains of  csp  which are critical for its function by genetic  engineering. In addition, a strategy has been designed to  determine the molecular components that interact with csp  combining the purification of interacting proteins and the  isolation of mutations interacting with the csp mutation.  The  identification of critical parts of the csp protein and  its interacting partners will provide the basis to develop  more specific ideas to directly  elucidate csp function.  Given the numerous signaling pathways conserved from flies  to mammals, Drosophila will serve as a model system to  illuminate basic mechanisms of normal and abnormal synaptic  transmission.",
