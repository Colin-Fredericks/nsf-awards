 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marden   9722196         Insects constitute roughly two thirds of all known  species. Their unparalleled evolutionary success, as well  as their economic impact, appears to derive from their  ability to move rapidly over large distances in three  dimensional space, i.e. their ability to fly. This proposal  will investigate how flight evolved in insects. One of the  primary challenges for evolutionary biology is to determine  how complex traits, such as flight, evolved through a  series of intermediate stages. Without evidence for  advantageous intermediate stages, the only alternative  explanation is that some form of macro-mutation produced a  flight-capable animal de nova. Such an explanation strains  credulity given that flight depends on an exceedingly  complex interplay of wings, nerves, and muscles that simply  could not arise by chance. Thus, the critical task is to  identify possible intermediate stages of wing-propelled  locomotion that serve a beneficial purpose and present an  opportunity for progressive natural selection. Such a  system has been identified in stoneflies (Plecoptera), a  primitive group of insects that use wing propelled  locomotion to sail or flap their way across water surfaces.  This project will construct a DNA based phylogeny (a  \"family tree\") to determine how surface skimming, flight,  and wing structure in stoneflies has changed over their  evolutionary history.      Preliminary work on this project has been widely  publicized in print, radio, and television media, as its  significance and implications are readily grasped by the  general public. An episode of the public television series,  Scientific American Frontiers, presented this work to an  audience of over 1 million school children, followed by an  email question/answer forum with the scientists involved.  The ongoing work will continue to provide a highly visible  example of how modern biologists ask questions and seek  answers regarding evolutionary riddles that are central to  the history of life on  earth.",
