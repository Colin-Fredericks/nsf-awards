 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with algorithmic problems  relevant to the design, maintenance, and management of high  speed communication networks.  High-speed integrated  communication networks are going to be the most important  communication platform of the future, presenting new  technological challenges. The essence of many of these  technological problems is the interactability of certain  simple network problems, such as routing and packet  scheduling.  The research is concerned with developing fast  and simple approximation algorithms for these combinatorial  problems.  Such algorithms can serve as tools for  successfully answering these challenges.  Some of the more  promising approaches will be tested on real network data.  Designing efficient methods to get packets of information  across a communication network is one of the main problems  in implementing Broadband Integrated Services Digital  Network(BISDN) standards, such as ATM (Asynchronous Transfer  Mode).  The packet routing problem is simply that of moving  packets in a communication network from their sources to  their desired destinations quickly, reliably, and using as  few resources as possible.  A solution to this problem  consists of two distinct (though by no means independent )  parts:  a selection of paths for the packets (routing) and a  schedule of the motion of packets along their selected paths  (packet switching).  The main thrust of the research is on  the two basic algorithmic issues:  routing and packet  switching.  The combinatorial essence of many real-life  routing problems is the disjoint paths problem.  Research  directions for the routing problem include both off-line and  online problems with worse-case, and competitive analysis,  respectively.",
