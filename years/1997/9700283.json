 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, a new threat model has been discovered which can  be used to break many existing cryptographic protocols.  The  threat is based on the fact that certain hardware may be  induced to perform miscalculations. This scenario is  applicable to tamper proof devices which can be made to  miscalculate by operating them in an extreme physical  environment.  The possibility of attacking various  cryptographic protocols using hardware faults raises many  interesting open problems.  First, it now becomes desirable  to construct efficient schemes which are resistant to  attacks using hardware faults.  The project will develop the  theory necessary to prove the fault resistance of certain  schemes. Other cryptographic schemes will be analyzed to  determine whether they are susceptible to the new attack.  The hardness of factoring integers is a standard  cryptographic assumption.  Various mathematical implications  of this assumption will be studied.  The previous results  show that the hardness of factoring implies that polynomials  having many roots in low algebraic extensions of the  rationals are hard to evaluate.  Generally speaking,  criteria for when polynomials are hard to evaluate are  useful in many applications. Further applications of the  hardness of factoring will be studied. Specifically, the  goal is to construct new classes of polynomials which  are hard to evaluate, unless factoring is easy.  There are  several such candidates, for example, certain polynomials  which generate Galois extensions over the rationals.  Estimating the difficulty of evaluating certain polynomials  based on the type of number fields they generate is a  promising area of research.  Such results will hopefully  shed light on the complexity of evaluating polynomials.***",
