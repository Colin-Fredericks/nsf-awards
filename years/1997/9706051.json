 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706051  Smith    Siliciclastic detritus in a sedimentary basin follows a path from a weathering profile, to the hillslope system, to the fluvial system, and finally to the basin depositional environment.  The stratigraphy and sedimentology of a sedimentary basin are the net result of the complex steps along this path and they record the effects of exogenic forces including climate, tectonics, and rock type on surficial processes.  The sedimentological literature is rich with interpretations of the stratigraphic record in terms of tectonic processes.  In contrast, Quaternary scientists generally interpret Quaternary stratigraphy in terms of climatically-driven hydrologic changes.  Resolution of the relative roles of tectonics and of tectonics and climate in the stratigraphic record can only be addressed if the climatically-induced variability in the hillslope processes that produce and deliver detritus to the sedimentary basin are understood.   The proposed research has been stimulated by unprecedented field observations, in a tectonically quiesent setting, of hillslope deposits that can be traced with confidence laterally into Neogene lacustrine deposits or remain as relict Pliocene and Pleistocene features on the landscape.  We propose to combine sedimentologic and geomorphic approaches in the study of these deposits with the hypothesis that significant climatically-controlled variations in the production and transport of hillslope sediment are evident and that the Neogene and Quaternary records of hillslope sedimentation can be compared and contrasted.  This will be accomplished through detailed analysis of the stratigraphy, sedimentary petrology, and sedimentary structure of buried and relict hillslope deposits and their correlative proximal piedmont deposits, along with the study of Quaternary stratigraphy and soil-landscape associations.  Results will significantly bridge and benefit both disciplines and fill a gap in our understanding of how hillslope and fluvial systems have been linked  and have varied with climate over the past 12 million years.",
