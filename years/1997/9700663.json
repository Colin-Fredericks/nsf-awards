 "awd_abstract_narration": "The detailed understanding of the mechanisms of action of extreme  pressure lubricant additives is the focus of the research of this  project supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program.  Professor Tysoe at the University of Wisconsin-  Milwaukee investigates these questions by using a combination of  ultra high vacuum surface spectroscopic measurements, thin film  growth studies, and tribological investigations of model systems.   Building on the understanding of chlorine containing extreme  pressure lubricant additives developed previously in this  laboratory, this project explores the mechanisms of action of  sulfur and phosphorous containing additives.   A connection  between the surface chemistry of these materials and their  operation as lubricants is sought in this work.  A detailed  microscopic understanding of tribological processes is of  considerable utility in a number of technologically important  areas, including metalworking, disk head lubrication, and the  transportation industries.  Understanding the atomic level processes occurring when one  material slides over another in the presence of a lubricant  molecule is the focus of the research of this project.  A  combination of surface spectroscopic studies and direct measures  of friction forces for a series of model lubricant molecules will  provide this understanding.  Friction and wear is a relatively  underexplored area of surface science, and the work of this  project will contribute to our growing understanding of this  technologically important area.",
