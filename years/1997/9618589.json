 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Tobin J. Marks, Department of Chemistry, Northwestern University, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of   the Chemistry Division for a study of the organometallic chemistry of the   f-elements (actinides and lanthanides), and closely related early   transition metals. The goal of the project is to design, characterize,   and understand from a structural, mechanistic, and thermodynamic sense   novel stoichiometric and catalytic transformations involving f-element   organometallic molecules. The project consists of four closely   interconnected components:(1) Titration calorimetry will be utilized to   quantify the strengths of metal-ligand multiple bonds, of bonds involving   `zero-valent` f-element complexes, of bonds involving heavier groups   14-16 ligands, and to firmly `anchor` existing bond energy data   compilations on an absolute scale; (2)  The scope and mechanism of   organolanthanide/organoactinide-catalyzed reactions in which element-H   bonds are added to unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds will be determined,   with focus being concentrated on thermodynamic feasible hydroamination,   hydrophosphination, hydroboration, and hydrothiolation reactions; (3) The   properties of chiral lanthanide and actinide complexes having C1   symmetric ligation will be investigated with respect to structure,   stereochemical integrity, and efficacy in enantioselective catalytic   transformations of the types described in (2); and (4)   organolanthanide-catalyzed chain transfer reactions in which olefin   polymerization is coupled to element-H/metal-C transposition processes   will utilized to produce a series of heteroatom `end-capped` polyolefins,   and unusual polyolefins in which methylene units are directly appended to   polymer backbones.  Transformations involving organometallic compounds are of central   importance to numerous areas of U.S. industrial chemistry, including   catalytic processes for the production of fuels, polymeric materials,   pharmaceuticals, and other economically important chemicals. Developments   in this area are crucial to the development of ever more efficient,   selective, environmentally benign, and economically competitive process   technologies. This project focuses on the lanthanides and actinides. The   organometallic chemistry of these elements has until recently been   relatively unexplored, and there is growing interest in their application   in polymerization catalysis and organic synthesis. The goal of this   project is to effect, characterize, and understand unusual and   potentially useful transformations involving f-element organometallic   molecules.",
