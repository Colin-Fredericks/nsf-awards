 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    9612148          Hwu        The aim of this research is to explore a new class of extended solids that contain nanosize,  transition-metal-oxide frameworks and to investigate the behavior of the delocalized electrons  of oxide-bridged, transition-metal (TM) magnetic centers in a confined lattice. The  anticipated structures consist of TM-oxide chains (wires), layers (sheets) and oligomers (dots)  that are structurally separated and electronically isolated by closed-shell, non-magnetic  oxyanions, i.e., silicates, phosphates and arsenates. Efforts in exploratory synthesis will  focus on (1) homologous series containing sheets and wires of rutile and perovskite  frameworks and (2) silicate compounds containing nanosize frameworks of late TM oxides.  Molten-salt methods, using alkali and/or alkaline-earth metal halides, will be employed, since  it is a proven technique for the crystal growth of these refractory oxides. Compound  characterizations will be directed toward understanding the bond strength, spin-spin and  spin-lattice interactions, band structures, and the onset of metallic properties associated with  finite TM-oxide structures. This proposed research is significant because the anticipated  TM-oxide fragments with different lengths and geometries will provide a library of structural  models for studying the behavior of the delocalized electrons in a confined space. Also,  compounds containing TM-oxide frameworks with finite structures may possess novel  electronic and/or magnetic properties, which are incompatible with the properties of extended  oxides and will be of both scientific and technological interest. Finally, the research outlined  in this proposal will provide invaluable fundamental knowledge necessary to continue  advancing technology for materials that are of electronic and magnetic importance.   %%%    Recent advances in technology and the need for new materials in device applications have  driven the rapid growth of solid-state science. Understanding fundamen tal parameters that  govern the performance of a material has played a crucial role in every area of this  multi-disciplinary science, which includes solid-state chemistry and physics, as well as  interdisciplinary areas such as electrical and materials science engineering. Solid-state  chemistry is concerned with the synthesis of materials with extended structures and their  related properties. The variety and complexity of these solids' structures, and the evaluation  of the factors that influence and control structural and physical properties, are the elements  that have made solid-state chemistry a dynamic area of study. As a result, attempts to modify  known structures and explore new ones with novel properties are made with the aim of  revealing parameters that may be used to fine tune the physical properties and to ultimately  synthesize the desired materials.  Currently, the ability to predict the composition and  structure for extended solids is not yet possible and synthetic discoveries that have led to  landmark advances in solid-state science have nearly always been made through exploratory  synthesis, rather than by design. The research outlined in this proposal will provide  invaluable fundamental knowledge necessary to continue advancing technology for materials  that are of electronic and magnetic importance. The aim is to explore new class of extended  solids that contain nanosize, transition-metal-oxide frameworks.",
