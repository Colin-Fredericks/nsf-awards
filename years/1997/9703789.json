 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703789    Randrianantoanina    The proposer intends to focus on two lines of research:  (1) Banach space structures of C*-algebras and related spaces;  (2) studies of vector-valued function spaces. In (1), he will  study some connections between the two fields: Banach space theory and   operator algebra theory. The primary goal of this direction of   research is to show that some classical results from  Banach space theory and harmonic analysis are still valid  for the non-commutative setting. One important direction is the   investigation of symmetric spaces of measurable operators  associated with semi finite von Neumann algebras. The basic   permanence question is whether or not a given property  can be preserved from a given function space to its non  commutative version. For instance, the classification  of (non commutative) spaces of finite  type (respectively  of finite cotype) is not known; there is the question of  which spaces have the Radon-Nikodym properties  associated with Riesz-subsets of a given  discrete group. Another direction is the study of  non commutative Hardy spaces associated with maximal finite  subdiagonal algebras of finite von Neumann algebras. For  example, it is unknown if Szego's theorem from classical   analysis is valid for the general non commutative setting.  It is still open if the predual of such maximal subalgebras  are of finite cotype. The same kind of investigation will  also be considered for non commutative Hardy spaces and the  non commutative disc algebras introduced by Popescu.  Our knowledge of Banach space structures of non commutative  C*-algebras (despite some recent intensive studies) is  still less than satisfactory; the proposer also will  tackle some of the questions that arise naturally from the   classical case. For instance, the behavior of different classes  of bounded operators on C*-algebras are far from being well  understood. Several intermediate results, such as   factorizations of absolutely summing operators and   compactness of  absolutely summing operators, were already   obtained, hinting that in general non commutative C*-algebras  should behave (in many ways) like their commutative counterparts.  The main motivation for this part is that certain  problems related to these algebras become more transparent  when formulated in Banach space language. Part (2) can  be viewed as close connections between measure theory  and Banach space theory. Many questions remain unresolved  on permanence properties preserved by Bochner spaces.  The proposer will concentrate on properties of spaces  containing classical function spaces, uniqueness of   preduals, and strong regularity.     The purpose of this project is to improve the understanding  of the connections between different field of analysis:  Banach space theory, harmonic analysis, and operator algebra  theory. C*-algebras turn out to be one of the most  important structures in mathematics. They have significant  applications to other parts of sciences (for examples,  mathematical physics, geometry, quantum mechanics), so it   is important to view them from many different angles.",
