 "awd_abstract_narration": "White  9701018  Bacteria that are growing in biofilms form a relatively stable community that may greatly affect bioremediation rate in situ, perhaps more than bacteria in the bulk phase.  However, microbial activity of biofilm bacteria, as well as the bioavaliability o metal contaminatants, remain difficult areas to study.  Biofilm communities are complex mixtures of many species, both culturable and non-culturable, and the composition of the biofilm communities to metal ions spatially and temporally.  We will study the response of biofilm communities to metal ions (mercury and chromium) by constructing bioeporter strains for these two metals.  Expression of the bioreporter genes indicates that the metal is bioavailable, and that the bacteria are actively producing gene products to detoxify.    We have produced bioreporter strains that bioluminesce in the presence of mercury.  We have further modified this strain to encode a gene for Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which is an extremely bright fluorescent molecule.  Individual cells expressing this protein can be found using our sensitive photodetection equipment.  We will use this strain in a flow cell biofilm formation apparatus, following the bacteria with both fluorescence and bioluminescence detectors.  The biofilm community will be established under laboratory conditions using groundwater from a contaminated site.  We will incorporate the bioreporter bacteria and track their establishment using their fluorescence.  The continued presence of the cells, and their number, will be established using the fluorescence bioreporter. The same technique will be applied to bacteria that reduce chromium.  The mercury reduction (mer) genes are highly conserved, and we will use tis advantage to detect mer genes in the biofilm population.  Sensitive molecular techniques, such as in situ PCR for detecting mercury reducers, and in situ Reverse Transcriptase PCR for detecting activity from mer reducers, will be employed for comparison to results form light  measurements.  The results of these experiments will give a more definite assessment of biofilm bioremediationrates under in situ conditions.",
