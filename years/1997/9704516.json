Steen A. Andersson                          Indiana University            (together with David Madigan, Michael. D. Perlman,            and Thomas. S.  Richardson, University of Washington)                                 ABSTRACT     Graphical Markov models (GMM) and the closely related structural   equation models (SEM) use graphs (= path diagrams), either   undirected, directed, or mixed, to represent multivariate   dependencies among stochastic variables in an economical and   computationally efficient manner. A GMM or SEM is constructed by   specifying local dependencies for each variable (= node of the   graph) in terms of its immediate neighbors, parents, or both, yet   can represent a highly varied and complex system of multivariate   dependencies by means of the global structure of the graph.   Nonetheless, the local specification permits efficiencies in   modeling, inference, and probabilistic calculations. This research  involves the development of more complex and comprehensive classes  of GMMs and SEMs, determination of the mathematical structure of   these (extremely vast) classes, and the development of more   efficient statistical and computational algorithms for the   discovery and analysis of appropriate models within these classes  for specific real-world applications.     Among their many applications, GMMs have become prevalent in   statistical science for the analysis of categorical data in   contingency tables, for the modeling of spatially-dependent   processes such as the spread of epidemics in human and animal   populations, and for the development of early warning systems   for severe weather conditions; in computer science (as Bayesian   networks) for information processing and retrieval, for robotics,  computer vision, and pattern recognition, for the debugging of   complex  programs (such as Windows 95), and for the representation  of expert systems for medical diagnosis; and in decision science  (as influence diagrams) as models for information flow and control  and for combining the opinions of many decision-makers. SEMs have  long been used in fields such as genetics, sociology, econometrics,  and psychometrics as networks for representing the structure of   complex causal systems. A crucial feature of all these models is   that they are designed for fast computational implementation,  thereby facilitating the development of software that can \"reason\"  about real world problems.
