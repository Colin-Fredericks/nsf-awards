 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brooklyn College of The City University of New York is the recipient of ARI funds for the renovation of the science building, Ingersoll Hall.  Constructed 59 years ago and never renovated,  the structure is home to the Departments of Biology and Geology.  This  project is the second phase of the College's renovation effort to improve research facilities focusing on environmental science. Specifically research laboratories in the Geology Department, devoted to the study of clay minerals and of benthic invertebrate ecology and paleoecology will be renovated to help link the functioning of the Aquatics Institute and Environmental Sciences laboratory.  The bridge will  provide a basis for mounting a unified research position within both departments with respect to important  local and national environmental issues.  This linkage will also improve the departments' research position in the more traditional areas of paleobiology and clay mineralogy.   Renovations include modernizing three laboratories by upgrading electrical and plumbing services,  installing new fume hoods, and replacing lab benches with new ones.  An old preparation room will be converted into a clean room, and the rock and sediment processing lab will be upgraded.  Once completed,  the renovated space will contain aquarium facilities for investigating Hudson River benthic ecology; areas for cleaning, preparation, study, and storage of invertebrate specimens and sediments; and a satellite room housing computer and analytic tools. This project accomplishes several goals: 1) provides an infrastructure for novel research interconnections between geologists and biologists; 2) improves effectiveness and efficiency of research; 3) provides facilities needed to support studies on Hudson River benthic environments: and 4) consolidates the ability to support meaningful graduate student research and research training.  Located in an urban setting, the institution serves a large population of minority students. Providing first class research  facilities for such students constitutes an effective means of attracting the best of these students, promoting higher quality, and ensuring their competitiveness in the evolving marketplace in the earth and environmental sciences.",
