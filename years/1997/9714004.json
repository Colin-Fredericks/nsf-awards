 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Turtle Cove Environmental Research Station has become an  important focus for research and educational programs on the  Lake Pontchartrain system. Use of the facility has increased  dramatically in recent years and Turtle Cove has reached a  significant stage in its development, where facility demands  exceed available resources.  Plans are being developed for  construction of new facilities to enhance the mission and  scope of Turtle Cove by providing additional research  and educational laboratories, housing for students and  scientists, supporting facilities such as docking and boat  storage, and complementary on-campus facilities.  However,  several questions remain regarding how construction should  be prioritized, how educational and research programs  should progress, how the facility should be administered,  and what activities should be emphasized. Wetlands acreage  (approximately 324 hectares or 800 acres) has been donated  to Turtle Cove recently and plans need to be developed for  the potential use and incorporation of such lands into  programs at the research station.  Therefore a planning  workshop, to be held in February, 1998, is will address  these and other questions, and will develop long-term plans  for development of the station.  In addition support will be  provided  for data management training for the station data  manager. Such training in automated monitoring of weather  and water quality data, and the proper archiving  procedures for such data will improve the long-term data set  being generated by the station.  The proposed planning  process should help to insure that Turtle Cove will reach  its goal to become a nationally recognized center for  environmental education and research in low-salinity  estuarine environments.",
