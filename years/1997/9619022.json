Produced under the guidance of a National Advisory Board the tapes  will feature an open exploration of what good teachers are doing  implementing hands-on, inquiry based instructional materials such  as FOSS, Insights and Science and Technology for Children (STC).    The full \"Investigating Classrooms\" library will be comprised of an  introductory videotape to orient the viewer to the nature and use  of the collection as a whole, three classroom tapes for each of 4  units covering grades K-2, 3-4, and 5-6.  A taped professional  development session to model the use of the library will allow for  inservice training.  A tape giving a summary of significant issues,  focusing on the nature and the value of current reform efforts in  the field, will be prepared for use with administrators, parents  and community groups.  Companion print materials will include a  comprehensive guidebook which provides an overview, background and  analysis.  In addition tapes will be prepared for use with the LSC  Core Evaluation.  These tapes will cover a conversation between  experts involved in a discussion of ratings of classroom  observations using the instrument designed by Horizon Research.    The request is for $1,601,413.",
