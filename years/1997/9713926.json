 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with an active control of offroad  wheeled vehicles. An effective control of the force  distribution in these systems, particularly the control of all  the wheel-terrain contact forces, is central to achieving  acceptable control of the motion and suspension degrees of  freedom of these vehicles. On uneven terrain, wheeled vehicles  possess kinematic and quasi-static force distribution  characteristics that are fundamentally different from those  that vehicles possess on even terrain. If the vehicle-terrain  combination are instantaneously treated as a spatial linkage  with closed kinematic loops, an even terrain leads to an  inherent symmetry in these virtual spatial linkeage. This  symmetry leads to singularities in kinematic and static force  distribution behavior of these vehicles. The literature on  conventional vehicles for even surface operation does not  address these singularities since these vehicles are nominally  studied as planar motion machines with small perturbations in  their suspension degrees of freedom. Motion and suspension are  generally treated as decoupled  problems. On uneven terrain,  the symmetry and hence the singularities are not always  present. Using a kinematic-geometric framework based on screw  system theory, an understanding of the mobility (number of  degrees of freedom) and the motion potential (available motion)  of wheeled vehicles on uneven terrain is developed. This  framework can also be used to study the force distribution  characteristics of these vehicles by extending the rate  kinematics/static force analysis duality that has been observed  in classical problems in robotics to these kinds of spatial  mechanisms. The kinematic-geometric framework is particularly  suited for studying  active off-road vehicles since their  system designs typically do not include intentional passive  compliances (lumped or distributed). An extension of the  kinematic-geometric approach to rigid body dynamics of complex  systems, known as spatial vector mechanics is used to study the  dynamic behavior of these offroad vehicles. The project  includes both the `analytical/numerical' and `experimental'  aspects. The analytical/ numerical objectives include the  development of a Spatial Vector Mechanics (SVM) framework that  combines Screw System Theory and Newrton-Euler Dynamics using  Spatial Vector Notation. The SVM framework allows the  investigation in an integrated manner; to develop general  kinematic synthesis techniques for active off-road wheeled  vehicles; to develop a modular dynamic simulator for performing  numerical studies of two classes of wheeled vehicles; and to  develop system-level force control strategies for active off  road vehicles. The experimental task include off-road  experiments with an experimental prototype known as the Force  controlled Tricycle (FCT). The FCT is representative of a class  of active vehicles that include two-wheel axles that can  actively vary their axle lengths.",
