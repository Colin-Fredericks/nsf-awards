These goals are to create a  quantitative, predictive understanding of the following: (1)  the effects which ternary solute additions in Al--Mg  materials have on the solute-drag creep deformation  mechanism; (2) the nucleation and growth of cavities during  solute-drag creep as a function of particulate content and  solute chemistry; and (3) the tensile ductility in materials  subjected to deformation by solute--drag creep through a  better understanding of the mechanisms of necking and  cavitation, which govern ductility.  The CAREER educational  activities consist of four fundamental goals, as follows:  (1) a unique instructional approach for undergraduates in  the mechanical behavior of materials by incorporating  lectures on materials theory with hands-on laboratory  activities; (2) unique graduate courses in the mechanical  behavior of various classes of materials which utilize  research experience and data as educational examples; (3)  incorporation of undergraduate students into scientific and  engineering research as a significant enhancement to their  educations; and (4) the scientific education of high-school  students through association with existing mentoring,  outreach, and University programs.  %%%  Success of this research activity is expected to have  significant long-term effects in manufacturing.  The  creation of economical, enhanced-ductility aluminum alloys  will significantly decrease the price of superplastic  forming as a manufacturing alternative.  ***",
