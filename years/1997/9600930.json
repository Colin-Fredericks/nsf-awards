 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will integrate innovation in teaching with important basic research on  vocal  cord function in human speech.  The research component of the project will examine the ways in which  linguistic phrasing--position in a sentence, differences in sentence structure, etc.--affects the  quality of sounds, particularly the way the vocal cords move, during speech.  Many previous studies  have not given adequate attention to the possible effects that differences in sentence structure could  have on the timing of articulator movements for speech.  As a result, important generalizations may  have been missed about the way that variations in vocal cord function are used in the world s  languages.  This project will be one of the first large scale research studies which combines careful  control  of linguistic phrasing with carefully planned cross-language comparisons of vocal cord  position and movement during speech production.  The result of the research will be a clearer  understanding of the similarities and differences between languages in speech production.       The similarities between languages will further our understanding of the innate common linguistic  abilities of all humans.  The differences will make clearer some of the speech production skills which  must be acquired by individuals learning a new language.  The teaching portion of the project involves  developing a new curriculum for basic education  in  phonetics, using the research results as the core  of a laboratory-centered course.   Students will develop basic skills in speech acoustics and  physiology by collecting their own data  on vocal cord function, its coordination with other speech  articulators, its acoustic manifestations, etc., and comparing their data with that of the larger  corpus generated in  the research portion of the project.  By participating in analysis of data  pertinent to current research questions in the field, students will gain first hand knowledge of how  scientific methods are applied t o the study of human language, and they will have a more active    and collaborative educational experience.",
