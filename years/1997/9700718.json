Little is known about the chemistry of leaf surfaces and how  variation in surface-chemical profiles is related to host  selection by insects. The goal of this project is to examine the  leaf-surface chemistry of a single plant species (Daucus carota)  with particular reference to compounds already identified as  oviposition stimulants for one of its specialist insect herbivores  (Papilio polyxenes). Plant surfaces will be extracted with a  combination of chloroform and near-boiling water, and the  resulting extracts fractionated and analyzed using high  performance liquid chromatography. The project will include: (1)  comparisons of the surface-chemical profiles of leaves differing  in age, form, life history and genotype; (2) comparisons of the  surface-chemical profiles of plants differing in acceptability as  oviposition substrates; and (3) comparisons of larval performance  on plant genotypes differing in oviposition acceptability. These  experiments should determine the extent to which leaf-surface  chemical variation is correlated with oviposition preferences of  an insect species and subsequent larval performance. This research  will reveal whether chemical signals on leaf surfaces can serve as  keys for recognition of quality host sites by ovipositing female  butterflies.",
