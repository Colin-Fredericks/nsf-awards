 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705453  Redline    The Science Museum of Minnesota will develop \"After the Dinosaurs\",  an exhibit that will feature a detailed reconstruction of the  ecology of a Paleocene subtropical environment that existed in the  North Plains of North America (58 million years ago).  Information  presented in the exhibit will come from a 25 year research project  carried out by SMM curator Bruce R. Erickson and his colleagues at  Wannagan Creek Quarry in northwestern North Dakota.  This research  has yielded one of the most complete assemblages of Paleocene  megafossils in North America.  Both the increased knowledge gained  from this research and process of the research will be highlighted  in this exhibit.  Visitors will learn that the world's landscape  has changed considerably over time, the analysis of fossils helps  scientists reconstruct the past, knowledge of former ecosystems  help us to understand current ecosystems, and everyone can be a  scientific investigator when we attempt to understand our  environment in a systematic way.  Two versions of the exhibit will  be prepared: a 4000 sq. ft. permanent version that will be  installed in the new SMM river front building and will open in late  2000.  There will also be a 2500 sq. ft. traveling version that  will begin its national tour in 2002.  Complementary programming  will include an on-line interactive teacher guide and student  project curriculum, a teachers' institute, and a variety of youth  programming including specially developed interpreter training  materials.  The exhibit will be accessible to people with  disabilities.",
