 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712543  WHARTON    Parasitic Hymenoptera (wasps) are extraordinarily diverse, containing some 70,000 described species, but comparatively poorly known taxonomically despite their importance in understanding terrestrial ecosystems.  Virtually all parasitic Hymenoptera are parasitoids of other insects and many are quite host-specific.  They are therefore essential components in the complex food webs of natural ecosystems and they provide a valuable source of natural enemies for pest insects in managed ecosystems.  Improved taxonomy and more natural classifications of parasitic wasps will enable better characterization  and management of biological diversity, and it will directly support research directed at a more sustainable agriculture with fewer negative impacts on the environment.    This research, by Robert A. Wharton, James B. Wooley and colleagues, will provide comprehensive taxonomic monographs in four key groups of parasitic Hymenoptera.  The project will address taxonomic needs in four families representing four major lineages (superfamilies) of parasitic Hymenoptera: 1) Braconidae (superfamily Ichneumonoidea), 2) Encyrtidae (superfamily Chalcidoidea), 3) Eucoilidae (superfamily Cynipoidea), and 4) Diapriidae (superfamily Proctotrupoidea).  Specific objectives are to produce worldwide monographic treatments of key genera in each of these families, treating nearly 1000 species.  Four Ph.D. students will be trained in the course of the project, one in each major lineage to be addressed.  The collaborative nature of the project (including specialists from four different countries) will provide exceptionally broad training and experience for the students in all aspects of modern, collection-based  systematics research.  Training will emphasize taxonomic methodology at the species-level, including computer/video-aided image analysis, and computer databasing of character data as well as host and locality data.",
