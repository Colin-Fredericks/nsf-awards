In order to conduct a unified   analysis of correlated categorical data, this research uses a   very rich class of scale mixtures of multivariate normal (SMMVN)   link functions. The SMMVN-links include multivariate probit,   Student's t links, logit, symmetric stable link, and many others.  The main focus of this research is to develop a complete exact   small sample Bayesian analysis of correlated categorical responses,   which involves prior elicitation, model comparisons (in particular,   choices of link functions), model diagnostics, and variable   selection. Various efficient computational algorithms are developed   by using sampling-based methods (e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo).   This research also includes extensions which cover dynamic   models, simultaneous autoregressive models, missing covariates,   and meta-analysis.     Correlated categorical data arise frequently in biometrics,   science, education, and the pharmaceutical and computer industries.   For example, the measurements on the sites of a wafer, from which   computer chips are made, are spatially correlated; cholesterol   level (low, medium, high) and blood sugar level (low, medium, high)   on the same individual are correlated; and in tumorigenicity  experiments, different kinds of tumors may be observed from the   same mouse or the same rat. Models and analysis incorporating   correlation among multiple categorical responses enable researchers   to obtain results with greater precision.  Engineers or doctors   are now using very rough methods to analyze  such data, but more   advanced methods are needed to deal with all aspects of the problem.   Incorporating prior information leads to improved interpretation of  the results of a current study and to reduction of the cost of a   new experiment.  This research will provide practitioners with   more appropriate methods to perform a comprehensive analysis of   multivariate categorical data.",
