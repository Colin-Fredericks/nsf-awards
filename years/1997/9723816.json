 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distributed Collaborative Database for Brain Viewing This project  will develop a distributed database system and the collaborative  viewing tools necessary to overcome the difficulties inherent in  imageintensive neurobiological research that is accomplished by  collaborations between geographically separated researchers.  Images containing morphological information either are, or have  recently become, a primary form of data in many fields of  biological research. For an individual laboratory, the iceberg  metaphor is true. Published images are the tip, whereas the ever-  expanding collection of raw image files stored on hard disks and  removable media is the hidden body of the iceberg. Neuroscience  is particularly image intensive. From the perspective of a single  laboratory, managing the magnitude of the data collected in  recent years is daunting. Neuroscientists often wish to compare  images of brains from experimental groups with those from control  animals. It is oftentimes a challenge to identify and understand  the spatial relations of a brain region identified by a staining  or labeling procedure. Furthermore, collaborations among  researchers in the same or different institutions are impeded by  lack of image viewing tools.    This goals of this project present challenges for computer  scientists, including the design and development of: (i)  additional file header information that represents biological  variables and is generated at the microscope during the capturing  of the image using speech-to-text technology; (ii) viewing tools  needed for collections of images that give perspective, while  retaining the pristine data captured from the digital camera;  (iii) multipleresolution image-handling techniques integrated  with a DBMS to meet data intensive image requirements; (iv)  collaboration support for on-going research discussion centered  around images, across time and space boundaries; (v) techniques  for integrating audio and text within the same discussion. This  research wi ll yield two kinds of results: a) artifacts, software  and databases, that will be demonstrated and made available to  others, and b) reports in the literature on studies of a variety  of research questions on the impact of these on neuroscientists'  activity.",
