 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research project,energy extraction methods for active  noise control are developed. A major goal is to explore and  design robust feedback control methods for rendering sound fields  silent through energy extraction, and not via wave-cancellation.  The technique developed are applicable to local as well as global  silencing of sound fields. Further, these energy extraction  methods are effective for progressive sound fields (for example,  duct-borne noise) as well as reverberant noise configurations.  Any selected resonant modes as well as broad-band noise are  suppressed. In the context of duct-borne sound, sound energy is  trapped (for extraction) in the region between the source and the  control. The sound fields, downstream of the control are  essentially silenced. Initial experimental work focuses on 1-D  control of duct-borne noise with subsequent extension to the  acoustic caging of 3-D sound sources. Using the proposed robust  energy extraction methodology for noise silencing, in principle  all noise configurations could be silenced: 1-D, 3-D, progressive  wave fields or reverberant acoustic chambers. In all cases the  noise could be confined to a small region near the source,  rendering all space outside the confinement zone silent. Since  the units do not exactly provide phase and amplitude matching for  silencing, they will be simple, robust, and economical and have  universal applicability.",
