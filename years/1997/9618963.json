 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618963  HANSELL    This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment   for the research vessel WEATHERBIRD II, operated by the Bermuda  Biological Station for Research, Inc, and dedicated to use in  support of ocean science research.          The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds  for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe     conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support   for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the   deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational   equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite     receivers to pin point the location of research sites,     communication equipment including radio transceivers and     satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data     communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats    for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.        The Project Director, Dennis A. Hansell is fully qualified to    direct this project having had considerable experience in    overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard    equipment.       This project will allow the institution to acquire two small  winches and two life rafts, upgrade a machinery control panel and  replace an ageing water maker.  ***",
