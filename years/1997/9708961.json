 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  award funds a Workshop on Perception of Action, to  be  held  May  18-20, 1997 in Brewster, MA.  As computer  vision  moves  from the processing of static images to consideration  of  image  streams  such  as video  sequences  or  real-time  robotic  vision,  the problem of machine \"understanding\"  of  actions  represented in the images is becoming  increasingly  important,  for potential applications such as security  and  surveillance,  dynamic  situation monitoring,  guidance  and  verification of machine action such as robotic assembly, and  support  for human user access to video image and multimedia  databases.  This workshop will explore the current state  of  knowledge  in this area, and look into future prospects  for  advances  in understanding, including schemes that represent  action  more  naturally  than the traditional  sequences  of  static poses or key frames.  The results and recommendations  of  the  workshop will be published in the form of a report,  which will also be made available on a web site.",
