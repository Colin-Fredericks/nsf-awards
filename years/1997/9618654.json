 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618654  Tabib-Azar  Silicon carbide offers many advantages in high power, and high temperature device applications.  Extended defects in epitaxial GaN are the main factor limiting its lifetime and its laser application.  Experimental studies of carrier diffusion lengths, surface recombination velocities, and extended defects in silicon carbide (4H, 6H, and 3C phases) and GaN will be carried out using electron beam induced current (EBIC) measurements as a function of temperature.  In 6H-SiC, micropipes will be extensively studied (in terms of an effective carrier lifetime and mobility in their vicinity) and they will be mapped in p and n-type epitaxial materials. Electrical passivation of these defects by oxidation (and by A1N in the case of GaN) will also be studied.  We expect to resolve micropipes and other defects with 0.5 (m dimensions.  Wafers with appropriate epitaxial layers will be purchased from Cree Corporation and using in-house fabrication facilities, supplemented with NASA Lewis Research Center's capabilities, both p-n junction and Schottky diode structures will be fabricated.  PI's characterization facility is well equipped with high- and low-frequency capacitance meters, device parameter analyzer, deep-level transient spectrometer, and other relevant equipment.  In addition to the above facilities we will use the EBIC apparatus at NASA Lewis Research Center.  ***",
