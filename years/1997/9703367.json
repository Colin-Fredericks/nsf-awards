Grubb:  Georgia Institute of Technology    \"Career:  The Productive Re-use of Industrial Byproducts to  Solve Environmental Problems:  A Paradigm Shift in the Way  Industrial Byproducts are used \"      The overall objective of this Career development plan is to  explore the interface between geotechnology, geochemistry,  environmental engineering and the social sciences, the  latter principally due to the stigma associated with  industrial byproducts.  The research program will emphasize  core skills in fundamental science and engineering, and will  have its nexus with the educational program in these same  areas, but also in creative thinking.    Specifically, this research will evaluate whether fly ash  (pure or blended with other industrial byproducts) can be  used as a porous geochemical filter (PGF) media to  successfully mitigate or attenuate acid mine drainage (AMD).  The primary objective will be to identify a strategy for  rapid deoxygenation of AMD leachates while minimizing the  negative impacts of iron precipitation, i.e., pore clogging  in the PGF itself.  The second objective is to identify and  quantify the governing redox chemistry, and precipitation  and sorption phenomena associated with the flow of AMD  through the various PGF media, including the redox reactions  involving metals that are mediated by microorganisms under  anoxic conditions.  The third objective is to identify which  PGF media can best immobilize metals and to correlate this  performance with geochemical and geotechnical index  properties.    The educational activities will be constructed to promote  mental and experiential breadth and conceptual versatility.  Critical thinking techniques will be introduced, and special  facets will be developed to attract and retain more students  from all groups of engineering.  Existing and new coursework  will be infused with information from history and philosophy  of science and engineering, and will highlight factors that   can contribute to the discovery and problem solving process.  The study of productive use of industrial byproducts will be  introduced into coursework, as a means of initiating  paradigm shift in attitudes concerning industrial byproducts  and their productive re-use.    ***",
