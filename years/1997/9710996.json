 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710996  Anderson    Mother Goose Asks Why? is a program of the Vermont Center for the Book currently being brought to 1200 parents in Vermont.  Centered around exemplary children's literature and science activities, the program provides a series of four reading/discussion/activity sessions to parents of preschool children.   Through exploration of basic questions such as \"What Is It?\", \"How Many?\", and \"How Do You Know?\", parents gain experience, skills, and confidence to introduce science to their 3-7 year old children.    The Vermont Center hopes to expand this program to twelve additional states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Before initiating this expansion, however, the Center needs to address two issues:  1) how to create appropriate strategies for reaching, recruiting, and retaining families in locations that are quite different from Vermont, and 2) how to create an evaluation strategy that will assess parental behavior and attitudinal changes over time.  Toward this end, the Center will gather representatives from the participating expansion sites and experts in family outreach to examine local issues and differences, to establish local contacts, and to begin development of  effective implementation strategies for the sites.  They also will work with The Network, Inc., a national education evaluation and research organization, to produce concrete measurements for parental behavior changes.",
