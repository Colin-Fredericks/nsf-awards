 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Pechukas is being supported by the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program.  His research will focus on three   problems of many-body quantum dynamics:  the problem of computing the   dynamics efficiently and with accuracy, the problem of generalizing   quantum rate theory to accommodate complex kinetic processes with   randomly fluctuating activation barriers, and the problem of devising and   analyzing simple soluble models for many-body quantum dynamics to   illuminate a number of obscure issues in the theory of open systems.    Specific areas of interest are to further develop and test his phase   space path integral Monte Carlo method for real-time quantum dynamics,   based on a compact `Fourier` expansion of wavefunctions in coherent   states.  Another aspect of this research will push the fluctuating   barrier problem beyond the simplest case--classical Kramers problem in   the spatial diffusion limit, barrier fluctuations driven by an external   stochastic process--to which this work and that of others has so far been   restricted.  In a third aspect this research will explore a simple   collision model recently devised for quantum Brownian motion, to answer   questions about initial state preparation and long-time Markovian   dynamics in open systems that interact strongly with their surroundings.    The motivation for all three projects is the same.  Chemistry is   fundamentally quantum-mechanical and typically complex.  Chemical   processes in complex systems--charge separation in photosynthesis, oxygen   fixation at the active site in thermally fluctuating hemoglobin,    hydrogenation of carbonmonoxide at metal surfaces in synthetic fuel   production--these are fundamentally quantum-mechanical processes   involving many atoms simultaneously.  To describe and to simulate complex   chemical processes properly is fundamentally to study quantum dynamics in   many-body systems.",
