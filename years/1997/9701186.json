 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701186  Barnes    The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) will operate the  R/V URRAC'A during 1997 as a general oceanographic vessel in  support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The URRAC'A is a 96'  general research vessel operated by STRI.  The vessel is scheduled  for 128 operating days in 1997, of which 33 days are in support of  NSF-sponsored programs.  The ship operates primarily in the coastal  waters of the Panama Canal zone, including the Caribbean and  Pacific.    This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science  Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most  oceanographic research projects require highly specialized  equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An  increasing number of research projects require equipment that must  be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be  specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires highly trained  crew members for maintenance and operation.  These vessels do not  operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and  therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels  specifically dedicated to oceanographic research.  These vessels  are operated by universities and research institutions around the  country.",
