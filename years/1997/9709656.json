 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mark A. Smith of the University of Arizona is supported by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his studies on the   mechanism and dynamics of gas phase chemical reactions at temperatures   between 1 and 300K.  The primary goal is to further the understanding of   very low energy collision phenomena and to obtain absolute reaction rates   and product branching ratios needed for the modeling of planetary   atmospheric, cometary, circumstellar and interstellar chemical   environments.  He will investigate radical-molecule and molecule-molecule   collision processes near 1K using a free jet-based flow reactor, and   measure rates, branching ratios and product identities over a wide range   of temperatures and pressures using laser-induced fluorescence-based and   mass spectrometer-based Laval flow reactors.   The wide temperature range of these studies encompasses those prevalent   in interstellar clouds, and many of the reactions to be investigated are   particularly important in that environment.  For example, there is an   enhancement of deuterium atoms in molecules in these regions, which may   be due to grain mechanisms, fractionation in ion-molecule reaction   pathways or neutral fractionation.  Reactions must be studied to   determine which alternative is viable.  Our general knowledge of   intermolecular interactions at low energies is poor because experimental   methods have not previously existed to permit studies at temperatures   below about 250K.  These studies will break new ground in physical   chemistry at low temperatures.",
