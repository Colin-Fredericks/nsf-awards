Up to two million km2 of Amazonian forest, representing one-fifth of the world's moist tropical forest, depends on annual recharge of deep (>2 m) soil moisture, and is therefore susceptible to rainfall reduction. As a result, forests that normally extend like firebreaks through the forest-pasture landscape become flammable.  The mortality of drought-vulnerable understory and hardwood trees leads to a reduction in above-ground biomass.  Soil water depletion also leads to a reduction in below-ground production and, hence, in soil respiration and soil carbon storage.  In this research, responses to drought of two tropical forests with similar rainfall patterns and soils will be compared:  a high evergreen forest of eastern Amazonia and a low evergreen forest of the Cerrado Region of central Brazil.  The response of these forests to rainfall reduction will be compared to the response of the grass-dominated ecosystems that are common in both regions.  Rainfall will be reduced experimentally using a network of clear, portable panels that intercept incoming rain during the rainiest months and transport this water outside of the plots. Canopy phenology and stem sapflow, fine fuel characteristics, soil respiration and water content, root distribution and tree mortality will be compared for control and rainfall-excluded plots.",
