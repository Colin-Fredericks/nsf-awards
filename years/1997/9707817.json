 "awd_abstract_narration": "In most higher plants, certain cells become specialized to accumulate calcium and precipitate it as crystalline calcium oxalate.  These cells appear to function in bulk regulation of calcium by sequestering excess calcium, thereby reducing levels of free ionic calcium within the plant.  Plant cells that sequester calcium oxalate exhibit distinct structural and biochemical differences as they differentiate for this role.  Dr. Webb's research goals focus on understanding what stimulates plant cells to develop for this specialized function, and how the cell controls the crystallization process.  The primary objective of her current research is the application of molecular approaches to identify genes that are differentially expressed at early stages in the development of crystal-forming cells.  Molecular studies will be initiated with two tissues in grape, endosperm and root cortex, which have contrasting patterns of crystal morphology and development.  Differentially expressed genes will be identified using mRNA differential display to compare distinct populations of mRNA from each of these tissues.  Messages from endosperm will be compared at selected developmental stages, and those from roots after manipulating calcium nutrition to alter crystal development.  After differential expression of selected cDNAs is confirmed, they will be sequenced and compared to known sequences in computer databases.  Full-length cDNA clones will be isolated and characterized.  Clones that have potential roles in calcium transport, oxalate metabolism, or vacuole function will be of particular interest.  To identify genes specifically expressed in crystal idioblasts, the cellular localization of expression will also be determined for selected cDNAs using in situ hybridization.  These studies will form the basis for future research to determine how expression of particular genes and gene products are important in calcium oxalate crystallization and the differentiation of crystal-forming cells.  Correlated studies will  examine the structural development of crystal-forming cells in grape roots during their differentiation.  A variety of approaches will be explored using scanning confocal microscopy to observe unique features of these cells.  A primary objective in this work will be to examine the development of the membrane systems that compartmentalize calcium oxalate crystals within the vacuole.  All of the research to be conducted under this Career Advancement Award emphasizes activities and techniques that are new to Dr. Webb and will significantly enhance her research and advisory capabilities.",
