 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program is supporting   Professor Rigoberto Hernandez at the Georgia Institute of Technology as   part of the CAREER program for young scientists.  The objective of this   research is to characterize the time-dependent behavior of the   polymerization process.  A bond percolation model on a novel lattice has   been combined with an Ising-like Polymer Growth Hamiltonian (PGH) to   provide non-uniform and correlated bond formation/breaking probabilities.    It includes the pertinent reaction dynamics, but is simple enough to   accommodate the Monte Carlo treatment of high (long-length) polymers.   A   new stochastic Hamiltonian has been built around the potential of mean   force for the effective polymer `contour` length.  The change of the   macroscopic properties of the polymer as its length increases is included   through an effective friction which explicitly depends on this length.    Further study of the dynamics of this Hamiltonian, as well as its   connection to the polymer-growth lattice Hamiltonian, should provide   increased understanding of the connection between the monomer properties   and reaction conditions, and of the resulting material properties of the   polymer as a function of time.  Hard plastics, chewing gum, glues, proteins and coatings are but a few   examples of the diverse range of polymeric materials which have driven   the polymer industry.  Surprisingly, these materials are often obtained   from the same base monomers, varying only reaction conditions and   relative composition.  What existing theories often leave out in their   characterization of the final product is an understanding of the reaction   dynamics when viscous effects affect the reaction process.  This is   important in thermoset polymers used in the encapsulation of microchips;   the polymerization ends not because the reactants have been depleted, but   because of diffusional quenching due to the dramatic change in viscosity   as a function of the extent of reaction.  The goal in this research  is   to understand the competition between the reactivity of the polymer and   changes in the material's viscosity as a function of temperature and   reaction profile.  The educational component of this proposal comprises   the development of a new physical chemistry course and a companion   web-based textbook, both of which emphasize the connection between   theoretical understanding and physical intuition.  The course will also   use various electronic forms of communication.  It is hoped that this   computer-enhanced dialectic (CED) will provide ample opportunity for the   student to learn not only how to answer questions, but also how to ask   the right ones.",
