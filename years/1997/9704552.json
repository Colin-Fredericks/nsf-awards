 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704552  Karlin   This research centers on developing new probabilistic and statistical tools of   relevance to biomolecular sequence analysis with particular emphasis on:  (i)  The use of   scan statistical analysis of marker arrays in multiple correlated sequences.  Specifically, to   find asymptotic distributions of extremal r-scan lengths for several stochastic models,   extending earlier work of the investigators by accommodating dependent and/or   transformed data. These asymptotics then serve as benchmarks for interpreting various   biological correlated multiple sequence data by providing estimates of probabilities of   clustering or over-dispersion of markers along one or more sequences.  (ii) To provide a   flexible and general framework for characterizing residue clusters and statistical   significance of unusual compositions in protein 3D structures as well as the means of   assessing statistical significance of strong local similarities among two or more such   structures. The proposed framework is based on the study of random models for weighted   labeled graphs and as such it generalizes previous work on the probabilistic foundation of   general score based methods for use in protein sequence comparison.   Since 1995, several prokaryotic genomes and one eukaryotic genome have been   reported, and many are forthcoming. These genomes provide opportunities and pose   challenges for characterizing genomic inhomogeneities, for detecting significant sequence   patterns, and for evolutionary comparisons. Availability of complete genomes and massive   amounts of DNA and protein sequences opens a new era in bioinformatics research.   Advances in (i) and (ii) above can provide much needed tools for biomolecular data   analysis and for comparison of protein sequences and corresponding three-dimensional   structures.  Software approaches are often used to find relationships between newly   discovered sequences and the existing data banks. Similarities detected can be used to   predict biologi cal characteristics of new structures, suggest directions for further   experimental study, and point to possible medical applications. However, due to the   accelerating growth of the data banks, random correlations might at first appear significant   and thus mask the true biological information existing in the data. This research aims at   putting biomolecular data analysis procedures on a firm mathematical foundation, and   concomitantly reducing the masking effect of random correlations.",
