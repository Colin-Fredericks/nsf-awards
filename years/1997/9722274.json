 "awd_abstract_narration": "Keeney  9722274  The educational objectives of this CAREER award are to expose students to the excitement of scientific research from the high school through the college level. This is being achieved by:  1. Preparing undergraduate students for engaging fully in research through development of  an investigative laboratory course, Molecular Techniques, based on the research in the principal investigator's laboratory.  2. Providing the capstone experience of senior research and providing the opportunity for students to present their research results.  3. Involving local high school teachers in the research project and assisting them in more effectively relating the research process to their students through development and implementation of appropriate curricular exercises. Developed exercises will be distributed through the successful Science in Motion Outreach Project in place at Juniata College.  4. Continuing building a strong Biochemistry/Cell and Molecular Biology Program through advising and integration of educational activities which expose students to the process and complexity of research.  The research involves using a genetic system to study the mechanism of reverse transcription in yeast retroelements. The reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme of these elements, like the RT enzymes of retroviruses, employ a host-encoded tRNA molecule as a primer in the first step of copying their RNA into DNA. The resulting DNA can then be incorporated into the host genome, allowing for further replication. The research is appropriate for undergraduates due to the relative simplicity of techniques required to conduct yeast genetic studies. The research objectives are to:  1. Use saturated mutagenesis of the tRNA gene, initiated in the Molecular Techniques laboratory, to identify residues important for recognition by RT enzyme.  2. Use identified tRNA mutations to screen a panel of RT mutations in vivo for the rescue of transposition, thus identifying the amino acid residues in the RT enzyme required f or recognition of the tRNA primer. 3. Purify mutant RT enzyme for collaborative biochemical studies of interaction with primer tRNA.  Implementation of the research objectives relates directly to the institutional goal of building a strong  program which includes an opportunity for research experience.  The educational objectives will strengthen this goal by integrating into the curriculum, beginning in high school, the opportunities for students to experience the excitement of discovery.   Students choosing to pursue a capstone research project as college seniors will be well prepared, assuring a positive and productive experience with cutting-edge research.",
