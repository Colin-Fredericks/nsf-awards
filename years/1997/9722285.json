 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722285  Cushman  Most higher plants assimilate atmospheric CO2 through the C3 pathway of photosynthesis using ribulose bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RUBISCO).  However, when environmental-stress conditions reduce the availability of CO2, increased photorespiration reduces the efficiency of C3 photosynthesis.  To overcome the wasteful process of photorespiration, about 10% of higher-plant species have evolved two alternative strategies for photosynthetic CO2 assimilation.  These alternative carbon-fixation pathways, C4 photosynthesis and Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), employ a CO2 pump to concentrate CO2 within plant tissues near RUBISCO.  This process improves the competitiveness of C4 and CAM plants under environmental-stress conditions such as high light intensity, high temperatures, or low water availability.  Unlike C4 plants, however, CAM plants assimilate CO2 mostly at night, limiting daytime water loss through transpiration and greatly improving water-use efficiency.    The goal of this research is to identify and characterize key structural and regulatory components of the CAM pathway by isolating mutants defective in CAM using the common ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) as a model system.  To complement this approach, a non-redundant database of expressed-sequence tags (ESTs) will be established by sequencing randomly selected complementary DNA (cDNA) copies of expressed genes.  This EST collection will provide a rich source of sequence information for identifying novel genes or gene-family members and expression patterns peculiar to CAM plants.  The mutant and EST collections generated by this research will provide an indispensable resource for researchers worldwide investigating CAM plants.    The availability of large amounts of nucleotide-sequence information from EST and genome-sequencing projects in a variety of model organisms is rapidly changing the way in which biological research is conducted and has generated a pressing need to educate scientists in the  analysis and study of biological information (Bioinformatics).  To exploit biological-information resources effectively, an integrated educational and research program will focus on instructional and training opportunities in Bioinformatics.  A semester-long Bioinformatics course, an abbreviated \"hands-on\" Bioinformatics workshop, and a series of instructional modules (with computer lab) will be developed where graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students will learn how to use informatic tools and resources through active participation in the M. crystallinum EST-sequencing effort.  In this way, the research on the genetic basis of CAM will be integrated with a series of unique instructional opportunities that combine research-based experiences with cutting-edge training in Bioinformatics.",
