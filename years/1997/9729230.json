 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to continue the work done at Wheelock College under the National Science Foundation funded Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation, Teacher Education Addressing Mathematics and Science in Boston and Cambridge (TEAMS-BC) to improve mathematics and science education of students preparing to teach young children in the elementary schools. Over the past three years, with the support of TEAMS-BC, Wheelock has used six strategies to reform its mathematics and science programs:    The enhancement of the basic courses in curriculum development with additional mathematics and science elements;    The development of new mathematics and science courses and the revision of existing core courses that meet the distribution requirements to reflect an approach to the teaching of science and mathematics that emphasizes the acquisition of basic concepts in science and mathematics and inquiry and problem solving skills and models effective teaching for understanding;    The development, revision, and extension of courses in science and mathematics education (methods courses) so that they relate more closely to the mathematics and science courses and to reflect more clearly and deeply the nature and strategies of teaching for understanding;    The enhancement of the Mathematics/Science Major and intensification of recruitment activities;    The development of a mathematics and science specialty for students wishing to pursue mathematics and science in greater depth; and    The provision of opportunities for faculty and mentor teachers to work together to enhance their skills in science and mathematics teaching and mentoring.  In this proposal, funds are requested to: (1) further develop and finalize science and mathematics courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels which were revised and/or introduced during the first three years of TEAMS-BC; (2) complete the revision of the initial mathematics course sequence for Wheelock undergraduates; (3) continue the development of tw o new programs at Wheelock focusing on mathematics and science education (Specialty in Teaching Mathematics and Science, Certificate in Teaching Mathematics); (4) continue to collaborate with cooperating teachers on mentoring and science and mathematics teaching at three professional development sites - the Holmes School and the Young Achievers School in Boston and the King School in Cambridge; and (5) prepare portfolios of key courses for dissemination within the college and to other institutions.",
