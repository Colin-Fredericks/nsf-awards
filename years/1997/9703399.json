 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process of creating a virtual environment or object in  computer graphics typically begins with modeling the geometric  and surface attributes of the objects in the environment along  with any lights.  Great effort has been expended to develop  computer aided design systems that allow the specification of  complex geometry and material attributes.  Similarly, a great  deal of work has been undertaken to produce systems that simulate  the propagation of light through virtual environments to create  realistic images.  Despite these efforts, it has remained  difficult or impossible to recreate much of the complex geometry  and subtle lighting effects found in the real world.    The modeling problem can potentially be bypassed by capturing the  geometry and material properties of objects directly from the  real world using some combination of cameras, structured light,  range finders, and mechanical sensing devices.  When successful,  the results can be fed into a rendering program to create images  of real objects and scenes. Unfortunately, these systems are  still unable to completely capture small details in geometry and  material properties.  Existing rendering methods also continue to  be limited in their capability to faithfully reproduce real world  illumination, even if given accurate geometric models.    This project will develop techniques for using a representation  of light (radiance) as a basic primitive for computer graphics.  This primitive will augment the traditional geometry-based  primitives used in computer graphics.  This framework will  provide a unified method for encoding the complete appearance of  a complex model, and allow the rerendering of an object at speeds  independent of the its geometric or lighting complexity.  Moreover, this framework will allow one to use a video camera to  sample the radiance information of a real world scene or  environment. This sampled information can then be organized  properly to allow for redisplay of the scene interactively from  any  virtual camera at any viewpoint.    The research is fundamental in that it explores an entirely novel  primitive for computer graphics.  This primitive is one of the  most natural ways to represent the complicated visual information  present in a scene.    The research will facilitate the interactive viewing of captured  real world scenes.  No other known method has the ability to  directly represent the information captured by a video camera,  and use this information for interactive generation of new  realistic images.  The success of this project will have impact  in such diverse fields as simulation, interactive virtual  environments computer education, the visual archival of objects,  and the transmittance of the appearance of objects in 3D  catalogs.",
