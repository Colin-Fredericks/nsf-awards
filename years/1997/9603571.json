 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603571  Rossmann  X-ray diffraction, using crystallized viruses, will be the  primary tool to analyze the assembly and uncoating  intermediates of various viruses.  Frequently, however, it  is not possible to crystallize transient intermediates on  account of their short-lived, unstable properties.  In these  cases, the X-ray crystallography will be augmented by cryo  electron microscopy.  The major emphasis will be on the  study of bacterial viruses, such as single-stranded X174 and  the far more complex double-stranded T4.  The far more  complex and far larger dsDNA T4 phage has over 40 structural  proteins.  While it is unlikely that it will ever be  possible to study the whole virus by X-ray diffraction, it  is possible to study the atomic structure of individual  proteins. Combination of X-ray diffraction and cryo-EM is to  be used to determine the interactions of components.  Part  of the work will be to develop suitable techniques for  interfacing cryoelectron microscopy with X-ray diffraction  techniques and also to examine particles that lack perfect  icosahedral symmetry.  The objectives will be to determine  not only the structures, but also the molecular mechanisms  by which the assembly intermediates are stabilized and  triggered into the subsequent steps of morphogenesis.  Similarly, the structural intermediates of viral disassembly  during cellular infection are to be examined.  Comparision  of different viral systems should lead to the identification  of common strategies and evolutionary relationships.    The goal of the research is to elucidate the mechanisms by  which infectious virus particles are assembled from their  component parts.  Although the work is devoted to the study  of bacterial viruses, the viral mechanisms are also likely  to be utilized by plant and animal viruses.  The different  process of disassembly during viral entry into a host will  also be studied.  Viral assembly often requires scaffolding  proteins which help guide protein folding.  Hence, the  stud ies will be among the first to observe the structures of  these chaperone-like proteins complexed with their  substrates.  The study of their transient intermediates will  require the development of  techniques to combine X-ray  crystallography (which can resolve features near atomic  resolution) and cryo-electron microscopy (which has poorer  resolution but lacks the requirement of making crystals)  Combination of these techniques is likely to be critical in  the future development of  structural biology.",
