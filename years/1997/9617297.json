 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617297  Jahnke       Knowledge of the factors that control dissolution of  CaCO3 and hence, preservation, is critical to the  interpretation of the CaCO3  sedimentary record and to the  prediction of the linkages between sedimentary CaCO3 , ocean  chemistry and processes, and future climates.  Recent  results indicate that several aspects of CaCO3 dissolution,  especially dissolution driven by the metabolic production of  CO2 in sediment  pore waters, are poorly constrained.  This  has been demonstrated by: 1. regional variations in the  extent of  metabolic dissolution observed in in situ benthic  flux chamber incubations, 2. the lack of significant change  in the rate of dissolution calculated from in situ pore  water studies across the saturation horizon, and 3. the  presence of aragonite in surface sediments that are overlain  by undersaturated bottom waters.       Two of the three regions, the Cape Verde Plateau,  Ontong Java Plateau and Cape Hatteras continental rise, that  have been studied previously will be revisited to further  constrain CaCO3 dissolution mechanisms.  Specifically, fine-  scale pore water samples at in situ temperature and pressure  will be analyzed for Ca2+ and trace metals.  These results  will augment the data sets already obtained for these  regions previously.  In addition, in situ benthic flux  chamber incubations will be conducted to: 1. examine whether  chamber artifacts have influenced previous results, 2.  determine if fine-scale pore water Ca2+ gradients support  present dissolution models and agree with chamber  measurements, 3. examine whether other acid base reactions  are influencing predicted metabolic dissolution rates, 4.  assess variations in the mineralogy and reactivity of the  carbonate phases between the study sites, and 5. determine  whether exchange reactions at the carbonate mineral surface  can account for the variations in metabolic dissolution  observed.  ***",
