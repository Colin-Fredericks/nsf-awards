 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704301  Gollub    This is a renewal project which will extend our  understanding of nonlinear physical phenomena, especially  those involving granular materials and fluids, using small  scale laboratory experiments and involving undergraduate  students.  An extensive study will be made of the phenomena  of shear friction in granular layers.  Delicate shear force  measurements will be combined with simultaneous microscopic  imaging.  These improvements will allow the onset of stick-  slip motion, precursors, and the transition to continuous  slipping to be investigated in detail.  One goal is to  compare and contrast granular friction with solid-solid  friction.  A second focus will be the study of fluid mixing  phenomena, in which a passive impurity is mixed by a flow.  These experiments will include investigations of chaotic  advection in random cellular flows, and transport in  granular media.  Finally, continuing experiments on pattern  formation and dynamics of nonlinear waves will explore  phenomena such as hexagonal superlattice patterns with  multiple spatial periodicities.  %%%  This a renewal project which will extend our understanding  of nonlinear physical phenomena that can give rise to  complex or unpredictable behavior.  The project will focus  especially on granular or particulate materials and fluids,  using small scale laboratory experiments.  The training of  undergraduate students in research will be an important  aspect of this work.  An extensive study will be made of the  motion of layers of granular material when subjected to  shear forces.  Shear friction in granular layers is  potentially important in connection with earthquakes, though  these studies are aimed at achieving a basic understanding.  Delicate force measurements will be combined with optical  imaging to understand the onset of sudden slipping events,  and the localized precursors that occur in advance of major  events.  A second area of study will involve fluid mixing  phenomena, in which a passive impurity  is transported or  mixed by a fluid flow, which may contain a porous medium  such as sand.  Studies of this type may be relevant to the  transport of impurities in soils.  ***",
