 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Dynamics Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary   Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate support   Professor Richard H. Smith, Jr., of the Department of Chemistry of   Western Maryland College, for his mechanistic investigations of the   proteolysis of mono- and bis-triazenes.  With his Research in   Undergraduate Institutions award, Professor Smith seeks to develop a   clearer understanding of the mechanism of proteolytic decomposition of   the major classes of triazenes, an important family of anti-cancer drugs.    He uses a kinetic method to measure the component constants that   determine the overall rate at which triazenes decompose to produce their   active principle, an alkyldiazonium ion.  These data provide information   about the basicities of all the major classes of triazenes and will lead   to the development of a computational model of the key decomposition   reaction, facilitating the future design of new triazene-based anti-tumor   drugs.  Two new classes of triazenes, bis-triazenes and bis-triazolines,   are effective DNA crosslinking agents and may form the basis of a new   family of anti-cancer drugs.  Professor Richard H. Smith, Jr., of the Department of Chemistry of   Western Maryland College, carries out investigations of the synthesis and   reaction chemistry of triazenes with the support of a Research in   Undergraduate Institutions award from the Organic Dynamics Program and   the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and   Physical Sciences Directorate.  Triazenes, a class of molecules bearing   in common the structural motif of three nitrogen atoms connected in a   row, form the basis of an important group of anti-cancer drugs.  By   studying the influence of their detailed chemical structure on the   reaction chemistry of these compounds, Professor Smith sheds light on the   fundamental mechanisms by which they act.  In addition, this information   is leading to the development of a computational model which is expected   to facilitate the future design of new triazene-based anti-tumor drugs.",
