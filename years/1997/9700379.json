 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with modeling, analysis, design  and experimental verification of a novel tuned distributed  vibration damper (TDVD) for intelligent vibration control of  structures. Recent advances is smart materials make it  possible to adjust the parameters of dampers and absorbers  on-line, and thus dramatically broaden the utility of  dampers and absorbers in industrial applications. Although  much progress has been made, dampers with spatially  distributed inertia have been overlooked. Many dampers and  absorbers have a characteristic lumped mass, which limits  their operation to relatively narrow frequency bands. Since  the structure to be controlled may have a wide frequency  spectrum, it is desirable to have wide-band dampers with  relatively simple configuration and realizable control  algorithms. The TDVD is unique  in that an elastic bar is  introduced in its configuration. The distributed inertia of  the bar enables the new damper to provide wide-band  augmentation, leading to vibration reduction by up to  several orders of magnitude, compared to conventional  dampers. The major objectives of this research are to  understand the damping amplifying mechanism of the TDVD; to  investigate TDVD-structure interactions; to develop TDVD-  based vibration control algorithms; and to experimentally  justify the feasibility of the TDVD in real engineering  problems.",
