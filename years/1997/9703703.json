 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703703  Hoff    This is a proposal to continue the investigation of various questions  relating to the existence, stability, regularity, large-time behavior, and  numerical approximation of solutions of systems of certain partial  differential equations arising in various areas of continuum mechanics.   Discontinuous solutions are of particular interest, and will play a  unifying role in the project. A fairly well-developed theory has been  attained for flows in the whole space which are not subject to external  forces and which are small.  These results will be extended to regions  with boundaries and to flows with large initial data and with forcing  terms. A continuous-dependence theory will be developed, sufficient to  provide a framework in which numerical procedures for approximating these  solutions can be studied. The entire analysis will be extended to systems  of differential equations arising in related physical problems, such as  magnetohydrodynamics and viscoelasticity. Finally, recent work concerning  the pointwise behavior of Navier-Stokes diffusion waves will be continued:  the derivation and pointwise analysis of diffusion waves will be carried  out for related systems of physical interest, and a stability analysis of  planar viscous shock waves with respect to multidimensional perturbations  will be given.     The proposer will study various mathematical questions concerning  important models of compressible fluids and materials.  These models arise  in a broad range of applications, including supersonic flight, dynamic  meteorology, semiconductor theory, and the design and use of viscoelastic  materials.  While the main goal in constructing these models is to achieve  a predictive capability, they are far too complicated to be \"solved\" in  any explicit sense.  On the other hand, adequate approximate solutions can  frequently be generated by computer methods.  The intelligent design of  such methods depends crucially, however, on a rigorous understanding of  why solutions do e xist, in what sense, and in what ways they are sensitive  to noise in the data.  The primary goal of this project is therefore to  provide such a rigorous mathematical analysis for these models; a  secondary objective is to apply these mathematical insights to the  intelligent design and analysis of algorithms for generating approximate  solutions.",
