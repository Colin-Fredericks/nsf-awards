The project integrates fundamental algorithmic and applications-oriented   research in optimization with research in software infrastructure for   distributed systems management. New algorithms that use the powerful but   heterogeneous, high-latency environment of the metacomputer platform will be   developed to solve key problems in targeted application areas. The   optimization tools will include interfaces that link the client workstation   to the metacomputer server in novel ways. The environment will be able to   execute in tandem with data-gathering and modeling resources elsewhere in   the network.    Focus areas for the algorithmic research include combinatorial optimization,   integer programming, global optimization, and nonlinear programming, with   target application areas of transportation, telecommunications, molecular   conformation, and weather forecasting. Software infrastructure research will   focus on the resource allocation, scheduling, persistency, and security   mechanisms needed to maximize the usefulness of the environment, from the   viewpoint of the optimization tools and their users. The project will make   use of the GUSTO metacomputing testbed being constructed by the Globus   project.",
