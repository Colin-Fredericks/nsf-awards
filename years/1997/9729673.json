 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729673  Kenig  This research suggests a program to test the hypothesis that  there is a substantial microbial biosphere living within the  oceanic upper crustal rocks of the off-axis ridge flanks,  hundreds of meters below the water-rock interface, by  detecting specific metabolic products which are associated  with these sub-surface microbial communities.  These  diagnostic organic compounds should accompany the  hydrothermal fluid that is known to circulate within the  upper crustal rocks and eventually discharges into the  overlying seawater at diffuse vent sites in exposed rock  outcrops.  We will also detect and phylogeneticallv  characterize (ribosomal RNA molecular probe) any cellular  biomass associated with fluid discharges.  To test the ridge  flank subsurface biosphere hypothesis, we propose to build  an instrumented \"bio-blanket\" that focuses up-welling fluid  emanating from these diffuse vent areas through relatively  small scavenging columns that serve as traps for metabolic  (organic carbon) products.  The proposed instrumented  blanket would also measure up-welling temperatures and  velocities as the hydrothermal fluid vents into seawater.  The development of the bio-blanket will be in several  stages: initial instrument-component tests and fluid  sampling will exploit the convenient valved- plumbing system  of the \"corked\" ODP Hole 1026B, which has documented 65 C  outflowing fluids; subsequent complete prototype instruments  will be deployed over active diffuse vents at both an  exposed outcrop at a ridge flank site (Baby Bare, Cascadia  Basin) and a mid-ocean ridge spreading center (Endeavour  Segment), where flux rates are high and the signal-to-noise  ratio of any component of the fluid is quite large.    The direct detection of a wide-spread biological community,  living within the sub-surface ocean floor in the older ridge  flank regions, would dramatically alter our estimates of  biological productivity and the global carbon budgets, and  have a profound impact on our ph ilosophical view of the  earth.  ***",
