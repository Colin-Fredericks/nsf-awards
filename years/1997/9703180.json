 "awd_abstract_narration": "Characterizing realistic high-performance computer  applications with existing, advanced tools will be a first  thrust in this project.  An information repository will be  created on the Web, documenting properties of application  programs, computer architectures, and their interrelations.  A second project part will improve the integration of tools  and their user interaction. Compilers will be enhanced to  make available to the users the information gathered from  their source programs. Performance analysis tools will be  integrated with compilation tools and developed to the point  where they can interpret performance and present it to the  user at several abstraction levels. The new tools will be  made available on the Web, serving as a \"Remote Parallel  Programming Lab\". Third, advanced capabilities of  optimization and performance analysis tools will be  developed. Compilers will be enhanced to increase their  understanding of subscripted subscript patterns, found in  many irregular applications.  Performance analysis tools  will be enhanced to do \"performance forecasting\", that is,  predict the performance of future computer architectures  running future applications. New course material will be  developed based on the results of these projects.  This  material will be brought into the existing course framework  of parallel programming, advanced optimizers, and object-  oriented programming at Purdue/ECE.***",
