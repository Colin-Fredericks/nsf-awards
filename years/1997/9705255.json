With funds from the planning  grant the MESA staff will do an assessment of need for a parents  program at ten target sites, identify potential partners in working  with the project and develop a parent involvement plan for each  center.  Specific tasks will be to identify a parent coordinator at  each site, to prepare the sites to deliver a program for family  math, science and technology training and to develop parent leaders  at each site who will work with the schools so that they can  deliver a strong math, science and technology to all students as  well as prepare parents to become active in their children's  learning.",
