The   proposed  formulation   fits  nicely  with  the  underlying   physical  concepts, most clearly described by Ashby over 20 years ago.      Among  the  host  of  applications  where  scale-dependent  plasticity driven by this mechanism is encountered  are  the  grain-size dependence of flow strength and work-hardening in  polycrystals   (Hall-Petch  effect),  size   dependence   of  indentation  microhardness,  particle-size  effects  in  the  dispersion  strengthening crystals.  and  others.   In  each  case,   the   attainment  of  locally  inhomogeneous   shear  strain,,over     a    characteristic    geometric     length  scale,,results   approximately   in   the   storage   of   a  geometrically  necessary  dislocations,   where  b  is   the  crystal  lattice constant.  These \"geometric\"  dislocations,  which   relieve  the  lattice  incompatibility  which  would  otherwise be introduced by conservative dislocation movement  in  producing the strain gradient, act as obstacles to other  (glissile)  dislocations,  producing  very  enhanced   local  hardening.      A review of the field shows that the computational methods  proposed  for dealing with this class of problems  are  both  feasible  to  implement  and are  methodologically  in  good  agreement   with   the   materials  science   understanding.  Preliminary  computational results  on  a  multi-crystalline  aggregate  have  shown a clear Hall-Petch effect,  based  on  \"first  principles.\"  The effects of the  extra  dislocation  density,   which  is  concentrated  near  grain   boundaries  struggling to deform compatibly, also give rise to  distinct  patterning of  strain within the grain.    The proposed extensions of the work will address less  idealized versions of the Hall-Petch phenomenon, the  deformation of thin metallic layers constrained between  ceramics, including thermally-induced misfit strain, and  particle size effects in the dispersion strengthening of  crystals.  The results will be of fundamental scientific  value, being a first computational thrust into quantifying  scale effects in crystal plasticity and the interactions of  statistically stored and geometrically necessary  dislocations.  Among the industrial applications which could  benefit from a robust computational capability to account  for scale-dependent plasticity are the mechanical behavior  of multi-layer electronic devices and thin films.",
