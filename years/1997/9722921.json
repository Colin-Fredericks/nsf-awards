 "awd_abstract_narration": "The solution to many questions in evolutionary biology and  agricultural science depend on the accurate estimation of  the level of genetic variation and covariation present in  the populations being studied.  In this project, the  investigator is developing software for estimating  quantitative genetic parameters using statistical resampling  methods, as well as theoretically verifying the  applicability of these methods.  In addition, novel  techniques for comparing the pattern of genetic and  phenotypic variation and covariation between two or more  populations are also being developed and the software for  conducting these tests provided.    Tremendous advances in high performance computing over the  last decade have made it possible to address many difficult  statistical problems by repeatedly recalculating the  statistical estimate after randomly resampling from the  population or sample under study.  Estimates of genetic  variation within populations, which are essential for  understanding how natural and artificial selection operate,  have complex statistical properties, making them especially  suitable for resampling approaches.  The software developed  in this project helps biologists in a variety of fields  analyze their experiments in more powerful and innovative  ways.  This work is supported by the Computational Biology  Activity and the Program in Population Biology (both BIO  programs).",
