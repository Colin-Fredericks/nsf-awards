 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is supporting   Professor Davidson at Indiana University.  Over the next three years he   will continue his development and application of new methodologies in the   field of quantum chemistry for the purpose of understanding the very   fundamental inner workings of molecules.  The major focus of this   theoretical research is in the area of multi-reference perturbation   theory.  Another aspect of this work involves the development of an   alternative formulation of open shell density functional theory.  This   research will also continue investigations of a number of chemical   systems, particularly of unstable forms of molecules.  Computational chemistry has become very proficient at describing the   properties of stable species.  Chemical reactions of hot molecules are   much more difficult to describe because the electrons in a reacting   molecule are often distributed in ways that differ greatly from their   behavior in stable molecules.  Application of many standard computational   methods often provides inaccurate and misleading predictions for reacting   molecules.  This research aims to improve methods designed to follow   chemical reactions and to predict their outcomes.  This requires   developing methods that apply to fragments of molecules and to molecules   with partially broken bonds.  These methods will be tested by   collaborating with experimental research groups that have compiled some   information for a few well chosen reactions.",
