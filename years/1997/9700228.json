 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of uniquely decipherable (UD) codes has been widely  developed in connection with automata theory, combinatorics on  words, formal languages, and monoid theory.  Recently, the  concepts of multiset decipherable (MSD), set decipherable (SD),  and numerically decipherable (ND) codes were developed to handle  some special problems in the transmission of information.  Unique  decipherability is a vital requirement in a wide range of coding  applications where distinct sequences of code words carry  different information.  However, in several applications, it is  necessary or desirable to communicate a description of a sequence  of events where the information of interest is the set of  possible events, including multiplicity, but where the order of  occurrences is irrelevant.  Suitable codes for these  communication purposes need not possess the UD property, but the  weaker MSD property.  In other applications, the information of  interest may be the presence or absence of possible events (or  may be only the total number of events).  The SD (or ND) property  is adequate for such codes.    This project extends the investigations carried out by several  researchers on decipherability of codes.  Unique decipherability,  multiset decipherability, and set decipherability of codes turn  out to be particular cases of a more general concept of  decipherability in monoids which establishes a close connection  between some classes of codes, called varieties of codes, and  some classes of monoids, called codifiable varieties of monoids.  This connection may allow the use of monoids to better understand  decipherability of codes.    Most of the procedures are based on game techniques, graph  congruence techniques, categorical techniques, as well as  techniques related to dominoes and to graph algorithms.",
