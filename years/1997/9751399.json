 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to provide students with experience in three important areas:  a sense of three-dimensional structures of molecules; hands-on experience with bonding theories in relation to molecular properties; and understanding reactions at the molecular level.  The course modifications associated with interfacing computers are bringing about a systemic change across the chemistry curriculum and allowing students to engage in discovery-based experiments fostering curiosity.  The goal is not to train students in theoretical organic chemistry, but to use computational methods to foster a cooperative and inquiry based learning atmosphere.  Molecular modeling is being implemented as a tool for clarifying misconceptions, leading students through the inquiry process, providing the opportunity to test hypotheses, and finally allowing students to assert ownership of the knowledge.  The major impact is in the area of organic chemistry.  A faculty member at the University of Missouri-Columbia is serving as an advisor for the project, assisting in developing experiments, co-authoring experiments submitted for publication, and implementing newly developed experiments into the organic chemistry curriculum at the university.  The collaboration between Graceland College, a rural liberal arts college, and the University of Missouri-Columbia, a large research university, is serving as a model for enhancing the chemistry curriculum and expanding the opportunities for undergraduate students.  *",
