 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710608  Browne  This grant is a renewal of this mid-career PI's research  program.  Coming from an EPSCOR state, this theorist has  emerged as an ambidextrous expert in both numerical and  analytical techniques, ranging from kinetic Monte Carlo to  real space renormalization group and finite size scaling  etc.  He studies the role of spatial correlations and  fluctuations in nonequilibrium phase transitions.  These  phase transitions can be between different steady states in  heterogeneous catalysis or in various states of traffic flow  on highways or data network flow.  These problems are  mathematically related as belonging to the paradigm of  nonlinear systems driven by external forces.  They can  exhibit transitions to steady states, to periodic temporal  or spatial oscillations and even chaotic behavior.  %%%  What is common between oscillating chemical reactions, stop  and go traffic on highways and similar phenomena in network  data flow?  They are all mathematically related as problems  involving nonlinear systems subject to external driving  forces.  There are different patterns of behavior and the  transitions between different patterns are the subject of  study in this renewal grant.  This mid-career PI from an  EPSCOR state is emerging as a leader in sophisticated  mathematical analysis of these problems using cutting edge  tools.  ***",
