 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry is actively pursuing the modernization of its teaching laboratories by providing hands-on experience with modern instrumentation.  As a part of the effort to update the entire undergraduate curriculum, the department is combining the laboratory components of physical chemistry and instrumental analysis laboratories into a year-long Advanced Laboratory.  New equipment is significantly affecting the students' experience in this course.  State-of-the-art instruments are being used an Nd:YAG pumped-dye laser and a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer in a variety of experiments. These experiments are being selected to illustrate topics discussed in lectures and to maintain students' interest and enthusiasm by exposing them to current research topics and methodologies.  The novel aspect of this project is the use of an integrated laser-based approach to upper-division experimental laboratories, with time-of-flight mass spectrometry of biomolecules serving as the capstone of the students' accumulated experiences.  Specific laser-based experiments include photodissociation of Fe(CO)s, nonlinear atomic spectroscopy of Fe atoms using a TOF mass spectrometer, and Raman spectroscopy of CHCl3.  The students are subsequently applying laser-based spectroscopy techniques in inorganic chemistry and biochemistry.  In addition, students are being encouraged to apply these techniques in original research projects chosen across the traditional divisions of chemistry including, physical, analytical, inorganic, and biological chemistry.",
