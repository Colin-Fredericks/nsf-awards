In the  research component advanced simulation techniques will be  developed and used to study the formation and evolution of  complex microstructures during thermal processing of high-  temperature oxide-based sensor materials, nanostructured  ceramic composites and titantium-based intermetallic alloys.  The research should reveal the fundamental mechanisms,  morphology and kinetics of the microstructure development;  provide a means to predict microstructure formation during  processing; and suggest novel processing schedules to  improve material performance for a wide range of  applications.  The methodology to be used is the field  computational approach to nonlinear pattern dynamics.    The proposed research will form the basis of new courses at  the undergraduate and graduate level in which students can  design alloys and see how microstructure evolves during  processing and how it determines materials properties.  The  course will be embedded in world-wide web and CD-ROM  technology.  %%%  This is a CAREER grant to a new faculty member.
