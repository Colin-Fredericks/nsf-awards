The investigations focus on films of the noble  gas helium, including mixtures of the isotopes of masses four and  three,  adsorbed  on  the  substrates  which  offer  the  weakest  possible  binding.  Such  substrates include  alkali  metals  and  molecular  hydrogen. This choice is made to more clearly  display  novel  behaviors  in  the  areas of superfluid  onset  and  phase  separation  in  submonolayer  two  dimensional  films;   in   the  varieties  of  wetting behavior; and in the  adsorption  of  very  thick   films.  In  all  cases  the  research  is  collaborative,  involving   close  coupling  between  experiment,   theory,   and  simulation. The experimental methods include dielectric constant,  volumetric,  capillary rise, torsional oscillator, heat  capacity  and  quartz microbalance measurements. The theory will deal  with  film  dynamics, statistical mechanics, van der Waals forces,  and  calculation  of potentials. Grand canonical simulations  will  be  directed primarily toward the wetting problem.  %%%  This  Focused Research Group grant supports a collaborative study  of  the adherence of thin films of gas molecules to several types  of  substrates, with an interest in the ability of the  molecules  to  wet the surfaces. The gases under study are relatively  inert  noble  gases, specifically helium atoms of masses three and  four  atomic   mass  units,  and  the  studies  are  carried   out   at  temperatures near the absolute zero, where the helium  atoms  can  appear  in  several  different  types  of  superfluid  state.   A  superfluid state is one in which the motion of the helium is  not  at  all impeded by its interaction with the surrounding container  or  substrate, in the case mentioned above. If, for example,  the  liquid superfluid is put into rotation (like swirling water in  a  glass)  the swirl ing motion will persist forever, and this effect  is  the  basis  for a gyroscope which can detect  extremely  slow  rotations. The proposed research will clarify the effects of  the  substrate  on  the  temperature at which the superfluid  behavior  first occurs, and will probe these behaviors down to layers  less  than one atomic layer thick, on average. The results may lead  to  new  insights  useful  in  the variety  of  situations,  such  as  chemical  engineering,  polymer science,  catalysis,  and  others  where  wetting  phenomena are important. The  results  will  also  contribute to general knowledge of situations where monolayer and  submonolayer coverages of surfaces by atoms and molecules  occur.  The  nation's science and engineering research base will  benefit  strongly  from the training of graduate students in this program,  in  addition  to the discoveries which may be made  on  monolayer  wetting and phase transitions.  ***",
