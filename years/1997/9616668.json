It is recognized  that there are certain characteristics of the reinforcement phase  and the matrix/platelet interface which will favor improved  toughness behavior, e.g., ease of debonding at the  platelet/matrix interface, high platelet volume fraction, however  detailed systematic study has been limited.  Based on recent work  carried out at Lehigh, it is believed that a novel composite  system consisting of alumina platelets coated with calcium  hexaluminate (CA6) has the potential to surpass the properties of  conventional platelet composites.  CA6 exhibits several  characteristics which make it exceptionally well-suited for the  proposed application.  These include the adoption of an epitaxial  relationship such that the weak basal cleavage planes of CA6  align parallel to the (0001) a-alumina platelet faces, values of  thermal coefficients of expansion which favor debonding, and  thermodynamic stability with alumina.  Mechanical  characterization of both the bulk composites and the interface  structures is proposed.  The processing and mechanical testing  will be complemented by high resolution study of debonded  interfaces using TEM. The goals of the program are several-fold.  One aim will be to determine the processing and microstructural  parameters of the composite system which optimize the mechanical  properties. On a more fundamental level, however, the proposed  program will enable the direct correlation between interfacial  structure, the toughness, and strength of the interface, and the  mechanical behavior of the bulk composite.  %%%%  In recent years, platelet reinforced ceramic composites have  emerged as viable alternatives to whisker and fiber reinforced  materials for many structural applications.
