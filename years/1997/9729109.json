 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729109  Norris    This  new  project  is  a collaboration between  D.  Citrin  at Washington  State and T. Norris at the University of  Michigan. It  addresses  the  response  of low-dimensional  semiconductor structures  to  sub-picosecond  shaped  optical  pulses.                     In  particular, we will employ tailored optical pulses incident  on semiconductor  optical  microcavities to  coherently  excite  a population  of excitons, and then de-excite them  on  the  subpicosecond  time  scale.   We  will  focus  on  the   ultrafast modulation of the optical nonlinearities of  the system  due  to the control of the exciton population at  100 GHz repetition rates.  In addition, in this project we  will explore the use of shaped  optical  pulses in  semiconductors to  generate  tunable terahertz  electromagnetic waveforms in quantum  wells  in  the  presence  and  absence of additional externally applied  strong electromagnetic  fields.  Control of the THz  waveforms  ill  be attained  using  ideas from coherent  control  and  dynamics  of optically excited electron-hole  wavepackets.  %%%  This  is  a new collaboration between D. Citrin, a theorist  at Washington  State  and an experimentalist,  T.  Norris  at  the University  of  Michigan.   Laser  pulses  of  extremely  short duration will be used to control the  behavior of electrons  in microscopic  semiconductor-based  structures. This  new  project will  address,  from a  fundamental viewpoint, how  such   short pulses  propagate  through small semiconductors,  and  how  the electrons  respond to the passage of these  light  pulses.         In  addition  to the contribution to our understanding of the ultimate  limits to  the  response of semiconductors illuminated by  very  short laser  pulses, the  results of this project will  be  useful  to identify  fast processes in semiconductors  that may be employed for the next generation of ultrahigh-  speed optical switches for optical-fiber-based  communications  systems.   Other  expect ed applications will  be in creating new sources of electromagnetic radiation in  regions of the spectrum where no or few convenient sources  presently exist.  ***",
