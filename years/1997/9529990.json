 "awd_abstract_narration": "9529990  IZENSON       This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project will investigate a novel, multiphase mixing technique for combining and dispensing foamable compositions (such as polyurethane foams). Dispensers for foam ingredients are unreliable because the reactive ingredients must be thoroughly mixed inside the dispenser. Solids form inside the dispenser, eventually causing failure. The opportunity is to investigate a dispensing method that dramatically increases reliability, reduces costs, and produces high-quality foam. In this novel method, the foam ingredients are pre-mixed with a high concentration of tiny air bubbles to form \"froths\" prior to mixing. Mixing improves dramatically, and the dispensers can be made much more simple and reliable. The objective of the Phase II research is to understand and characterize basic phenomena to enable the design of an economical dispenser based on froth mixing. Specifically, we will focus on good foam quality, commercially useful, reliable operation, and simple processes for commercial applications. We will investigate: (1) methods to produce the proper multiphase mixing conditions, (2) methods to accomplish multiphase mixing, and (3) optimal foam quality as a function of mixing parameters. Results of the research will be data and analysis methods for the design of economical and reliable foam dispensers.  Research results from Phase II are key to developing reliable foam dispensers to produce high-quality foams for packaging, insulation, structures, and textiles.  The froth mixing process is novel, conceptually simple, reliable, easy to scale, and makes efficient use of foam reagents.",
