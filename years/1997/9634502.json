 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634502  Eguiluz  This grant is to support work on calculation of collective  properties of metals, namely the influence of electron-  electron interaction using realistic band structure energies  for electrons.  The current understanding of these  properties is based on rather simple models such as Jellium  or Hubbard model.  As the full complexity of the metal  response is being explored in various state-of-the-art  electron spectroscopies, such a study is not only feasible,  it becomes imperative as well.  The project includes: (1)  calculation of inelastic scattering cross sections for  electrons and x-rays, (2) influence of charge and spin  fluctuations on the quasi particle states near the Fermi  surface, (3) magnetic response of atomically thin films and  (4) temperature dependence of the magnetic properties in a  3d ferromagnet.  The work involves close collaboration with  experimental colleagues.  %%%  This grant supports theoretical  work on complex and subtle  properties of metals using realistic models where the  earlier work has been done on specially developed simplified  models.  The work involves calculation of specific  quantities which can be compared to experiments.  In  particular, this project will considerably enhance our  understanding of temperature dependence of magnetism and the  magnetic properties of thin films.  ***",
