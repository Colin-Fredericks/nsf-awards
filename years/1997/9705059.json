We  have  developed  techniques  for  fabricating  single-electron tunneling transistors containing  an  individual,  nm-scale metal particle, and we have used these devices  to  make  detailed  measurements  of  the electronic  spectrum  within  the  nanoparticle.   This  new  capability  is  a  powerful  probe  of  electronic  structure, because all the forces which  act  on  the  electrons  can be studied through their separate effects  on  the  eigenstate  spectrum.   In this proposal,  we  will  apply  these  techniques  to study magnetic particles.  We will (a)  manipulate  single quantum levels to study spin-polarized electron tunneling,  (b)  examine  the  electronic spectrum in magnetic  particles  to  understand  exchange forces and the correlated states which  they  produce, and (c) use time-dependent studies of level spectra as a  probe of the dynamics of the nanoparticle's magnetic moment.  %%%  This  is a new project to study electrons confined in  very small  metal  particles.  When a piece of metal  is  so  small  that  it  contains fewer than 10,000 atoms, the mobile electrons inside the  metal  cannot  have any arbitrary energy, but are  limited  to  a  resolvably  discrete  set  of  states.   Because  of  the   level  discreteness, electronic devices on these small length scales can  be  thought of as \"artificial atoms\".  We have recently developed  techniques  for producing transistor devices by connecting  wires  to  individual metal nanoparticles, and then using these  devices  to measure the spectrum of allowed energy levels inside the metal  particle  for  the first time.  In this proposal, we  will  apply  these  new  techniques  to  study magnetic  particles.   We  will  examine (a) under what conditions electrons can h op on and off  a  magnetic  particle without flipping their spin, (b) how  magnetic  forces alter the spectrum of electron energy levels, and (c)  the  mechanisms  by  which  the magnetism of the particle  may  switch  direction under the influence of an applied magnetic field.  ***",
