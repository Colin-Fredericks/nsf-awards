In animals, so called  reciprocal  altruism  is a much-discussed yet much less investigated  issue.  Data accumulated over the past two decades are  largely based on observational research; there is little  agreement about the strength of the evidence.  Food-sharing  among capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) - one of the few  nonhuman primate species in which such behavior is well -  developed - may yield a handle on exchange: this behavioral  lends itself uniquely to experimentation.  After first  having studied sharing behavior itself, and the degree to  which it occurs reciprocally, the purpose the present study  is to investigate to what extent, if at all, it is used by  capuchins as a payment for cooperation.  For reciprocal  exchange to occur it would seem necessary that individuals  not only assist conspecifics, but also take notice of  received assistance.  The central question here is whether  rewards obtained through  cooperation are more readily  shared than rewards obtained through individual effort.  Trained for temporary separation from their group, our  capuchin monkeys have shown high rates of food transfer to  each other through a mesh partition.  Pairs of monkeys will  be presented with tasks in which one subject cannot obtain  food unless assisted by the other.  Food will be placed  outside a test chamber on a tray too heavy for a signal  monkey to pull close.  If both monkeys pull together,  however, one of them will obtain food subsequently can be  shared with the other.  Variation on this task, and control  procedures will be performed as well.  If cooperative  efforts do indeed promote sharing, this would suggest that  the principle of  one good turn deserve another  is not  limited to our own species.",
