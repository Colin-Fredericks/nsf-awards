 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lynmarie Posey of Vanderbilt University is supported by the Experimental   Physical Chemistry Program to study the gas-phase spectroscopy of   doubly-charged transition metal (TM) ions clustered with solvent.     Coordinated doubly-charged TM ions are quite common in the condensed   phase, but not in the gas phase, since the second ionization potential   (IP) of the metal is greater than the ligand IP, and the metal ion repels   the resulting positive ligand.  Electrospray ionization (ESI) has been   used to transfer the clustered doubly-valent ion from the condensed to   the gas phase, without reduction of the metal.  She will combine ESI and   laser spectroscopy to study (a) the electronic absorption spectroscopy of   the neutral solvent to assess the electronic or structural perturbations   resulting from coordination or electrostatic binding; (b) change in the   lowest energy ligand-to-metal charge transfer band as a function of the   number of solvent molecules; (c) d-d transitions.  Systems to be   investigated are first row TM ions clustered with various neutral solvent   molecules which differ in their basicity, polarity, steric bulk and   vibrational structure.    Most of the interesting chemistry involving transition metals occurs in   the condensed phase yet the analytical tools providing the most precise   information are often gas-phase techniques.  It is clear then that one   must ensure that the gas-phase system and condensed phase system are as   similar as possible.  The electrospray ionization technique will allow   transfer of the chemically interesting solution phase species to the gas   phase where high resolution laser spectroscopy can be brought to bear to   provide extremely detailed information on the structure of the divalent   transition metal ions.",
