 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protons and neutrons(nucleons) are the basic  constituents of matter.  However, t has become clear that  these particles are composed of even more fundamental  particles called quarks.  The description of the properties  of protons and neutrons, and their interactions, using  quarks as fundamental degrees of freedom, represents a  significant part of our research.  In addition, we can also  study the properties of mesons.  The exchange of mesons  between nucleons gives rise to their interaction at  relatively low energies.  If we work at low energy, we can  use effective theories that are meant to describe only the  low-energy properties of the systems considered (The theory  of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics, is very hard  to treat in the low-energy domain and effective theories  have found extensive application.)  The fact that free  quarks are not seen in nature leads one to say that quarks  are `confined`.  Introduction of a model of confinement in  the effective theories we study is an important part of our  program.       In addition, we study the nature of the potentials  found in nuclei.  These potentials have been found to have  an interesting relativistic structure.  (They contain parts  which transform differently when one describes the system  with alternate coordinate frames, making use of Lorentz  transformations.  Our detailed analysis of the force between  nucleons allows us to understand the properties of the  potentials found in nuclei from a fundamental point of view.  The success of the entire project will yield a good  understanding of mesons, nucleons, and nuclei that has its  basis in quantum chromodynamics, the modern theory of strong  interactions.",
