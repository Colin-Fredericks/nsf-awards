 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work would expand the implementation and dissemination of a successful strategy to foster interdisciplinary research perspectives among undergraduates at an urban university. Results from a prior NSF CCD award showed how to respond to challenges from 1) nontraditional students with weak academic skills, 2) widespread environmental degradation, 3) employers seeking graduates with multidisciplinary and highly technical skills and 4) a compartmentalized university curriculum. This program is called Cognitive Apprenticeships in Environmental Studies (CAES) as students practice their understanding in the content of its professional use. A series of exercises are placed throughout the traditional science curriculum. Although in disparate courses, the exercises are unified by 1) a focus on a specific, local environmental catastrophe and 2) the exchange of samples  and data collected by students. In effect, students in different courses become part of the same, interdisciplinary research team investigating problems that potentially affect their lives. To these experiences are added student participation in internship programs, advisement services and other activities that build a student community aware of environmental science. Proposed activities emphasize 1) development of more course materials, 2) broader implementation in the curriculum, including modules in courses for nonmajors and future teachers, and 3) wider dissemination of the CAES strategy through presentations at professional societies and Internet publications. A strategy is devised to address changes in the social, academic and biological communities of Los Angeles, but many other institutions of higher education are experiencing similar changes and would benefit from wider dissemination of our efforts.",
