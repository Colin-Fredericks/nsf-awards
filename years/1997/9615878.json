 "awd_abstract_narration": "State to state dynamics of the interaction of small molecular ions  with well characterized solid surfaces is the subject of this  research project.  Professor Jacobs' work at the University of  Notre Dame, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, uses state specific methods to prepare a beam of ions in  a particular quantum state.  This ion is then scattered from a  solid surface prepared and characterized in ultra high vacuum, and  the scattered ion identity, velocity, and energetics are  determined.  The results of these detailed measurements are  compared with wave packet calculations to enable the interpretation  of the scattering process.  The specific systems investigated  include N2+ and CO+ scattering from Pt(111), HBr+ scattering from  Si(100), and C2H2+ interacting with various metallic surfaces.  The  results of this work provide important basic information for the  mechanisms of ion etching and surface induced dissociation of  organic ions for mass spectrometric characterization.  A detailed mechanistic understanding of ion surface interactions is  vital to several technologically important fields, such as reactive  ion etching of semiconductors, satellite dynamics in low earth  orbit, and surface induced dissociation mass spectrometry.  The  work of this project is designed to provide this detailed  mechanistic understanding, using the sophisticated methods of state  preparation and surface scattering.",
