The Crystal Physics and  Electroceramics laboratory at M.I.T. and the Ford Research  Laboratory have teamed up to explore the praseodymium-cerium-  oxygen system that exhibits a number of features attractive for  the design of a versatile multi-component chemical sensor.  The  proposed research will examine the relationships between  composition, temperature and partial pressure of oxygen, as well  as the nonstoichiometry, phase stability and transport properties  (electronic and ionic).   Key features to be studied are: (1)  control of the n- and p-type character corresponding to the  position of the Fermi energy and relevant sensitivity and  selectivity to various HC and NOx molecules;  (2) the chemical  diffusivity important with respect to aging of the \"bulk\"  properties; (3) surface reaction kinetics relevant to selectivity  and response times.  Fundamental project studies will be carried  out at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; sensor response  and characterization studies are to be performed at Ford Research  Labs.  The participants of this GOALI project view their feedback  and exchange on materials, data, models, and concepts essential  to the success of this project.  The project is jointly funded by  the Ceramics Program of the Division of Materials Research and  the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical  and Physical Sciences Directorate.  %%%  Semiconducting gas sensors presently lack sensitivity and  selectivity to specific types of gases including hydrocarbons and  nitrogen oxides important for automotive systems.
