 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT - Hudson - 9710259     Experimental studies will be carried out on electrochemical reactions under conditions in which the current changes with both time and position along the electrode surface.  Spatiotemporat patterns occur under many conditions in other types of reacting systems including liquid and gas phase reactions, gas-solid heterogeneous reactions, biochemical reactions, etc.  During electrochemical reactions, such as those being considered here, nonuniform surfaces are typical under dynamic conditions.  The nonuniformities have a strong effect on the overall rate of reaction as well as the system dynamics.  However, very little information is available on spatiotemporal patterns in electrochemistry and that which is available is restricted largely to limited, special cases in which the patterns are both visible and slow moving.   An experimental setup shall be developed to study these spatiotemporal patterns; arrays of electrodes are used so that the current, or rate of reaction, can be measured independently at many locations on the reaction surface.  Since the current is measured at each electrode and since the sampling rate at each location can be high, say 5000 Hz per channel, the method is applicable to all types of electrochemical reactions over a large range of conditions.  The arrays will be in various configurations including square, hexagonal, and fing patterns.  The length scale of the reaction surface is varied by changing the number of electrodes in an array, the size of the individual electrodes, or the spacing among the electrodes.  The effect of surface nonunifonnities or pacemakers will be studied by varying the potential of some of the electrodes in the array   A representative and important electrodissolution reaction, the dissolution of iron in sulfuric acid will be studied.  This reaction will be investigated in two parameter ranges.  In the first, low frequency active-passive oscillations occur; both the fast activation and the slower passivation phases  of the cycle occur by the passage of waves across the electrode surface.  A study of surface wave phenomena and the spatiotemporal bifurcations which occur among patterns as the potential is changed will be carried out.  Direct visual observations using microscope and video camera of the slowly moving passivation waves will also be made.  Mathematical models will be developed.",
