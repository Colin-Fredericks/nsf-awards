 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617943  Cannell    This is a renewal project in which laser light scattering will be  used to study the length scale and dynamics of order parameter  fluctuations near the critical point of a model system involving  isobutyric acid/water mixtures containing a dilute silica  network.  The critical point of this system lies below (in  temperature) a region of metastable domain formation, much as the  critical point of a random-field magnet lies below the metastable  \"frozen-domain\" state.  Unlike the case with magnets, a simple  method of reaching the equilibrium state exists for the fluid  mixture.  (Leaving the gel containing the mixture in contact with  a reservoir of the fluid mixture allows it to reach equilibrium.)  This happy coincidence will permit experiments to be carried out  on the equilibrium system near the critical point, something  which is not feasible for random-field magnets.  %%%  This is a renewal project in which experiments will be done to  study how very dilute porous materials affect certain phase  transitions.  The phase transition to be studied is the demixing  of two liquids, and the porous material will be tenuous network  of synthetic quartz (silica).  The experiments will try to relate  this system to what is already known about magnetic systems  containing impurities that are fixed in position.  For the fluid  system, the silica network plays the role of the fixed  impurities, and with no impurities it is already well known that  the magnets and fluids are closely related.  Although this is a  very basic research project, a deeper understanding of how porous  materials affect the demixing transition might prove helpful in  situations such as contamination of ground water by organic  liquids.  ***",
