The participants will come mainly from Africa and USA.  Many topics on manufacturing technologies will be discussed.  Experts from Europe and the Far East are also to be invited to share their experiences on manufacturing research, education, technology transfer, and international collaboration. The conference also provides an opportunity for development of contacts and understanding of research interests between African and American researchers, which is valuable to developing long-term, mutually beneficial collaborative projects. This is the first Africa-USA International Conference on Manufacturing Technology held in the United States, since the previous three were all held in Africa. The formal part of the conference is scheduled for August 11-12, 1997 at the University of Pittsburgh, followed by two-day university and industry tours in the Pittsburgh area.   This conference enables researchers in manufacturing technology from Africa and USA to exchange ideas and research results and to make connections for possible future research collaborations. It has receive support from several African countries and companies in the Pittsburgh area.",
