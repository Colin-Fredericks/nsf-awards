Discrete and continuous FGMs are analyzed using the  boundary integral equations and the finite element methods,  respectively. Optimization of the compositional gradient by  means of numerical simulations provides relevant input for  material synthesis.  A novel technique known as Field-  Activated Combustion Synthesis (FACS), is used in the  synthesis process. Brittle FGM system, MOSi2/SiC, consisting  of two layers joined by a compositionally graded interface  sandwiched between the layers is used.  With different  applied electrical fields, different compositional profiles  are obtained for this system.  The spatial distribution of  the phase concentrations of Mo and Si are determined from  electron microprobe analysis. The distinct samples, with  various compositional profiles at the graded interface, are  tested by carefully placing a crack inside the  compositionally graded.layer. The fracture behavior of FGMs  with crack faces parallel and perpendicular to the property  gradient are investigated both experimentally and  numerically. The numerical models are calibrated by fracture  mechanics experiments. The influence of compositional  distribution functions on the structural behavior and the  mechanics of crack initiation and propagation in FGMs under  mechanical and/or thermal loads is studied. The study  contributes to the understanding of mechanical behavior and  optimal (or near optimal) compositional distribution  functions of MoSi,)/SiC and Ti3SiC2/SiC FGMs, in particular,  and to the actual design of FGMS, in general.  ***",
