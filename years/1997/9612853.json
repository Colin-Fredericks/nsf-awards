 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reconsidering Fragmentation and Reassembly    The Internet Protocol(IP)'s success for the last 15 years, during  which several new technologies emerged, is due to its support for  diversity.  IP's solution to the use of different maximum packet sizes  on different networks is to split packets that are too big into fragments,  and to reassemble these fragments at the destination.    This project reconsiders several issues related to fragmentation and  reassembly IP.  Reassembly is reconsidered first.  The current  reassembly algorithms are too slow.  A simple expected case  optimization can be used to improve reassembly performance to 38  instructions per fragment if the fragments arrive in FIFO order; a  goal for this project is to implement this optimization in the NetBSD  UNIX kernel.  The project also introduces the new idea of Graceful  Intermediate Reassembly (GIR), which is a generalization of the  existing IP mechanisms of destination and hop-by-hop reassembly.  In  GIR, fragments are coalesced at an intermediate router in order to use  the largest sized packets on its outgoing interface.  It can be shown  that GIR always outperforms the usual IP mechanism of hop-by-hop  reassembly.  A goal for this project is to modify existing IP router  code to show that GIR can be implemented economically in routers with  small processing and memory costs.    The project also reconsiders fragmentation.  It is shown that that  avoiding fragmentation has costs of its own in terms of increased  packet processing and/or round-trip delays.  Measurements are  described in which TCP performance improves after turning on  fragmentation.  For example, on Ethernet under NetBSD using a 536 byte  segment size for TCP results in a throughput of only about 6Mb/s,  whereas a throughput of 8.45Mb/s is obtained using a segment size of  1460 bytes (without fragmentation) and a throughput of 8.82Mb/s using  a segment size of 16260 bytes with fragmentation.  The project will  also investigate simple performance models th at can be used to  determine when fragmentation is beneficial.          Finally, the project address the major disadvantages of fragmentation.  A major problem is that when a fragment is lost, the entire TCP segment must  be retransmitted, resulting in reduced or zero goodput under loss.  A  new mechanism --- dynamic segment sizing, in which the segment  size is dynamically reduced after loss --- is introduced, which addresses  this problem.  Simulations (using a modified NetBSD kernel)  will be used to show that dynamic segment sizing keeps the goodput at  reasonable levels even under extremely lossy conditions.  All  mechanisms (reassembly optimization, GIR, and dynamic segment sizing)  are orthogonal and can be applied to other protocol suites besides  TCP/IP.
