 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614562  Kassner    The metal fatigue phenomenon is poorly understood, in part  because the dislocation dynamics of reversed deformation is  not well characterized.  The direct observation of  dislocations during cyclic deformation (such as with in-situ  cyclic or reversed plastic deformation tests in the high  voltage transmission electron microscope) is hindered by the  buckling of thin foils when the applied tensile or shear  stress is reversed.  Recent experiments show that buckling  of the foil can be avoided and dislocation movement can be  reversed by tensile stressing in alternating perpendicular  directions.  A new specimen stage was designed to facilitate  this loading and tested in the high voltage transmission  electron microscope under an NSF small grant for exploratory  research (SGER).  A series of reversed deformation and  fatigue experiments were successfully performed in the  microscope on aluminum single crystals pre-cyclically  deformed to presaturation, forming dense edge-dislocation  dipole bundles with screw dislocations that span the  channel.  It was found that screw dislocations move early  during reversal although edges and screws contribute equally  to the strain amplitude.  Dislocation loop expansion from  the dipole veins appears to be a major source of plastic  strain amplitude.  Dipole flipping does not appear to  contribute significantly to  reversible strain.  In this  project these preliminary conclusions are examined using the  new techniques.  These experiments are extended by improving  the quality of the  microscopy images.  The important case  where persistent slip bands form is included in the approach  because the slip bands create extrusions and intrusions  which may be sites for fatigue crack  nucleation.  %%%  Fatigue failure is a major failure mechanism in metal alloy  components used in applications that see alternating loads.  This project provides insights into the fatigue mechanism in  reversed loading situations.   ***  _",
