 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emlen  9723637              Many beetle species have \"horns\" which are only produced  by males. These horns can be extreme (as dramatic as the  antlers of elk), and investment by males into the production  of horns is presumed to be substantial. In many beetle  species only some of the males produce horns, other males  being completely hornless. In most species of the genus  Onthophagus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), male horn expression  is facultative, and depends on whether or not a male grows  larger than a threshold body size: males growing larger than  this size produce horns, whereas males not attaining this  size do not. Facultative expression of male horns provides an  unusual opportunity to study how horns develop, and whether  horns are \"costly\" to males to produce. Prior research  revealed that males allocating developmental resources to  horn production were forced to compensate by reducing  allocation to other traits, including eyes. This suggests  that there may be allocation tradeoffs operating during  beetle development which restrict the range of beetle shapes  that can be produced, and these may also restrict the  directions of evolution within the genus. Here the PI extends  his prior work by (1) using manipulative experiments on  developing larvae to confirm the existence and nature of  resource allocation tradeoffs, and (2) testing whether the  biases predicted to arise from such a mechanism are manifest  in the shape variation among taxa. This study will enhance  our understanding of the relationship between developmental  mechanisms and evolutionary change, as well as improve our  understanding of the \"costs\" associated with the production  of exaggerated secondary sexual characters like beetle horns.",
