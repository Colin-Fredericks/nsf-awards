 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alliance Members: There are five community colleges who are part of SMARTE (Southeastern Michigan Alliance for Reinvestment in Technological Education).  The Alliance also represents a major state university, K-12 school systems, community-based organizations, government agencies, labor, business, and industry interests in southeastern Michigan.    Overall Goal of the project: To assist community colleges, school districts, and universities to prepare skilled technicians in product design by offering programs and delivery systems which are partnered with business and industry.    Re-engineering Initiatives:   1) To develop regional product design curricula based upon skill standards, math and science applications, information technologies, and work-based learning.   2) To develop programs and delivery systems for the recruitment, retention and placement of non-traditional students in a learning communities setting.    Objectives to Accomplish Initiatives:   Develop or enhance regional product design programs incorporating knowledge areas which are based on skills using the industry standards and criteria (SCANS, ABET, NAIT, Advanced Manufacturing) established during the first phase of this project and resulted in the core competencies for product design.   Implement work-based learning experiences as part of technical programs.   Incorporate/integrate information technologies for instructional delivery.   Develop simulation programs which incorporate skills needed by the advanced manufacturing industry.   Conduct enrichment programs for students to increase competencies in math, science, computers, and product design.   Develop and deliver an enrichment program for middle school teachers in product design.   Work with faculty and teachers to share training resources on technological skills, core competencies, and recruitment and retention programs for non-traditional students.",
