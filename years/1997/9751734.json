 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed toward the enhancement of students' understanding of photosynthesis and related aspects of plant function.  Photosynthesis is the primary process fueling life, yet students often have difficulty grasping its principles.  By providing hands-on experience with varied analyses of photosynthetic systems, this project is helping students overcome their preconceptions of photosynthesis and gain an understanding on the ecological and biochemical levels.  The project is providing a model for the multifaceted integration of photosynthesis and related functions into undergraduate curricula. The lack of such integration is a widespread pedagogical shortcoming.  The project, is serving the college's biology majors and prehealing arts students, and is also affecting the interdisciplinary environmental studies program.  The department is acquiring equipment to measure photosynthesis in intact leaves.  The new instruments are primarily being used in investigative laboratory settings where students collaboratively design and conduct experiments, and in the extensive student independent research program.  Projects are being developed for various courses.  The new instruments measure photosynthesis and related processes in various ways (oxygen evolution, carbon dioxide uptake, or water vapor pelease), so students understand and integrate various experimental approaches.  Linking instruments to networked computers is enabling students to use sophisticated data analysis and presentation tools.",
