 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, aims to  understand the growth and nucleation of thin films prepared by  laser induced vaporization by back illumination.  Professor Spain  and her undergraduate students at Occidental College  will  prepare thin films of transition metal and transition metal  chalcogenides on silicon and ordered organic films anchored to a  substrate.  These systems should yield unique and potentially  useful microstructures at the interface between these inorganic  and organic phases.  Students in this CAREER research project  will also use atomic force microscopy to characterize these  systems.  Another aspect of the educational thrust of this  project will be the radical reorganization of a combined  inorganic-physical chemistry laboratory course that emphasizes  the uses of lasers in science.   The fabrication of reliable semiconductor materials of every  decreasing dimension requires improved understanding and control  of the synthesis of thin films on substrates.  This CAREER  research project focusses on the synthesis and characterization  of thin films grown on silica and organic substrates.  These  films will be grown using laser vaporization techniques and  characterized by atomic force microscopy.  Professor Spain's  undergraduate students will gain direct experience in each of the  aspects of this research as well as be exposed to new  instructional materials in lecture and laboratory formats that  emphasize the use of lasers.  High school students will also be  afforded opportunities to work in this new laser laboratory  facility.  Advising and mentoring of all of these students  regarding opportunities in science are important parts of the  educational thrusts of this CAREER proposal.",
