 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was submitted in response to the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry (EGB) solicitation, NSF 06-152.  It is being jointly funded by the Divisions of Ocean Sciences and Chemistry.   The proposed research will improve our understanding of the speciation and trophic transfer of selenium in San Francisco Bay.  Estuaries such as this, are complex physical, chemical and biological environments that are not only geochemically crucial (e.g. elemental transfer from the trash water to the marine environment), but are also economically vital (e.g. fisheries, transportation).  The estuarine geochemistry of trace elements has been well studied, but the linkage between the chemical speciation of these trace elements and their cycling throughout the whole estuarine food web is largely unknown.  The combination of innovative field and lab studies proposed here will allow researchers to more accurately predict the impact of Se input and speciation on the entire trophic structure of these environments.  Moreover, the methods and approach used here for Se should be applicable to other trace elements and other estuarine environments.  **  Cutter, OCE-9707946; Fisher OCE-9714308  $ + -  - \u00e1 +f/\u00aa\u00db=+- \u00b1- \u255d- \u00bcf +  +  -                         \u00c0   \u00c3   \u00bd   \u00da   \u00e3       \u00fa                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        u   )  c                       \u00db   +   \u00c0   \u00c0   \u00c3   \u00b3   \u00bd   \u00da   \u00b8  +$  \u00b8  +$  \u00b8  +$  \u00b8  +$  \u00b8  +$  P  +$  P  +$  P  +$  \u00f3  +$\u255d P      P      P  +$                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           H                      K          @\u00b9+     Normal       )  a  c                     ` A@\u00a0+- `  Default Paragraph Font           : $@  \u00a0 :  Envelope Address      \u00d0 @    + \u00cd+ \u00aa 1\u00a2 -\u2580   )  c      \u00da     \u00da     ++++    ++      \u00da             )   ,       \u00e3         \u00da                 b   q       '   ,   3   \u00b3   e   l   u   \u00f5   =       $   e   \u00d5   \u00b5   \u00a0   \u00d0   \u00aa   \u00c0   \u00c1                                                   z  harriet regina eason&\\\\CLM-07\\HEASON.$\\abstracts\\cutter.doc harriet regina eason&\\\\CLM-07\\HEASON.$\\abstracts\\fisher.doc+@HP LaserJet 4L LPT1: HPPCL5MS HP LaserJet 4L HP LaserJet 4L                      ` @  g                ,     ,                                                                                     @ MSUDN HP LaserJet 4L                          > ( `   d     HP LaserJet 4L                      ` @  g                ,     ,                                                                                     @ MSUDN HP LaserJet 4L                          > ( `   d      \u00d0                            `   +   Times New Roman   +   Symbol  &+   Arial   +   CG Times   +   Book Antiqua   +   Fences `   A \u00aa   f   h      + F + F          +   O           \u00aa                           $     ?",
