It is a high-tech barn raising where      volunteers in partnership with businesses and other organizations install high-      speed data wire in K-12 classrooms. It is a national, yet distributed effort, begun in      California about one year ago. Unsubstantiated estimates from the Netday      organizers suggest that more than 250,000 volunteers installed cable in more than      twenty percent of the nation's classrooms in the California and national Netdays.            Netday represents an important opportunity to bring Internet connectivity to all      students but there are serious policy implications that speak to the nation's goals      for creating a powerful and dynamic telecommunications infrastructure for      education. Netday is a strategic and important piece of the puzzle because it      focuses on the local infrastructure inside the school. In combination with the      possibility of reduced access costs under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, it      has the potential for bringing the Internet to the desktops of millions of students      to use for science and math applications.            Netday is defined as a project to install data wire in classrooms; wiring a school      site for a network is a necessary condition to get all students connected to the      Internet. Netday has resulted in many wired classrooms, however, we know      little about the schools' efforts to finish the task of connecting the schools to the      information infrastructure and preparing teachers to use it effectively.            In  spite of the significance of this phenomenon for changing the nature of      schooling, almost no reliable data about Netday exists. We need to know:              if this is primarily an event for the well-off suburbs that has the consequence of      increasing the gap between the information haves and have-nots;              if the model of pulling wires to five classrooms and not addressing the Internet      service to the building or the instructional applications of the Internet limits the      impact of the volunteer program;              the funding sources for the other parts of the puzzle and whether these are      differentially distributed according to wealth of the local community;              the immediate and long term roles of volunteers from the community and      from businesses in helping schools developed their infrastructure and change      teaching and learning.
