 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for funds to upgrade an existing 2-channel 500 MHz NMR  spectrometer to a 4  channel spectrometer with triple-axis gradients, high-order shims,  shaped pulses and new  probes, within the Center for NMR Spectroscopy at Washington State  University. The WSU  NMR Center is a central University facility, currently with three NMR  spectrometers, newly  remodeled space for 5 spectrometers, and a Ph.D.-level Facility  Manager. The Center services 13  Departments in 4 Colleges at WSU, with a typical annual usage by some  100 students, postdocs  and faculty. The research described here build on existing strengths at  WSU, and in particular  within the Departments of Biochemistry/Biophysics and of Chemistry, and  represents a major  initiative to establish the area of structural biology at WSU. The  projects in this proposal, the  majority of which are funded by NSF, include the use of high resolution  liquids NMR to the  study of enzymatic reaction mechanisms; the application of standard  triple resonance 3D and 4D  NMR to the structure determination of a protein-DNA complex, a complex  of a partially  unfolded protein with a chaperone, and a protein-RNA complex; the  application of  paramagnetic relaxation effect studies to characterize a ligand-enzyme  complex; and the  application of gradient-induced diffusion-filtered triple resonance NMR  to locate bound water  molecules in a model iron-sulfur protein, and use of 2D selective  excitation experiments to  characterize synthetic natural product diastereomers.",
