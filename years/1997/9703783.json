The research projects in  this grant are a continuation of seminal work by this PI on  dynamical properties of magnetic moments in magnetic thin films  and epitaxially grown magnetic superlattices. Here the PI is  proposing work on a possible new way of determining the exchange  coupling between thin magnetic films by examining the properties  of domain wall resonance. Other projects consist of: (1) Role of  structural defects on the magnetic order and magnetic phase  transition in thin films and (2) study of dynamic nonlinear  effects in arrays of quantum dots.  %%%  This young PI, at a predominantly undergraduate institution, is  being supported to work on the theory of magnetism in thin films  and very small grains. Some of the research focuses on finite  frequency behavior. The PI suggests that one can gather  information about the magnetic interactions by studying the  motion of domain walls with respect to each other, in adjacent  thin films. He is planning to develop a theoretical formalism to  describe the high power absorption in arrays of very small  grains. Finally he is also planning to study the relationship  between structural defects and the magnetic order and magnetic  phase transitions in thin films.  ***",
