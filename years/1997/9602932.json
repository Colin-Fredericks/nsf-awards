 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602932  Iwan    This award supports the participation of 7 US scientists in  a US-Japan seminar on Mitigation of Near-Field Earthquake  Damage in Urban Areas, to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii from  January 5-7, 1998.  The co-organizers are Professor Wilfred  Iwan of the California Institute of Technology and Professor  Kenzo Toki of Kyoto University.  The objectives of the  seminar are to: identify and record the important lessons  learned from the Northridge and Kobe earthquakes as regards  near-field ground motions and their effects on buildings;  develop a consensus regarding the nature of near-field  ground motions and their unique effects on structures of all  types; provide guidance for the development of appropriate  methods to characterize near-field ground motions for the  purpose of structural design; assess the adequacy of current  mitigation strategies as they relate to the effects of near-  field ground motions; and determine future needs for  mitigation research and applications regarding near-field  ground motions.   Participants are among the most active  researchers in the area of earthquake hazard mitigation, and  this seminar is expected to establish and nurture  collaborative research between US and Japanese scientists  who will mutually benefit from these research ties.  ***",
