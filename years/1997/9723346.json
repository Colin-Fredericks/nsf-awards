 "awd_abstract_narration": "Comparison of bio-molecular sequences has become essential  in modern molecular biology and biotechnology.  This project  will develop and test algorithmic techniques to explore DNA  and protein sequences, with emphasis on techniques for newer  or less analyzed biological phenomena.  There are several  areas of concentration: A fundamental re-examination of the  biological basis for alignment models and parameters in  light of  the recently available sequence data and the  accumulating understanding of mutation mechanisms; Expansion  of parametric alignment methods to apply to a broader range  of sequence analysis problems; Development of methods to  organize a large set of alignments, in order to present  alternative alignments without overwhelming the researcher;  Formalizing notions of repeated substrings containing  variations, and exploiting deep theorems from the study of  exact repeats; Connecting the problem of protein structure  alignment to a body of efficient techniques from Location  Theory.    Molecular sequence comparison is the essential complement of  projects, such as the human genome project, that are  obtaining the full DNA sequence transcript of various  genomes.  Comparison of sequences inside and across species  has tremendously accelerated many tasks in molecular biology  and biotechnology.    The potential impact of this project will be in the  development of more biologically based alignment models, in  the production of novel software, and in the adaptation of  mature mathematical and computational techniques to problems  in molecular biology.  Since sequence comparison has now  become critical in molecular biology and in many aspects of  commercial bio-technology and pharmaceutical companies,  improved models and software for sequence comparison may  have a significant impact on the way disease genes are  identified, on the way newly identified genes are understood  to function, and on the way new candidate molecular targets  for medicines are identified.    This work  is funded by the Computational Biology Activity  (BIO) and the program in the Theory of Computing (CISE).",
