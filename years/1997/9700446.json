 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  award  funds investigation of an approach to detecting  and  recognizing  deformable articulated shapes, such  as  people  and  animals,  from real images.  The approach involves  specifying  a  \"language\" for representing such objects, based on previous  work  on  deformable  template models.  These models represent  objects  probabilistically,  where  the  probabilities  are  required   to  specify  likely geometric deformations of the object and  of  the  imaging  function. To handle effects such as lighting changes  or  partial  occlusion  of  the object.  These models,  however,  are  complex,  and  so  detecting  them  in  images  poses  formidable  combinatorial optimization challenges.  This research explores  a  strategy  which makes use of a small number of image \"primitives\"  which can be thought of as key features.  These may include  both  local   image  structures  such  as  image  corners  and   larger  structures  such  as symmetric shapes.  These  should  be  simple  enough  that well-established optimization techniques can  detect  them  optimally.  The primitives are desaribed probabilistically,  like the object models, enabling the use of information theory to  quantify  how  much  information a particular primitive  provides  about the preseance or absence, or configuration of the object in  an  image.  It also enables optimal choices of primitives  to  be  made,  with  the  goal of finding primitives  that  are  easy  to  compute and convey maximal information about the objects  in  the  image.",
