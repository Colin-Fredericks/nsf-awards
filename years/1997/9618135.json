It is suggested    that proto- and micrometazoan grazers balance production of sediment    chemo- and photolithotrophs and thus become important players in the    dynamics of reduced and oxidized forms of sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon,    and possibly Mn and Fe.  This idea is supported by the results of    previously work, pilot data, and literature information. All these data    suggest the following ideas.  1. Major sediment microbacterivores    (flagellates, ciliates, nematodes, and others) are concentrated in a    specific sediment layer, at and immediately below oxic/anoxic interface.    2.  It is exactly in this sediment layer that most sulfide, ammonium,    and methane oxidizing chemolithotrophs, as well as anaerobic    photosynthesizers, are known to concentrate.  3. In this particular    layer, which exhibits increased grazing pressure over bacteria,    micrograzers appear to remove daily up to 50% of bacterial standing    stock.  Based on the above evidence, the following hypothesis is    advanced.   Proto- and micrometazoan grazing controls bacterial dynamics    in a specific sediment layer at and immediately below the oxic/anoxic    interface.        The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the rates of bacterivory by    sediment flagellates, ciliates, nematodes, and other micrograzers, with    bacterial standing stock and bacterial production in the identified    sediment layer. This will be done by a combination of classical, modern,    and novel approaches. Seasonality will be examined by conducting the    experiments in two different seasons, which were previously shown to    contrast with each other in the microbial food web structure. At each    seasonal time point, experiments will account for daily dynamics in    grazing activity and vertical migrations of prospective bacterivores.    Many key techniques to b e used here have been substantially improved,    and supporting evidence collected, under prior NSF support. The model    community (fine intertidal sands, Boston Harbor) has been under study    for several years and is uniquely suited for the planned research.  This    work is one of the first to introduce spatial motives into studies of    sediment microbial food webs. The target of this research are those    functional types of bacteria that are particularly important in sediment    biogeochemistry, nutrient recycling, and sediment-water exchange. The    significance of studying mechanisms governing these bacteria dynamics    goes therefore beyond its intrinsic value for detailing benthic    microbial food web structure, and is important in a much larger    ecological context.    ***",
