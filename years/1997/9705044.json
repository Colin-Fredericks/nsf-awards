The overall  aim in this project is to study the possible ways of  increasing the energy content (which has been measured to be  at best 1/3 of the theoretically expected amount) of a rare  earth-transition metal magnet.  Additional goals include an  understanding of ways of increasing the transition  temperature and  the magnetization at a finite temperature.  These studies are carried out using a self-consistent spin-  polarized electronic structure calculations, incorporating a  general, non-collinear magnetic structure.  The effects of  finite temperature, thermodynamic averaging are carried out  using a Monte Carlo procedure.  There are plans to apply the  insight gained to other problems such as exchange coupled  hard-soft magnetic phases and magnetic superlattices.  This  work is a continuation of a long standing collaboration with  an experimental colleague.  %%%  This senior theorist  PI from an EPSCOR state has been  awarded this grant to work on a subject of considerable  technological and also of fundamental interest.  The overall  aim in this project is to study the possible ways of  increasing the energy content (which has been measured to be  at best 1/3 of the theoretically expected amount) of a rare  earth-transition metal magnets.  The principal approach  consists of total energy calculation of electrons in the  presence of arbitrary magnetic order.  The PI is also  planning to study several other magnetic materials such as  exchange coupled hard-soft magnetic phases and magnetic  superlattices.  This work is a continuation of a long  standing collaboration with an experimental colleague.  ***",
