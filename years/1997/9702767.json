 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of multiprocessor computer systems is  increasingly common in scientific and numeric  computing. In developing applications for  multiprocessor systems, new challenges arise in  coordinating concurrent accesses to shared data.  This is traditionally achieved through locking,  which often restricts parallelism, and can also  cause performance bottlenecks because delayed  processes can cause others to wait.  This work  aims to eliminate locking from multiprocessor  applications through the use of transparent,  wait-free implementations of user-supplied  transactions, which ensure that delayed  processes never cause others to wait. In this  project, wait-free implementations will be  designed that automatically resolve conflicts  between concurrent transactions, and exploit  parallelism between nonconflicting transactions.  Their performance will be studied through  simulation and applications. Finally, a seamless  interface for application code will be developed  on several systems.  The education plan of this  project focuses on integrating research and  education in concurrent programming. This  research will provide new tools for developing  efficient applications in multiprocessor  systems. These tools will be used in some of the  future courses in concurrent programming.  ***",
