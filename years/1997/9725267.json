 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science Writing Fellowships Program provides hands-on  laboratory training for young and mid-career science  journalists (newspaper, magazine, radio, television and free-  lance). It begins with an intensive one-week laboratory  course that focuses on cell and molecular biology and  continues for up to eight weeks, during which time fellows  participate in on-going laboratory projects or in  postdoctoral-level courses offered at the Marine Biological  Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.  Fellows also  have the opportunity to participate in environmental and  ecological research studies either locally or at the Toolik  Lake Research Station in Alaska.  Fellows are selected on  the basis of demonstrated writing or broadcasting skills and  the size and importance of the public they address.  Their  participation in the program provides them with a better  understanding of the complex subject matter of contemporary  biological, technological, and environmental science, and  with a better insight into who scientists are, what their  motivations are, and how they work.  Fellows form long-  lasting and informative relationships with each other as  well as individual scientists.  Their ability to inform the  public of the place of science and technology in  contemporary life and its relation to critical social and  political decisions, i.e., to enhance the science literacy  of their, is also significantly improved.",
