This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled \"Dispersal,  area and edge effects, and the fragmentation of Amazonian  tree populations.\"  This study examines the effects of  forest fragmentation on tree populations in Brazil.  Adults  and seedlings are being mapped and tissue collected from  different-sized patches.  Microsatellite markers are being  used to reconstruct parentage relations and assess the  effect of patch area and edge on pollen and seed dispersal  and effective population size.  Valuable information is  being gained on the ecology of species interactions in  heterogeneous environments with important implications for  conservation theory and the design of nature reserves.",
