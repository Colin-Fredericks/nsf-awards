 "awd_abstract_narration": "Friedman proposes to continue his work establishing the independence from the usual axioms of mathematics (i.e., Zermelo-Frankel set theory with the axiom of choice) of some simple and basic finite combinatorial statements.  Recent work of the PI discusses versions that assert that in every collection of finite functions satisfying a certain coherence condition, some element has a very strong combinatorial property related to Ramsey theory.  He proposes to relate these examples to the fast growing numerical functions associated with the relevant large cardinal axioms.  In addition, he has discovered a family of transfer principles which establish a  new kind of formal relationship between finite set theory and transfinite set theory. In particular, he has shown that certain large cardinal axioms are equivalent to transfer principles asserting that any statement of a simple kind that is true about the functions on the natural numbers is true about the functions on the ordinals. The PI proposes to extend this work to stronger large cardinal axioms, and also to formulate and investigate related transfer principles from the hereditarily finite sets to arbitrary sets.  An independent statement is a mathematical assertion which cannot be proved true or false within the usual axioms for mathematics. The previously known independent statements have certain unsatisfactory features which make them very  atypical of normal everyday mathematical assertions. Friedman has discovered some examples which are much closer to normal mathematics in terms of both concreteness and naturality and proposes to continue the search for more concrete and natural examples. His examples also have the positive feature that the assertions can be proved using certain well studied new axioms for mathematics (so called large cardinal axioms), but not otherwise. The PI also has established an entirely new way in which these new axioms arise - they can be thought of as the natural extension of known facts in the context of the inte gers. He proposes to extend this new way of looking at these new axioms for mathematics to yet stronger new axioms for mathematics.",
