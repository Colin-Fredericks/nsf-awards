Schall  Affiliation:                          University of Tulsa        The investigator proposes to initiate research in the area of nucleation of protein crystals. This is an important area with tremendous applications in protein purification, structure determination etc.   However, protein crystallization is still an art, to a large extent, and it is important that new researchers bring scientific rationales to the phenomenon thereby allowing technological exploitation.      The investigator qualifications are excellent at this stage of research experience and maturity.  The institutional facilities are appropriate, but the university has not done much to encourage research activity by providing a start up package for the PI.  It is disappointing that the PI has to purchase even basic research instrumentation (mixer, analytical balance) from the grant; the institution should have helped in this regard.     Nevertheless, this is a worthy PI who has shown promise in her graduate work, and the grant should foster the development of her research career.     The program officer recommends funding of this proposal.",
