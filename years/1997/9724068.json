 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:  Sternberg, W.  IBN-9724068  The goal of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms of pain inhibition in male and female mice.  The experience of pain is dependent not only on peripheral activation of pain receptors but also on influences from higher brain centers that modulate the pain experience. Pain usually serves as a warning signal, preventing further use of the injured area to promote healing; however,  there are situations when pain perception would be counter-adaptive such as during conditions of \"fight-or-flight\" when the brain perceives a threatening situation and temporarily blocks any incoming pain messages to allow the organism to cope with the potentially pain producing event, and live to fight or flee again.  This phenomenon of pain inhibition during threatening events is known as \"stress-induced analgesia\", or SIA.  Many animals, including humans, exhibit SIA responses under a wide variety of \"stressful\" laboratory and real-life situations.  That the brain has the ability to inhibit pain perception implies that there may be ways of artificially activating these systems to treat pain in individuals who are unable to experience pain relief by currently available methods, such as those suffering from chronic pain.   It is believed that non-traditional methods of producing analgesia such as hypnosis, acupuncture, or even placebo analgesia, are due to the activation of endogenous pain inhibitory pathways.  Another minimally invasive way to activate the brain's own mechanisms of pain relief is to use pharmaceuticals which mimic the action of the neurotransmitters which are normally used to communicate between neurons in the pain inhibition pathway.   Morphine works in this way to produce analgesia by binding to receptors in pain inhibitory pathways which normally accept the brain's own opiate peptides (the endorphins, enkephalins and dynorphins).  However, morphine has several liabilities when used in a clinical setting over prolonged periods (such as is necessary for the treat ment of chronic pain), so investigators are currently examining other non-opioid neurotransmitters which play a role in pain inhibition as possible candidate systems for analgesic drug development. One system that has been implicated in non-opioid SIA is the excitatory amino acid class of neurotransmitters (glutamate and aspartate) which bind to the NMDA subtype of receptor.  Recent research has established the existence of NMDA-mediated SIA in mice; however, this appears to be specific to male mice only.  The non-opioid analgesia displayed by female mice following the same stressor (3-min cold water swim), while equivalent in magnitude to that exhibited by males, cannot be characterized as being NMDA-mediated, and therefore must involve other neurotransmitters.  Follow-up research determined that females have a mechanism of non-opioid analgesia that is specific to their gender, and is dependent on the presence of estrogen for it's expression.  The goal of the PI is to determine which neurotransmitters are responsible for non-opioid analgesia in female mice of varying ages, and  how varying hormonal states influence the neurochemical nature of the analgesia exhibited following swim stress.  This should lead to a better understanding of the neurotransmitters that underlie non-opioid SIA in female mice and may contribute to the development of analgesic drugs that will be particularly effective at combating pain in the female.",
