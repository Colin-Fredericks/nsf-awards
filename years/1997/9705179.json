 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705179  Clopton  This project supports integrated faculty and undergraduate student research on the diversity of certain microscopic parasitic protists that inhabit the digestive tracts of insects, millipedes, centipedes, and crustaceans (macroarthropods).  These protists are known as \"eugregarines,\" and the organisms they inhabit are the most speciose of all organisms on earth.  During the project, it is expected that 150-200 species of eugregarines from 12 different families will be recovered from 125 arthropod species representing 46 families; these organisms will be collected from a range of 12 different habitats in the Nebraska sandhills.  The project has implications for ecology, agriculture, and medicine, because of the importance in those disciplines of the arthropod groups to be studied.  Further, there is currently no museum collection of eugregarines in North America, and no survey of these organisms has ever been carried out for this continent. Products of this project will include specimen collections that will be deposited at the Nebraska State Museum, taxonomic catalogs of eugregarines and their hosts in the Nebraska sandhills, an online specimen database, and WWW pages that will provide identification keys, images, and descriptions of the eugregarines.  Also, 12 undergraduate students will be involved in the research, and thus will receive field experience and training in systematics.  The project is jointly funded by the Biotic Surveys and Inventories Program and the Long Term Projects in Environmental Biology Cluster.",
