 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rutgers U.   Initial studies of reforestation have emphasized ecological not human dimensions.  The current research project aims to explore the human aspects of reforestation in an old colonization zone in Ecuador's Amazon region which colonists first deforested thirty years ago.  Four factors are related to reforestation: urban development and the growth of part-time farming, declines in soil fertility, declines in economic returns from agriculture, and institutional policies which disadvantage smallholders and encourage land abandonment.  Current and former farmers in a four village region will be interviewed.  In addition studies of soil and vegetation will also be carried out.  Land use changes precipitated by political reform, pest infestation, aging among settlers and the lure of urban jobs will be emphasized.  The research will offer a detailed explanation for the turnaround in forest cover trends in the Upano-Palora region and also will suggest policy directions that might expedite reforestation in other deforested regions of the world.",
