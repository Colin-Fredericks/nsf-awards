 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Archaeological Studies Program is part of the Sociology/Archaeology Department.  In 1993, the university completed an institutional strategic planning process in order to emphasize the priorities and strengths of the institution.  Archaeological Studies was specifically singled out as a program of exceptional strength and given high priority for resources.  Unlike most archaeology programs, which tend to focus on one type of archaeology, this program is designed to be comprehensive and interdisciplinary.  The curriculum includes coursework in prehistoric archaeology, classical archaeology, human osteology, geoarchaeology, historical archaeology, cultural anthropology, and cultural resources management.  All of this fields are integrated by the unifying theme of cultural ecology.  A minor in geoarchaeology is being added in 1997.      This program is actively involved in the preparation of new classroom teachers Through the Archaeology Education Program.  The Archaeology Education Program actively involves the School of Education students in hands-on learning in the science of archaeology and prepares them to incorporate this training into their classrooms.  Classes offered to teachers include \"Archaeology for Teachers,\" \"Archaeology Field School for Teachers,\" and \"Laboratory Methods for Teachers.\"   The new laboratory facilities will enable this program to significantly improve these courses.  The staff members of the Archaeology Education program are certified teachers, which allows them to help education majors incorporate appropriate material into classes designed for students from the Kindergarten to the 12th grade level.    *",
