 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617892  Harvey       The use of molecular organic markers has provided  valuable information on a wide range of inputs and processes  which occur in the worlds oceans and sediments.  What is  often absent from these observations, is quantitative  information on the relationship of biological processing in  the water column and sediments to the molecular signal which  is ultimately preserved in the geological record.  Such  information may be particularly important for the long chain  alkenones, a group of compounds present in several species  of oceanic and coastal prymnesiophyte algae which are now  being widely used to detail both recent and historical  records of sea surface temperature.  Recent disparities in  temperature predictions and isotopic signature have been  observed, yet no mechanistic information is available on the  alkenones and related lipids after initial cellular  biosynthesis to document diagenetic effects.  This work will  focus on the two major routes for the alteration of  alkenones, alkenes and alkyl alkenoates in marine systems:  zooplankton grazing and microbially mediated processes.  The  project will provide fundamental information on the  synthesis and fate of the alkenones and related lipids in  the marine water column and surface sediments and validate  the potential for these compounds or their degradation  products to provide a quantitative measure of sea surface  temperature in present and past oceans.  ***",
