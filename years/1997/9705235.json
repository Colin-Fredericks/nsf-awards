 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research presents a new concept dealing with the development of a  multi-span continuously prestressed concrete bridge system that requires no shoring or forms and has superior characteristics compared to conventional continuous bridge systems.  The non-corrosive bridge system will be built of:  (i) modified precast pretensioned, with internal carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) strands, Double-T (DT) girders, (ii) cast-in-place continuous deck, reinforced with glass carbon fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP or CFRP) rebars, connected to the DT through CFRP or GFRP shear connectors, and (iii) externally draped continuous CFRP post-tension strands.  An analytical and experimental study will be conducted by Junior and Senior  undergraduate students to examine the static, dynamic, fatigue and ultimate load characteristics of the multi-span continuously prestressed new bridge system. These include cracking, flexural strength, punching shear strength, damping response, natural frequencies and associated mode shapes and fatigue strength.  The multi-span continuously prestressed bridge system and its construction technique present a leap forward as well as a breakthrough in  the development  of a new approach for non-corrosive efficient bridges.  It will result in considerable savings in construction time and costs and in the complete elimination of corrosion problems in future USA bridges.  The ongoing implementation and design of the three-span simply-supported bridge over the Rouge River in the state of Michigan is a testimony to the success of this innovative bridge system and the quality of the research work of undergraduate students.",
