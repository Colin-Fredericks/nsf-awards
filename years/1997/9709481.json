 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Abstract          Adaptive sampling is a sampling design in which the selection  of units in the sample may depend on the values of the variable  of interest observed during the survey. The sampling intensity  may be increased in the vicinity of high observed abundance with  an adaptive sampling method. The method provides an efficient way  of sampling when the population has a clustered structure and is  also applicable to clumped or aggregated distributionsas as are  often found in sampling plants, animals pollution sites and  certain problems in epidemiology.        Without making specific assumptions about the distribution of  the population, various estimators had been proposed for adaptive  cluster sampling. (In adaptive cluster sampling, an initial  sample of units is selected and whenever the value of the  variable of interest satisfies a specified condition, the  neighbouring units are added to the sample.) These estimators are  unbiased and can be used in very general settings. However, in  those cases where we do have existing prior information about the  population of interest, it may be possible to derive more  efficient estimators using a Bayesian analysis.        Also, a Bayesian analysis yields one distribution (the  posterior distribution) for the unknown parameters, and from this  distribution a large number of questions can be answered  simultaneously. For instance, one can obtain accuracy measures  for the estimates with little extra effort.  In this project, we  are going to use a Bayesian approach for estimating the  population total, which is an important practical problem.",
