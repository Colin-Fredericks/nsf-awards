In 1966, Mark Kac popularized the question, \"Can one hear  the shape of a drum?\" Viewing a drumhead as a plane domain,  the frequencies produced when the drum vibrates correspond  to the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator. Thus the  mathematical formulation of the question posed by Kac is:  \"Does the spectrum of a plane domain determine its geometry?\"  Inverse spectral geometry studies the generalization of this  question to Riemannian manifolds.    This proposal addresses three topics in inverse spectral  geometry: (1) the classical trace formula and the length  spectrum, (2) spectral rigidity and the Laplace spectrum on  1-forms,and (3) spectral analysis of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The  first two topics concern Riemannian nilmanifolds, which have  played a vital role in demonstrating properties not determined by  the spectrum.  In the first project, wave invariants, constructed  using the trace formula, motivate a new notion of length  spectrum, which will be studied toward proving a necessary  condition that closed geodesics on isospectral manifolds must  satisfy. In the second project, one-dimensional invariant  subspaces of the Laplacian will be examined to show that the  1-form spectrum detects the Sunada method.  In the third topic,  the tools of hyperbolic geometry and topology are brought in to  elucidate the relationship between spectrum and geometry,  particularly on geometrically infinite hyperbolic 3-manifolds  that are realized as limits of geometrically finite ones.",
