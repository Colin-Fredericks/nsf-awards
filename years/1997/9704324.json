 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lai and Siegmund  9704324    The investigators develop  a sequential method of change-point detection involving algorithms that are  not too demanding in computational and memory requirements for on-line implementation and yet are  nearly optimal from a statistical viewpoint.  Powerful techniques to tackle this problem are derived from recent advances in sequential testing theory and boundary crossing problems in random fields.  A closely  related direction of research is fixed sample change-point problems and their applications to signal  detection and gene mapping.  Related fundamental problems in boundary crossing probabilities of random  processes and random fields are also investigated and lead to definitive solutions of some long-standing  questions concerning the distribution of generalized likelihood ratio statistics in change-point models.  A  third related area of research is estimation and control of time series models and stochastic dynamical  systems whose parameters may change with time.  Although in practice abrupt parameter changes  typically occur very infrequently, the unknown times of their occurrence have led to prohibitive  complexity of the Bayes estimators and controllers in the literature.  By using parallel recursive  algorithms and combining some new ideas in sequential change-point detection with empirical Bayes  methodology, these difficulties are resolved to obtain asymptotically efficient estimation and control  schemes of manageable complexity.      One important objective of this research is the development of a powerful statistical methodology for quality control of modern industrial processes and for automated fault detection in complex manufacturing  systems.  Another objective development of  statistical methods appropriate for analysis of genetic linkage  data related to disease susceptibility and other traits in humans, animals and plants and for extraction of   relevant information from these data that may ultimately lead to better diagnostic tests and tr eatments of  the disease.  Applications involve the strategic areas of manufacturing and biotechnology.",
