The focus of this project is  a study of the low-latitude ionosphere.  The major goals of  this project are:  1) to initiate discussion among  scientists from Japan and the western Pacific region; and  (2) to develop a cooperative plan that will lead to the  establishment of a chain of ionospheric monitoring stations  that will extend from Taiwan in the northern hemisphere,  through the Philippines and eastern Malaysia, and into  Indonesia in the southern hemisphere.    Cooperative research with scientists from developing  countries il the western Pacific region is expected to have  important mutual benefits.  For scientists from developed  countries, the monitoring stations will provide unique and  important measurements, which can be used to address some of  the outstanding questions that remain in low-latitude  ionospheric physics.  An additional benefit will be the  local support provided by scientists from those regions in  the operation of the monitoring stations.  Scientists from  the developing countries will benefit from establishment of  important research facilities in their region and the  availability of data from the monitoring stations.  Through  the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will  broaden our base of knowledge and promote international  understanding and cooperation.  ***",
