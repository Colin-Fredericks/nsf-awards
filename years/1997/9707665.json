 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707665  Werren  Wolbachia are a widespread group of intracellular bacteria that are found in the reproductive tissues of many invertebrates.  These bacteria are \"inherited\" through the eggs and alter reproduction of their hosts in several interesting ways. For example, many strains of Wolbachia cause \"cytoplasmic incompatibility\" an incompatibility between sperm and egg that causes destruction of paternal chromosomes and prevents development of the embryo. Wolbachia are of special interest because they may accelerate the formation of new species, and are of wide interest as potential agents for insect pest control and for studying fertilization and early development.  Research here focuses on the question \"Are Wolbachia involved in reproductive isolation between populations and species (i.e. are they a mechanism of speciation)?\".  The proposed research will address this question in a series of laboratory and natural population experiments  By combining studies of natural systems and experimental populations, this research should contribute significantly to our understanding of the potential role of Wolbachia in causing reproductive isolation, and the ability of Wolbachia to move between closely related species.",
