During their planning activities they will address issues involved  in attracting the traditionally underserved and large Hispanic  population of Dade County, Florida to the educational programs of  the zoo.  The planning grant will support 1) audience research  within Dade County, 2) a national study to see what others have  done to attract diverse audiences, 3) a three-day invitational  planning conference, 4) site visits and focused research by  Metrozoo staff on attracting a diverse audience, and 5)  dissemination of the information about marketing strategies and  programming techniques developed during the planning activities to  zoos and science museums across the country.  The planning process  will culminate in the development of a long-range exhibition,  educational program, and marketing plan for the zoo's new Education  Court scheduled to open in 1998.",
