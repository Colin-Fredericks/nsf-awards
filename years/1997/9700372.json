 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crucial to the success of ultra-precision fabrication systems are advancements in tool actuation technologies that provide large workspace volume of tool motion at nanometric accuracy with high dynamic stiffness.  Recent developments in the Magnetic Suspension Actuator (MSA) are characterized by narrow gap operation and low dynamic stiffness.  This has resulted in a suspension actuators that possess either multi-degree-of-freedom actuation with low workspace volume or large travel in small (one or two) degrees of freedom with low dynamic stiffness.  This research plan is to develop an MSA with six degrees of freedom with large travel range, high stiffness, high bandwidth, and nanometric trajectory tracking accuracy.  The approach to accomplish this goal consists of two basic components: (1) development of magnetic actuation technology that uses a rational basis for the optimal location of the electromagnets based on dynamic force balance, and (2) development of nonlinear control strategies that utilize nonlinear model of the electromagnetic field to obtain large travel.   The development of MSA is valuable to motion applications which require dynamic interactions with the environment.  The fine motion control and large travel properties of the MSA development has the potential of enabling accurate electrical and mechanical probing of the silicon wafers in semiconductor manufacturing over large areas at high velocities.  High-stiffness, high-bandwidth properties of the MSA are critically important to ultra precision metal cutting, non-circular turning, and micromachining where nanometric tracking accuracy at high bandwidths in face of significant external forces is required.",
