First specific objective of this research  effort is to develop a working prototype of a  preconditioned ceramic filter and, through rigorous testing  under varying flow conditions at ambient temperature and  pressure, show its effectiveness in protecting downstream  components of a fuel cell.  A second objective of this  research effort is to develop a method of reducing sulfur  and other contaminants from the coal gas by introducing  controlled size sorbent particles while zmg candle filter  pressure differential and the risk of filter candle  blinding or plugging. Coal is the most widely distributed  and readily available resource in USA.    Currently about 50% of electricity production is by  directly burning coal or coal gas.  Combustion and  gasification of coal produces both primary and secondary  pollutants.  One of the alternative way to utilize this  vast coal resource of the nation and world with relatively  cleaner emission is the use of coal gas in fuel cell for  power generation.  Fuel cell provide a new and exciting  option for the efficient conversion of fossil fuels to  electricity with much reduced emmission of pollutants.    Commercial development of fuel-cell technology has been  underway in the United States for over 25 years.  A variety  of fuel cells have been developed of which molten    carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) appears to be the optimum fuel  cell design approach.  Gasified coal is expected to be the  major source of fuel gas for MCFCS, but because coal  contains many contaminants in a wide range of  concentrations, fuels derived from this source also  contains a considerable amount of contaminants.  A critical  concern with these contaminants is the concentration level  that can be tolerated by MCFCs without suffering  significant degradation in performance or reductio n in cell  life.  Ceramic candle filtration is an attractive  technology for the removal of particulate at high  temperature in Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion (PFBC),  Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and other  coal utilization processes.  Due to their simple, cost  effective design, high temperature capability, and  effectiveness in particulate removal. ceramic candles  easily achieve New Source Performance Standards and Clean  Air Act mandates for particulate emissions, as well as gas  turbine manufacturer particulate requirements.  Although  the application of ceramic candle technology to PFBC and  IGCC applications has been vast, little progress has been  made to integrate candle filter technology to address the  very different and more stringent gas stream clean-up needs  of fuel cell applications.  This two year project will  focus on the design, testing, and development of unique  preconditioned candle filter which when combined with a  patented technique for the use of a controlled particle  size, once-through sorbent, will reduce the risk of fuel  cell stack fouling and simultaneously increase filter  candle life expectancy and performance    by maintaining a porous dust cake on the filtering  surfaces.  A simple candle filtering will be constructed at  Prairie View A&M University.  Testing of several different  preconditioned filter candles will be conducted under  various flow conditions.  Optimum preconditioning coating  will be recommended for a given set of conditions.  Long  term effect of sorbent particle size will also be explored.  ***",
