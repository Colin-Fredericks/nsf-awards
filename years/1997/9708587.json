 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708587  Haan    Many papers in the macroeconomics literature argue that heterogeneity is important for explaining the time series behavior of macroeconomic variables.  For example, when the lack of frictionless trading in a complete set of financial assets prevents agents from diversifying idiosyncratic income risk, this risk typically affects aggregate variables like asset prices.  In this case, the standard assumptions of the representative agent framework are violated and the amount of heterogeneity in agents' wealth and income levels affects the behavior of the variables in the model  The empirical failures of the representative agent framework have contributed to the popularity of models with heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets.  Models with heterogeneous agents have now been used for studying a wide range of topics in macroeconomics including asset pricing, consumption behavior, economic growth and investment behavior, the monetary transmission mechanism, business cycle studies, labor economics, and the international business cycle.   Quantitative analysis plays a crucial role in economics.  Solving dynamic equilibrium models with heterogenous agents, however, is a challenging problem because the cross-sectional distribution of agents' characteristics typically is a high dimensional endogenous object that is part of the set of state variables.  This project studies dynamic equilibrium models with a large number of agents and aggregate uncertainty.  This involves developing new algorithms to deal with the complexity of these models as well as analyzing some new important economic questions that could not have been addressed in the existing models that either assume a small number of different (types of) agents or no aggregate uncertainty.   In addition the project continues the work on the heteroskasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) covariance matrix estimator, VARHAC, developed in the investigator's previous NSF grant.",
