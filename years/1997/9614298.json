 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614298  Aprison    The Museum of Science and Industry will develop \"Genetics: Decoding  Life,\" a 4325 sq. ft. permanent exhibit about the basic principles  of genetics, the Human Genome Project, new tools and technology to  study life, and the biomedical and biotech applications resulting  from genetic information.  As a result of interacting with this  exhibit, visitors will understand the basic principles of genetics,  they will become familiar with the role of genes in the development  of life, they will learn something about how and why scientists  used genetic tools, and visitors will become aware of applications  of these principles and the potential social, ethical, medical and  economic outcomes.  In addition to the exhibit there will be a  number of complementary outreach programs.  An electronic web site  will be created, software used in the exhibit will be modified into  a format suitable for use in schools, computers loaded with genetic  programs will be loaned to Chicago public school groups, churches  and other community agencies, and the content of the exhibit will  be used to enhance special Lamaze and prenatal classes held at the  museum.  Special consideration will be given to developing the  relationship between the project personnel and the staff of the  Chicago Systemic Initiative.  They will work together to produce a  school program about genetics that will be suitable for grades 5 to  8.  School materials will include a teacher's guide for the  exhibit, a program of classroom activities, and materials to be  used before and after a trip to the museum to see the exhibit.",
