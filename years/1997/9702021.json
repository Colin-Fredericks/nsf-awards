This research in ultrafast optoelectronics developed from an earlier  collaboration (INT-9022623) between PI Shah and co-PI Arora of  TIFR that established the first and only picosecond spectroscopy  laboratory in India.  The scientific focus is: (1) energy relaxation  processes and rates in low-dimensional semiconductors and the  effect of relaxation dynamics on the performance of optoelectronic  devices fabricated from such structures; (2) development of  fabrication and characterization techniques for photoconducting  switches and electro-optic samplers, and (3) the use of such  optoelectronic devices for measuring the response of ultrafast  electronic devices.    Scope:  This award will provide the linkage costs for US and  Indian collaborators.  This study, while in the realm of fundamental  physics, is in an emerging research area that combines ultrafast  optics and electronics.  The topic is of considerable current interest  and the devices under study may in the future be integral to all  communication and computer systems.  In addition to initiating new  scientific collaborations, this project will contribute toward the  ultrafast spectroscopy laboratory at TIFR becoming a world-class  facility.  All the experimental work will be performed at TIFR and  will include advanced graduate students and postdocs.  The  scientific and technological benefits are mutual and the research  results will be published in international journals.          ***",
