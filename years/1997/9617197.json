Miser, Shivakant  University of Wyoming    CISE Research Instrumentation: High-Speed Cluster Computing at the University of Wyoming    This instrumentation grant enables research among the faculty in the Computer Science Department at the University of Wyoming, where distributed computing constitutes a focus area of research.  Most research today in the area of distributed computing centers around high-speed, high-bandwidth networks.  This funding   will enable research in at least three areas.- Runtime Support for Multidisciplinary Applications on Cluster Computers- Building Dependable Software using Group Communication Services - Real-time Distance Monitoring of Medical Information-The first is runtime support for multidisciplinary applications on cluster computers, in which several computing nodes are connected with a high-speed network to form a cluster computer.  This research area will focus on language and runtime support to enable efficient execution of multidisciplinary applications on this platform.-The second area of research involves building dependable thread-based communication services to enable reliable distributed software.  The goal of this research is to design reliable group communication services that can exploit a   high-speed network.- The third area of research supports real-time distance monitoring of medical information.  The goal of this research is to evaluate the abilities of a high-speed network to support real-time transmission and consumption of multimedia medical information.",
