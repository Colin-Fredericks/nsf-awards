Hybridization  of  the  localized  and   conduction  electron  systems  leads  to strongly  correlated  behavior  with  several manifestations which remain incompletely understood.  The  particular unusual effects of interest in this project  are  non-  Fermi-liquid behavior; superconductivity and magnetism  in  heavy  fermion compounds; and the formation of small energy gaps due  to  hybridization  in  small gap semiconductors  (Kondo  insulators).  These   effects  will  be  studied  under  changing  composition,  magnetic  field,  temperature  or pressure.  Measurements  to  be  performed  include  thermal, transport and  magnetic  properties;  additional measurements, in some cases with collaborations,  will  include  neutron  scattering, photoemission, electron  tunneling,  infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance.  %%%  This research project experimentally studies the unusual behavior  of  certain types of compounds which combine heavy (rare earth or  actinide elements) with lighter elements,  as for example in  the  intermetallic metal Uranium Beryllium 13. In this case deep  core  electrons  from  U remain localized on the U sites  but  interact  with free electrons from the Beryllium, an interaction that lends  very  peculiar  properties to the free or  conduction  electrons.  This  effect  leads  to  \"correlated electron\"  behavior  and  to  anomalies  in  \"electronic\" properties,  such as  the  electrical  conductivity, the electronic portion of the thermal conductivity,  the magnetic susceptibility, and others. The conduction electrons  behave  in  many  measurements as if their  masses  were  greatly  enhanc ed,  by  up  to three orders of magnitude (hence  the  name  \"heavy  fermion  compound\"), relative to the electronic  mass  in  vacuum  or  in simple metals such as sodium, copper or  aluminum.  The  study of these materials and their effects is valuable as  a  testing  ground for theories of electrical and related properties  of  solids, which can then be more confidently applied  to  other  systems; and in the search for novel properties and new compounds  which  may  find  new  application in technology.  This  research  project is interdisciplinary in nature and involves both graduate  and  undergraduate  students who will be excellently  trained  to  enter positions in industry, government or education.  ***",
