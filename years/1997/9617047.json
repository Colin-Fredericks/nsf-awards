Traditionally,  the functions of recognizing speech and recognizing the speaker  have been thought to involve separate processes and informational  attributes.  However, recent observations with auditory speech  suggest that these two functions might not be as separate as once  thought.  The same question arises for the visual domain:  How do  speechreading and face recognition functions interact?  The first  set of experiments will test if facial familiarity facilitates  speechreading.  The second series of experiments will explore if  the relationship between speechreading and face recognition could  be based on the use of common visual information for articulator  movements.  The experiments in this series will make use of a  point-light technique which involves placing small illuminated  dots on an otherwise darkened face.  This technique serves to  isolate articulator movement information and can convey a great  deal of speech information.  The third series of experiments will  test whether face processing and speechreading depend on the two  cerebral hemispheres in the same or different ways.  These  experiments will vary the amount of dynamic information available  in the stimulus by using static, moving, and point-light images.   The results of these experiments will be illuminating about  theories of face and speech perception as well as the general  issue of the separability of perceptual processes.  The  experiments should also help determine the salient information  for speechreading and face recognition.  This research should  ultimately be useful for designing speech and face recognition  devices as well as speechreading programs for the hearing  impaired.  ***",
