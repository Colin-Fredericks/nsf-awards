Studies on the  nature of P450-ligand interactions will be exploited as a  biocatalyst to design an innovative synthesis for the  industrially important carboxylic acid, 2-ethylhexanoate.  The biocatalysis pathway will lead to pollution prevention  since it will obviate the need for toxic and carcinogenic  heavy metals in this synthesis.  This synthesis was chosen  as a model for how the P450 enzyme family can be exploited  as a biocatalyst in general.  These same studies will be  used to develop predictive methodology that can be exploited  in the design of safer chemicals.  The predictive  methodology will allow for rapid decision making about the  potential of bioactivation in the development of new  chemicals.  Thus, less toxic chemicals can be designed into  chemicals for new applications and potentially hazardous  chemical identified rapidly.    The cytochromes P450 are a ubiquitous family of enzymes that  catalyze the reduction of molecular oxygen to a very  reactive monooxygen species.  This enzyme system is  responsible for the metabolism of both endogenous and  exogenous chemicals.  The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme  family has been called the most versatile biological  catalyst known.  This trait is a double edged sword that  makes the CYP enzyme family a diverse detoxifier of  chemicals, as well as, the major enzyme system responsible  for the production of toxic metabolites.  Thus, while the  enzymeis important in biosynthetic reactions, it is also  important in bioactivation of benign chemicals to  carcinogens and toxins.    The general objective of this proposal is to understand the  structural factors that govern cytochrome P450-ligand  interactions.  Active site mutants of P450cam will be  constructed and kinetically characterized.  Structural  information from these mutants, gained from Xray  crystallography and molecular dynamics studies, will define  factors  important in substrate binding to P450cam.  This  information can be used in the design of P450 mutants to  perform benign synthesis, in the design of safer chemicals  and in the design of P450 enzymes for bioremediation.  While  the development of bacteria for bioremediation is not within  the scope of this grant, the results obtained during this  project will be directly applicable to this endeavor.  Furthermore, general knowledge about the mechanism of ligand-  enzyme interactions, that can be applied to enzyme systems  other than P450, will be obtained.    The following are the specific objectives of this proposal:    (1.1) Produce P450cam active-site mutants F87W, Y96W, L244A,  and T185F.    (1.2) Chemically and kinetically characterize regio- and  stereospecificity of oxidations to the  industrially important product 2-ethylhexanoic acid by the  wild-type and mutant enzymes.    (1.3) Study enzyme-ligand interactions at the active site  using molecular dynamics.    (1.4)     Test the dynamics models by examination of crystal        structures of the enzyme and enzyme-ligand complexes.  ***",
