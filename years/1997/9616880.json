 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616880  Shklovskii  This grant to a senior, distinguished theorist involves  study of interplay between disorder and coulomb interaction,  a subject to which he has made several seminal  contributions.  This grant consists of three related  projects, all involving low to moderate magnetic fields.  In  one, the PI proposes to study the transport properties of a  crystal of charged bubbles (clusters of electrons) that has  recently been proposed as a possible ground state of a layer  of electrons in low magnetic fields.  In another project,  there are plans to study the crossover between the moderate  magnetic field regime represented by quantum Hall effect and  the oscillations in resisitivity at low fields, the  Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations.  Finally, there is a project  to study quantum version of the Coulomb gap, expected to be  present during a metal-insulator transition or near a  transition between the two plateaus in the quantum Hall  effect regime.  %%%  This grant to a senior, distinguished, theoretical physicist  is to study the subtle and complex properties of a thin  layer of electrons.  This PI is well known for his seminal  contributions to this subject.  In this grant, the work will  concentrate on the effects of impurities and interaction  between electron on electrical current in the presence of a  moderate magnetic field.  All of the projects involve  sophisticated state-of-the-art mathematical machinery and  includes further development of these mathematical tools.",
