This proposal  seeks to further out understanding of OM preservation by  evaluating in more detail the organic mineral to mineral surface  area ratio (OM:SA) which has recently been shown by this PI and  others to be useful for evaluating OM preservation in marine  sediments.  The proposed measurements are aimed at answering  fundamental questions in marine geochemistry about the factors  and processes that form and mold the OM:SA relationship.  A wide  range of approaches will be used to evaluate marine sediments,  including:  a combination of probing techniques (X-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV photooxidation, density  fractionation); adsorbing extracted organic matter to know  mineral phases; and, conducting microbial degradation  experiments.  The PI will conduct these experiments on samples  collected from contrasting redox environments and OM:SA settings.  The proposed studies build on successful experiments previously  conducted by the PI and should lead to a significant advancement  in our understanding of OM preservation in ocean sediments.",
