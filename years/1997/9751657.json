 "awd_abstract_narration": "San Diego Miramar College proposed to improve the quality of learning and breadth of instruction in Biotechnology by providing \"hands on\" laboratory experiences for both community college and high school students in their shared  teaching facility at Scripps Ranch High School.  Responding to the national need to implement biotechnology skill standards and improve biotechnology instruction, this project features training and practice in the use of industry-based research techniques with an emphasis on team work, critical thinking and problem solving skills.    Project objectives focus on helping students gain the laboratory competencies required for entering the field of biotechnology and/or for advanced study in the field.  During the term of the grant, instructional laboratory activities will be produced to develop student skills in: 1) basic laboratory techniques, 2) immunology, 3) tissue culture and 4) working with nucleic acids.    Project Co-PIs will join in a collaborative effort with industry representatives, Miramar faculty, Scripps Ranch High School faculty and other local educational institutions in order to recruit underserved and underrepresented students, accomplish project goals, and disseminate project results.  The instrumentation equipment requested will also be used to enhance biology and microbiology laboratories for both majors and non-majors.    Significance of the Miramar College ILI-IP project centers on the industry-education commitment to improving the quality of biotechnology education by utilizing local industry resources and expertise.  The enhanced offerings will increase the number of students majoring in science, transferring to four year colleges and/or receiving A.S. degrees and professional certificates.  In addition, the instructional materials developed under this project will provide a useful laboratory improvement model for other high school and community colleges.",
