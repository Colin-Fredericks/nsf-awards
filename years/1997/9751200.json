 "awd_abstract_narration": "The linguistics program takes an empirical approach to the science of language.  Students are encouraged whenever possible to experiment and find out for themselves, drawing their own conclusions based on real data.  To this end, a linguistics laboratory, intended to serve as a place where students can do their own research, as well as a place for class demonstrations, has been developed.  The laboratory had contained a Mac-Speech-Lab run on a Macintosh II acquired in 1990.  While this program has been very helpful and has seen a lot of use, it lacks the capability to do many crucial types of linguistic analysis.  This project expands the research capabilities of the linguistics laboratory to encourage student learning and research in other components of the speech signal such as air pressure and flow variables, vocal fold dynamics, and the articulatory acoustic interface.  The new equipment supplements the old equipment with instruments to record and analyze many different kinds of speech data.  These different types of analysis are available for expanded student research in the existing courses, as well as serve as a basis for a new full-semester course in experimental phonetics, replacing the intersession offering of acoustic phonetics.  Some of the new equipment is also occasionally being used for demonstrations in foreign language classes, as well as for a supplementary unit on speech for students in the physics department.  *",
