 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for a Molecular  Dynamics Storm 840, Power  Macintosh             7500, HP  LaserJet 4M plus, and 6 imaging  screens, to be placed in  the core facility             serving the three departments of Biology,  Molecular Biology  & Biochemistry, and             Chemistry.  The instrument  will be used  by  the  laboratories of  six major users, two             minor users, and other occasional users in these  departments.                    The  Storm 840  images  radioactive and  fluorescent blots and  gels with  five             orders of linear dynamic range, and a resolution  of 250 M for radioactive samples,             and 500 M for fluorescent  samples.   This  instrument will  provide  the  ability  to             accurately quantify radioactive and fluorescent  blots  and  gels,  which  is  not             currently  possible at  Wesleyan  University.  The  fluorescent  capability  will enable             the  use  of  fluorescent  labels  instead  of  radioactive labels  in many applications.             Substitution  of  chemifluorescent  techniques  for  chemiluminescent  techniques  will             provide both accurate quantitation of samples and  longer sample lifetime.                    The  Storm  imager  will  be  used  to  quantify  protein-DNA  and  protein-RNA             gel shifts, sequencing gels,  CAT  assays,  Western,  Northern,  and  Southwestern  blots,             RNA  footprints   and   toeprints,    pulse-chase  labeling  experiments,  processive   DNA             replication,  nucleotide  binding,  RNase  protection,  and  RT-PCR   assays.     These             methods  will  be  applied  to  several  different  projects.   These  include  studies   of:             Contribution  of  individual  structural  elements   to   the   folding   of   RNA;             Thermodynamic  and  structural  basis of  RNA-  protein  interactions;    Dissection    of             Drosophila  Paired   proteil  function;  Identification  of   imm unoglobulin-like             molecules  in   he  developing  CNS;  Mechanisms  of   protein  localization  in  scherichia             coli;  Identification  of  novel  antigens   for  Lyme   disease  diagnosis;   Biochemical             analysis  of  yeast  DNA  replication  and  repair  proteins;  and  The   role  of extracellular             matrix and signaling molecules in teratocarcinoma  stem cell differentiation.                    Matching  funds  from  Wesleyan  University  will  pay  for  50%  of  the   cost  of the             instrument.",
