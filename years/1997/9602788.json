 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Delaware-Bartol Research Institute (BRI), a non-profit research  organization, is located in Sharp Laboratory with the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Delaware. BRI is engaged in fundamental areas of research in theoretical and experimental physics, as well as participation in the University's Joint Graduate Program in Physics and Astronomy.  Research interests and activities span a wide range of disciplines and include both theoretical studies and in-house investigations, as well as in situ and remote observations of space, the Sun, and the interplanetary and interstellar mediums.  Most of the research activities are supported by the Computer Facility consisting of the Main Computer Room and the Computer Room Annex.  Research conducted in the facility is connected with computer simulations and analysis of data from experiments and from simulations in the broad field of space physics, fluid dynamics as applied to astrophysical plasma, and high energy air showers.  Computational components of these projects are limited by inadequate CPU power, data storage, and visualization and graphics capabilities.  Increased research needs have placed a strain on the central Computing Facility, which impedes on the ability to conduct research.  Funding from the Academic Research Infrastructure Program, combined with resources from the Bartol Research, will be used to modernize and enhance the mechanical, electrical and environmental aspects of the 12 year old facility.  Renovations include replacing  an air conditioning unit with one that possess environmental controls, installing new ductwork associated with the air conditioning system, and installing environmental monitoring capabilities.  The electrical power and distribution equipment will be upgraded, including the addition of an Uninterruptible Power Supply system. These improvements will allow the Bartol Computing Facility to operate more safely and efficiently and accommodate for future growth, and, therefore, enabling the Institute to provide high quality computational support for various research efforts.",
