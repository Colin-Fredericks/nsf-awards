 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will advance automatic storage allocation through  the use of experimental techniques, and will advance  education in experimental computer science. Automatic  deallocation of dynamically allocated storage is called  \"Garbage collection\" (GC). GC helps to avoid a variety of  common but serious programming errors. Unfortunately, it may  adversely affect program performance. Modern collectors  probably provide acceptable performance, but there is a lack  of experimental evidence to support this claim, hindering  the adoption of GC, despite its advantages.  The goal of  this work is to provide a better understanding of GC  performance, both aiding its adoption when performance is  adequate, and providing detailed quantitative information  about how performance needs to be improved when it is  inadequate. In particular, the work will compare the  performance of copying and mark-and-sweep collection on  modern computer architectures. The focus of the work will be  building a GC testbed, which will facilitate the systematic  comparative study of a variety of GC techniques. The  educational goal is to improve the teaching of experimental  computer science. A new course is proposed that will  explicitly teach experimental CS. The pedagogiaal approach  is the standard one used to teach other experimental  sciences, in which well-known experiments are repeated,  enabling students to gain hands-on experience with the basic  methodologies and techniques.***",
