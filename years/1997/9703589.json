 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Hans J. Reich, of the Department of Chemistry at the University   of Wisconsin at Madison, is supported by the Organic Synthesis Program   for his synthetic and mechanistic studies of organometallic reagents.    His research is aimed at gaining a mechanistic understanding of a number   of important reactions and processes in organolithium chemistry,   including chelation effects, the role of ion pair structure on   reactivity, the formation and potential interconversion of allenyl and   propargyllithium reagents, the properties of stereochemically defined   organolithium reagents, and the thermodynamics of the lithium metalloid   exchange reaction.  With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Hans J.   Reich, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin at   Madison, studies the chemistry of certain classes of organometallic   compounds, molecules bearing metal-carbon bonds.  His research is focused   primarily on organolithium compounds, which play a central role in both   organic and inorganic chemistry.  Lithium reagents are often used in   reactions forming new carbon-carbon bonds and thereby helping to build up   the often complex structures of compounds displaying interesting chemical   or biological activity.  In addition, they are also common precursors to   many other organometallic reagents which provide additional opportunities   to synthetic chemists.  Professor Reich explores organolithium compounds   in solution in order to provide a better understanding of the factors   influencing their structure and chemistry, thereby helping to achieve   better predictability of their chemical reactions and expanding the   applications of lithium reagents.",
