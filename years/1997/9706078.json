 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this grant is to support research on a new concept related to   error correcting codes and stream ciphers.  Pseudorandom binary sequences   are used for error correction in the presence of noise by introducing redundancy   to messages and for security by introducing pseudorandom noise to messages.    This research concerns pseudorandom sequences and the fundamental properties   that make them useful for coding and cryptography.     The covering radius of a code is the smallest radius such that every vector of   the given length is contained in at least one sphere of that radius centered at a   codeword. It is a fundamental measure of codes, closely related to many other   measures.  Covering radii have been extensively studied for some 25 years.    The multicovering radii generalize covering radii by asking that several vectors   be covered simultaneously by codewords.  This new concept arose from an   investigation of the existence of stream ciphers that resist all possible   cryptanalytic attacks of a very general type.      The principal investigator will study basic properties of multicovering radii of   codes such as the multicovering radii of specific codes and bounds on codes   with various properties.  The result of this research program will be a better   fundamental understanding of pseudorandom sequences with respect to   properties that make them suitable for use in cryptographic stream ciphers.  It   will also lead to improvements in our fundamental understanding of error   correcting codes and perhaps to improved design and analysis of such codes.",
