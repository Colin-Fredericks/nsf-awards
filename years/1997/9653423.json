 "awd_abstract_narration": "All college and university science faculty, not just the \"thin chalk line\" of science educators, should be prepared to make science more inclusive and engaging; all science education faculty should maintain a strong science background and a high level of research enthusiasm. The purpose of this two year project is to facilitate reciprocal science success for college/ university science faculty who have taught less than five years and science education faculty who have taught five or more years, in order to improve preparation of future teachers, especially for urban environments. In all, 24 participant pairs will attend four day workshops, plan and implement collaboration for at least one full semester at their home institution, and assisted by project staff, conduct an outreach activity on their own campus. Participants will have on-site urban science experiences at the elementary, secondary, and collegiate level and instruction in strategies to engage minorities in active learning, the use of AAAS science standards, and assessment techniques. Teams will construct rubrics and performance assessments to evaluate their own home-based collaboration and outreach projects with particular attention to ways that science education faculty can become more connected to local science research activities to improve science education for future teachers. Collaboratively, science and science education faculty will design strategies to enhance the active participation of minorities in science and teacher preparation on home campuses.",
