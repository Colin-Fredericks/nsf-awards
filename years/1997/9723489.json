 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723489  Wang    This award supports the initiation of collaborative research  between Zhi-Qiang Wang, Utah State University, and Li  Shujie, Institute of Mathematics, Chinese Academy of  Sciences. The research concerns the development of new  methods in calculus of variations, critical point theory,  and Morse theory, and the application of these techniques to  nonlinear differential equations.  The project will bring  together two groups in nonlinear analysis to work on a  problem that requires the strengths of both groups to  address.    The Chinese co-PI has over forty research papers in relevant  areas, and is responsible for the initiation of the concept  of local linking, which is a powerful tool in critical point  theory to deal with multiplicity results. The US PI has  expertise in variational techniques and in the theory of  Morse. The complementary expertise of the two groups should  enable new insights into this field. Support on the Chinese  side will be provided by the Chinese National Natural  Science Foundation.",
