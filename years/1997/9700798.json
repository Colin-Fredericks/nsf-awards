 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides supplemental funding for the First IEEE Signal Processing  Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communication (SPAWC) to be  held at La Villette, Paris, France, April 16-18, 1997.  This workshop is  organized by Professors Lang Tong, Georgios Giannakis and Jean-Francois Cardoso.   The objective of this workshop is threefold: (1) to present the most recent  research results in the area of signal processing applications in wireless  communications; (2) to provide a forum for exchanging ideas on current trends and  future research directions; (3) to encourage cross-fertilization of ideas between  signal processing and communications communities, and between academia and  industry.    The scope of the workshop includes the following key areas in wireless  communications where advanced signal processing techniques are making significant  impact: Array Signal Processing in Wireless Communications; Signal Separation,  Channel Estimation and Equalization; Detection and Estimation in Wireless  Systems; Modeling of Wireless Channels; Multi-user Wireless Communications: DDMA,  TDMA, FDMA; Synchronization and Tracking; Mobile, PCS and Indoor Systems;  Underwater and Satellite Communication Systems, and, Performance Analysis and  Experimental Results.",
