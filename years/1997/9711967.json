 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  goal  of  this  research is to develop methods  for  robust,  domain-independent  vision-based  navigation  suitable  for  both  structured  and  unstructured environments.  Visual  tracking  is  used  to  monitor a set of image features (markers), and  vision-  based  control  is used to to guide the robot's motion  from  the  image  trajectory  of the markers while avoiding  obstacles.   An  environment  is  represented  as  a  graph  (map)  which  may  be  constructed under human control (e.g. giving the system  a  tour)  or  autonomously  as  the system explores.  As  the  robot  moves  during the process of mapping, markers are automatically selected  from  the  video stream and tracked.  Rather than using prestored  models  of landmarks, markers are selected based on image content  using  a  suite  of  domain-independent operators.  The  selected  markers  will be visually distinctive, unique within  the  image,  and  stable  under  varying viewpoint and  illumination.   During  passive  map  making,  the  robot is taken  on  a  tour,  and  it  instantiates  a graph representing the paths that the  robot  can  follow;  recognition is used to annotate the map.  During  active  mapping,  the  robot systematically explores the environment  and  incrementally   constructs  the  graph   representation.    These  algorithms will be tested empirically on two mobile platforms  in  both indoor and outdoor environments.",
