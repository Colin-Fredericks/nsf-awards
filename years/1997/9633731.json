 "awd_abstract_narration": "9633731 Irene  This research project, co-funded by the Electronic Materials and Solid State Chemistry programs, aims for significant advancement in fundamental understanding of ECR plasma deposition of dielectric films on GaAs and Ge single crystal surfaces. Film growth will be monitored in situ by both spectroscopic and single wavelength ellipsometry.  Specific goals include investigation of the electronic properties of the semiconductor-dielectric interfaces resulting from the deposition by examining the I-V behavior of MIS junctions derived from the interfaces formed.  In addition, a variety of ex-situ characterization tools including XPS, AFM, and FTIR will be employed to gain detailed information on the deposition process and fundamental structure-property relationships. The general approach is expected to provide new fundamental information and insights into the creation of environmentally stable, defect-free terminations of Ge and GaAs surfaces. %%% The project is multidisciplinary combining fundamental solid state surface and interface chemistry and materials science synthesis and processing studies with advanced characterization tools and analysis methods to address forefront issues in a topical area of strong technological relevance and high potential payoff.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to several aspects of advanced electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry.  Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
