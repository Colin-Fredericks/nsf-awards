 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a marine geological and geophysical  study of exposed lower ocean crust in the southwest Indian  Ocean.  Exposed crustal rocks on shallow uplifted seafloor  were discovered in this region during Ocean Drilling  operations.  ODP site 735B sampled a 400 meter vertical  section of gabbros in this area providing a detailed record  of crustal formation processes.  To date, however, it has  been difficult to place these results into a local context  since no data are available on surrounding seafloor geology.  The present project will rectify this situation by  undertaking detailed near bottom observations and sampling.  Canadian scientists will provide the ROB ROPOS as primary  survey vechicle, and rock drill would be modified for  deployment on ROPOS to allow direct sampling of observed  rocks.  The primary objective is to provide detailed near  bottom examination and sampling of seafloor to tie existing  ODP data to local environment and to provide detailed site  survey for drilling to be proposed which would sample at  sites surrounding existing hole.  Additional work would  include newly developed British rock drill to provide deeper  sampling than could be done from ROPOS vehicle.  Sample and  data would be used to identify crustal formation process at  this unique exposure of lower crustal rocks.",
