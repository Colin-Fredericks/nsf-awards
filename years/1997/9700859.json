 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,  focuses on the development of an understanding of the process of underpotential  deposition of metals on single crystal and deliberately stepped metal surfaces.   Professor Abruna and his students at Cornell University will use a combination  of dynamic electrochemical methods and X-ray scattering probes such as EXAFS and  X-ray surface diffraction to study these processes.  Real-time growth of silver  and copper electrodeposited on platinum electrodes will be examined, and the  effect on the structure of the adsorbed layer by halides and pseudo-halides will  be characterized.  This information is crucial to the understanding the science  and technology of electroplating and thin film growth.    Studies of the processes involved in the electrochemical deposition of thin metal  films on metal substrates is the focus of this research project.  X-ray and  electrochemical methods will be used to characterize the interfacial structures  as they are formed during the deposition process.  This information is useful for  understanding technologically important processes such as electroplating and  corrosion inhibition.",
