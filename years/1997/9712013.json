The compact  object is usually either a neutron star or a black hole,  although sometimes it can be a white dwarf star.  These  binary systems emit X-ray light generated by material,  released by the companion star, falling upon the compact  object.    These interesting objects were first detected in  the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum during the  very first astronomical X-ray observations in 1962, which  detected the low-mass X-ray binary system Scorpius X-l.  Ever since then, astronomers have been trying to understand  these systems.  The interpretation of the observations of  these objects can yield interesting answers into the nature  of how stars evolve, the physical properties of stars, and  the deaths of stars.    The systems may be divided into two main classes: low-mass  (LXRB) and high-mass  (HXRB).  The terms \"low-mass\" or \"high-mass\" refer to the  mass of the companion star.   In general, LXRB companions  have masses greater than two solar masses. The Be/X-ray  binaries, a certain type of HXRB, have masses between eight  and fifteen solar masses.    The X-ray binary stellar systems emit light in several  spectral regions, including X-ray, optical, and infrared  wavelengths.  By the analysis of  the data from the various  spectral regions,  and the relationships between the  emissions from these regions, astronomers can better  understand the nature of these stars and perhaps find clues  to help astronomers find out more about the evolution of  stars.  There are only thirty known Be/X-ray binaries.   A  large percentage of the stars are in binary systems and  several X-ray binary stellar systems may  not have been  discovered yet.    The research plan to be carried out is designed to help the  principal investigator better understand the underlying  properties of Be/X-ray binary syst ems.   During the research  period supported by this award, the Principal Investigator  (PI)  will spend time educating himself  in the subject  through researching the scientific literature, meeting other  researchers in the field (and eventually beginning  collaborations with them), and analyzing archival data of X-  ray binaries  taken by several X-ray, optical, and infrared telescopes,  including data from the satellites known as Rosat, Asca, and  the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).   The award will enable  the PI,  who has extensive experience with the X-ray data  analysis of quasars (using data from the satellites  IRAF/PROS and Xspec) , will easily move into the area of  the study of X-ray binaries.    This award will  make it possible to determine if a more  extensive project in the study of X-ray binary stellar  systems is reasonable and feasible.   This award is  supported jointly by the Division of Astronomical Sciences  and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the  Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences at NSF.",
