 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with the analysis, design,and  implementation of robust controllers for nonlinear systems such  as operating under variable conditions such as internal  combustion IC engines. The operation of modern IC engines for  automotive use must satisfy a diverse range on conflicting  constraints imposed by economical, environmental , societal and  marketing factors, such as; regulating exhaust emissions to  near zero levels to meet government standards, providing  increased fuel economy consistent with consumer acceptance,  maintaining satisfactory vehicle performance over a wide range  of operating conditions, and performing safely and reliably  over the life of the vehicle. At the present time there exists  no unified control methodology to provide robust controllers  for nonlinear systems with time-delays, saturation constraints  and large operating parameter variations. In addition, since  modern controllers are to be implemented in a digital  microprocessor, issues related to the implementability of these  controllers are essential, but are often ignored. Hardware  limitations and real-time computational constraints require the  implementation of low-order digital controllers. This research  project addresses the important and challenging short comings  and limitations of modern control theory. Novel tools based on  recently developed robust gain-scheduled control, fixed-order  control sampled-data systems, alternating projection algorithms  and linear matrix inequality methods are developed. The model  of a diesel engine, provided by Cummins Engine Company, is used  as a design paradigm to demonstrate the applicability of the  developed techniques. Cummins has agreed to collaborate closely  with the investigators by providing industrial expertise,  simulation models, test data, and access to their experimental  test facilities. The research results provide valuable insight  and optimized design methodologies to control a large class of  practical control engineering problems,such as engines, robots  and manufacturing processes in a unified and computationally  efficient manner.",
