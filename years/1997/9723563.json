 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pruitt  97-23563      The long term goal of this research project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which epidermal cells interact with each other and with pollen. Toward this end a comprehensive genetic analysis of mutants showing ectopic fusion of above ground organs in Arabidopsis has been undertaken. To date 30 independently isolated mutations causing this fiddlehead (fdh)-like phenotype have been mapped and partially characterized. These 30 mutations putatively identify 9 different complementation groups.  Cytological, biochemical and molecular characterization of the fdh-1 mutant demonstrated that fdh-l mutant plants differ from their wild-type counterparts in only  two ways. First, fdh-1 plants exhibit changes in the lipid composition of the crude wall (including the cuticle), and second, exhibit markedly enhanced wall permeability relative to wild-type plants. These findings suggest that differences in wall composition may be important in regulating the responsiveness of the epidermis to contact with other epidermal cells. In addition to this contact-mediated fusion response, fdh-l plants are capable of interacting with pollen. Furthermore, experiments utilizing pollen from Arabidopsis and closely related species reveal that pollen will germinate and grow on the fdh-l shoot surface whereas pollen from hydration-defective mutants will not. Taken together these data suggest that fdh-l plants express factors on the shoot surface that mediate not only epidermal cell-cell interactions but also pollen recognition and that the observed specificity of the interaction with pollen parallels that of wild-type stigmatic papillar cells.  The objectives for the upcoming research period are: 1) to complete the genetic and phenotypic characterization of the fusion mutants in this collection, 2) to isolate some of the affected genes and 3) to screen for mutations in other genes involved in the regulation of this developmental pathway.",
