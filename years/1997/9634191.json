The exact nature and reason  for this impact, however, is not well understood.         The primary objectives of this project are (1) to describe the interaction of  extratropical cyclones and fronts with the complex orography of the western United   States and (2) to document the evolution and dynamics of convective snowbands  that form along the Wasatch Mountains of northern Utah.  These orographic effects  and features dominate the meteorology of the western United States and are  responsible for life threatening and economically disruptive snowstorms, windstorms,  and flash floods        One component of the investigation will examine how synoptic systems, such  as cyclones and fronts, are modified by their interaction with the Rocky Mountains.  The project will develop regional climatologies of such interaction and perform a  series of observational case studies utilizing a variety of mesoscale data sets.   Numerical simulations utilizing an advanced mesoscale numerical model will be  used extensively to supplement observational analyses and examine how orographic  processes alter the structural evolution and dynamical balances of these systems.        The second part of the investigation will describe the structure and dynamics  of post-frontal convective snowbands that form along the Wasatch Mountains of  Northern Utah.  These features produce heavy snowfall in the Salt Lake City  metropolitan area and appear to form as a result of the interaction of the synoptic  flow with local orographic features, including the Great Salt Lake.  Observations  from a local mesoscale network and WSR-88D Doppler radar, coupled with numeri-  cal simulations, will be used to document the evolution and dynamics of these snow-  bands.  In order to improve local forecasting, a climatology of post-frontal  snowstorms along the Wasatch Front will also be devel oped.        This project will advance the understanding and forecasting of terrain induced  phenomena of the western United States.  It will describe the interaction of cyclones  and fronts with the complex orography of the region and evaluate the ability of  numerical models to simulate mesoscale features produced by such interaction.  ***",
