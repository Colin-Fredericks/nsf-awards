The project will contribute to contribute to community decisions by citing examples from rural America that showcase innovative collaborative efforts that will be featured in a national video conference in March 1997. Print and on-line information will complement the video conference materials. Project strategies include: a survey to identify initiatives, documentation on each selected by case study an inclusion in the video conference on-site and follow-up materials, dissemination via on-line, and features in OCRE's newsletter and other publications. The project will describe common initiative features such as: innovative approaches for use of technology, components for professional development, scalability and replicability, attention instruction and content, implications for public policy, sensitivity to resource constraints of rural communities, and commitment and active participation of community leaders.  ***",
