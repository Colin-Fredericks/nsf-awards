 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project abstract  Households allocate their wealth between different classes of assets. One way to classify these assets is by the institution in which they trade. Some assets are traded in an auction institution, such as shares of a corporation, while others trade infrequently in an institution which involves search and bargaining. For ease of exposition, I refer to these classes as financial and real assets respectively.  Inadequate data has prevented econometricians from decisively determining whether real assets should be considered a subset of the set of assets households use to optimize their portfolio or if they are a distinct type of good that does not belong in the finance paradigm. This question can be answered by looking at how the returns on real assets adjust to changes in real their per-period benefits given returns on financial assets. In the proposed study, subjects in the laboratory have the option of allocating their wealth between two types of assets. The first type has a rate of return which is exogenous of a subject's actions. The second type has a return based on an price changes. To examine the impact of institutions, the second type of asset is traded under two types of institutions. First, it is traded in a double auction institution, which is frequently used to organize trade of financial assets. This establishes a baseline of how well subjects are able to price an asset relative to a risk-neutral asset pricing formula in an institution previously shown to have superior performance characteristics. In another treatment, the asset trades under an institution similar to the one in which heterogeneous real goods general trade, such as homes and small businesses. The salient features of this institution are that sellers attract buyers by advertising a price, buyers and sellers negotiate by sending binding offers, and no absolute time restriction on bargaining is imposed. In the proposed implementation, the information available to subjects is similar to what is available in naturally occurring markets.  This project has theoretical and policy implications. Theoretically, this experiment help us understand why real assets prices are not well explained by asset pricing models. This is typically attributed to a number of factors such as: the lumpiness of the asset, absence of futures contracts, incorrect expectations, and asymmetric information. This project isolates the impact of trading institutions as a possible explanation. This will also provide insight into how data are smoothed by real asset trading institutions.   Laboratory data generated by this study will also help us understand the Real Estate cycle.  Ultimately, better regional economic stabilization policy could result form a better understanding of how these asset markets work.",
