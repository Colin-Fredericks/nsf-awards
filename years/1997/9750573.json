 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Geography and Earth Science is dedicated exclusively to the education of undergraduate students. The project is modernizing the curriculum in the department with the addition of a computer laboratory.  The computer laboratory is significantly affecting the curriculum in several ways.  First, it is increasing the exposure of majors to the tools of geographic information systems and remote-sensing in four of the upper-level courses.  Second, it is enabling the department to incorporate a vast array of available multimedia and Internet resources into the introductory courses.   Third, it is undergirding a new course for students preparing to be K-12 teachers, called \"Geography for Life,\" and will enable at least one other course for teachers planned in the Earth Sciences, tentatively titled \"Computer Tools for Earth Science Teachers.\"  Fourth, advanced courses that use mathematical or computer models are being given a facility that can be used for demonstrations and laboratories.  Finally, the department wants to provide a facility that students can use for projects, independent research, and presentations.  *",
