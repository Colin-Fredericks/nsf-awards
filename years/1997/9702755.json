 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current information revolution is stimulating the  emergence of new computing devices, here called network  appliances, that connect to the information infrastructure,  interact with the real world, and can be programmed to  perform custom functions. The limited resources available on  most appliances will create a need for in-network servers  supplying CPU cycles and storage. These servers will host  proxy services as well as application specific gateways.  This project will research the design and implementation of  computer systems for network appliances and the related in-  network servers. This includes developments at the level of  the operating system, programming languages, and the run-  time system. More concretely, the research will develop  around the Secure Language Kernel (SLK) operating system  being developed. SLK relies on the type safety properties of  the language system in order to enforce protection  boundaries between applications and the OS itself, which  means that all code can run in a single address space, and  at a single hardware privilege level. The expected benefits  of this approach are higher resource efficiency, seamless  system extensibility, and flexibility in the form of fine  grain sharing across protection domains.***",
