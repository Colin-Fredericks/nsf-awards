 "awd_abstract_narration": "McPeek 9700877              This project is designed to understand the evolutionary  history of how different groups of frogs have adapted to  their environment. Different species of frogs are presently  found in different types of ponds: permanent ponds with  fish, permanent ponds without fish, vernal ponds that dry  yearly. Closely related species in three frog families  (toads (Bufonidae), true frogs (Ranidae), tree frogs  (Hylidae)) segregate among these pond types. For example,  the green frog and the bullfrog evolved from a common  ancestor, yet green frogs are found only in ponds without  fish, and bullfrogs are found primarily in ponds with fish.  Previous research has revealed that different predators and  competition for food cause this segregation of species.        By quantifying traits related to how well tadpoles  evade predators and compete with other species, this  project will determine which traits are essential for  successfully inhabiting each pond type. Study of the  relationships between these traits, pond type and the  evolutionary history of species, will also reveal the role  of adaptation (acquiring traits that increase survivorship  in a new habitat) in forming the present-day frog fauna.  This project is important to furthering our understanding  of factors that influence the ability of species to utilize  a new habitat.",
