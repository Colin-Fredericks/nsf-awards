 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615061  Nevitt  The Pelagic Ecosystems Studies (PES) program utilizes  Framework Science to analyze the operation of the Southern  Ocean Marine Ecosystem.  Objectives of the program include  questions relating to the development of strategies for the  management and exploitation of marine resources as part of  CCAMLR, and the effect of Climate Change upon the marine  ecosystem.  The geographical focus for the work is the South  Georgia area but the open nature of the ecosystem means that  the system must be studied in the context of the operation  of the Scotia Sea and the wider Southern Ocean.    As part of the proposed five-year research program for the  period 1995-2000, the Pelagic Ecosystem Studies Group have  designed a coordinated series of research cruises.  In  addition to those cruises targeted on specific aspects of  ecosystem dynamics, the study program includes a yearly  repeat mesoscale survey cruise designed specifically to  provide information on large-scale, long-term, variability.    The repeat survey will focus on three aspects.  First, it  will establish a physical oceanographic context for the  season based on a 740 km transect between the Maurice Ewing  Bank and the Willis Islands, to the west of Bird Island.  This transect crosses the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) which is  a key area for setting the South Georgia studies in a larger  context.  Second, it will examine features of community  composition both along the transect and in two survey areas  along the north coast of South Georgia.  Finally, it will  collect information on the population structure,  distribution and abundance of krill in the same survey  areas.  Krill is the dominant dietary component for many of  the bird and seal species studied at Bird Island, and  interannual variation in predator populations is largely  related to changes in krill availability around the island.  Krill is also the focus of a major commercial fishery and is  the key organism in the CCAMLR resource based analyses of  the ecosystem.",
