 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is the development and implementation of  parallelizable numerical methods for solving matrix Riccati  equations that arise from large control problems.  One effective  and widely used approach to their solution is via the computation  of the stable invariant subspace of an associated Hamiltonian  matrix.  Existing methods have one or more drawbacks: limited  parallelizability, lack of structure-preservation, numerical  instability, or slow convergence.    In this project, new Jacobi type algorithms for Hamiltonian and  other structured eigenproblems will be developed.  Existing  structure-preserving Jacobi algorithms suffer from poor  convergence: they use 2x2 symplectic-rotations, which limit the  positions on the off-diagonal that can be targeted for  annihilation.  By exploiting the correspondence between 4x4  matrices and the tensor square of the quaternion algebra,  this proposal studies ways to overcome this restriction,  and develop structure-preserving algorithms that have better  convergence properties, while retaining numerical stability and  parallelizability.  The algorithms developed will be evaluated  for speed and stability in serial and parallel settings.  Improved parallel algorithms will enable scientists and engineers  to solve larger control problems with greater accuracy.  ***",
