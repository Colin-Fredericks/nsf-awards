 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726681  Gardner    Research will be undertaken in response to an Announcement of Opportunity (NSF 97-  38)for Coastal Studies in the Great Lakes.  This is a collaborative research project   between investigators from ten academic and government research institutions.  The   research is being conducted under the auspices of the NSF Coastal Ocean Processes   (CoOP) program and the NOAA Coastal Ocean Program.    This collaborative, 5-year research program will focus on the importance of episodic   events on nearshore-offshore transport and subsequent ecological consequences. The   study seeks to 1) determine what processes control the cross-margin (inshore to offshore)   transport of biological, chemical, and geological materials in the coastal margins of the   Great Lakes, and to 2) develop and test scientific strategies for assessing, quantifying, and   predicting the impacts of multiple stresses both natural and anthropogenic, in the Great   Lakes or selected coastal sub-regions.    A tight coupling between contaminated sediments and overlying water exists in lakes and   coastal ecosystems through the process of sediment resuspension. Satellite observations in   Lake Michigan illustrate an annually recurrent episode of nearshore-offshore transport, a   10 km wide plume of resuspended material extending over 200 km along the southern   shores of the lake. Preliminary evidence indicates that this episodic event may be the major   mechanism for cross-margin sediment transport in Lake Michigan.  This type of event   impacts recycling of biogeochemically important materials (BIMS), ecosystem responses,   cross-isobath transport in the Great Lakes. The program results will be applicable to   similar events in many coastal areas.    This comprehensive, interdisciplinary study will implement an integrated observational   program and numerical modeling effort to identify, quantify, and develop prediction tools   for the winter-spring resuspension event and to assess the impact of this event on the    transport and transformation of BIMS and on lake ecology.    This component of the study focuses on structure and abundance of microbial food web   organisms before, during, and after plume formation; measure Nitrogen cycling rates in   relation to community and species-specific grazing rates of microzooplankton within, at   the edge, and outside of the plume. Observations, experiments, and results will be   coordinated with those from primary production and zooplankton grazing experiments and   other studies of nutrient and physical processes to complete a conceptual model and   provide data for the proposed coupled biological/physical model.",
