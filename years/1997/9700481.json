 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motif-based hidden Markov models (MHMMs) are a new extension of  hidden Markov models (HMMs), which are the most promising method  available for characterizing families of biological sequences. An  MHMM is an HMM based on conserved regions (i.e. motifs) within a  family of biological sequences, as discovered by our existing  MEME software. Motif models discovered by MEME serve conceptually  as individual model states in an MHMM. Therefore, Unlike  traditional HMMs, MHMMs closely model only the relatively highly  conserved regions of the proteins in a family. Therefore, MHMMs  will be trainable from small datasets. In addition, MHMMs will  have a more general topology than standard HMMs, which are  linear, so MHMMs will be capable of modeling repeated occurrences  of a motif in a single sequence. Although MHMMs are applicable to  genetic sequences. the work proposed here will focus on families  of protein sequences. This proposal describes plans to develop  the algorithms necessary to train MHMMs. Our software will be  made available through a web server, like our existing MEME  software  Grundy et al., 1996 .",
