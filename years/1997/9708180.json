 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the investigator to make several research visits to the Czech Republic to develop further background and understanding of factors affecting energy policy and regulation there.  The particular research focus is the upgrading of the Temelin nuclear plant.  This upgrading is part of the commitment of Western nations to respond to the legacy in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) of unsafe nuclear plants built by the former Soviet Union.  The research will place the Czech experience in the context of nuclear power development in the CEE, focusing on problems common to these states.  The goal is to increase knowledge about the influence of scientific/bureaucratic elites and the role of citizen participation.  The research will identify the significant stakeholders, stages in the decision-making process, relevant legislation and regulations, institutional authority and bureaucratic influence.  During these trips, the investigator will meet with her Czech collaborator.  She will interview representatives of the non-governmental organizations involved in Temelin, and spend time in Brussels interviewing officials of the European Union concerning nuclear standards and reviewing documents.  The second trip may also provide an opportunity to work with the European Environmental Bureau or DGXI of the European Commission.  Research findings will be reported in a chapter of a co-edited volume under production.",
