 "awd_abstract_narration": "Networked computer laboratories are used for instruction in Introductory Physical Geology, Introductory Physical Geography, Environmental Geology, and Historical Geology.  These laboratories are used to enhance student learning through access to information services over the World Wide Web, instructional routines on CD-ROMs, visualization exercises using digital imagery, simulation of research experiences, modeling of physical processes, use of real-time data sets, and collection and analysis of data and interfacing with the computer laboratories.  A special focus of these activities will be toward preparation of in-service teachers, who will need to use these skills in their professional careers.  Evaluation of computer-assisted learning can be undertaken by monitoring impacts on student performance as a result of this instructional mode and evaluation of the effectiveness of existing computer-assisted learning materials now available through commercial and academic sources.",
