 "awd_abstract_narration": "9553585  Lidsky    The teaching of science, mathematics, and technology education is  changing to more hands-on, laboratory rich experiential learning as  teachers and schools explore new ways to teach.  Computers and  sophisticated instrumentation in schools are increasing as are  efforts in cooperative learning, team teaching, project-based  learning and student research.  Boundaries between disciplines are  blurring.  However, little has been done to define the physical  facilities necessary to support and sustain improved teaching and  learning.  The demands placed on facilities by educational reform  are studied to provide facility development criteria and guidelines  for programming, planning, and designing prototype spaces for  learning in the sciences, mathematics and technology education.   The study defines a process for planning that can be used to verify  needs and implement change.  The project is guided by an Advisory  Committee to provide the vision and case studies of educational  reform.  A Consultant Group of teachers and others assist in data  gathering and interpretation.  Both groups review the final  documents.  The main audience for the products of this project are  teachers involved in facility development or renovation; but it is  also useful to parents, board members, administrators, and  government officials.",
