 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9722920  Wolniak             Mitosis is the process that facilitates the orderly  separation and apportionment of replicated chromosomes so  that each daughter cell possesses an entire complement of  the genetic material.  The regulation of mitotic progression  is now known to involve a number of signal transduction  events at specific time point during the process where  enzymatically induced modifications of proteins have  profound effects on  the occurrence and timing of subsequent  events.  The research of this grant is focused on the  regulatory states that trigger sister chromatid separation  at the onset of anaphase, in stamen hairs of the spiderwort  plant, Tradescantia virginiana.  Stamen hair cells exhibit a  remarkable predictable rate of progression through  metaphase, and thus, are uniquely suited for the analysis of  regulatory events that affect the timing of sister chromatid  separation.  Kinases and phosphatases are enzymes that add  or remove phosphate, respectively, from substrate proteins,  and thereby affect their behavior, activity and  distribution.  As a consequence of these phosphoylation  events, the altered substrate proteins affect the rate of  mitotic progression.  By microinjecting small quantities of  peptides that represent phosphorylation domains of substrate  proteins into stamen hair cells at know time points after  nuclear envelope breakdown, this laboratory found that the  regulation of progression through metaphase is under the  control of a multifaceted phosphorylation cascade.  The  current project expands on this approach and findings, and  utilizes the screening of a cDNA library made from stamen  hair cells to isolate cDNAs that encode bone fide protein  kinases and kinase substrates from stamen hair cells.  These  cDNAs will enable them to make peptides that represent  legitimate stamen hair cell gene products for  microinjections designed to determine how and when their  phosphoylation affects mitotic progression.  This research  will furthe r our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms  involved in mitosis.  %%%     This research is using the stamen hair cells of the  spiderwort plant to examine the regulatory processes  involved in cell division.  The research is using  recombinant DNA techniques to determine the protein kinases,  phosphatases and the proteins they modify, and how they  regulate mitosis.              ***",
