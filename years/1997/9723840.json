 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723840  Fleming    This award supports a two-year collaborative research  project between Dr. Graham Fleming of the University of  Chicago and Dr. Minhaeng Cho of Korea University on  \"Femtosecond Nonlinear Spectroscopy of Photosynthetic Light  Harvesting.\"  The goal of the project is to extend current  theories of nonlinear spectroscopy, such as the photon echo,  to include the influence of molecular dynamics.  The three  pulse echo peak shift method will be studied theoretically  and applied experimentally to bacterial and plant systems to  investigate: 1) degree of electronic delocalization, 2)  energy transfer mechanisms, and 3) how the couplings of  chromaphores to the protein environment influence electronic  coupling.    The collaboration between Dr. Fleming and Dr. Cho will  enable a combined experimental and theoretical study of  nonlinear spectroscopy applied to photosynthetic light  harvesting.  Dr. Fleming's laboratory has the capability of  generating experimental data on the bacterial and plant  antenna photosynthetic systems, while Dr. Cho has the  theoretical expertise to develop the theoretical formalisms  and computer codes to model these data.  The study is timely  because of the rapid advances in the structural biology of  photosynthetic systems and in the techniques of nonlinear  spectroscopy.  It is expected that this study will result in  a better understanding of the photosynthetic process and  will form the basis for applying nonlinear spectroscopy as a  probe of a wide range of chemical and biological dynamics.  ***",
