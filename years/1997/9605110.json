 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a request for renewal of a summer REU  program held at the Wadsworth Center of the New York State  Department of Health in Albany, NY.  The research scientists  who supervise the students in this program are also faculty  in the Department of Biomedical Sciences of the State  University of New York at Albany's School of Public Health.  The Wadsworth Center is a unique scientific institution with  state-of-the-art facilities, in which basic research  programs have developed alongside mission-oriented public  health laboratories.  The research interests of the  participating BMS faculty cover a broad range, with emphasis  in molecular genetics, cell biology and structural biology.  Ten undergraduate students interested in research careers  are recruited from institutions with limited research  opportunities for undergraduates, including small colleges  in the Northwest and historically black colleges in the  south.  Another 4-6 students participate in the program with  stipend support from the Wadsworth Center.  Laboratory  projects in basic biological research topics are chosen that  are interesting, likely to yeild results within the time-  frame of the program, and allow for some degree of student  development and independence.  Weekly group meetings are  used to discuss science- and career-related issues  (including the proper conduct of science) and to monitor  student progress.  The students give short oral  presentations of their work in a symposium in the last week  of the program, and also submit written reports before they  leave, to stress the importance of communication skills  within science.",
