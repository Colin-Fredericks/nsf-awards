 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Darryl D. DesMarteau, III, Department of Chemistry, Clemson   University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division for research into the   reactivity, properties, and materials based on sulfonimides.     Perfluorinated ionomers (ion clustering polymers) and perfluorinated   ionenes (polyelectrolytes containing ionic groups  in  a  polymer  main    chain) incorporating  the  superacid bis((perfluoroalkyl)sulfonyl)imide   and isoelectronic sulfone functions will be prepared. Stable N-fluoro   derivatives will then be obtained by the reaction of the ionomers with   elemental fluorine. These polymers will contain ionic clusters embedded   in a fluorcarbon matrix and the cavities, where the clusters reside, will   be used as microreactors to form dispersed nanoscale particles of, for   example, CdSe. Using analogies to molecular sulfonimides, the polymers   will be developed as acid catalysts. Also based on analogy to the   sulfonimides, fluoroalkyl iodonium salts will be developed as aqueous   phase alkylating reagents. Using these reagents fluoroalkyl analogs of   amino acids and other biochemically interesting compounds will be   prepared.  The systems to be studied in this project are being investigated for   their potential as polymer electrolytes in fuel cells and battery   applications, as media in which nanoscale materials can be formed, and as   polymer based reagents. One objective is the design of new catalysts for   a number of `acid catalyzed` processes (petroleum refining, for example,   often uses acidic catalysts). Another is to design ways to introduce   fluorine containing groups into biological molecules.",
