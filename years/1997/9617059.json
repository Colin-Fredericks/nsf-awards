 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal interdisciplinary task of this project is to place contemporary non-Archimedean mathematical theory within an historical and conceptual context - within an intellectual tradition in which certain conceptual problems have been posed and various historical attempts have been made to solve those problems. The project is concerned with the Robinsonian foundations of non-Archimedean analysis. Its purpose is  to relate non-Archimedean mathematics to its `archaeology, ` which is of considerable intrinsic historical importance and of conceptual significance for science studies.  Non-Archimedean mathematics holds out the promise of providing an exciting tool for analysis of a wide variety of classical conceptual problems of great historical significance in natural philosophy and the philosophy of mathematics.  It is important to investigate to what degree this promise can be fulfilled.  History has shown that such a contextualization of a formal theory can sometimes play a stimulating role in its further mathematical development as well as in the development of possible scientific applications of it",
