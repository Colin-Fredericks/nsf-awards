The author proposes   several specific problems that should  contribute to the development of these subjects and to   better understanding of their interrelations.  Frenkel  also plans to study representation theory of a new class of Lie  algebras and groups, recently introduced by him and his collaborators.  Besides its intrinsic mathematical significance the new theory  has important applications to four-dimensional quantum field theory  in physics.    Representation theory of Lie algebras and Lie groups initially  developed at the turn of the century studies the structure of   symmetries and their realizations.  This theory encompasses many  areas in mathematics and has fundamental applicaitons to theoretical  physics.  In the past twenty years the study of representaiton  theory of a special class of affine Lie algebras and  Lie groups led to many new unexpected discoveries in mathematics  and theoretical physics as well as to a synthesis of many established  areas in both disciplines.  In particular, it yielded a pure mathe-  matical description of a simplest quantum field theory -- a prototype  theory of fundamental interactions.  It is expected that representation  theory of new classes of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups  might substantially deepen our understanding of mathematics and  theoretical physics during the next decade.",
