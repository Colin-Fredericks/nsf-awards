 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project has the goal of understanding computational aspects  of  the  immune  system.   The project extends  earlier  work  by  emphasizing the highly distributed memory and control  structures  of the immune system and integrating several earlier models.  The  following  approach  is  taken:  (1)  identify  an  immune-system  mechanism  that  appears to be interesting  computationally,  (2)  write a computer program that implements or models the mechanism,  (3) study its properties through simulation and analysis, and (4)  demonstrate its capabilities, either by applying the model  to  a  biological question of interest or by showing how it can be  used  profitably  in a computer science setting.  Computer security  in  open  environments (e.g., the Internet) is used as  a  motivating  application  and as an on-line environment in which to  test  the  integrated  adaptive computer immune system.  Other  applications  include:   biological  modeling,  vaccine  design  for   mutating  viruses, and anomaly detection in manufacturing.  Distributed and  secure  computing will play a central role in almost  any  future  networked  computer  system,  and  this  project  contributes   a  principled  approach to this topic, particularly the  problem  of  how  to  deploy  active  truly  autonomous  agents  across  large  networks",
