 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702220 Papadimitrakopoulos  This CAREER project addresses fundamental materials science issues of organic Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). Low molecular weight sublimable organics, such as 8-hydroxyquinoline metal chelates have been advantageous because of the inherent semiconductor purity levels attainable with simple high-vacuum evaporation. Although advantages have been envisioned for their high molecular weight polymeric analogs, they have not materialized due to intrinsic impurities and defects associated with macromolecular architecture. The objectives of this project encompass a broad fabrication methodology which effectively addresseq these issues and permits complex supramolecular structures to be constructed via a facile self-assembly approach. Some specific anticipated features include: Direct chemical attachment to the substrate, with increased lateral stability by dense packing and two dimensional crosslinking, leading to pinhole-free devices of increased stability; Film forming uniformity, regardless of shape and size of the starting substrate; Chemical surface patterning and subsequent localized growth permitting complex device fabrication in simple, additive, buildup fashion as opposed to conventional etching techniques. %%% The project addresses forefront research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of organic photonic materials and devices, in general.  An important feature of the program is the emphasis on education, and on the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant research area. For example, the innate simplicity of the chemistry and versatility of molecular architecture help bridge a broad array of scientific disciplines, while maintaining accessibility to educational levels from undergraduate students to highly qualified research scientists . The actual fabrication of proto-type devices in the research activity directs and motivates young minds into science and engineering, providing them a strong foundation in the advanced technologies of the future. ***",
