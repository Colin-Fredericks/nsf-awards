 "awd_abstract_narration": "9709604  Pfister  This project will upgrade the bryophyte and lichen collections and their curatorial management at the Farlow Herbarium (FH) of Harvard University Herbaria. The FH holdings of non-vascular autotrophs and fungi amount to about 1,325,800 specimens of worldwide representation. Of these, 440,800 are bryophytes and about 178,000 are lichens. There are high proportions of exsiccatae, and historically significant and type collections. Currently, the 76 steel cabinets for bryophyte specimens and 60 cabinets of the lichen specimens are nearly filled to capacity and there is no space in the Farlow building for the addition of new cabinets. During this project, a system of compactor shelving units will be installed in the basement of the Farlow building where the bryophyte collections are currently housed. These moveable units will increase the storage capacity by 62% and will allow for the expansion and shifting of the overcrowded bryophyte and lichen herbaria. As an improvement in curatorial operations, the two large and frequently consulted moss collections, i.e., the Bartram moss herbarium (about 64,000 specimens) and the general moss herbarium (about 179,200 specimens) will be integrated and reorganized. This project is a part of continuing efforts to upgrade the collections of non-vascular autotrophs and fungi at the Harvard University Herbaria. Harvard University is committed to collection improvement and, as cost-sharing with NSF, will finance the expenses incurred in major structural work associated with compactorization.",
