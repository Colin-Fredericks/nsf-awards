 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Jackson Laboratory (TJL), located in Bar Harbor, Maine, is the recipient of ARI funds for the replacement of existing research space for the Induced Mutant Resource (IMR).  Established in 1992, the IMR is a national center for the cryopreservation and distribution of transgenic, targeted mutant, and chemically induced mutant mice.  Current services of the IMR that occur in separate facilities include:  importation of mice of unknown health status, cryopreservation of embryos, and the maintenence and inbreeding of mice which require unusual health safeguards or breeding paradigms.  However with rapid growth, the integration of these processes are imperative to the success of the IMR which is increasingly important to the conduct of biological research in all areas, and cannot be achieved under existing conditions.  The configuration of the facilities presents serious limitations to quality control functions that now require separate, duplicative embryo transfer facilities and animal colonies.  The lack of adequate space hinders the IRM from accepting strains for preservation as cryopreserved embryos or gametes, and from developing and implementing new methods for rederiving animals.  This project is part of a larger effort of TJL to construct a permanent facility for the IMR.  Specifically, NSF funds will be used to replace research space for the SPF and Cryopreservation facilities. Consolidating these functions will allow the TJL to accept strains for cryopreservation only, increasing the number of strains the IMR can preserve, while keeping costs of the repository manageable. As an important component of the Laboratory's strategic plans for research and educational growth, the replacement structure will facilitate recruitment efforts in building programs in developmental biology, molecular genetics and neurogenetics and behavior.  Research will be enhanced as well as advanced training programs where research personnel have access to the IMR's cornucopia of induced mutant models.  This project will ensure the viability of this scientific reserve.",
