 "awd_abstract_narration": "9605102  Herr    To encourage the development of young scientists in the field of biology, the Undergraduate Research Program at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory has, since 1959, sponsored undergraduates from various institutions in the U.S. for an intensive summer research experience.  The students are housed on the Laboratory grounds, and each one is assigned to a permanent Laboratory staff member to perform an independent research project in the mentor's field of expertise.  Each student begins his or her project with the mentor's close guidance and is subsequently encouraged to work independently.  This allows students to develop to their full potential and to sample first-hand the excitement of experimental science.  During the program the students present two series of seminars:  one in which they describe their proposed research and one in which the results of each project are summarized.  They attend a series of seminars especially for the program given by the Laboratory staff, and may also attend lectures in the post-graduate biology courses that are taking place concurrently.  This undergraduate research program focuses on the selection of individuals who are likely to make a contribution to science in their ensuing careers.  Strong emphasis is placed on recruiting minorities.  The success of the program is evidenced by the number of past participants who have become eminent scientists.",
