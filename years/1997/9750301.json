This  fellowship  provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled  \"Neuroendorcrine control of seasonal singing in starlings.\"  For many birds, lengthening days lead to elevation of  testosterone levels and changes in the area of the brain  necessary for singing.  But birds also sing during  shortening days when the level of testosterone and the brain  regions required for song are unchanged.  This study uses  starlings to investigate how changes in day length modifies  the responsiveness of the brain to testosterone and how  environmental factors affect the brain to produce seasonally  relevant behavior.",
