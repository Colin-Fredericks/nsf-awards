 "awd_abstract_narration": "The singularity theorems tell us that singularities form in  a large class of spacetimes, including the physically  relevant cases of the big bang and of the gravitational  collapse of a star to form a black hole.  However, these  theorems tell us very little about the nature of the  singularities.  For example, we would like to know the  entire class of incomplete observers, how the curvature  behaves along their world lines and whether they can see the  singularity before they hit it.  Since we do not have the  general solution of Einstein's equation in closed form, it  is proposed to use all the methods available for the study  of singularities: (i) to find exact solutions and study  their singularities, (ii) to examine, in a general way the  behavior of classes of singular spacetimes, or (iii) to  perform a numerical study of spacetimes with singularities  to address these issues.                                                         \u00bd\u00bc^\u00a1&\u00fa\u00bc^\u00bc(\u00bd",
