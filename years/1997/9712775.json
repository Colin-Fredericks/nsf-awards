 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program with a contribution for instrumentation from the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities supports reseach on bridged nitrido   compounds by Dr. Nancy M. Doherty, Chemistry Department, University of   California at Irvine.  New polynuclear, oligomeric, and polymeric   compounds in which nitrido ligands link transition metals will be   synthesized.  A variety of metals would be used, including vanadium,   tungsten, ruthenium, and osmium.  Although a simple ligand, nitride   engages in pi-bonding that can result in large metal-containing   structures with a variety of electronic, magnetic, and optical   properties.  Spectroscopic and physical methods will be used to   characterize the compounds so that composition and structure can be   correlated  with reactivity and electronic properties.  The goal of the   investigation is to achieve a molecular level understanding of   polymetallonitrides by building a series  of compounds ranging from   small, soluble polynuclear species that are amenable to characterization   in solution to large polymeric materials.  In this way, more systematic   approaches to synthesis and control of bulk properties might be achieved.  Metal compounds containing nitride have potential for development as   electronic materials, but a controlled route to their synthesis has not   been found.  By examining the steps in the formation of crystalline   metal-nitride chain compounds, understanding of the details of formation   and of the relationship of structure and properties may result.  The   findings are relevant to the rational design of metal nitrides and the   mechanism of forming polymeric inorganic materials in general.",
