 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central theme in contemporary environmental policy is recommending the adoption of watershed-based approaches to restoring native diversity, preserving ecological habitat and managing ecosystems.  A watershed is a complex ecological system that sheds water, such as a creek, lake, slough, or estuary; its boundaries do not often coincide with political ones.  California's watersheds supply water for drinking, recreation, industry and farming; and they provide critical habitat for a wide variety of animal species.  Rapid population growth in these watersheds has led to increased conflict between human users of natural resources, dramatic loss of native diversity, and general decline in the health of ecosystems.  In California, federal and state government are turning to watershed-based organizations to develop and implement environmental policy.  The implications of these watershed management activities are not well understood by scientists, policy makers or the general public.  Focusing on these activities in California, this study will address the following questions:  What are the relevant values of participants currently involved in watershed restoration and management?  What is the role of scientific information in watershed restoration and management?  The research will use a three-part strategy of direct analysis of documents from watershed groups; a random sample of opinion of participants in all California watershed organizations, and comparative case studies of eight of these organizations.  Scientists and policy makers can learn from a comparative analysis of the place of values and science in watershed management in California.  Results will be disseminated through scholarly and professional conferences and journals.  An executive summary will be produced and distributed to watershed planners, federal and state policy makers.",
