 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to conduct fieldwork on Czech  language use among third, fourth, and fifth generation Texas  Czechs in order to explore its significance for ethnic identity.  This research will contribute to our understanding of the place  of language change and language loss in the process of redefining  what it means to be a Texas Czech. It aims to reassess  historically motivated perceptions of Czechness among the  descendants of Moravian immigrants, and provide insight into  their reasoning about discontinued language transmission and  shifting definitions of Czech speakers. Such ethnolinguistic  study is especially timely because the current--and perhaps last-  -adult generations of Texas Czech speakers experienced the most  concerted attempts at purposeful public language revival,  allowing the researcher to examine its impact on their self- and  other-perceived identity, as well as their language skills and  attitudes. In order to retrieve community members' own views,  participant observation will combine discourse-centered and  sociolinguistic methods, using audiotaping of naturally occurring  and elicited speech, and ethnographic notes. This project will  contribute a new linguistic-anthropological perspective to the  study of the place of immigrant languages in American ethnic  communities.",
