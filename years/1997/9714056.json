 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory (MDIBL) will  construct a multi-use housing facility.  MDIBL provides  access for visiting Investigators to marine species for the  purpose of investigating mechanisms of basic processes such  as osmoregulation, cell division, reproduction and the  function of vertebrate organs like the kidney, heart and  brain; and offers educational programs for students ranging  from high school to postdoctoral.  The Laboratory hosts  Investigators and students from the U.S., Canada and Europe  who are actively recruited through a variety of fellowship  programs.  The ability of MDIBL to accommodate these diverse  groups is currently limited by the quality and quantity of  available housing, in particular housing for Investigators  seeking short stays at the Lab and for students during our  peak season.  The long-term goal of the proposed activity is  to create a set of at least four housing units designed to  be utilized by students, Investigators or teacher/student  groups at different times of the year.    The current application seeks support for the first of these  units.  The site proposed for these units was chosen on the  basis of a comprehensive site-planning process undertaken by  MDIBL in collaboration with professional planner and offers  privacy and accessibility while minimizing development  costs.  The design of the units was chosen to maximize  flexibility of current and future use, economy of  construction and harmony with the surrounding land and  community.  The unit will be insulated and heated to provide  much needed accommodations in the colder months.  The  housing unit will benefit both students and Investigators by  providing summer student housing which is safer and more  accommodating and allow MDIBL to house visiting  Investigators who come for short stays to collect samples or  attend conferences or short courses.",
