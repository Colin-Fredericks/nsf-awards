 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Palmer  This grant will provide initial support for the Ohio State  University Summer Physics Institute which is designed to  encourage students to pursue research careers in physics by  introducing them to and engaging in the research activities  of a major research university physics department.  The  Institute will support ten-week research internships,  including a stipend, subsistence, and travel.  Students will  live and work together, guided by their faculty mentors, in  research groups that include graduate students and post-  doctoral students.  They will engage in tutorials on  computational physics, instrumentation and electronics, and  shop safety and procedures, but the main focus will be the  project that the faculty mentor and the students jointly  develop.  Group activities are designed to promote  interactions and relationships among the intern students and  the Department's student and faculty researchers.  Each  intern will write a project prospectus early in the summer  and a final oral and written report at the end of the  summer.  The program is intended for students who are  physics majors in undergraduate programs and who are between  their sophomore and junior year or their junior and senior  year, but all undergraduates are encouraged to apply.  The  focus will be regional, but the Institute will be advertised  nationally.  A particular attempt will be made to involve  women and minorities.  The many small undergraduate  institutions in the region will be strongly encouraged to  send applicants.  The recruitment and selection committee  includes a representative of a local small college, as well  as faculty members nationally prominent in areas of outreach  to minorities and women.  ***",
