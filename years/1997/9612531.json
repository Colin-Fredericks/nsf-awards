 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612531  Bras  The prevalent approaches to estimating extreme precipitation  and flood relationships are empirical curve fitting to  historical data and numerical simulation also based on  empirical models.  Both methods become inaccurate if very  rare events or the impact of climatic variations and human  interventions on such extremes are estimated.  The source of  the inaccuracy is that, in the absence of a theoretical or  physical basis, extrapolation far beyond the range of the  historical data becomes highly uncertain.  A large number of  these empirical relations are of the power-type that reflect  the scale-invariant properties of the observed hydrologic  event.  This project will use a scaling or fractal approach  to the problem of extrapolation from limited data of  hydrologic extremes.  A new class of rainfall and width  functions models will be developed which posses the simple-  and multi-scaling properties observed in nature for these  quantities and that will be validated through extensive data  analysis.  These models will combine two basic approaches,  the multi-scaling and the pulse superposition.  The final  phase of the project will include the parameterization of  rainfall and basin response in terms of climate and  catchment characteristics, using them to assess the  sensitivity of peak precipitation and flood events to both  natural changes in the climate, basin characteristics, and  human intervention.  Improving the understanding of the  rainfall-flood relationship is of great benefit to areas and  people at risk and will advance the state-of-the-art.  ***",
