 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bell  9706307       Mechanotransduction is a fundamental physiological process  that is central for such diverse functions as hearing, touch,  digestion, and balance.  To understand mechanoreception in the  somatosensory system, the investigator continues developing a  detailed mathematical model of one receptor, the Pacinian  corpuscle, an encapsulated nerve ending.  One can not remove the  capsule without damaging the nerve, so many questions about the  voltage distribution along the nerve underneath the capsule can  not be answered experimentally.  Since one can only take neural  measurements where the nerve emerges from the capsule after  applying displacement stimuli to the capsule surface, how does  voltage there depend on various neural parameters along the  unexposed nerve?  Does one need a nonlinear current-voltage  relation to achieve a threshold voltage at the emerging end?  Can  one do extra recordings at the emerging end (overdetermined  boundary conditions) and be able to recover the stimuli to the  nerve?  The project undertakes mathematical modeling to address  these physiologically valuable questions.       Our bodies receive mechanical stimuli continuously, but the  stimuli must be processed into neural signals that the brain can  interpret.  This involves receptors called mechanoreceptors.  Be  they hair cells in the inner ear, or Pacinian corpuscles in the  skin, there are properties that are nearly impossible to  establish experimentally, so the investigator uses sophisticated  mathematical models to help predict responses to given stimuli,  as well as establish internal receptor properties.  For example,  the above mentioned skin receptor is a nerve ending which is  protected by a bulb of membranes and fluid.  Physiologically one  can not separate the mechanical bulb (the capsule) from the nerve  ending without sever damage to the nerve membrane.  But with a  good mathematical model one can determine respective  contributions each component makes to response behavior.  Also ,  the model can suggest ways of taking extra neural measurements  outside the capsule which will aid in finding biologically  unreachable parameter values inside the corpuscle.  Analysis  increases our understanding of the transduction process in the  mammalian tactile system, and the analytic methodology transcends  the particular model case considered here.",
