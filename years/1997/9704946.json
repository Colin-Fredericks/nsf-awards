 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704946  Taylor  This is a renewal project for the study of the electronic  and structural properties of disordered semiconductors.  This research will answer questions concerning the  structure, defects and doping mechanisms in Group IV  chalcogenide glasses at low chalcogen concentrations and in  metal chalcogenide glasses at high metal concentrations.  A  second important component of the research will answer  questions concerning the microscopic origins of optically-  induced paramagnetism and of photodarkening in chalcogenide  glasses, especially those in the two model systems mentioned  above.  The scientific approach involves a broadly based  program that utilizes several growth techniques, magnetic  resonance spectroscopy, optical spectroscopies, various  combinations of optical and magnetic resonance techniques,  and electrical measurements.  The specific objectives are  (1) to understand details of the local order, (2) to study  the intrinsic defects, and their associated metastabilities,  as a function of average coordination number, and (4) to  identify the defects that contribute to photodarkening.  %%%  This is a renewal proposal for a continuing study of  amorphous semiconductors.  Amorphous semiconductors provide  inexpensive alternatives to crystalline semiconductors for  many electronic applications.  One important example is the  use of amorphous silicon for the switches (thin-film  transistors) in flat-panel displays for personal computers  and flat television screens.  The use of these materials is  hindered by changes that occur with time in the various  electronic or optical devices that are currently  manufactured.  The information gained in this research will  greatly increase our understanding of the behavior of  electrons which are the carriers of electrical current.  This information will confirm or refute specific models that  have been developed to apply generally to all amorphous  semiconductors.  For example, the most important property of  semiconductors that mak es them useful as switches of  electricity is the ability to change the electrical  conductivity dramatically via a process known as doping.  This research will result in a more general understanding of  doping mechanisms in amorphous semiconductors - an  understanding that can eventually be used to manufacture  more reliable devices.  ***",
