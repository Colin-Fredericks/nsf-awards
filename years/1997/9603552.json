This year, USA is invited to serve as the host. It will be held August 24 - 29, in San Francisco, followed by a post conference meeting in Asilomar, California. The congress this year is organized in a format of 36 symposia, 12 of three-day duration and 24 of two-day duration.  The two-day symposia are divided into two equal sections with unique time slots such that an individual can attend all of the lectures.  The program includes areas of interest in enzymatic mechanisms and catalysis, protein folding, molecular design, receptors and signal transduction, signaling, regulation, intracellular sorting and trafficking, replication, recombination and repair, genome analysis, bioenergetics, protein turn over, macromolecular modification, ribozyme, and others.  The topics have been selected and scheduled to allow a flow from three-day symposia to those in the ensuing two-day symposia.  The design is to allow participants to remain highly focused, as is appropriate for individuals with very distinct and specialized interests, or one can attend a broad spectrum of lectures, as befits a generalist. The support will be used to help defray costs for approximately 30 young scientists from USA to attend one or both of these venues.    Part 2.  Non technical  The International Congress in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology is a forum for discussion of advances in this topic area by scientists from around the world. It is the major event of the field, and has been in operation for nearly 50 years.  This year, it will take place during August 24 - 29, in San Francisco. USA is invited to serve as the host.  The congress will be held with a post conference meeting in Asilomar, California. It is organized in a format of 36 sympos ia, 12 of three-day duration and 24 of two-day duration, with many areas of interest from basic to applied biochemistry and molecular biology included.
