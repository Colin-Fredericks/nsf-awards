 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building upon its previous Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement project, \" Integration of Workshop Approaches in Calculus and Precalculus\", the SUNY coalition will now focus on the content and mode of instruction in Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and Linear Algebra. The SUNY Coalition, comprised of twenty nine two- and four-year schools, will be expanded state-wide to include private institutions. Participants will learn to: integrate modern curricula (conceptualization, exploration, and higher-level problem solving)  into the teaching of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and Linear Algebra; integrate technology and innovative pedagogy into the teaching of ODE and Linear Algebra; attract and retain students from underrepresented groups in ODE and Linear Algebra; change the academic culture by collaborating with the Long Island Consortium for Mathematical Sciences Throughout the Curriculum to extend mathematical sciences throughout the curriculum. These efforts will help to: increase faculty's knowledge in the content and pedagogy related to teaching and scholarship in ODE and Linear Algebra; emphasize the importance of mathematical modeling in industry; improve student understanding and retention of fundamental mathematics concepts; provide the opportunity for faculty to develop and initiate alternatives to the lecture format; and promote effective communication between two- and four-year institutions and users of mathematics in the real world. The first-year participants comprised of Lead Professors from the original SUNY Coalition and new members will implement ODE and / or Linear Algebra modern curricula and innovative pedagogical approaches in the year following the summer training. The implementation plan for the new participants of the second year will be the same as that of the first year. In addition the Lead Professors, selected from the first-year participants, will begin work on interdisciplinary courses.",
