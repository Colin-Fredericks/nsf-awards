 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF grant will fund the PI's work in documenting and  analyzing the sound patterns of indigenous languages of Bolivia's  eastern lowland.  This region, also called Amazonia, is a rich  and ethnically diverse area where more than twenty-five distinct  indigenous groups engage in an ongoing struggle to preserve the  routine, every-day use of their ancestral languages.  To this  end, recent years have witnessed internationally-supported  efforts to develop bilingual education programs in Bolivia in  which children will be educated partly in Spanish (the  geographically dominant language) and partly in the traditional  indian language of their communities.  Leaders of such programs  have sought to involve North American and European linguists as  consultants in ongoing efforts to create linguistically informed  materials (such as, grammars, dictionaries, readers) that can be  used to educate children in indigenous languages.  In exchange  for our labor as consultants, the PI for this project and other  linguists are gaining the opportunity to study a variety of  indigenous languages for purposes that benefit the North American  scholarly community.  As most languages of eastern Bolivia are  understudied to date, the detailed information to be acquired as  part of this project is expected to contribute to linguists'  understanding of what human languages are like from a structural  point of view; the similarities and differences that exist  between languages spoken in diverse  regions of the world; and what this information might tell us  about the cognitive underpinnings of our linguistic systems.  The  PI's role in the ongoing research just described is tied to her  experience as a phonologist--a linguist who analyzes aspects of  sound structure in human languages, from the basic inventories of  consonants and vowels used, to the stress and intonation contours  imposed upon them in running speech.  The funds awarded by NSF  will be used to cover costs associated with travel to Bolivia for  stu dy and data acquisition; to purchase equipment needed to  analyze sound structures in these languages; to employ a graduate  student at the University of North Carolina to assist in this  analysis (a valuable aspect of that student's training); for  travel to scholarly conferences at which the results of this work  may be presented; and to assist in preparing work for publication  in scholarly journals and in magazines more accessible to the  general public, such as Science.",
