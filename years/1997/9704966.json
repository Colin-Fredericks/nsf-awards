 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pernarowski  9704966       The investigator studies several problams related to the  electrical activity of the pancreatic beta cell.  Fast and slow  subsystem bifurcations yielding different global behaviors in  single cell, cell pair and continuum models of the islet are  examined.  The emphasis in the single cell analysis is to extend  previous asymptotic procedures to models having more than one  slow variable.  For the cell pair analyses, the effect of phase  differences in the slow variables and coupling conductance is  examined using standard bifurcation and linearization techniques.  One goal is to explain the prolongated active phase duration that  is indirectly responsible for elevated insulin secretion.  Lastly,  a continuum model for the electrical activity in large  collections (islets) of beta cells is examined using asymptotic,  linearization and global monotone methods.  The effect of  heterogenity and coupling strength on fast subssystem  bifurcations is studied in the context of a system of reaction  diffusion equations used to model the islet behavior.       The investigator studies mathematical models of the  electrical and chemical behavior of the insulin secreting  pancreatic beta cell.  The salient feature of the study lies in  the identification of electrical behaviors that lead to increased  insulin secretion in both individual pancreatic cells and  collections of such cells as they occur in the body.  Knowledge of  such behaviors facilitates an understanding of the cellular  mechanisms that are most relevant in diabetic conditions.  All  mathematical analyses are motivated by experimental studies.",
