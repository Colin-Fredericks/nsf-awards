The work on  hydrides  (1)  focuses  in one case on motion of hydrogen or  deuterium  in  elemental hcp dilute hydrides, in the temperature range near  60-  80K.  In  a  second  aspect, the YH2-YH3  system,  with  possible  application as a switchable mirror, will be examined.  (2)  Spin-  echo  double  resonance  (SEDOR)  will  be  extended  as  an  NMR  technique  in  such  a  way that the echo  amplitude  A  will  be  measured  as  a  function  of the flip angle  on  the  unobserved  spins.This  new method will be applied to amorphous  hydrogenated  silicon.  The  nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) will be  exploited  to   enhance the use of optical techniques, which have previously  been   developed  by  others  to  provide  20-50%  nuclear   spin  polarization of helium 3 or Xe 129. The nuclear Overhauser effect  will  be  used to transfer some of this polarization to spins  of  analytical  importance, such as protons and  C13.  An  additional  application  of the NOE will be made in a proposed  technique  to  avoid  inhomogeneous  broadening in NMR study  of  dilute  solute  resonances in a solvent.  %%%  This  experimental research project is based on the technique  of  nuclear  magnetic  resonance. In one  aspect  of  the  work,  the  hydrogen   or  deuterium  resonance in  metal  hydrides  will  be  studied  to clarify the state of motion of hydrogen or  deuterium  ions in the hydride structure. Metal hydrides are of interest for  potential use as an energy storage medium. In a second aspect  of  the work, the project will research an enhancement of the nuclear  magnetic  resonance technique, in conjunction with  a  separately  developed  nuclear spin polarization technique.  The  new  method  will  make use of the nuclear Overha user effect, and may   permit  new  applications  of  nuclear magnetic resonance  in  analytical  studies.  Secondly,  in solutions, where a dilute  solute  is  of  interest, the new method will greatly reduce the broadening which  arises from interaction with the solvent molecules. This research  project is interdisciplinary in nature and involves graduate  and  postgraduate  students who will be excellently trained  to  enter  positions in industry, government or education.  ***",
