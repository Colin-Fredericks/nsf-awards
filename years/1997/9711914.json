The meeting was  jointly organized by the New York Academy of Science and the  New York State Center for Advanced Technology in Ultrafast  Photonic Materials and Applications at the City University  of New York.    The goal of the symposium is to advance the understanding  and development of biomedical instrumentation for optical  methods of cancer detection.  Optical biopsy and mammography  are promising new techniques for determining whether or not  a tissue is cancerous without using invasive techniques.  An  analysis of the spectrum of light emitted from optically  excited tissue allows investigators to detect physical and  chemical changes in tissue and determine if the tissue is  normal, benign, or cancerous.  Because they are minimally  invasive, and use non-ionizing radiation to detect diseases  with high sensitivity and accuracy, these new techniques may  lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic techniques.    Funding from the Foundation defrayed partial travel expenses  for the U.S. participants who prepared and delivered  scientific presentations at the meeting where approximately  80 persons attended.  Information presented at the  conference is to be disseminated in the Annals of the New  York Academy of Sciences, thereby making the results of the  meeting available to a wide audience.  ***",
