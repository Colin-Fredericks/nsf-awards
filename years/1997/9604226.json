Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of such preferences, and many studies have examined the benefits that females receive from mating with males with particular traits.  However, there have been few detailed studies of both the costs and benefits of female preferences.  This study will begin a detailed analysis of selection on female mating preferences in the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps.  Males of this species call to attract females, and females select mates, in part, based on variation in male calling song.  Females tend to prefer males that produce chirps at higher rates, and they tend to prefer longer chirps. Higher chirp rates are energetically more expensive to produce, and males in better nutritional condition are capable of sustaining higher chirp rates.  First, variation between females in their preferences will be examined.  Selection can act on female preferences only if different females possess different preferences.  Second, correlations between preferences based on different aspects of male calling behavior will be examined.  Selection on one preference can result in indirect selection on other preferences if preferences are correlated.  Third, the relationship between female preference and searching behavior during mate choice will be examined.  If females with stronger preferences engage in riskier searching behavior, search costs can act against the evolution of strong preferences.  Fourth, the direct benefits of female preferences will be examined.  Specifically, the correlation between a mate's call type and female fitness (egg number, egg size, egg hatching success, offspring development rate and offspring survivorship) will be tested.  Males transfer a spermatophore to females during mating, which females eat approximately 40  minutes after attachment.  There is thus the potential for nutritional benefits that accrue to females or to offspring.  If females that mate with preferred males obtain a benefit from doing so, selection can favor the evolution of strong preferences.  This research promises to increase our understanding of why females prefer certain male traits, and the factors that act against the evolution of such preferences.",
