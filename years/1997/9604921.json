In particular, we propose to study alloys in the family  Se-As-Ge.  A remarkably simple feature has emerged from our previous  studies of glasses in this family:  the dependence of some properties  only on network topology as characterized by one parameter, the  average atomic coordination number <r>.  Recently we have made the  first ab initio molecular dynamics calculations in a compound  chalcogenide glass, GeSe_2.  This work demonstrates the power of a  combined experimental and computational approach in gaining  understanding of amorphous systems.  In this proposal we address the  following issues:  atomic structure and dynamics and their relation to  network topology and chemical order/disorder; \"floppy\" modes and their  relation to network properties and to photo-induced phenomena; and the  \"Bose peak.\"  We also theoretically investigate holeburning in glassy  As_2S_3 :H.  %%%  Non-Technical abstract  This a new project of study on chalcogenide glasses.  Unlike crystals,  glasses are difficult to study because the atoms are not arrayed in a  nice regular pattern.  For this reason, even obvious properties like  the excellent transmission of light through ordinary window glass are  not very well understood.  Nor is it understood why some materials  form glasses easily while others don't.  In this work we study a  family of glasses (chalcogenides) which display a strikingly simple  feature:  some properties apparently depend only on the average number  of atoms to which any given atom is linked up (bonded.)  Among these  properties, for example, is how the atoms vibrate in the glass.  We  make measurements which provide some information about this, but which  cannot reveal the atomic motions in detail. This is where computations  come in.   By making a reliable computer model of the same glass (which we can  tell by comparing its predictions with measurements) we can use it to  see just how the atoms vibrate.  But the model then provides much more  information about these glasses.  It gives details about atomic  structure which can be compared to experiment, and about how these  glasses will respond to light.  In this way we hope to come to a  better understanding of this glass family, and of glasses generally.  ***",
