 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed project is to design efficient  algorithms applicable to security and computational issues that  are core concerns of statistical agencies and database vendors.  Results obtained from the project will be implemented to test  theoretical models as well as to advance technology transfers.  Building on the PI's completed work on statistical data security,  a number of specific research directions are pursued to further  determine the computational complexity of detecting and  protecting sensitive information in highly useful types of  statistical data bases.  These directions involve techniques from  a variety of algorithms areas including combinatorial  optimization, dynamic algorithms, graph algorithms, linear  algebraic algorithms, and online competitive analysis.  It is  expected that algorithmic insights and techniques obtained from  this project will be useful in various application areas in  addition to statistical data security, such as relational  databases and secret sharing schemes.",
