Harmonic analysis will be used to provide spectral   decomposability of operators (and associated weakened forms of   orthogonality) in a wide variety of contexts.  The mechanism   for combining the structural decomposability features of harmonic   analysis and operator theory will be the transference theory   initiated by A.P. Calder n and Coifman-Weiss.  Studies aimed at   expanding the scope and vistas of transference theory will be   involved, as will applications of transference theory to harmonic   analysis.       The central theme of the project will be a unified overview   providing new avenues for applying classical analysis to its own   settings and to general mathematical analysis.  The broad scope of   the methods will be aimed at new vistas and discoveries applicable   to a wide variety of mainstream mathematical subjects.  From the   standpoint of human resources, the NSF support awarded for the   operations of the Wabash Modern Analysis Seminar, which functions as   a Mid-Western regional seminar attracting national and international   participation, will provide ready access to the frontiers of knowledge   for many young researchers and graduate students, while furthering   a wide array of research programs.",
