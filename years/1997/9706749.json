These fundamental questions motivate the proposed study of diversification in selected clades of Cenozoic neogastropod molluscs.  The great morphological and ecological diversity, as well as the excellent fossil record of this large group of molluscs make the Neogastropoda ideal for the study of evolutionary proliferation, an as yet poorly understood but crucially important phenomenon in the history of life.    The taxonomy, phylogeny, distribution, and ecology of clades with apparently contrasting evolutionary histories will be studied.  Building on earlier work with rapanine muricids and pseudolivids, analyses of ancestor-descendant and sister-group relationships will be conducted in the muricid subfamilies Ocenebrinae and Muricinae, the buccinid subfamilies Pisaniinae, Photinae, and Siphonaliinae, and the family Fasciolariidae.  Comparisons within and between these purported clades will focus on shell characters of fossil and living species, to be examined in the major museum collections of the world, and on DNA sequences to be obtained from living representatives.  Observations relating shell morphology to aspects of life including feeding, locomotion, and defense will be conducted on the two coasts of Panama.    Hypotheses to be tested include the following:  1)  key innovations as well as antipredatory traits reduce barriers to speciation and increase the range of potential phenotypes in a clade;  2)  times of climatic warming (Middle to Late Eocene, Late Oligocene to Early Miocene, Early Pliocene) favor worldwide diversification;  3)  constriction of the Central American seaway beginning in the Late Miocene stimulated speciation in tropical America but not elsewhere;  4)  glacially induced climatic fluctuations stimulated speciation among high-latitude clades beginning in the latest Miocene.  Multiple comparisons among sister-groups, a mong time intervals, and among regions with contrasting histories will be used to evaluate the roles of these intrinsic and extrinsic triggers of speciation and adaptive diversification.    The study of diversification is important not only because evolutionary proliferation remains little understood, but also because of close parallels with economic growth.  An empirically based economic perspective on the history of life may shed light on important controls of the human economy, and make possible intellectual links between evolutionary science and the social science discipline of economics.",
