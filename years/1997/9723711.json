 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723711  Harris     In preparation for cytokinesis, both animal and fungal  cells assemble a cortical actin ring.  The formation of this  ring appears to be temporally and spatially controlled by  signals from mitotic nuclei.  Current models suggest that  the actin ring functions via two possible mechanisms to  effect cytokinesis.  In animals and certain fungi, the actin  ring contracts, splitting cells in two.  In other fungi, the  ring defines a region where a cell plate forms to divide the  cell.  Regardless of mechanism used, the actin ring is  essential for cytokinesis.  Previous studies employing  various biochemical and genetic approaches have identified  numerous proteins necessary for the formation and/or  function of the actin ring.  However, it is not at all clear  how these proteins function in an integrated manner to  control cytokinesis.  Moreover, it has become increasingly  evident that a complete inventory of actin ring proteins has  not been attained.  The overall objective of Dr. Harris'  research program is to use the power of genetics to identify  and characterize additional proteins required for the  formation and function of the actin ring, and thereby  elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying cytokinesis in  the genetically tractable filamentous fungus, Aspergillus  nidulans.  This fungus undergoes cytokinesis by forming  crosswalls known as septa.  Septum formation in A. nidulans  is temporally and spatially coordinated with mitosis, and  requires the formation of a contractile actin ring.  Genetic  screens have resulted in the identification and  characterization of gene products which act at different  steps to control septation in A. nidulans.  For example, the  analysis of sepB mutants has revealed the existence of a  checkpoint which prevents septum formation in the presence  of DNA damage.  In contrast, the characterization of sepA  mutants has led to the identification of an evolutionarily  conserved protein that may control the assembly of the actin  ring.   The objective of this research project is to address  the hypothesis that the sepA gene product plays an essential  role in septum formation by promoting the formation of the  contractile actin ring.  Specifically, Dr. Harris will use  indirect immunofluorescence to determine if SepA localizes  to the incipient division site.  In addition, he will  establish the timing of SepA localization relative to  mitosis and actin ring formation.  He also plans to employ a  battery of genetic and biochemical approaches to identify  proteins that interact with SepA.  In particular, he will  test predictions that SepA function requires interactions  with the actin-associated protein profilin and with the  septins.    The fascinating process of cytokinesis, in which a living  cell literally separates itself into two progeny cells,  underpins the nature of life.  This research project should  lead to a better understanding of the general mechanisms  underlying cytokinesis.  The use of a filamentous fungus as  the model organism in this study is a particularly good  choice because of the pronounced societal impact of fungi.  On the one hand, some fungi cause diseases; on the other  hand, they produce useful natural products such as  antibiotics and commercially important enzymes, and can be  genetically engineered to produce non-fungal proteins of  commercial interest.   Thus, an increased understanding of  how septum formation permits filamentous fungi to grow and  reproduce can lead to ways of combating fungal infections of  plants, animals, and humans, as well as allowing fungi to be  used more efficiently as industrial biocatalysts for the  production of commercially important enzymes and other  proteins.  ***",
