 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information  visualization is an increasingly important  research  and  development area, crucial for the success of the information  revolution.  This workshop focuses on visualizing information and  how  users interact with digital information. Co-chaired by Nahum  Gershon  (The  MITRE  Corp.)  and  Jacques-Emile  Dubois  (CODATA  International) it has an international committee of visualization  experts  from nine countries.  The goals of the workshop  are  to  bring   together   researchers  and  developers  in   information  visualization  from  Europe,  United  States,  and   Canada   for  intensive  brain-storming to accomplish  the  following:   survey  current  activity in information visualization in Europe and  the  United  States;  identify  research  and  development  issues  in  visualization;  and  forge  research collaborations  between  the  United  States and Europe.  Although there has been a great  deal  of  development of methods for visualizing diverse types of  data  and information, few algorithms and methods have been implemented  to  solve real-world problems, especially in North America. Since  more  research and development have been targeted at solving real  problems  effectively in Europe, they are ahead of U. S. research  and   development  in  applying  visualization   to   operational  environments.  The focal point of this workshop  is  implementing  visualization  methodology.  Combining  the  North  American  and  European   expertise   is   expected  to   result   in   enhanced  effectiveness of visualization, enabling better communication  of  information  and more effective use of the information  highways,  reducing  the  number of documents end users such as  journalists  must access.",
