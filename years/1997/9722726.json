 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722726  Block    This Americas Program award will support travel and related  expenses for 9 U.S. scientists to participate in the \"Latin  American Seminar in Biological Rhythms,\"  to take place in  Puebla, Mexico,  August 31 to September 3, 1997.  Organizers are Dr. Gene Block, University of Virginia, and  Dr. Raul Aguilar-Roblero, Universidad Autonoma de Mexico.  The topic of the proposed meeting is circadian biology, and  the goals are to provide a forum for academic interactions  among U.S. and Latin American scientists interested in the  field of chronobiology;  to provide graduate students from  participating countries with the opportunity to interact  with established scientists; and to promote the exchange of  students. During the past two decades there has been a  tremendous growth in our understanding of biological timing.  Biological clocks play a critical role, not only in the  control of behavior and physiology, but also in the  measurement of daylength, and in solar orientation and  navigation by a number of species. In humans, few processes  escape the impact of timing systems.    The US participants are recognized for their contribution to  the study of biological rhythms and for their commitments to  the education of graduate students.  They represent  different areas of basic biological rhythms research,  ranging from the molecular level to behavior, and from  unicellular organisms to vertebrates.   A report on the main  conclusions of the sessions, with specific suggestions  related to joint research, the exchange of graduate  students, and development of a basic curriculum in  chronobiology graduate courses, will be submitted for  publication in the Archives of Medical Research.  ***",
