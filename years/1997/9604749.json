 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds  are  requested  to purchase a Finnigan-MAT  LCQ  Ion  Trap  Mass  Spectrometer and  associated Hewlett Packard HPLC for use by a group of seven  independent, federally  funded investigators from three different basic science departments  (biochemistry,  pharmacology, and cell biology) at the Medical University of South  Carolina. It is  proposed to use this highly sensitive, efficient equipment in the  isolation, purification,  and synthesis of insulin-like proteins, retinal pigments and binding  proteins, GTP-binding  proteins, sperm motility proteins, lens globular proteins  (crystallins), and regA proteins.  The research projects of six additional users who will also benefit  from the proposed  instrument are also briefly described. Preliminary data using the LCQMS  instrument are  presented for a lens protein demonstrating that the LCQ technology  provides not only  state-of-the-art sensitivity, but saves enormous amounts of time and  sample handling  through its capability to perform on-line HPLC-MS and HPLC-MS/MS on one  chromatographic run.    The  proposed instrument will become a part of MUSC's Mass Spectrometry  Facility which has evolved into a laboratory primarily devoted  to  the  study  of protein structure and function. It combines research  in  new  developments and applications of mass spectrometry, application of this  technology  to important research problems by the faculty and  students  associated with the facility, and service to the general MUSC community  as well as to national and international collaborators.",
