 "awd_abstract_narration": "96-04213  Dahlquist    This study is designed to elucidate the nature of  hyperthermostability in the CheY protein from Thermotoga  maritima (TMY), which undergoes reversible thermal unfolding  at 95oC. The CheY isolated from Bacillus subtilis is the  same length and is 75% identical in amino acid sequence to  TMY but denatures about 35oC lower in temperature. Each of  the 30 residues that differ in the two proteins will be  substituted in order to monitor the contribution that each  makes to the overall stability of the protein. Selected  mutants will be examined by a variety of physical methods  including circular dichroism, solution nuclear magnetic  resonance methods, differential scanning calorimetry and X-  ray crystallography for possible relationships between the  thermal stability of a protein and its structural and  dynamic properties.    A thermally-induced structural change in TMY that occurs  about 50o below its thermal unfolding will also be  characterized. This transition, similar to those observed in  other proteins from hyperthermophilic sources, results in  extensive line broadening and chemical shift changes in the  15N-1H correlation spectra of TMY.      The information so gained in this study should provide a  rich experimental database for the understanding of the  structural and energetic contribution to the exceptional  thermal stability seen in proteins from hyperthermophilic  sources.    Proteins from organisms that live at very high temperatures  (hyperthermophiles) are much more stable than similar  proteins from organisms that live near body temperature  (mesophiles). This study undertakes a systematic  investigation of the source of stability in a small, well  behaved protein, CheY, which is involved in sensory  signaling in both hyperthermophiles and mesophiles. About 20  amino acids of this protein, isolated from a  hyperthermophile has, are likely to account for a near 50oC  increase in its thermal stability, as compared to the  similar protein from a mesophilic  source. These residues  will be varied by sitedirected mutation so that the role of  these residues in the stability of the protein and its  structure, as determined by X-ray diffraction and nuclear  magnetic resonance methods, can be recognized. In addition,  there is a change in structure as temperature increases that  occurs near body temperature in the CheY protein from the  hyperthermophile. This structural change may reflect a  change from a catalytically inactive form at low temperature  to a functional form at high temperature. This change and  the reasons that it occurs will be characterized to yield a  general understanding of how proteins function under extreme  environmental conditions.",
