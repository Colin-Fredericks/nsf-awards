 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are able to think about, or construe, a given entity in more  than one way.  For example, a given entity may be thought of as a  table, or as some wood.  These distinct construals are linked to  the linguistic distinction in English between count nouns and  mass nouns.  Thus we can talk of two tables, but not two woods,  similarly we can say a little bit of wood, but not a little bit  of table.  This is because kinds of objects (e.g. tables) come in  discrete amounts, whereas kinds of substances (e.g. wood) come in  continuous amounts.  The experiments in this proposal investigate  what factors lead children and adults to construe solid entities  as either objects, and thus quantify them discretely, or as  substances, and thus quantify them continuously. Specifically, we  will be investigating whether cues that suggest that the  structure an entity possesses is non-arbitrary (couldn't have  been just any other way) lead us to construe it as an object of  some kind, whereas cues that suggest that the structure an entity  possesses is arbitrary (could have been any other way) lead us to  construe the entity as an amount of solid material instead.  It  is expected that in addition to providing important data on how  conceptual representations are related to the linguistic  distinction between count- and mass nouns, the experiments will  shed light on the nature of conceptual representations during  development, and how they are related to representations within  other knowledge systems (e.g. systems for representing and  reasoning about quantities).",
