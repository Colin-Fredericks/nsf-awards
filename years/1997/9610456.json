 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this research project is to investigate the  local and global dynamics in the motion of a spinning disc  system and to numerically and experimentally verify the  theoretical results. The results of this research will be  useful in applications such as computer disc memory devices,  industrial circular saw blades, and turbine rotor dynamics. The  objectives of the research are four-fold. First, the general  nonlinear equations of motion governing the disc dynamics will  be derived systematically  to include the effects due to  inherent bending rigidity, membrane stresses arising from  centrifugal forces, non-axismmetry of the inplane and  transverse displacements, geometric nonlinearities, aerodynamic  damping arising from air stationary and moving with respect to  the disc, parametric excitation due to time varying spring  rate, etc.. Second, is equations, along with symmetry-breaking  bifurcations, will also be examined. Third the mechanisms which  five rise to global bifurcations in nonlinear spinning disc to  identify the important modes, locate the stability boundaries,  and examine the nature of the nonlinear response to verity the  theoretical predictions. Validation studies will be carried out  using actual data from manufacturers of spinning discs.  Experimental verification and validation in turn, guide the  development and refinement of the theories to incorporate any  new phenomena observed.",
