 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615274  Mukasa  Ultramafic xenolith suites from Jetty Peninsula, East Antarctica,  provide an unparalleled opportunity to examine and describe the  consequences of magma/rock reactions equilibrated at  subcontinental mantle temperatures and pressures during the  lithospheric extension that fragmented eastern Gondwanaland at  the end of the Jurassic and beginning of the Cretaceous.  The  samples to be used in this study were collected by Soviet/Russian  expeditions during 1982-83, 1983-84 and 1986-87 and have been put  entirely at our disposal by Dr. Alex Andronikov of the Department  of Antarctic Geology, VNII Okeangeologia, St. Petersburg, Russia  (now on leave at the University of G ttingen, Germany).  This  award will support analytical work to determine the Nd, Sr, and  Pb isotopic compositions and Rb/Sr, Sm/Nd, and U/Pb elemental  ratios for clinopyroxene (cpx) and glass taken from garnet  lherzolite and spinel lherzolite xenoliths, and to perform the  same measurements on whole-rock samples from the host magmatic  rocks which are alkaline picrite, aln ite, and nephelinite in  composition.  In addition, the analytical program will include  concentration measurements, using secondary ionization mass  spectrometry (SIMS), of the rare earth elements (REE) and Ba, Cs,  Cr, K, Nb, Rb, Sr, Ti, V, Y and Zr (in different combinations) in  cpx, garnet and the various glasses present in some of the  xenoliths.  With his recent award of a fellowship by the  Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Dr. Andronikov will carry out  complementary studies on the same materials at the University of  G ttingen, Germany, focusing on xenolith mineral chemistry  determined by electron microprobe, and the major and trace  element compositions of the host rocks measured by X-ray  fluorescence spectrometry and Inductively Coupled Plasma-mass  spectrometry, respectively.    The combined data will allow, for a subset of the xenoliths,  assessment of the degree and effects of partial melting in  lherzolites derived from  different depths in the upper mantle,  and, for a glass-bearing subset, characterization of the  compositions of the melts which intruded the mantle lithosphere  and altered its composition by infiltration.  Through analysis of  these results, this work will lead to better understanding of the  scale of chemical interactions between melts and adjacent wall  rocks at mantle depths in the Earth.  The principal objectives of  this work are to model the magmatic processes which affect  subcontinental mantle lithosphere during rifting, reconstruct the  thermal evolution of the lithosphere during such deformation,  determine the provenance of magmas which intrude the lithosphere  at various times during its evolution, and with model ages,  establish a connection between the evolution of the lithospheric  mantle beneath East Antarctica and the plate tectonic history of  eastern Gondwanaland.  In addition to the importance of this work  to regional geologic models, understanding the processes that  control lithospheric evolution during extension will provide  important general constraints on thermo-mechanical models of  rifting, and on chemical evolution of the mantle beneath  continents.",
