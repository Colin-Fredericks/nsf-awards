 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724387  Hauser    The semiconductor industry's National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (NTRS) is predicated on the continuing shrink of a planar silicon integrated circuit manufacturing technology.  Although the NTRS forecasts that an ultimate shrink to 70 nm gate length and 4 nm oxide thickness in YEAR 2010 will provide on-chip clock frequencies of 1 Ghz and an integration density of 0. 9 x 108 cm-2 for microprocessors and 0. 64 X 1011CM-2 for DRAM, demands of the marketplace will require that performance continue to increase beyond these limits in future years.  Both the semiconductor industry and the Department of Defense have recently recognized this requirement, and both are reacting to urge continued investment in research to achieve this more aggressive objective.    NCSU's Advanced Electronic Materials Processing Center (AEMP) has been conducting leading edge research relevant to this objective under the sponsorship of both the National Science Foundation (NSF) through an ERC and the Semiconductor Research Corporation through a SEMATECH Center of Excellence and now a Materials and Bulk Processing Research program.  Through collaboration with semiconductor industry partners, NCSU has made considerable impact on industry's technology advances.  Recently, AEMP has explored the issues related to the use of the vertical or third dimension for integrated circuit fabrication, a departure from the NTRS roadmap.  It may be possible by this approach to dramatically improve both circuit performance and functional circuit density.  Thus, new and more aggressive research goals have been defined that are aligned with the new national need.    One key to the accomplishment of these new goals is the ability to planarize and smooth the surface following each of the third dimension processing steps.  For this process, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is the optimum solution.  This proposal describes the need for this capability and requests funds for the purchase of equipment to establish this  capability within the AEMP.  Funds are requested for the purchase of three equipment items: (1) a chemical mechanical polishing tool, (2) a double sided wafer cleaner for use after CMP and, (3) an AFM metrology tool.  All three items are needed to provide the support for future research looking at applications of CMP to front end of the line silicon IC manufacturing processes.  ***",
