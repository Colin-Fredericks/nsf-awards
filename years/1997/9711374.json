 "awd_abstract_narration": "The idea of executing a transactional system under a lower isolation level than perfect Serializable isolation was introduced in a 1977 paper by IBM researchers, and implemented in IBM's DB2. It is now offered by most commercial DBMS systems supporting multi-user applications. Lower isolation levels permit more transactional threads to simultaneously execute an application, so processor resources are more effectively utilized. The tradeoff is that in perfect isolation, no update performed by one application thread can have any effect on data read and updated by an independent transactional thread; in lower isolation levels this is no longer the case. The intent is to use lower isolation levels only for \"safe\" applications, where the application code will not use isolation weaknesses to arrive at erroneous results. But the database field has no general method for deciding what applications are \"safe\". The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a method for evaluating large transactional application systems to determine what errors can arise at different isolation levels in common commercial use. This process of evaluation is to be known as Isolation Testing, and provides a list of all isolation problems that can occur in the workload. It is then possible to make modest changes in the database and application design to eliminate these errors and gain the advantage of a lower isolation level. Isolation Testing has the potential to make many of the largest commercial applications (e.g., banking, airline reservations) more efficient in their use of computer resources.",
