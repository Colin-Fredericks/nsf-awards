 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to address two problem areas in the application of information technology to engineering.  The first area to be addressed is the development of techniques for automatic classification and retrieval of designs using detailed product design attributes that are more meaningful and accurate than Group Technology codes and can be computed automatically from the designs stored in the database.  The second area to be addressed is the development of a hybrid variant/generative approach to process planning that will combine the best characteristics of both variant and generative process planning, while avoiding the worst limitations of each.  When a process plan is needed for a new design, the hybrid approach will use the above classification scheme to retrieve portions or `slices` of several plans that are relevant for corresponding portions of the design, and then will combine these slices and modify them to produce a plan for the new design.       If successful, this work will have the following benefits.  First, it will combine, in an innovative way, the strengths of both variant and generative process planning.  Like traditional variant process planning, the proposed approach to process planning will construct process plans that the process engineer may need to improve.  However, by automatically adapting the retrieved plans to the new design requirements, it will minimize the need for such improvements, thus producing more successful implementations and applications than previous methods.  Second, the proposed work will develop techniques that help design and manufacturing engineers effectively use legacy data and adapt it to new problems.  Since it is estimated that practicing engineers spend more than 80 percent of their time searching through legacy data, catalogs, and earlier engineering projects, this should have significant positive impact on engineering practice.",
