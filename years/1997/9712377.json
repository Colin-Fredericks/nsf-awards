 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two and a half day conference will provide the occasion for a comprehensive analysis and rich public discussion of the relationships between civic democracy, obligations to future generations, and the particular topic of the restoration of wolves to the Adirondacks. The conference will introduce these issues to a large, diverse audience including biologists, ecologists, philosophers, lawyers, activists, politicians, public policy analysts, and members of the media. Particular attention will be paid to the restoration of one species, the wolf, through three major realms of inquiry. First, philosophers and other humanists will address the moral question by considering what obligations current citizens have to future generations and how those obligations should be identified and fulfilled. Furthermore, they will address what values should guide public policy concerning the particular matter of the project to restore wolves to the Adirondacks. Second, the conference will involve political theorists, public policy specialists, and politicians, who will consider the adequacy of our current political institutions and laws to protect the interests of future generations. Particular attention will be given to exploring what kind of legislation can best embody contemporary wisdom concerning the conservation and restoration of various species. Third, biologists, ecologists, and paleontologists will discuss the biological issues. Given the radical difference between the time-scales of ecological and evolutionary change and human cultural change, they will consider what, exactly, is most important to save from a biological point of view. Furthermore, they will also address the long-term biological implications of the wolf restoration project. An important aspect of this event will be its inclusion of speakers capable of addressing three distinct themes within the single conference format. Participants from a range of disciplines will be carefully selected to explore the major themes. These scholars will make public presentations during the conference, and several of them will provide additional lectures at various universities and public gatherings elsewhere in the state of New York. The conference site is the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The anticipated date is October 21-23, 1998. Papers from the conference will be collected in a scholarly book intended for academic faculty and students in a range of disciplines as well as general citizens, legislators and policy analysts with an interest in the issues of intergenerational obligations and species restoration. The presentations will be video-taped, so that they can be utilized in distance education and public education courses. Finally, the material from the conference will be utilized in a university course offered over the Internet. The conference should foster valuable public debate concerning its principal themes and contribute to public understanding concerning intergenerational obligations, wolf restoration projects, and the importance of citizen participation in public policy debates with long-term implications.",
