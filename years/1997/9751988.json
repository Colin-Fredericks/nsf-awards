These materials are being created to answer the pressing need for high-quality, professional-level instructional materials for training two-year community and technical college students--as well as secondary school students, 4-year university students, and corporate and government employees.  Educational institutions can incorporate Preserving the Legacy within distance learning programs that link instructors and students through telecommunications.  Others can integrate the materials within training programs for business and industry.  Preserving the Legacy is designed for flexible use in any number of curricular programs and educational delivery modes.  When Preserving the Legacy is complete, textbooks and videos will be available nationally and internationally to present the basics of environmental technology, not only to inform and train students, but also to inspire future students.  As one of its promises, then, the Preserving the Legacy project helps ensure that we create a national legacy of well-trained environmental technicians.",
