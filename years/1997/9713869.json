This information is being used by current and future ATE project directors to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the kinds of mathematical skills students preparing for technological careers are expected to have and a more realistic view of what ATE programs should accomplish in mathematics.  Specific goals of the project include:  (a) creating a vision of high quality mathematics for students in vocational and technological education programs consistent with high academic standards developed by numerous organizations, and (b) developing and publicizing a variety of effective strategies for creating challenging mathematical tasks.",
