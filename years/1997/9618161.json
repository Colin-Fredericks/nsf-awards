 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. David R. Tyler, Department of Chemistry, University of Oregon is   supported by the Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division for the development of metallacycles for the synthesis main   group heterocycles by remote intramolecular C-H bond activation. A series   of early transition metal vinyl complexes that present one or more sites   for intramolecular C-H activation and that always include at least one   site that is accessible for gamma-activation will be prepared. The chemo-   and regio- selectivity of the C-H  activation reactions by these   complexes will be determined. Through systematic variation in the   placement and nature of the substituents on the vinyl group and the   nature of the transition metal, an understanding of the steric and   electronic factors favoring remote activation will be developed. The   resulting information will be used to assist in the rational preparation   of metallacyclic complexes, particularly metallacyclobutenes bearing    substituent patterns unavailable through the use of existing synthetic   procedures. There metallacyclic complexes will be exploited, with primary   focus on the development of catalytic uses of the complexes in the   formation of heterocyclic compounds.   Transition metals are often used to effect the preparation of important   organic chemicals. This project aims at developing new methods to prepare   a variety of heretofore difficult to obtain species. These `heterocyclic`   compounds have great laboratory, industrial, and biological significance.   In addition, this project will explore the activation of carbon-hydrogen   bonds that are remote from a transition metal. This phase of the   investigation will provide fundamental information on how organic   compounds can be activated by transition metals.",
