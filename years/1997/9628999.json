 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is developing a methodology and efficient techniques for evaluating and/or  predicting power dissipation of CMOS circuits. The major components of the  proposed methodology are survey sampling techniques, automata-based sequence  compaction techniques, a behavioral/logic level co-simulation engine,  regression-based power macro-modeling techliques, and information-theoretic  models of power dissipation.    Special emphasis is being given to parasitic capacitance estimation, input data  modeling, impact of memory hierarchy and circuit architecture, and effects of  nonlinear delay equations and custom wire load models on accuracy/efficiency  trade-offs of the estimators. Concurrently, CAD methodologies and techniques for  minimizing the power dissipation in VLSI circuits and systems are being  developed. These are: low power optimization techniques and prototype software  programs for system-level partitioning and hardware/software codesign,  communication synthesis, multiple supply voltage scheduling, activity-driven  register allocation and binding, bus encoding, state assignment for interacting  finite state machines, logic restructuring and simplification, timing-driven  placement, routing and zero-skew clock tree construction. Finally, power  management techniques such as (serial or parallel) gated clocks, stoppable  clocks, and dynamic switching between power modes are being studied and  automated.",
