 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project covers the development and analysis of new  algorithms for weighted least-squares problems and their  applications.  In many practical applications, the weights vary  by large factors, giving rise to ill-conditioned cases.  In the  past decade several authors independently proved a norm bound for  this case of an ill-conditioned weight matrix.  In previous work  the PI followed up on this norm bound with the discovery of a  stable algorithm for weighted least squares. ``Stable'' means  that the accuracy of the algorithm is not affected by ill-  conditioning of the weight matrix.    The norm bound and the stable algorithm turn out to have several  unexpected applications.  For example, a new interior point  method was discovered whose running time, unlike for all  previous interior point methods, does not depend on the numerical  data of the objective function.  Also, a way was found to stably  solve a class of finite element methods on which previously known  algorithms would have failed.    In this research project, weighted least-squares problems will be  pursued along several lines:    (1) iterative methods for weighted least squares will be      developed, as well as improved sparse-matrix methods,    (2) results for linear programming will be extended to      semidefinite programming,    (3) new algorithms will be invented for the highly nonlinear      problems arising in electric power networks, which have      at their core a generalized weighted least-squares problem,      and    (4) inverse finite element problems will be addressed.    The outcome of this project will be more accurate and more  efficient algorithms for optimization and simulation problems  arising in science and engineering.",
