 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9724050  Gaber        The expression of many genes in the yeast Saccharomyces  cerevisiae, is regulated by the availability of glucose or other  hexoses.  For example, in the presence of low glucose  concentrations some genes are transcriptionally induced whereas  others are only induced when the cell is exposed to high  concentrations of glucose. In addition, many genes, like those  involved in the transport and metabolism of galactose, are  transcriptionally repressed by glucose.  The integration of both  positive and negative transcriptional regulation in S. cerevisiae  involves a complex, sometimes redundant network of signaling  pathways.  The identity of glucose signaling molecules remains  largely unknown despite intensive efforts toward their discovery.  Recently, a novel glucose signaling pathway was discovered, in  which Snf3, a membrane protein with a resemblance to glucose  transporters, was found to be required for the negative  regulation of HXT6, a glucose transporter gene that undergoes  transcriptional repression in response to moderate or high levels  of glucose.  This negative role of Snf3 on HXT6 expression in  response to glucose is unique.  Also unusual is the expression of  HXT6 in the complete absence of glucose; all other glucose  transporter genes require either low or high concentrations of  glucose to induce expression.  Moreover the expression of SNF3 in  cells deleted for the functional HXT genes is insufficient to  confer either growth on glucose or glucose uptake.  Thus Snf3 may  function more like a glucose receptor than a transporter and its  principal role appears to the elicitation or maintenance of the  appropriate signaling pathway that allows the cell to respond to  the availability of glucose by inducing or repressing downstream  target genes.         One goal of the proposed research is to identify proteins  that participate in the Snf3-dependent signaling pathway.  A  genetic characterization will determine the effects of known  mutations on Sn f3 signaling.  Genetic screens will also be  carried out to identify mutations in genes that specifically  affect this pathway.  The genes identified through the mutant  screens will be cloned and the proteins they encode will be  determined.  These results will enable the construction of  molecular tools that are required to assess the relative  positions and roles played by specific proteins  in this pathway.  This research will lead to the identification of the molecular  mechanism involved in transducing the glucose signal, and  lead  to an understanding of how a membrane protein of the glucose  transporter family can maintain a glucose availability signal  that is transmitted to the nucleus where it can enhance or  repress transcription of specific genes.  %%%            This research is examining how a membrane protein which  is similar in sequence to glucose transporters, can negatively  regulate glucose transporter genes  that are repressed in  response to moderate or high levels of glucose.  The results of  these studies in yeast will lead to our understanding of the  mechanism by which cells can respond to different levels of  glucose in their environment.    ***",
