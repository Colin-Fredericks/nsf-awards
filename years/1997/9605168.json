 "awd_abstract_narration": "9605168  Klug      The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site  at Michigan State University's W. K. Kellogg Biological  Station (KBS) offers undergraduate students an opportunity  to participate in interdisciplinary research activities in  the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. Students are  exposed to concepts and techniques from a variety of  disciplines and levels of biological organization, from  genes to landscapes, including microbial ecology, animal  behavior, and plant ecological genetics. Individual research  projects are carried out under the supervision of faculty  advisors, and weekly seminars and other activities help  foster intellectual exchange among students, faculty, and  visiting scientists. The KBS offers a wide variety of  terrestrial and aquatic habitats, both natural and managed,  for observational and experimental research, as well as  superb laboratory facilities; active year-long programs  bring numerous graduate students, postdoctoral associates,  and senior researchers to the Station regularly, who can be  expected to interact with and help mentor undergraduates.       Students participate in their own REU Noon Seminar  series as well as other seminars and discussion groups at  KBS, which exposes them to other areas of research. Each  student develops and conducts an independent research  project during the summer sessions, involving all stages of  the scientific process: identification and refinement of a  scientific question or hypothesis; experimental design and  sampling techniques; field and laboratory work; data  analysis and presentation. Students present their research  to the KBS community at a REU Symposium, and are encouraged  to synthesize their results for publication in collaboration  with their faculty advisors.",
