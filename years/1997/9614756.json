 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614756  Jones  Laser-based Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry LA-ICPMS)  is a new technique, which is being applied for the first time in  the Southern Ocean, to examine movement-at-age in Patagonian  Toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). The chemical structure of  growth increments in the otoliths of fish reflects the composition  of water passing across the gills; the increments also give a  chronological record of the life history of individual fish before  capture and are used for aging. Elemental analysis using LA-ICPMS  allows accurate sampling of a suite of elements in the otoliths,  giving a record of changes in the water mass experienced by the  fish. This can be related retroactively to age and real time using  the increments.    The project is an international collaboration between scientists  from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Chile and  Australia. The central collaboration is between scientists at Old  Dominion University and the British Antarctic Survey, bringing  together the most extensive experience currently available of the  technique, with that of Antarctic life systems. Scientists from  France, Chile, Australia and the United States are providing  samples of Toothfish otoliths from the Southern Ocean and southern  South America.    The project consists of four inter-linked modules, addressing the  overall question: what are the patterns of movement of Patagonian  Toothfish over its life history in relation to variability of  water mass in time and space? The objectives are to show that the  LA-ICPMS technique can discriminate between Patagonian Toothfish  from different geographical regions, develop a validated aging  method, and characterize the variability of the chemical signal  with age and between years. Other objectives are to elucidate  differential spawning sites, and examine age-specific movement  retrospectively in individual fish within the Southern Ocean, and  within the Patagonia-Scotia Arc region. NSF will fund only module  3 (Does eleme ntal analysis indicate movement of Patagonian  toothfish between the Atlantic, Inian, and Pacific sectors of the  Southern Ocean?), while modules 1, 2, and 4 will be funded by  other governments.    The first module consists of a preliminary test for elemental  variability in otoliths, using LA-ICPMS. The second is the  development of a reliable aging method with fully validated  criteria for interpretation of growth increments, using marginal  increment analysis. The third module consists of analysing, with  LAICPMS, a suite of elements present across otolith sections of  fish taken from Macquarie Island, the Kerguelen Islands and South  Georgia in the Southern Ocean. Discrimination of element  concentrations at the otolith edge between regions will confirm  that the technique can detect geographic separation in Patagonian  Toothfish. Discrimination by year class of concentrations at the  nucleus will indicate that spawning sites are separate. Comparison  between known-age sites in the otoliths will test for changes in  the elemental profile with age corresponding to movement of fish  between water masses. Comparison between the same known-age sites  of fish from different age classes will test for variability  between years. The fourth module examines elemental concentrations  on a finer scale, comparing consecutive year sites across otoliths  sampled from northern and southern Chile, the Falkland Islands and  South Georgia.    The results of the project will be of direct benefit to population  and ecosystem ecologists, oceanographers, and fisheries managers  working in the Southern Ocean and outside. They will indicate  where movement occurs in time and space, and where populations are  isolated potentially by oceanographic barriers. The validation of  aging criteria will be a major contribution to accurate aging of  Patagonian Toothfish. Better knowledge of age and stock structure,  and mixing levels, is important for the use of fisheries yield  models; better understanding of the role playe d by environmental  processes will allow better prediction of recruitment and growth.  The chemical structure of the otolith may be used as a retroactive  environmental record, giving data that may enhance understanding  of the role of inter-annual variability in structuring marine  ecosystems, and allow detection of trends associated with  climate-induced change.",
