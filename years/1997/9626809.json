They are designing and developing, determining and controlling behavior, utilizing, assessing, contextual relationships, nature and evolution of technology, and technological concepts and principles.  Using this as a basis, this project develops standards for what technological concepts and processes students should understand and be able to apply in grades K-12 with benchmarks at grades 2, 5, 8 and 12.  The standards are compiled by a small central staff.  Three  teams, consisting of representatives from technology education, both teachers and technologists, as well as representatives from science, mathematics, and engineering some of whom were involved in developing other standards, provide the content.  Input and consensus is developed by presentations to diverse groups interested in education, newsletters, and the WWW.   Third party evaluation is used to monitor the content and the process to assure that the standards are useful in a variety of contexts.",
