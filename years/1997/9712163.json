 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Net Scout project is an Internet resource location and technology service oriented primarily to the higher education community. It  currently provides four services that are used by thousands of faculty, staff, and students in higher education: the Scout Report, Net Happenings, the Scout Toolkit, and the KIDS Report. The Scout Report is a weekly electronic newsletter summarizing the best new Internet resources of use to higher education. Net Happenings is an electronic service that provides immediate notification of 50-70 Internet   announcements each day via a mailing list, a newsgroup, and a Web site.  The Scout Toolkit summarizes the best Internet search services and other tools needed by researchers and educators to use the Internet effectively. The KIDS Report is a biweekly newsletter written by students in elementary, middle, and high school classrooms who select and describe the Web sites they find the most interesting and useful.     The Net Scout project will continue and expand these services in two ways:  First, to provide additional services, including publication of three biweekly Scout Reports produced by specialists  in the specific areas of Science and Engineering, Social Sciences, and Business and Economics, and, second, to implement new tools which aid in the   location of Internet resources in a specific subject area. A prototype   service will be built using as its initial base the three year archive of the highly selective resources that have been included in the Scout Report. Specialized authenticated collections of quality resources at higher education institutions will also be identified and included in the prototype.    http://wwwscout.cs.wisc.edu/",
