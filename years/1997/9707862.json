 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707862  Schroeder    This award supports a two-year collaborative research  project between Professor Roger Schroeder of the University  of Minnesota and Professor Michiya Morita of Gakushuin  University in Japan.  The researchers will undertake a study  on the effect of development cycle time and production cycle  time on manufacturing effectiveness in both the U.S. and  Japan.  Additionally, they will study the effect of  manufacturing strategy and quality in the two countries on  the resulting cycle time.  Reduction of cycle time and the  associated manufacturing strategy has been an important  objective of companies in both countries.  They will attempt  to determine:  1) why similarities and differences exist;  2) how cycle time reduction facilitates competition and  cooperation among firms; and  3) how quality and cycle time  are interrelated.  The researchers will visit factories in  the U.S. and Japan to develop case studies in order to  extract theoretical propositions and implications.    This collaboration consists of researchers who are very  knowledgeable in their field and will be invaluable to each  other in gaining access to the companies they plan to  survey.  This research has significance to industry because  it will suggest the best practices for maximizing plant  performance, using a broad set of performance criteria.  It  is important to academia because it will advance knowledge  by using multiple theories and multiple disciplines to  address a question of trade-offs, which have not been  effectively addressed by previous research.  Through the  exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden  our base of basic knowledge and promote international  understanding and cooperation.  ***",
