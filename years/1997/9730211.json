 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for organizing two workshops to study the  potential of autoadaptive media in civil engineering and to  define targets and types of needed university-based, cross  disciplinary research for broad applications in civil  infrastructures. Autoadaptive media are materials, mechanisms,  devices, and structures that can modify, monitor, or control  their own characteristics to respond appropriately to external  stimuli. The slow adoption of autoadaptive media by civil  engineering is attributed mainly to three perceptions; lack of  relevant information, concern about maintenance of the materials  and devices in the field, and cost of materials. A directed  research initiative will help alleviate and possibly even  eliminate the first two perceptions and will exploit the vast  potential of these media fully. A research initiative targeting  the civil engineering uses of autoadaptive materials is desirable  because (1) in relation to consideration of `added value` to the  knowledge base it will have a substantial impact, (2) to leave it  to serendipitous development is to delay any possibly  application, and (3) even if the current prognostications are  negative, it is a strategic mistake not to explore an opportunity  that may revolutionize many segments of civil engineering. The  project activity will explore the potential of autoadaptive media  for civil engineering applications and to develop a program of  appropriate actions. It is predicated on the belief that the  knowledge base already developed by material scientists and  control engineers must be tapped and redirected by engineers  intimately familiar with the demands of civil-engineering  application.",
