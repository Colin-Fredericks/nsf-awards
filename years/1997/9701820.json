Pepin, a doctoral student at Washington University in St. Louis working under the supervision of Drs. Jonathan B. Losos and Allan Larson.  Mr. Pepin's dissertation research will utilize phylogenetic relationships among 46 species of monitor lizards (genus Varanus), as inferred from mitochondrially- and nuclear-encoded DNA sequences, to examine and test several hypotheses regarding variation in morphology and life history.  Monitor lizards vary dramatically in body size and are an ideal, model group in which to test these hypotheses.  Specifically, the influence of allometry on life-histmry traits will be examined to determine the influence of life-history on body size.  Reproductive traits to be examined include egg-clutch number, and hatchling size.  The award will provide support for Mr. Pepin to travel to several museums in the United States to obtain data from specimens sampled from the Philippines, Guam, Indonesia, and Northern Africa.  Foreign travel to Australia and Western Europe will allow Mr. Pepin to obtain data from specimens not available in U.S. museums.  Funds for materials and supplies will permit acquisition of both morphological and molecular data. .  Support for training of graduate students in modern technologies is critical to maintain the workforce of scientists capable of addressing questions and issues in global biology.",
