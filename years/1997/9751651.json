 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stereolithography: A Distributed Partnership       Stereolithography has become a powerful industrial tool in reducing the manufacturing lead time from design conceptualization to product realization. It has begun appearing in engineering and technology curricula only recently. One objective of the project is to enable Rowan's engineering students to rapidly produce designs working with their technology team partners at Camden County College. This activity is centered around the creation of a stereolithography center. Freshmen engineering students develop product designs in their engineering clinic course, but are generally unable to fabricate them since conventional processes require high degrees of skill and long cycle times. Stereolithography allows any 3-d model developed on a computer to be produced by successively solidifying layers of resin using a laser beam. Engineering students can now ascertain the design complexity and assess the functional requirements. Technology students now have access to a state-of-the-art manufacturing capability that complements their training in computer integrated manufacturing and laser technology.       The second objective of the project was to bring technology and engineering students together in project teams. This represents the real work environment that students will face after graduation. By placing the stereolithography equipment at Camden County College, Rowan's engineering students must interact with the technology students by remote access to produce prototypes of their designs. The remote access is provided by video teleconferencing combined with distributed computing using a networked design package.       This innovative approach will better prepare both engineering and technology students to adapt to a rapidly changing work place.",
