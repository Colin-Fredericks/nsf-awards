 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727144  Engblom  The objectives of this research are threefold and include:  (1) the characterization of micromorphology, (2) the  determination of life cycle mechanical properties, and (3)  the development of a computer-based design methodology,  i.e., for fiber-reinforced commingled recycled plastic  lumber (CRPL) of efficient structural form.  Reinforcements  would include hybrid combinations of chopped natural fibers,  chopped recycled synthetic fibers, and continuous synthetic  fibers.  Rectangular hollowcored CRPL profiles will be  extruded with variations in wall thickness and reinforcement  to obtain mechanical properties equivalent to or better than  2x4 wooden lumber.  The design methodology will be developed  on the basis of characterizing micro-morphology through  microscopy in combination with full scale structural  testing.    Rectangular hollow-cored CRPL profiles will be extruded with  variations in the weight percentages and types of chopped  fibers, variations in weight percentages of continuous glass  rovings, variations in thermoplastic waste, and variations  in compatibilizers.  A statistically significant set of  samples, of each of these material combinations, will be  subjected to tension, compression, flexure, fatigue and  creep structural testing to determine short/long term (life  cycle) properties.  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) will  also be performed on small specimens cut from structural  samples to quantify both the micro-morphology and damage  mechanisms of the various reinforced CRPL blends.  The  microscopy data will be essential in developing a finite  element (FE) based design methodology.  The computer  modeling approach taken will be to utilize repeating cells  (or super-elements) to model repeating' representative  volumes of the commingled thermoplastic matrix with  distributed reinforcement.    Synthetic lumber has been developed due to the large  quantities of dirty and/or mixed thermoplastic waste that is  not easily or cost effectively recyclabl e.  However,  primarily due to their low elastic moduli (stiffness)  properties, present unreinforced CRPL products do not  compete with pressure treated lumber for load-bearing  applications.  Perhaps as importantly as finding uses for  waste plastics is the need to minimize the environmental  impact of deforestation of old growth forests.  Additional  environmental impact is related to the toxic treatment of  lumber.  The waste products from pressure treating  operations are highly toxic and require elaborate disposal  methods.  Furthermore, treated lumber itself poses health  hazards to people and the environment.  Without pressure  treatment, the life expectancy can range from 5-10 years for  lumber as compared to more that 30 years for plastic  alternatives.    The significance of the proposed research is, therefore,  that both a material properties data base and associated  design tools can be developed for hybrid forms of CRPL that  can potentially replace pressure-treated lumber in much  residential and commercial construction.  Long term 'life'  material properties data for reinforced CRPL does not  presently exist.  Since macro-mechanical behavior of  reinforced CRPL is strongly related to micro-morphology and  to structural form, efficient structural profiles  (extrusions) will be utilized in all of the structural  testing.  The knowledge gained in this research should  provide the basis for developing superior  construction materials which (1) pose no  health hazard, and (2) provide the means of  preventing waste plastics from ever entering  the waste stream in the future.  ***",
