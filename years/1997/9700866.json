The project will provide hands-on learning in the context of a course title Indoor Wireless Project.  The course will be taught by the team of PI's who are actively engaged in research in wireless communications and have significant experience in hardware implementation of communication and digital signal processing systems.  The project will carry two credits per semester and will require a two-semester commitment from participants.  It will be offered in two sections accommodating a total of 24 students, who will be working in teams of three.  Graduate students involved in parallel research efforts will also participate.  The overall goal will be to design, implement and test an indoor wireless network for two-way voice communication, data transfers and (eventually) video transmission on an adaptable hardware platform based on programmable digital signal processor chips.  The first-year goal will be to implement and test a simplex wireless link between two portables, i.e., one transmitting and the other receiving.  For the second year, the goal will be to implement a working wireless network consisting of a base station and four portables in a star configuration.  For the third year of the effort, the goal will be to refine the platform to enable simultaneous real-time voice, data and video transfers among the portables, possibly using different system implementations.  The project will continue evolving after the third year as a regular course in the electrical engineering curriculum.  The Indoor Wireless Project will generate software and written reports which will be electronically disseminated to the academic community.  It will also result in  the creation of a virtual wireless lab site on the World Wide Web.  The effectiveness of the project will be evaluated in terms of the project's output, the participants' subjective evaluation and long-term career profiles, and the project's impact on the academic community at large.",
