 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spearing  9702399  Structures  made  from  composite  materials  and  laminates  generally fail by a combination of interacting damage  modes  operating over a continuum of length scales.  Design against  failure  is  complicated  because, unlike  monolithic  metal  alloys, no single failure mode dominates.  It is, therefore,  critical to develop models with a predictive capability that  include the effects of such damage for the efficient  design  of   structures,  using  polymer,  metal  and  ceramic-based  advanced  materials.  Dr. Spearing's core research  activity  is  the  development  of  physically-based  models  for  the  failure  of  advanced  materials.   These  models  will   be  presented  and actively communicated in a form suitable  for  use  as  structural design tools, in aerospace  applications  and  elsewhere.  Dr. Spearing has a strong grounding in this  activity  through his involvement in previous  projects,  in  industry  and  academia,  on  polymer  and  ceramic   matrix  composites  and  layered ceramic materials.   Research  will  include  modeling,  using closed-form and  numerical,  solid  mechanics  and  fracture  mechanics solutions  supported  by  appropriate mechanical testing and observational techniques.  The   emphasis   will   be   on   conducting   research   on  technologically   important  topics  in   conjunction   with  partners in industry, academia and government agencies.    Dr.  Spearing's  educational goal is to excel  at  classroom  teaching, student supervision and mentoring activities.   He  will  continue  to  develop a new graduate  course  to  give  students  a  solid  grounding in the  failure  mechanics  of  composite  materials, particularly focusing on  the  use  of  mechanics   of   materials  models  to  predict   structural  performance.  This course links directly to the  established  departmental curriculum, through an existing course  on  the  \"Mechanics  of  Filamentary  Composites,\"  taught   by   Dr.  Spearing  in  1995.  In additi on the new course  complements  the  research  plan outlined above.  A longer term  goal  of  this  curriculum and research integration is to  refine  the  teaching of this important subject to the point where it can  be written as textbook or as a computer-based teaching tool.  Dr.  Spearing co-teaches an undergraduate laboratory  course  on  the  manufacture  and mechanical  testing  of  composite  materials,   which  provides  a  strong  link  between   the  department's   research  activities  and  the  undergraduate  curriculum.  Dr. Spearing will continue to act as an advisor  for undergraduate and graduate students, on academic, career  and  other  concerns,  He  will  also  continue  to  educate  graduate  and undergraduate students through the supervision  of research activities.    The award of this grant under the CAREER Faculty Early  Career Development Program will support the educational and  research activities described in this proposal.  In  particular it will allow the investigator and a graduate  student to devote time to the integration of these  activities.  In addition it will enable increased  collaboration with colleagues, in universities, government  agencies and industry.  The overall aim is to achieve the  synthesis of more generalized models for the failure of  advanced materials, and to communicate them in such a way as  to inform and educate current and future generations of  engineers.",
