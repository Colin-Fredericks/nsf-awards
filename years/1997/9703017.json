 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient communication is at the very heart of extracting  performance from  a parallel or distributed system. The design of a parallel  or distributed  network involves a number of complex design choices.  This  research aims at  providing a sound theoretical basis for making these choices  and help meet  the challenges of the evolving National Information  Infrastructure (NII).  This  project will study important theoretical issues in the  design of parallel or distributed networks that guarantee  quality-of-service (QoS) performance metrics. Further,  this  effort will focus on simple implementable protocols for  store-and-forward, wormhole, and deflection routing.  This  project will investigate theoretical aspects of wireless  communication, including call admission algorithms, and  algorithms for mobility management. The education plan  includes activities  involving research into novel teaching  methodologies, participating in teaching seminars, and  consulting with experienced educators. A new core  undergraduate course in algorithms will be developed with  the aim of integrating algorithmic theory with algorithmic  practice. The course will focus on a number of teaching  innovations.  ***",
