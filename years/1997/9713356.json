Nairn  University of Utah    New  techniques for solving fracture problems in  composites  that  treat  the  residual  stresses  commonly  arising   in  composite   materials   by   using  thermoelastic   fracture  mechanics  formulations are developed using  a  four-pronged  approach: the derivation of new exact thermoelastic fracture  analyses   specific  for  composites;  the  development   of  approximate   techniques  including   variational   fracture  mechanics, the analysis of observed finite fracture  events,  and experimental verification.  The exact techniques provide  new tools for analysis of composite fracture and are used in  place  of  stress  intensity factor  techniques,  which  are  powerful  for isotropic and homogeneous materials,  but  are  much  less useful for composites. The approximate techniques  are   aimed   at   finding  general  tools  for   accurately  determining the quantities appearing in the exact  analyses.  These  techniques will be based on new variational  theorems  that  will make it possible to derive useful upper and lower  bounds  for energy release rate.  The term \"finite  fracture  events\" refers to the observation that composites often fail  by  a  series  of  discrete  fracture  events  (e.g.,  fiber  fracture,  ply  cracking,  or  debonding)  rather  than   by  continuous crack growth.  The present work develops fracture  mechanics  tools  for  dealing with such  discrete  fracture  events. All analysis methods are verified by application  to  real and relevant failure processes in composite materials.",
