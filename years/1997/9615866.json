 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research on carbon dioxide by Dr. Donald J. Darensbourg   of the Chemistry Department, Texas A&M University.  The main focus of the   research is on the fundamental processes occurring during   copolymerization of carbon dioxide and epoxides to form polycarbonates.    Information gleaned will be used to design more selective catalysts for   those reactions.  Tungsten, zinc, cadmium, and copper complexes will be   used to probe the lability of alkoxide complexes, epoxide complexation   and subseqent coupling with ligated carboxylates, and catalyst activity   and selectivity.   In addition, metal catalyzed copolymerization   reactions of carbon dioxide and aziridines to form polyurethane will be   explored, and reactivity of carbon dioxide with coordinatively and   electronically unsaturated metal carbonyl derivatives that contain   pi-donor ligands will be investigated.  Biphasic catalysis and   supercritical carbon dioxide will be used for catalyst separation from   the substrate and the product in these homogeneous processes.    Carbon dioxide is a potential source of carbon for various uses.  Also,   it can serve as an environmentally-benign replacement solvent for   volatile organic compounds.  In this study, catalysts will be designed   for reactions in which carbon dioxide is used as a source material for   synthesis of useful polymers.  In addition, supercritical carbon dioxide   will be tested as a solvent for some of the separations needed in the   process.",
