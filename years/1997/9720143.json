 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Robert A. Steiner  IBN:  9720143  Reproduction in mammals is governed by a hormonal communication system linking the brain and pituitary gland to the gonads. The brain is responsible for integrating hormonal signals (e.g., estrogen) from the ovaries and testes and directing the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from cells in the brain. These cells, in turn, serve as the final common pathway for the control of gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland. The overall goal of our research is to understand how these brain cells work to coordinate the functions of the reproductive system. The specific objective of this proposal is to learn more about the physiological significance of a small molecule, called galanin, and its receptor in the regulation of reproduction in the female rat. It has been shown by previous research that galanin plays a crucial role in the regulation of hormone secretion from the brain and pituitary; however, we have only a limited understanding of precise mechanisms by which galanin actually works. Galanin-containing cells are widely dispersed throughout the brain, including the forebrain and hindbrain, and galanin works together with other important signaling molecules (e.g., norepinephrine, NE, and GnRH) to exert its action. With probes that allow detection of messenger RNAs coding for galanin and its receptors coupled with a precise chemical analysis of the brain,  experiments have been designed first, to identify the target cells for galanin's action in the brain; second, to reveal the functional significance of galanin produced in the hindbrain for the control of reproductive hormone secretion from the pituitary gland; and third, to learn more about the interactions of galanin and other important molecules in mice bearing genetically altered brain chemistry. The results of the studies outlined in this proposal should help us to understand more about the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms governing reproduction and other important physiologi cal functions in mammals.",
