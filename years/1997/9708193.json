 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   chemistry program supports research in the laboratory of Dr. James A.   Larrabee at Middlebury College under the Research in Undergraduate   Institutions (RUI) initiative.  Dr. Larrabee's research group will   investigate coupled binuclear cobalt complexes as models for the active   site in methionine amino peptidase (MAP).  Variable-temperature,   variable-field magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) will be used to probe   the ground state electronic structure of this recently discovered enzyme.    Zero-field splitting and magnetic exchange constants will be determined   for model compounds and protein systems.  Since substrate molecules may   bind across the cobalt ions, changes in metal-metal exchange coupling may   be important in the functioning of the enzyme.       An unusual cobalt-cobalt active site in a newly discovered enzyme,   methionine amino peptidase, will be probed by magnetic circular   dichroism.  These spectroscopic studies will be carried on model   compounds and other proteins, which have a dinuclear cobalt site   substituted into them.  Comparisons between the model compounds,   theoretical models and the actual enzyme will be made in order to   understand the functioning of the active site in the enzyme.",
