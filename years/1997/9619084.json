In year-1 ten three-teacher teams, of physics and physical science (middle and high school) teachers, join scientists at the University of Virginia, Jefferson National Laboratory and at six other Virginia sites for the research experience.  The workshops to facilitate transfer to the classroom will be done at the University of Virginia-Charlottesville.  In year-2 this cohort will continue their work and be joined by a new cohort of 30 teachers.  Teachers may earn 8-graduate credit hours for both summers through the University of Virginia-Charlottesville.  An important feature is the field supervisor who will track and keep in constant contact with teachers during the summer and academic year to facilitate transfer back to the classroom.  The pedagogy and leadership workshop component will prepare teachers to conduct workshops for their peers, improve computer networking skills, and construct apparatus to facilitate transfer of the research experience back to the classroom.",
