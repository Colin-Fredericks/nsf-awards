 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712564  Hubbard  The aim of this research is to integrate posture  measurements with the measurement of postural support forces  into a kinetic computer model of seated people.  This  kinetic model would include the biomechanics of human  posture and movement with the support forces.  The support  forces and postural changes would be measured on a group of  subjects and be used to develop the model.  Inputs to the  kinetic model are posture, weight distribution, and support  forces.  Outputs from the model will be computations of  forces and moments at the joints between the human body  segments.  This kinetic model will include the kinematic  linkage of the human, based on anatomical structure, which  has been validated based on past and current studies by the  investigator.  This kinematic linkage simulation can be  scaled to fit size and movements of individual human  subjects.  The weight distribution will be estimated from  anthropometric measurements for each of the body segments.  This research is in collaboration with an industrial  partner, Johnson Controls, Inc., a designer and manufacturer  of automotive seats.  However, this research also has  potential application for any seating industry that must  provide appropriate support for task function, e.g.,  military, office, medical, etc.  This funding would provide  support for an engineering graduate student to perform part  of her Ph.D. research in collaboration with the industrial  partner.  ***",
