 "awd_abstract_narration": "People draw diagrams and sketch to explore ideas, understand  problems, generate alternatives, and communicate.   However,  today's menu and text based human-computer interfaces do not  take advantage of this commonly used modality.  The Back  of  an  Envelope project aims to support freehand drawing as  an  interface  to  knowledge  based design  tools.   It  employs  advances  in gesture recognition, interpretation  of  visual  languages,  and  pen based computing, and  explores  how  to  combine  these technologies to build drawing interfaces  for  end  user  applications.  The Back of an Envelope has  three  specific  objectives: develop a framework for using freehand  drawing  to  communicate with computer-based  design  tools,  construct a working prototype that links a drawing interface  with design tools, and assess the prototype's performance in  design  studios  and classroom settings.  The  project  also  aims  to elucidate roles that graphical communication  plays  in  problem-solving and design.  The project's  significance  is  that it expands the range of modalities available to end  users,  enhancing traditional text and menu interfaces  with  freehand drawing.  This enables designers to employ computer  aided  design tools earlier in a design process,  when  they  are  sketching  and making diagrams. Besides computer  aided  design,  the Back of an Envelope interface framework can  be  employed in other problem solving applications.",
