 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Undergraduate research experience for six students over seven  weeks.  Computational group theory methods are employed to  explore the geometry of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces tiled by  triangles and the induced  tilings of the hyperbolic plane. All  tilings  considered generate large symmetry groups of the  surface, and the geometrical and combinatorial properties of  the  tiling are strongly reflected in the structure of the group and  the groupOs action on the geometry.  The geometric and  combinatorial problems need to be solved by massive computations  in the symmetry groups, as it is very difficult to visually  represent the complexities of these tilings.  Motivated by these  problems, students  will perform group theoretic experiments,   make discoveries and formulate conjectures by carrying out  computer calculations using the software package MAGMA. The end  goal will be to discover and prove theorems about  the geometry  and combinatorics of the surfaces and, of course, anything about  groups discovered along the way.   In addition to this technical  program, students will be engaged in a companion program to  develop their oral and written mathematical communication skills,  collaborative, and  other professional skills.  This will be  accomplished  through required oral presentations and technical   reports on their work and a close, positive working environment   among the students and the P.I. in the Theorodrome, the  computer laboratory/workplace devoted to the REU.",
