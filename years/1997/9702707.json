 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves improving quality, reducing cost, and shortening the time-  to-market for image and video processing systems, such as video telephones,  multimedia systems, and confocal microscopes.  Image and video processing systems  are difficult to design because they consist of a variety of algorithms  implemented by a variety of electronic devices and software programs.  In  industry, it is common practice to divide the design of an image or video  processing system into simpler parts and design the parts separately.  Until all  of the individual parts are designed and built, it is difficult to guarantee that  the parts will work together, and know how the decisions in the design of an  individual part will affect the cost and quality of the entire system.  As an  alternative, this research explores design techniques and computer tools that  allow all the parts of an image and video processing system to be designed at the  same time.    The principal investigator is establishing a research and education program in  the design and implementation of image and video processing systems.  The  research focuses on automating the design of scalable software and hardware for  image and video processing systems.  The performance of a scalable implementation  improves as more processors are allocated to the task, until the number of  processors reaches upper limit.  Scalable hardware can expand to a variable  number of processors, whereas scalable software adapts to the processors that are  available.  Scalable software is available on desktop computers, and scalable  hardware is commonly used in high-performance computing.  The education program  trains undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art design methods and  technologies.  As part of this training, the investigator is introducing new  courses in communication system design, image and video processing, and embedded  software systems.  By forging research partnerships with industry, the  investigator is developing new stude nt design projects to solve system design  bottlenecks in industry.",
