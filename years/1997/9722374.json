 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9722376  Beeson          This is a career award to determine the association between the  kinetics of early T cell activation and the biochemical and  functional response of T cells. During an immune response  antigenic peptides bound to proteins of the major  histocompatibility complex(MHC), bind to T cell receptors.  The  studies outlined in this award will correlate the structural  features of the reactions between peptide-MHC complexes and  specific T cell receptors with the biochemical reactions involved  in an immune response.  Computer models of peptide-MHC complexes  will be used to design altered peptides predicted to slightly  enhance or disrupt T-cell receptor binding.  This will be  accomplished by substitutions of amino acid residues with side  chains that interact with a TCR.  Such altered peptides are known  to block or modify normal immune responses.  The kinetics of the  reactions between these altered peptide-MHC ligands and T  cell receptors will be studied.  Changes in  intracellular  calcium, redox potential and cytokine release will be used to  relate the molecular events at the cell-cell interface with the  biochemical pathways responsible for the immune response.  For  the teaching component the investigator will incorporate  biological topics into the curriculum of an organic chemistry  course.  Moreover his graduate and undergraduate students will be  doing research that involves chemistry, biochemistry and  immunology.  %%%    The studies outlined here will further our understanding of the  immune response, by examining in detail the molecular reactions  between the antigen and the T cell receptor and the biochemical  reactions which follow.      ***",
