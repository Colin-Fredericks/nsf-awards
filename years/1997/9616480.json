 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616480  Hughes  This project, which involves the transfer of collections of invertebrate paleontological specimens from the University of Cincinnati (UC) to Cincinnati Museum Center (CMC), is the essential first phase of a program of the CMC that integrates research, collections, exhibits, and education, and is popularly known as \"Mission Ordovician\". This program capitalizes on Cincinnati's unique fossil heritage as a tool for introducing the public to \"Cincinnatian\" environments of 450 million years ago, when the rocks upon which the city is built were mud on a sea floor. Transfer of UC collections to CMC will have impact in two major ways: 1) the finest specimens that are transferred will form part of the new Ordovician Hall at CMC, which is currently in the planning phase; 2) the UC collection will be properly curated, which will facilitate specimen-based research on the ancient life and environments of Cincinnati. This research is important because it has direct relevance to humankind's understanding organismic and community responses to global change, and secondly because CMC will involve the strong community of local amateurs as \"para-paleontologists\" in several aspects of this research. Doing this will give the public a chance to become directly involved in a real research program in their own backyard. Educational programs associated with the exhibit will reach out to other sectors of the community-particularly children, who will have the thrill of cracking open a rock, finding a fossil, and knowing that the last animal to look at it was a trilobite, alive 450 million years ago. This project is being accomplished as a partnership between the CMC (providing 55%) and the NSF (providing 45% of the funding by way of this award).",
