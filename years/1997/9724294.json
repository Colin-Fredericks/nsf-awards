Because CXD functions by collecting the  diffraction pattern from the entire field of view at the sample,  it can be used to reconstruct an image somewhat in the same way  that a hologram does.  The scientific potential of the technique  is enormous, not only because it is sensitive to the specific  arrangement of the microstructure, but also because structural  fluctuations in the time domain can be observed using photon  correlation spectroscopy.  The project  brings together eight  faculty members from the departments of Physics, Materials  Science and Engineering, and Chemistry at UIUC.  The  instrumentation will support research in a variety of material  systems, including thermal fluctuations and faceting of surfaces,  electrochemical interfaces, and materials containing defect  structures.  %%%  The novel CXF technique depends on the use of high brightness,  third generation hard x-ray synchrotron sources to be successful.  There are only three such sources in the world: the APS at  Argonne National Laboratory, the ESRF in Grenoble, and Spring8 in  Osaka.  This synchrotron beamline affords the potential for many  new insights into the dynamics of structural changes of a wide  class of materials which are not possible by other techniques.  This project is co-supported by the Major Research  Instrumentation program and the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities.  ***",
