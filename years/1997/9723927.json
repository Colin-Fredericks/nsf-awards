The simple goal of the project is to  gather rainfall data on the ground from multiple sites  throughout the Pacific island nations and territories.  This  unique data is made available to meteorologists and other  interested parties over the Worlwide Web and through  standard databases.  It has been used in several major  studies of global climate including NASA WETNET's  Precipitation Intercomparison Programs I and II.  Nearly all  the data is collected by students in all levels of education  across the Pacific. The program started with 25  participating schools and has grown to 145 schools at the  present time representing approximately 30% of the total  number of Pacific Island sites now reporting daily rainfall.  Therefore, this project is much more than a data-gathering  exercise.  It is a major pan-Pacific educational endeavor  which gives students across the Pacific an opportunity to  participate in scientific research.",
