 "awd_abstract_narration": "If  \"to  err  is  human,\" then understanding the origin,  nature,  detection,  and correction of errors should be an important  goal  for  those  engaged  in the study of human-computer  interaction.  There  are  many  ways in which we may err; the current  proposal  tackles one of the most modest, least studied, but most pervasive  types  of  human errors: errors in performing simple,  rule-based  tasks. Rule-based tasks include tasks such as getting money  from  an ATM, programming a VCR to record a show, or using a browser to  surf the web. Such tasks involve following a limited set of rules  (i.e.,  well described procedures) to achieve limited,  but  well  defined goals. They do not involve problem solving or creativity.  Though  seemingly  modest in terms of their  demands  upon  human  cognition, the prevalence of errors in such tasks seems  constant  and  high  even with experienced users. The increasing number  of  such  tasks  at home (e.g., programmable voice-mail, thermostats,  and bike odometers) and work (e.g., flight management computer on  advanced  commercial  aircraft, routine use  of  spreadsheets  or  databases,   and   email  systems)  suggests  that   an   indepth  understanding  of  errors  in  these  tasks  could  significantly  improve  the  design  of  many simple but  important  interactive  tools.",
