 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses combinatorial and algorithmic  problems related to searching and matching of strings and  slightly more complicated structures such as regular  expressions, arrays, trees and compounds thereof.  These  problems arise in a vast variety of applications, and their  impact is widely perceived as more and more crucial in  future information infrastructures, as unprecedented volumes  of information are increasingly amassed, disseminated and  shared.  A list would include the design of structures for  the efficient management of large repositories of strings,  arrays and special types of graphs, fundamental primitives  such as the various variants of exact and approximate  searching, specific applications such as the identification  of periodicities and other regularities, efficient  implementations of ancillary functions such as compression  and encoding of elementary discrete objects, etc.  The main  objective of this project is to abstract and clearly  identify these problems, develop new techniques and  efficient algorithms to solve them, both by serial and  parallel/distributed computation, and implement the new  algorithms.  This research represents a joint effort by two  teams having bases at Polytechnic University and Purdue  University, respectively.  These teams have marked  commonalities in backgrounds and complementary expertise in  highly specialized subareas of the field.",
