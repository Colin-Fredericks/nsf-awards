It also provides a short analysis  section  which  highlights information in the preprint listings which  is  judged  to  be  particularly  important.  Other  current  information  on  technological  advances,  meetings,  requests  for  proposals  is  provided.  The service is subscribed to by about 2500 researchers  by   mail  or e-mail, and an additional 4000 visits are made  per  month to the Web site that the Information Center also supports.  %%%  This  Information  Center  on  High  Tc  Superconductivity  helps  researchers  worldwide  in the active area  of  high  temperature  superconductors keep abreast of the latest research results.  The  newsletter and Web site which are supported make the progress  of  research  in  the area of superconductivity more rapid  and  less  expensive,  by helping researchers avoid duplication of  efforts,  and  keeping them up to date on the latest developments in  their  field of research.  ***",
