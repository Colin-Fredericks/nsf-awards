 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wu    Abstract      Professor Wu shall continue her study of removable sets and   nonremovable sets for quasiconformal mappings.  She intends to   construct nonremovable sets which are simple in nature and can be   described without using mappings.  Such sets are known to exist   in the plane, the problem here is for higher dimensional space.    She also intends to study whether the lifting of sets from the   plane into the space will destroy the nonremovability.  Also   Professor Wu shall continue her work on null sets of dyadic   doubling measures: how easily a null set may be changed into a   non-null set under the multiplication by a positive number.  This   problem has a close connection with a question of P. Erdos on   universal sets.  Furthermore, Professor Wu shall continue to   investigate the growth of subharmonic functions in half space and   its influence on the size of the asymptotic sets on the boundary.    Professor Wu is working in the area of potential theory and   geometric function theory.  More specifically, she studies the   growths of the solutions of certain differential equations, the   geometry of the region where the equations are defined, and their   relations.  One of the equations under study is Laplace's   equation, which has a very important place in the study of   thermal conductivity, electrostatic potential and fluid dynamics.    Moreover, this equation is the root of a whole family of   differential equations, called elliptic equations.  Elliptic   equations are interesting to mathematicians due to their origins   in physics.",
