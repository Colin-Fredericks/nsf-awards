 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Research Planning Grant to study the long-term and cumulative effects of exposure to crowding on children's social and cognitive development. A considerable body of research has demonstrated the negative consequences of crowding in the home, in school, and in child care settings.  These effects often carry over from one setting (e.g., the home) to another setting (e.g., school). However, longitudinal studies have not been done to understand the effects of children's exposure to crowding in multiple settings over varying periods of time. This study will include three variables related to crowding: residential density, school density, and the amount of time (both over a 24-hour period and number of years) spent in high density settings. New York City public schools will be the site for this project. Children from low density and high density homes who attend crowded and uncrowded schools will be included. Children will be followed for a period of four to five years, and will be assessed on a number of behavioral and cognitive outcome measures. During the planning period, data collection instruments will be refined and a Parenting Booklet will be prepared. This research will contribute to the body of knowledge about how crowding affects human behavior and development, and may help to identify interventions that promote healthy social and cognitive development.",
