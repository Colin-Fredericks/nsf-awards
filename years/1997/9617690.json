 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617690  Ward         Nitrifying bacteria play an essential role in the nitrogen  cycle of aquatic and terrestrial environments. Environmental  variables such as oxygen concentration and light intensity, which  control nitrification, therefore ultimately influence the chemical  nature and amount of nitrogen available. The rate and distribution  of nitrification in water and sediments can be related to and  predicted from these variables using reaction/diffusion models.  However, the mechanisms by which the influence of environmental  variables is translated into biogeochemical reaction rates depends  on the response of individual bacteria to physiological stimuli.  Advances continue to be made in sensitivity and precision in  isotopic methods used to measure transformation rates in the  nitrogen cycle. In parallel, recent advances in molecular ecology  make it possible to detect and partially characterize the genetic  diversity of naturally occurring nitrifying bacterial assemblages.  Dr. Ward will investigate the composition and activity of  nitrifying bacterial assemblages in two aquatic environments which  differ in the degree and scale of environmental variability: a  pelagic oceanic realm and an intertidal sediment ecosystem. Species  and group-specific PCR amplification, followed by DGGE screening  and sequencing of amplified ribosomal and functional gene  (ammonia-mono-oxygenase, AMO) DNA fragments will be used to 1)  describe qualitatively the composition and activity distributions  of nitrifying bacteria in different environments; 2) determine the  physical and temporal scales over which species composition and AMO  activity vary in relation to environmental variables such as depth  (with light and oxygen as important co-variables) and nutrient  distributions; 3) investigate the relationship between species  composition, AMO expression and nitrification rates. These two  environments represent important ones for nitrogen transformations  and include a wide range of environmental  variability, so that the  relationships among species diversity, habitat characteristics and  biogeochemical transformation rates can be elucidated.",
