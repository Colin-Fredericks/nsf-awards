 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ren  9703727    Martensite transformations are phase transformations that produce a change   of shape and a change of crystal symmetry. Shape-memory materials are  materials that are extremely malleable in the martensite phase below a  transformation temperature, but that return to a `remembered' original  shape when heated above the transformation temperature.   Coherent phase transitions of crystalline solids lead to mixtures of  distinct phases or phase variants with characteristic fine-scale  structures. The main issues addressed in this project are the characteristic  scales, the generation and the propagation of the   microstructures. A nonlocal theory involving integro-differential  evolutionary equations is proposed to answer these questions.  This theory lies between the traditional microscopic quantum theory which   uses Schodinger's equation and the macroscopic elasticity theory which uses  elliptic and hyperbolic partial differential equations. In the study of  the  characteristic scales, a periodic solution of a stationary nonlocal equation  is needed. But the  equation seems to have multiple solutions. The `right'  periodic solution should be selected by a suitable least energy  principle. Another intriguing question is to find a `generalized' traveling  wave solution of a dynamic nonlocal equation, which describes the propagation  of microstructures. This solution should have an oscillatory structure  at one end, constant value at the other end, and as time increases the  uniform-to-oscillatory transition region should advance in a periodic  manner. Such a solution can also be viewed as a heteroclinic orbit in an  infinitely dimensional function space connecting a periodic stationary  solution to a constant stationary solution.       Materials and processing are critical to the success of industries such as the  aerospace, automotive, biomaterials, chemical, electronics, energy, metals,  and telecommunications industries. This project is concerned with shape memory  materials and  martensite transformations. The mathematical theory in this  project is aimed at understanding the characteristic scales, the generation  and the propagation of the microstructures during shape memory materials'  phase transformations. The study of stationary periodic solutions ald  uniform-to-oscillatory waves of the integro-differential evolutionary equations  used in this nonlocal mathematical theory is at the cutting edge of  mathematical analysis and computation.",
