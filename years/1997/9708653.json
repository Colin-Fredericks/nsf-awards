 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708653 Stickney  This project, supported by the DMR Electronic Materials and CHE Analytical and Surface Chemistry programs, addresses electrochemical atomic layer epitaxy(ECALE) of semiconductor films, as well as the inverse process of electrochemical digital etching, removal of material a monolayer at a time through control of electrochemical potential. The approach employs UHV surface analysis techniques to identify and investigate surface limited reactions. The structure and composition of surfaces resulting from electrochemical surface limited processes will be investigated as a function of relevant conditions such as the potential and solution composition. One of the important thrusts of the research is to follow the evolution of defects, atomic layer by atomic layer.  %%% This project represents innovative, forefront research in a unique topical area of materials science having high potential for technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of electrochemistry and to the control of new deposition and etching processes with advantages of reduced temperature operation, and processing of electronic/photonic materials at reduced costs. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
