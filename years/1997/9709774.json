 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most frequent source of data used to understand the  nature of both normal and disordered language development is  children s productions. The properties of child utterances  that deviate from adult forms are of particular interest,  since they appear to reflect parts of the adult system that  the child has not yet mastered. One of the most common types  of deviation from adult forms seen in normally developing  children between the ages of 24 and 30 months, as well as in  older children with language disorders, is omissions,  including omissions of mono-syllabic grammatical morphemes  (e.g.,  the ) and unstressed mono-morphemic syllables (e.g.,  the first syllable of  giraffe ).   Data from numerous  researchers suggest that such omitted syllables are not  simply missing from children s representations of language.  The proposed research continues in this framework, but  begins to move beyond the question of whether normally  developing children have some representation of syllables  they omit to a question of why they omit these syllables. In  keeping with this expanded focus, the proposal begins to  draw more heavily on studies of adult language production as  a framework for understanding child production.           The proposed experiments are divided into three sets.  Exps. 1-4 are based on observations of the role of prosody  (i.e., rhythm and intonation) in children s omissions, along  with an observed bias for children to produce final  syllables. The goal of these experiments is to compare two  prosodic accounts of children s omissions, one proposed  previously and a new account derived from current linguistic  theories of prosody as well as studies of adult language  production. If the new account is supported, it would  provide a unified account of English-speaking children s  weak syllable omissions and a framework for viewing the  relation of immature and mature language systems.  Exps. 5-8  are based on the observation that children are more likely  to omit weak sylla bles from sentences containing an  unfamiliar word. These experiments promise to shed light on   how utterance complexity affects child productions and how  prosody fits within the larger language production system.  Two of the experiments in this section also use work on  adult language production to make predictions about child  production. Exps. 9-10 are based on a pilot study that  suggests children maintain a slot for weak syllables that  they appear to omit. These experiments have the potential to  confirm the notion that children have some representation of  elements that they do not produce in an adult-like way. They  also have the potential to relate child omissions to studies  of adult production.             Taken together, the experiments will reveal  considerable information about normally developing  children s growing knowledge of language and how this  knowledge is implemented by their changing language  production system.",
