 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: SciTeKS (Science Technology: Knowledge and Skills) is an interdisciplinary (biology, chemistry, earth science), modular, technology education curriculum for students in grades 11 and 12. The goal of the curriculum is to introduce high school students to standards-based science technology in an industrial, problem-based format. Each ofthe 14, 5-week modules is designed to create a \"virtual workplace\" for students, through laboratory experiences, computer-based multimedia, and video. While working through each module, students apply science knowledge, and practice problem-solving and laboratory skills in an industrial, \"real world\" context. Student proficiency in skills and knowledge is assessed throughout the program with a variety of methods: performance assessment using multimedia industry-related simulations, labs, and presentations; journal analysis; self-assessment of progress; and teacher-generated assessments.  Modules are developed by a writing team who work in close collaboration with technology education teachers and industry members. Module components (video, computer-based multimedia, and print) are reviewed at key points in their development, by project advisors, members of industry, teachers, and students. After review and revision, modules are field tested with teachers in a variety of high school settings (tech prep programs, general technology education programs, and traditional science classes) across the country. Results from the field test are used to revise modules in preparation for dissemination by a commercial publisher.",
