 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this application is to acquire a  phosphorimager with chemifluorescence capabilities for the use of  seven major users and several secondary users. The University of  Tennessee, Memphis is committed toward the acquisition of this  instrument. However, because the desired system is expensive, the  University cannot provide total funding for the equipment.  Therefore, the request to the NSF represents 67.66% of the costs  that we will incur; the University of Tennessee, Memphis will  provide the remainder 32.33% of the costs for the system.              A number of investigators in the Departments of  Pharmacology, Physiology & Biophysics, and Biochemistry at our  Institution are employing a variety of molecular biological  techniques for the performance of their research. These techniques  range from detection of phosphorylated proteins to Northern,  Southern, and Western analyses, as well as in-situ hybridization.  Presently, a number of the users in this proposal use  autoradiography for detection of radioisotopes in their  phosphorylation, Northern, Southern, and DNA sequencing protocols.  For Western analyses the investigators rely heavily upon the  chemiluminescence detection assay which also requires the use of X-  ray film. Although these procedures involving use of X-ray film are  adequate for detection, the low linear range of the film severely,  limits quantification of the differences that one observes. The  problem of quantifying data from X-ray film exposed to  radioisotopes or chemiluminescence is further compounded by the  fact that the film has to be subjected to densitometric analyses.  Thus, depending upon the quality of the image on the X-ray film and  the capabilities of the densitometer, in the final analyses, the  data may at best be semi-quantitative.              The StormTM system that we have requested has the  capability of detecting radioisotopes as well as chemifluorescence  signals. The system uses the phosphor storage technology and  provide s a larger linear range as compared to the X-ray film. In  addition, the system provides direct quantification of signals and  therefore, the need for a separate densitometer is circumvented.  These features coupled with the versatility of the Imagequant  software which permits the quantification of irregular shapes (e.g.  ellipses) as would be seen in phospho-peptide mapping provides a  rapid, exquisitely sensitive, and quantitative method for analyses  of radioisotopes and chemifluoresence.              One of the added advantages of the StormTM system that we  envisage is that because of its ability to detect  chemifluorescence, several investigators will be able to switch to  non-radioactive detection methods for their protocols. This would  be highly desirable since some of our experimental protocols, by  decreasing the generation of hazardous radioactive waste, will  become more environment-friendly. Moreover, the direct fluorescence  capabilities of the StormTM system will also allow us to switch  over to certain procedures not involving mutagenic, hazardous  chemicals such as ethidium bromide to detect DNA.              The availability of the StormTM instrument will not only  expedite the progress of the research of several investigators as  elaborated upon in the proposal but also facilitate the  interpretation of their data. Preliminary data are provided to  demonstrate the sensitivity of the system that is proposed over  conventional X-ray film technology. In addition to using the  StormTM system for research, we also intend to use the equipment  for educational purposes involving graduate students, postdoctoral  fellows and high school as well as college students from the Mid-  South area who participate in a variety of programs at our  Institution.",
