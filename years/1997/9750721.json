 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem to be remedied by this project is a deficiency in the curriculum with regard to nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  The objectives of the project are twofold.  First, the pedagogical method of instruction at the introductory level is improved for spectral characterization by NMR spectroscopy.  Second, at both the advanced and introductory levels, the curriculum is updated by teaching students how to obtain and interpret 1990's FT-NMR 1D and 2D data in lieu of 1960's CU-NMR.  A gradualistic style of spectroscopic instruction for introductory organic chemistry is employed.  Gradualistic learning is defined as a series of small steps that build one upon the other until such time as sufficient skill has been developed to solve complex problems.  This method for teaching spectroscopy to large numbers of students depends on the use of autosampling instrumentation and has been under development in this department for several years.  Upper-level chemistry and biochemistry majors manually operate the NMR and perform experiments that address the theoretical aspects of FT-NMR spectroscopy.  The new NMR significantly improves the quality of the undergraduate research opportunities for students.  Since 1991, 50 percent of graduating majors have been women, over 40 of whom have gone on to graduate studies.  This project therefore affects a large number of women who may enter into the scientific professions.  In addition to the development of many new experiments that fit into the framework of the traditional chemistry laboratory curriculum, this project also brings to fruition the gradualistic method of instruction, which can have a significant impact within the local institution and may have an effect on teaching at the regional or national level.    *",
