 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research on development of supramolecular inorganic   complexes by Dr. Karen J. Brewer of the Chemistry Department, Virginia   Polytechnic University.  Transition metal systems containing extended   light-absorbing organic moieties will be synthesized and tested for their   ability to facilitate photoinitiated multielectron transfer.  The basic   molecular design will involve the coupling of two light absorbers to a   central, catalytically active metal center that will serve as the site of   collection of the electrons.  The light absorber systems will be   multimetallic and designed to have metal-based highest occupied molecular   orbitals that are localized on the periphery of the molecules, well   separated from the central site of localization of the lowest unoccupied   molecular orbital.  The remote metal centers will then function as   electron donors for the central electron collecting core.  Details of the   spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of these systems will be   determined and used to optimize the design.  Materials that convert light energy to chemical energy are necessary for   development of solar energy devices.  Storage and delivery of many   electrons under desired conditions is an important goal.  Many natural   processes such as the reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrogen fixation   require many electrons.  In this fundamental research project, some new   multi-metal compounds will be synthesized and tested for their efficiency   in absorbing light energy and in releasing many electrons for use in   chemical reactions.",
