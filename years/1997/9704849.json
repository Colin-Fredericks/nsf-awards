 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his research on several open problems in set-theoretic topology.  First, he will determine if some modifications of his recent solution (with P. Koszmider) of the well-known Arhangel'skii-Tall problem can be applied to other long-standing open problems concerning normality and paracompactness in locally nice spaces.  These problems include M.E. Rudin's question of whether or not every normal manifold must be collectionwise-Hausdorff, and S. Watson's question about the existence in ZFC of a perfectly normal locally compact non-paracompact space.  Second, two problems concerning closed mappings will be investigated, the first being the well-known open question about the preservation of the metalindelof property under closed or perfect maps, and the other a question about the existence of irreducible restrictions of closed mappings.  Finally, a set of other problems related to recent work of the principal investigator includes the question of the characterization of the Baire property in function spaces with the compact-open topology, of the existence of a completely regular connectification of metrizable spaces with no compact open sets, and problems about the behavior of the Lindelof property in product spaces.     Set-theory and general topology are fundamental mathematical disciplines which have common turn-of-the-century roots.  Set-theory provides a framework upon which all of mathematics can be based.  Objects of study in topology include familiar spaces such as the plane and ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space, and their subsets, as well as much more abstract spaces.  The pioneering set-theoretical work of  K. Goedel in the late 30's and P. Cohen in the 60's soon led to the realization that some long-standing topological questions could not be solved assuming only the standard axioms of set-theory.  The principal investigator's research lies substantially within the scope of this interesting interaction between the two fields, focusing especia lly on problems selected for their topological significance, but where knowledge of set-theory is likely to be useful in their solution.  The problems involve basic topological properties and constructions-normality, covering properties, product spaces, function spaces, etc.-which impact a large portion of the field of general topology, and have applications in other areas of mathematics as well.  The new techniques involved in the solution of these problems are likely to be applicable to a wide variety of other problems.",
