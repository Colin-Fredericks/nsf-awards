 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to set up a computer laboratory for use in the teaching of Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations courses.  For the past several years, members of the dynamics group have been involved in a complete updating of course offerings at the undergraduate level in these areas.  Recent advances in technology have profoundly changed the way these courses can and should be taught.  No longer is it necessary to spend the bulk of time in differential equations classes teaching cookbook methods of solution.  Rather, using technology, students can compute these solutions symbolically.  Then they can view solutions geometrically, they can see how phase planes change as parameters vary, and they can explore bifurcation phenomena.  Also, it is now possible in dynamics courses to introduce even first-year students to such contemporary topics in mathematics as chaotic behavior, Julia sets, factual data compression, and more.  The goal of this project is to provide the computational equipment so that students can benefit from these types of enriching activities.",
