The  co-organizers are Dr. Jo Ann Banks of Purdue University and  Dr. Akeo Kadota of the Tokyo Metropolitan University in  Japan.  This seminar has three objectives: 1) to explore the  diversity of questions in plant development and evolution  that can be addressed most effectively using ferns as model  systems; 2) to discuss the genetic, biochemical and  molecular tools that must be developed and implemented in  order to understand these questions at the cellular,  molecular and mechanistic level; and 3) to educate and  encourage ideas from graduate students and postdoctoral  researchers in the use of ferns as experimental systems in  studies of plant growth, development and evolution.  %%%  The primitive features of ferns have facilitated the study  of fundamental aspects of plant development, especially  those that are difficult or impossible to study in flowering  plants.  This seminar will bring together American and  Japanese researchers who work on the molecular biology and  genetics of fern development using different model species.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese scientists will  enable the U.S. scientists to advance their own work.  The  seminar will involve active participation by graduate  students and postdoctoral researchers, and the results of  the meeting will be widely disseminated via a World Wide Web  homepage.  ***",
