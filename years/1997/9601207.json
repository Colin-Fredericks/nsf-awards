 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dennis Epple and   Richard E. Romano  Carnegie Mellon University  SBR-9601207     This research will study public school policy from a theoretical perspective.  A computational model paralleling the theoretical model is developed and used to explore properties of the model and investigate policy predictions.  We compare outcomes in localities that have residency requirements (neighborhood schools) with outcomes where there is some degree of choice among public schools. Outcomes with costless choice among public schools will be contrasted to outcomes with costly exercise of public school choice (e.g. commuting costs). In practice, when school systems introducing choice programs, they often impose selection criteria for admission to various schools; the research will investigate how such \"controlled choice\" policies affect equilibrium outcomes. These neighborhood school and choice alternatives will be considered in environments with centralized school finance and with decentralized finance.  We analyze settings with only public schools, then when there are both public and private school alternatives. The research characterizes the factors that determinate expenditures in all schools in all variations of the model. Public school expenditures will be determined by majority rule, exploiting our earlier work on voting over public provision when there are private alternatives.  The model developed in this research has the following features. Students are characterized by an ability level and household income. A student's educational achievement is increasing in own ability, educational expenditure per student, and in the abilities of the student's classmates (a peer-group effect). The demand for educational achievement is increasing in the student's household income.     The final part of the project will enhance the characterization of school quality to include faculty-student ratios and a hierarchy of faculty skills. The educational achievement function will be broadened to allow average faculty qu ality and faculty-student ratios to affect achievement. The utility function of faculty will depend on income, student quality, quality of faculty peers, and, possibility, the faculty/student ratio. This model will serve to permit analysis also of college and university education.     We will investigate how alternative policies affect the achievement of students of varying ability and income levels, the distribution of students by ability and income across schools, the welfare of students, school taxes and expenditures, private school financial aid policies, the distribution of faculty by ability across schools, and determination of faculty salaries in all schools.",
