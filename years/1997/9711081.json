The principal investigator is Georges Belfort.  The grant is to be used for travel  Support to the 1997 Gordon Conference on Membranes:    Materials and Processes.  This Gordon Conference will address the theme of membrane science and technology.    The conference is very pertinent to emerging areas of separations technology.  Membranes are very  important in chemical and biochemical separations and advances in membrane technology are expected  to lead to processes that will replace conventional chemical separation processes, e.g. distillation.  The interdisciplinary nature of the conference will allow cross-fertilization of ideas.  For example, the notion of using biomimetic principles for membrane design is an area that biochemists and chemical engineers can fruitfully collaborate in.  The conference will bring together academic and industrial participants, engineers and physical scientists, and a mix of mature researchers and new researchers including students.  The focus on discussions, an integral part of the Gordon Conference format will aid information dissemination and enhance the educational component of the conference.",
