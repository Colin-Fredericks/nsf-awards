 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  96-61122    Barrall    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will magnetic resonance (MR) viscometry and develop specifications for a commercial MR viscometer.  Many manufacturing and processing technologies depend on the flow or rheological properties of fluids, suspensions, slurries, or melts.  For example, the steady-state shear-dependent viscosity of thermopolymers is often indicative of key properties such as molecular weight and molecular weight distribution.  Viscometric measurement of molecular weight distribution requires measuring shear viscosity over two or three decades in shear rate with at least five points per decade.  Current in-line and on-line viscometers are not capable of making the required measurements quickly enough to allow real-time process control.  The MR viscometer will measure shear viscosity over two decades in shear rate within one minute (about 30 times faster than the present state of the art).  It will be noninvasive, capable of investigating particulate-filled systems (which can clog present viscometers), and amenable to large flow streams.  The MR viscometer will further be capable of simultaneously measuring other important properties such as diffusion coefficients, of which present viscometers are incapable.    A low-cost, in-line system to measure viscosity over several decades in shear rate will find wide application in industries that process melts, slurries, and emulsions.  Target markets include thermoplastics, resins, petroleum derivatives, heterogeneous food products, coal, paper, and waste disposal management.  ***",
