 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701027  Jones  Pacific salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) have a life-history pattern in which individuals hatch in cold, freshwater streams, migrate as juveniles (smolts) to the ocean to feed for a few years, and then return as adults to their natal stream to spawn and die.  During both smoltification (the physiological process preparing young salmon to leave freshwater for the ocean) and the return migration to the natal spawning grounds, salmon exhibit an increase in stress hormones in their blood plasma.  The latter increase has been implicated in the subsequent death of the adults shortly after spawning.  During periods of stress, all vertebrates secrete stress hormones.  After reduction of the stressor, stress hormone concentrations generally decrease, but after periods of prolonged stress these hormones can remain elevated.  Increased and prolonged secretion of stress hormones, and the actions of these hormones, can have degenerative effects on the body.  However, it is known that in mammals an increase in stress hormone levels can also facilitate the recall of long-term memory.  Before and/or during smoltification, young Pacific salmon imprint on the chemical make-up of their home-stream water.  this imprinted \"memory\" is vital in directing the adult salmon back to their natal stream bed several years later.  This study tests the hypothesis that the increase in plasma stress hormones during recall and homing aids the recognition of the home-stream water and that this increase in plasma cortisol primes the brain regions to recall the imprinted chemical composition of the salmon's home stream.  Using immunohistochemistry to determine the location of cortisol receptors in the brain, as well as electrophysiological recordings from olfactory brain regions, the research will test the involvement of cortisol in home-stream water imprinting and recall in Pacific salmon.  This project could have important implications not only for understanding the life-history of an endangered genus of salmonid fish,  but more broadly the general role of stress hormones in memory.",
