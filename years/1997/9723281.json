 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent enhancements in the resolution of primary data and the  complexity of algorithms have resulted in significant increases in the  computational load for the neuroimaging, `rain mapping and biomedical  imaging communities. In response to these increased demands, a group of  neuro- and biomedical scientists with common interests and  computational needs have come together to seek funding for a shared  graphics supercomputer. This group has a critical need for potent  visualization hardware, extremely fast, parallelizable CPU  architectures and considerable amounts of data storage and transfer  capabilities. This equipment is required to satisfy the demands  generated by three dimensional volume viewing, intricate surface  extraction, nonlinear warping and the volumetric blending of complex  polygonal objects with both raw data and the results of statistical  analysis. Housed at the Laboratory of Neuroimaging at UCLA, the device  will be available on a shared basis for interactive use locally and  batch processing remotely. After evaluation of several vendors of  graphics platforms, the equipment selected was an Onyx graphics  supercomputer manufactured by Silicon Graphics Inc. Simulations and  benchmarking confirmed the ability of this instrumentation to fulfill  the needs of the participants. An administrative plan was created to  manage the equipment equitably and to optimize its utility for the  participating research projects. The ongoing research in nine local and  four remote projects will directly and immediately benefit by using  existing software that is capable of taking advantage of the features  of the instrument. Programmers and other experts in this architecture  are already members of the staff. Technical and management personnel  are also among the funded group of participants. The existing  collaborations of the participants and the common algorithmic  requirements will enable sharing of computer code, analytic procedures  and computational strategies. The availability of suc h a machine will  enhance the productivity of ongoing funded research and foster the use  of leading edge technology for all participants.",
