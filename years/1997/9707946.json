It  is being jointly funded by the NSF      Division of Ocean Sciences, the  Division of Chemistry and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities.             The proposed research will improve our understanding of the  speciation and trophic transfer of selenium in San Francisco Bay.  Estuaries such as this, are complex physical, chemical and  biological environments that are not only geochemically crucial  (e.g. elemental transfer from the trash water to the marine  environment), but are also economically vital (e.g. fisheries,        transportation). The estuarine geochemistry of trace elements has  been well studied, but the      linkage between the chemical speciation  of these trace elements and their cycling throughout the whole  estuarine food web is largely unknown. The combination of  innovative field and lab studies proposed here will allow  researchers to more accurately predict the impact of Se input and        speciation on the entire trophic structure of these environments.  Moreover, the methods and approach used here for Se should be  applicable to other trace elements and other estuarine  environments.     Cuner, OCE-9707946; fisher OCE-9714308",
