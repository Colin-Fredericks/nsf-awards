 "awd_abstract_narration": "To answer the question of how children learn language as quickly as they do with such impoverished  input and no explicit instruction, one must assume that a great deal of what children come to demonstrate in  terms of their linguistic behavior is the product of grammatical knowledge they bring into this world with  them. This study seeks to explain the appearance and then disappearance of certain non-adult like phenomena of  child Spanish as a consequence of this in-born knowledge coming on-line. This study will  focus on what preliminary studies have shown to be three intriguing phenomena: the early lack of question  formation in child Spanish, the early lack of overt subjects in child Spanish as well as the lack of negative  imperative verbs in child Spanish. If language acquisition proceeds as quickly and uniformly as it appears to  because children are born with highly specified linguistic knowledge of the kind characterized by modern  syntactic theory, then the emergence of the elements that syntacticians have argued to be crucial to the three  constructions mentioned should have consequences for the development of these three constructions. Concretely,  certain grammatical elements (known as functional categories) and the relationships among them are argued to be  crucial for all three of the above constructions. Some of these elements appear to be active from the beginning  of child Spanish, but others may not develop until after the second birthday. Hence, investigating their  development should shed light on the way in which grammar develops in child language as well as the explanatory  value of the adult grammatical theories in question.          The method used to investigate these developmental consequences is a longitudinal study of three  monolingual Spanish-speaking children from the age of 1 year, 6 months until 2 years, 6 months. The subjects  will be taped and the tapes will be transcribed and grammatically coded, paying special attention to three  constructions in que stion. In this way it will be possible to amass a large amount of monolingual Spanish child  data and to study language development during what appears to be the most interesting and volatile period of  the development of child Spanish syntax. An important result of this study, in addition to its theoretical  ambitions, will be the construction of a rich, longitudinally-collected data base of monolingual child Spanish.  At present,  no such database is widely available. The resulting data base would be made available to the  CHILDES Data Base (MacWhinney and Snow, 1985), thus providing to researchers from many disciplines  (Linguistics, Sociology, Anthropology, and Developmental Psychology), an invaluable resource in an extremely  widely-spoken language that has been understudied. In the same way that data from the three children from the  Brown Corpus (Brown, 1968) have proven to be a virtual gold mine of insight into early child language  development, this study aims to furnish the international scientific community with a linguistic resource of  substantial value.",
