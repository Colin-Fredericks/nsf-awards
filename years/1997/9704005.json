 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704005  Fisher  This grant titled \"Disorder and Correlations in Low  Dimensions\" is to support the theoretical research of a  young and a well honored (Waterman award, among others) PI.  He is proposing work on a host of problems, all derived from  the effects one encounters in increasingly smaller devices.  More specific, the research includes work on: (1) transport  in quasi 1d systems, incorporating the novel correlations  known as the Luttinger liquid as well as the compounds that  exhibit \"high Tc superconductivity, (2) Quantum Hall  transport and tunneling in novel geometries, (3) electron  localization transitions in 1-d and 2-d using supersymmetry  and numerical methods and finally (4) non-equilibrium  transport in vortex lattices, driven through a random  pinning environment.  %%%  As the devices become smaller, the physical phenomena become  increasingly sensitive to the effect of coulomb interaction  and presence of defects (disorder).  This grant is to  support the work of a young, distinguished  PI, recipient of  the 1995 Waterman award among other honors.  He is proposing  research on phenomena which occur in small dimensions (thin  films, wires or dots) and also involve rather complex  mathematics.  The selected projects have applications in  cutting edge technology in  superconductivity and magnetism.  ***",
