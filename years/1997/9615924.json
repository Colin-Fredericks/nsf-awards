The program is intended specifically for students planning on careers in industrial research and development. A critical element of this program is the design of a curriculum which effectively prepares the students for careers in industry. The new Master's program will be designed to bridge the gap between the long term basic research of the traditional university Ph.D. program and the shorter term focus of research and development in industry. The planning grant aims at developing a consensus among industrial leaders and educators on strategies to best prepare students for the changing industrial environment. A workshop on materials industries needs in future hires and surveys of materials science and engineering programs and BS students in industry will help define approaches needed. These strategies will be articulated in a detailed proposal for consideration by the Division of Materials Research. This education grant is funded through the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Materials Research..\r\n%%% \r\nThis grant promotes novel opportunities for students to prepare for academic, industrial, government and non-traditional roles (such as communication, business, leadership, ethics, mentoring) and assists in integration of research and training with curricula.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
