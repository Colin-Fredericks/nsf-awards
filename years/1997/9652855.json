 "awd_abstract_narration": "The product of this project will be a Windows-based data acquisition and reduction system for general  chemistry laboratories that is based on inexpensive, generic hardware and standard software. The  DOS-based LIMSport system which it will succeed has been used for years in our laboratories with  success, and has been disseminated nationwide by means of seven, week-long NSF/UFE Summer  workshops. Most universities are now converting to Windows-based software. This necessitates a  revision of LIMSport, but it also offers an opportunity for substantial improvement. Our system is  unique in that it adds data acquisition capability to the most popular spreadsheets (Excel and Lotus), so  that students learn standard, transferable methods of data analysis in the laboratory, and teachers can  use the system as an authoring language to create their own experiments involving direct data  acquisition. We will prepare spreadsheet templates for a number of typical general chemistry  experiments which illustrate ways of using the powerful graphical and numerical methods built into  modern spreadsheets to reveal trends in real-time data as they are collected. An extensive evaluation  plan has been developed to determine which computer methods are most effective in promoting student  learning in the laboratory. A laboratory manual will be written for the new Windows/Excel version of  LIMSport which incorporates the results of our work as well as features suggested by the large body  of research on educational chemistry laboratories. The manual will provide background information for  about 30 experiments which are suitable for General Chemistry, using the capability of LIMSport to utilize small quantities of relatively innocuous chemicals.",
