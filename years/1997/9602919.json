Langdon of the  University of Southern California in Los Angeles and  Professor Minoru Nemoto of Kyushu University in Japan.  This  research investigates processing parameters and  microstructural characteristics that are associated with  ultrafine grained materials, including the influence of  microstructure and concurrent microstructural evolution on  the mechanical properties of materials at elevated  temperatures.  The research employs a new processing method  \"equal channel angular pressing (ECA)\" to create  nanocrystalline metal and magnesium alloys.  Past  experiments have established that metallic alloys with  ultrafine grain sizes in the nanometer range have the  potential for high ductilities and superplastic-like flow at  relatively low temperatures.  ECA provides a capability for  producing intense plastic straining that can refine the  metal alloy grain size into the nanometer range.  Aluminum  and aluminum-based alloys and copper and magnesium alloys  are selected for the study because this selection allows an  evaluation of the role of stacking fault energy and its  effects on dislocation networks and grain boundary  structure.    This collaboration will facilitate the extensive expertise  in mechanical testing of the Americans with the considerable  experience in microstructural analysis of the Japanese.  The  research could lead to a new processing technique for  deformation processing of nanocrystalline materials and  could impact future metal alloy processing in the metal  forming industries.  Through the exchange of ideas and  technology, this project will broaden our base of basic  knowledge and promote international understanding and  cooperation.  ***",
