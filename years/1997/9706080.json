 "awd_abstract_narration": "Consider the problem of establishing a temporary network in a region  hit by some natural disaster. Such a network would, for example, allow  medics in the field to retrieve patient history from hospital  databases, allow insurance companies to file claims from the field,  etc. Ideally, setting up such a network should involve no more than  equipping medics with PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) that have  radio capability and providing one or more ``gateways'' that connect  this ad hoc network with the outside world.    A fundamental problem in setting up such a network is routing packets  between nodes in the ad hoc network. Why is this a difficult problem?  The primary reason is that as nodes move about the network topology  changes and thus routes need to be constantly updated. Furthermore,  natural obstacles may have the effect of partitioning the network for  brief periods of time. Thus, packets enroute to a destination that no  longer lies in a partition may be dropped (even though the partition  is short-lived). Finally, an overreaching constraint on any solution  is the problem of very limited battery life at each mobile. Thus,  while a specific protocol may route packets optimally, it may cause an  inordinate amount of power drain causing mobiles to run out of power  quickly.    In this research, we will develop routing protocols that are  power-efficient (i.e., the battery life of mobiles is maximized) while  still providing near-optimal routing functionality. In addition, these  protocols will support Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees by performing  demand-based route discovery. Other protocol support for QoS, such as  loss profiles for dynamic adaptation to bandwidth changes, will also  be incorporated. Finally, the routing protocols will implement  cache-and-forward packet routing to deal with short-lived network  partitions.
