The ROSRINE project brings together a strongly-coordinated  group of geologists, geotechnical engineers and  seismologists from a number of organizations to address  geotechnical site characterization and ground response  issues resulting from the 1994 Northridge earthquake.  This  project is funded by the National Science Foundation, with  cost-sharing from the California Department of  Transportation (Caltrans), the Electric Power Research  Institute (EPRI), the Southern California Earthquake Center  (SCEC), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  The project  is performed in cooperation with the California Department  of Mines and Geology (CDMG).    Two critical elements of ROSRINE are (1) the data exchange  between the research teams, and (2) the data dissemination  to a large number of researchers and practicing engineers.  This is now to be achieved through the creation of an  Internet WWW site in order to exchange and disseminate  ROSRINE-generated data in an efficient and timely manner.",
