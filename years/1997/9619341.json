 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619341  Hutchinson    This 5-year Local Systemic Change project in Minneapolis proposes  to reach approximately 1600 grades K-8 teachers in 62 elementary  and 8 middle schools.  All teachers will receive a minimum of 100  hours of professional development in science and 300 leadership  teachers will be involved in 240 or more.  The professional  development is expected to provide all Minneapolis teachers with  the science content knowledge and instructional skills they will  need to implement the district's new inquiry- and standards-based  science curriculum for grades K-8.  Principals and school  administrators from the district's elementary and middle schools  will undertake professional development to enhance their leadership  skills in the alignment of science curriculum, instruction and  assessment in their schools.    An important goal of all the proposed project activities is to  change the belief systems that have perpetuated the public  perception that science is not for all children.  A coalition of  science professionals has been formed that includes Minneapolis  teacher leaders and district administrators, higher education  faculty, informal science educators, and representatives of local  corporations and community organizations.  A substantial effort is  underway in Minneapolis to recruit teachers who represent the  diverse groups represented in the schools' student population,  which is now 63 percent students of color.  Approximately 25  percent of the new teachers hired in the last five years are from  groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.  One  component of the Minneapolis Local Systemic Change project will be  to develop stronger linkages between the Minneapolis Public Schools  science program leadership and the state's higher education  institutions that train the majority of future Minneapolis  teachers, with the goal of moving preservice teacher training in  science closer to the MPS standards for science curriculum,  instruction and assessment.  The serv ices of the district's two  science centers that have traditionally provided hands-on science  instructional materials to elementary school teachers will be  expanded to include materials distribution to middle school  teachers and science professional development coordination for the  district.  Principals and science leadership teachers at the school  sites will determine the scope of services offered by the centers  as part of a \"buy-in\" plan to be implemented over the five-year  term of the project.  Teachers at 8-10 \"model schools\" will  experiment with various approaches to aligning the science  curriculum with best practices in instruction and assessment.    The request is for $5,034,214 with cost share estimated as  $3,454,449.",
