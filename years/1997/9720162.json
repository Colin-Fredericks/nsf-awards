 "awd_abstract_narration": "9720162  SPELL  This award provides funding to establish the Nevada Isotope  Geochronology Laboratory under the direction of Dr. Terry Spell  in the Department of Geoscience at the University of Nevada, Las   Vegas.  This facility will be able to process geological samples   from academic, industrial, and state and federal government  laboratories.  At present, researchers must wait for extended  periods of time to have samples processed at laboratories outside  of Nevada.  The laboratory will enhance research for scientists  investigating subject areas ranging from genesis of ore bearing  strata to dating of fossil materials.  In addition, the  specialized instrumentation capable of surface exposure dating of  very recent strata will be applicable to studies of climate  change, constraining erosion rates and volcanic hazards  assessment.  Support is provided primarily for equipment (a MAP  215-50 Rare Gas Mass Spectrometer and related instrumentation and  analytical equipment) and salary and benefits for a full-time  technician committed to running samples and maintaining the  instrumentation.    Establishment of a Geochronology Laboratory in Nevada will  provide important infrastructure of use in both basic and applied  research, facilitate the research of scientists from a breadth of  academic disciplines, and contribute to economic growth and  development in the state by serving industrial clients involved  in ore and petroleum exploration.",
