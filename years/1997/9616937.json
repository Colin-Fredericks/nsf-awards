 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to produce a book-length examination of the early agricultural context  of genetic research in the United States, and of the significance of that context for the  development of genetics as a discipline.  The aim is to produce both a study of U.S. genetics in  its first thirty years and a case study of the relationship between institutional context and  intellectual content.  More specifically, the study will document the prevalence of Mendelian  genetics in agricultural institutions, explain that involvement in terms of U.S. agricultural  policy and characteristics of those institutions, and examine the implications for genetics  research of the practical and theoretical emphases of agriculture.  The central purpose of the study is to demonstrate that U.S. genetics, in its early decades  was an agricultural discipline, and that during this period its successes and failures were  consequences of agricultural policy and science that also went on to shape policy and science.  When completed, this study will be the first disciplinary history of genetics focusing exclusively  on the early decades within the United States.",
