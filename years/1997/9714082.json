 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) is an  independent, nonprofit field station with  no institutional affiliation, which provides facilities for  researches who wish to study high-altitude  biology in a field setting.  Researches have come to the  RMBL for 69 years, and during that time  have patiently put up with inadequate housing and research  facilities.  Recent facilities grants from  NSF assisted with construction and renovation of several  buildings.  With this project RMBL will  provide necessary treatment of its water supply and proper  installation of telecommunications cables  to laboratories, offices and residences.    First, though RMBL's water has consistently tested as high  quality, new State Public Health  Department regulations require treatment of all water  sources classified as surface water sources.  A treatment system designed by a Water Treatment Engineer  needs to be installed.  Second, a rural  improvement grant for the local telecommunications company  provided service to RMBL in late 1995.  During summer 1996, RMBL staff laid unprotected surface  cables to a number of laboratory and  residence buildings, to facilitate immediate use for that  field season.  These surface cables need to be  encased in weatherproof protection, buried where necessary,  and the network completed according  to a master distribution plan.",
