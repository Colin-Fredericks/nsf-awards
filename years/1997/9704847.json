This project focuses on issues from three computational  areas in applied mathematics.    1.  The first set of problems concerns the analysis and computation of      eigensystems of stochastic matrices and associated Markov chain models.      Special attention is devoted to nearly uncoupled Markov chains. These are      large systems comprised of collections of loosely coupled subsystems, and      the purpose is to analyze and compute the stability and steady state nature      of such systems with aggregation/disaggregation (or A/D) algorithms.      Specific goals are to provide a more concrete foundation for analyzing (A/D)      errors through the use of ergodicity coefficients instead of tradition norm      based bounds; to provide a better understanding of the nature of errors in      multilevel A/D processes thereby facilitating improvements in the      development and performance of multilevel A/D algorithms; and to develop new      techniques for uncoupling the eigensystems for stochastic matrices.  2.  The second set of problems focuses on the development and analysis of direct      projection and implicit factorization algorithms used to solve large sparse      systems of linear algebraic equations encountered in the numerical solution      of partial and ordinary differential equations. Specific goals are to gain      an advantage when solving positive definite systems by means of      conjugate gradient-like methods on high-performance vector and parallel      computers by utilizing implicit factorization algorithms to construct      explicit approximate inverse preconditioners.  3.  The third set of problems stems from manufacturing applications involving      the necessity to describe or measure a manufactured item at various points      on its surface in order to build an accurate computer model so that the item      can be machined by automatic tooling devices. When these description s or      measurements are used in the manufacturing process, constraints are      automatically generated by computer codes to account for complex geometries,      to insure smoothness, and to account for material variability in the      surfaces being tooled. But these computer codes usually generate many      redundant constraints, and it is a significant problem is to distinguish      the necessary constraints from the redundant ones. This facet of the      project is dedicated to developing new numerical algorithms for making such      distinctions. The strategy is to improve on costly rank-revealing      techniques currently used to identify redundancies by developing new      sparsity-preserving, row-action algorithms for estimating      the smallest singular value/vector of a matrix.                        NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION. This project focuses on issues from three  computational areas in applied mathematics.    1.  The first set of problems concerns computations involving stochastic      matrices and associated Markov chains. The theory and application of Markov      chain models is a recurring theme in many problems from engineering,      economics, and physical and  social science. In particular, analyzing and      computing steady-state probabilities associated with large-scale Markov      chains is a fundamental concern in areas such as queueing models and      networks, telecommunications, computer performance evaluation, economic      modeling and forecasting, manufacturing systems modeling, and more      generally, in applications where discrete models are used to understand and      analyze the dynamics of large evolutionary systems. This project emphasizes      computational as well as theoretical issues, and special attention is      devoted to nearly uncoupled problems. These are large systems comprised of      collections of loosely coupled subsystems (e.g., the economy of the United      States), and the purpose is to analyze and compute the stability and      stea dy-state nature of such systems with techniques known as      aggregation/disaggregation. Specific goals are to sharpen and extend the      theory of errors in aggregation/disaggregation processes and to develop new      aggregation/disaggregation algorithms for estimating steady-state behavior      in nearly uncoupled systems.  2.  The second set of problems focuses on the development and analysis of      a new class of algorithms for solving systems of linear algebraic equations      arising in the numerical solution of partial and ordinary differential      equations of the type typically encountered in solving large-scale problems      in engineering and physical science. The algorithms under development are      aimed at high-performance multiprocessor computers  3.  The third set of problems stems from manufacturing applications involving      the necessity to describe or measure a manufactured item at various points      on its surface in order to build an accurate computer model so that the item      can be machined by automatic tooling devices. When these descriptions or      measurements are used in the manufacturing process, constraints are      automatically generated by computer codes to account for complex geometries,      to insure smoothness, and to account for material variability in the      surfaces being tooled. But these computer codes usually generate many redundant      constraints, and it is a significant problem is to distinguish the necessary      constraints from the redundant ones. This facet of the project is dedicated      to developing new numerical algorithms for making such distinctions.",
