A novel and particularly powerful  aspect of the instrumentation will be the development and usage  of a high power femtosecond UV laser system as an excitation  source for photoemission experiments of electronic materials.       The UV-laser system will provide:        (1) a photon flux orders of magnitude higher than is  achievable by other means, including the best wiggler or  undulator sources at a synchrotron.        (2) Very high energy resolution (1-10 meV), depending  upon the temporal length of the pulses.       (3) Greater ease in controlling the photon polarization  (linear, circular, etc.), which is very helpful for obtaining the  symmetry of the electronic states.       (4) Much greater bulk sensitivity because the electron mean  free paths get very long at low kinetic energies.  For studies of  the bulk electronic structure, this will overcome one of the  major difficulties of photoemission today, and open up the  technique to the study of many materials systems which have not  to date yielded high enough quality surfaces for reliable  photoemission experiments.       (5) Pump-Probe based photoemission which will enable us to            (a) Study the unoccupied levels near the Fermi energy.       This may replace inverse photoemission as the too of choice       for this purpose, as inverse photoemission suffers from poor       resolution (a few tenths of an eV), low count rates, and is       damaging to a sample surface.            (b) Study the dynamics of the system by varying the       delay between the pump and the probe beams.              The system will make use of the most advanced electron  spectroscopic and laser instrumentation.  To our knowledge, this  powerful combination does not currently exist anywhere in the  world.       The requested  instrumentation will also fill a hole in the  techniques available in the greater Boulder area, and will be  available to the local scientific community.  ***",
