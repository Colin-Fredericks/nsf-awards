 "awd_abstract_narration": "Founded in 1969, El Paso Community College (EPCC) serves a community characterized by a high minority population.  Located at the western tip of Texas and bordered by New Mexico and Mexico, the mission of the College is to provide educational opportunities for students who traditionally have not pursued higher learning in a postsecondary educational environment.   Unlike many community colleges that have been excluded from the research enterprise, EPCC supports the participation of faculty and students in summer research activities through bridge programs with the University of Texas at El Paso. One program is the NSF Alliance for Minority Participation Summer Bridge Program.   Faculty also actively participate in research activities on campus, engaging students in the study of the environment.  Research projects share a common environmental focus and include a study of environmental factors that affect the survival of viruses in groundwater, and microorganisms in the marine intertidal zone.  Other investigations conducted include systematic and biogeographic studies of the flora and the fauna in the Chihuahaun Desert, and the development of sensors for heavy metal contaminants in bodies of water. Because research was not considered in the original design of laboratory facilities at EPCC's Transmountain campus, other space has been used by students and faculty to conduct research.  Fixed equipment including fume hoods and an autoclave are in poor condition and must be shared with instructional activities.  This award will be used to consolidate the various spaces used for research into a state-of-the-art research facility.  In addition to improving utility systems, an autoclave, a fume hood, a cold room and fiber optics cabling will be installed. Although significant collaborations already exist among faculty, having a dedicated research area will initiate a chain reaction as more faculty and students experience the thrill of research.  The newly renovated laboratory will  expose students, specifically students of Hispanic origin,  to research, encouraging them to become critical thinkers,  and motivating them to pursue careers in science.",
