 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724171  Yu    This Conference entitled, \"Sphingolipids as Signaling  Modulators in the Nervous System\" will take place from July  13 - 17, 1997, at the New York University Las School, New  York City.  Historically, sphingolipids have been of  interest to neuroscientists and neurologists because of  their involvement in lipid storage diseases and other  disorders affecting the nervous system.  More recent  investigations have focused on questions of basic biological  functions, such as the physiological roles of these  molecules in neuronal differentiation, regeneration, and  trophic assisted cell survival.  Sphingolipid involvement in  such processes has been shown to include a number of signal  transduction mechanisms as well as protein modulatory  effects.  Sphingomyelinase, for example, when activated by  cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, converts  sphingomyelin to ceramide which then functions as an active  second messenger triggering such processes as proliferation  and apoptotic cell death.  Sphingosine, sphingosine  phosphate and ceramide phosphate are also recognized as  intracellular messengers exerting a variety of effects on  cell proliferation and differentiation.  Gangliosides as a  class of sphingolipids are well recognized neurotrophic  factors which function as neuroprotective agents in a  variety of in vitro and in vivo systems.  Numerous studies  have indicated their role as modulatory agents to a variety  of membrane enzymes, receptors, ion channels and adhesion  factors.  They are now being actively studied as potential  pharmaceutical agents for treatment of specific neurological  disorders including Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury  and stroke.  Presentations from basic scientists on the  biochemical/cell biological aspects of gangliosides and  other sphingolipids will focus on possible mechanisms to  account for the trophic, neuroprotective properties of these  substances.  The immunogenic potential of gangliosides and  sulfated glycosphingolipids in promoti ng neurological  dysfunction will be explored, a key question being whether  or not this invalidates use of these substances as  therapeutic agents.  As in  past sphingolipid meetings, we  anticipate stimulating interchanges between research  scientists and clinicians concerning basic mechanisms and  the biomedical potentials of sphingolipids.",
