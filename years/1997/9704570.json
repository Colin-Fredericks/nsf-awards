 "awd_abstract_narration": "Re: NSF DMS-9704570  Saddlepoint Approximations for Survival Analysis   Snehalata V. Huzurbazar  University of Wyoming      The primary goal of this research is to develop saddlepoint   approximations to survival and hazard functions used for   bio-medical data or alternatively, approximations to reliability  functions used for engineering data. Modelling of survival data  results in complicated waiting times whose exact distributions   are intractable but they can be approximated using saddlepoint  methods. The latter are based on `higher-order' asymptotic  methods and yield extremely accurate approximations for density  and distribution functions which can then be combined to give  approximate survival and hazard functions.  The methodology is  extremely computer-intensive due to the nature of the calculations.    Survival analysis is primarily concerned with the modelling of  waiting time distributions arising from various scenarios.  The  investigator studies models for linear as well as acyclic  progression of diseases, models for competing risks, models with  feedback for cyclic behaviour as well as frailty models for  populations which are heterogeneous. Due to the complexity of the   distributions that describe waiting time behaviour in these  situations, conventional methods are restricted to models which  mainly use the exponential distribution. Use of saddlepoint  methods removes this restriction, yielding much more flexibility  in modelling.      The above models are tremendously useful in studying the  progression of various diseases.  For example, progression of  the HIV virus is mainly from one stage to the next; but in some  cases, patients can skip stages and also get better before  getting worse.   Progression of diseases is also studied using  frailty models, that is, situations in which the whole population  does not have the same risk for a disease. For example, certain  subgroups are more susceptible to diabetes than other subgroups,  or subpopulations may have different ri sks due to exposure to  different environmental factors.  Again, modelling the  progression of a disease in the different subgroups can lead to  fairly complicated models which tax currently used methodology  but can be handled using saddlepoint methods.  Finally, the  methods obtained from this research are easily transferred  into reliability models used in engineering and manufacturing.",
