One  key function is the recognition of physical objects in a changing  environment.  Existing research shows that infants have  impressive abilities in this regard.  This project will  investigate the development of the cognitive mechanisms  underlying this skill.  The approach will draw upon recent  advances in understanding mechanisms of visual attention in  adults.  A series of experiments will explore how infant  attention picks out and \"holds onto\" physical objects under a  variety of circumstances.  The brain mechanisms underlying such  skills are crucial for learning about the world, for learning  verbal labels, and for developing numeracy.  The ability to  attend to physical objects requires that objects be distinguished  from one another.  One way this can be done is to recognize that  two objects have distinctive features.  Another way is simply to  note that the objects simultaneously occupy different locations  in space.  These simple solutions do not always work (a) because  objects can change the features they present (e.g., with a change  in viewpoint) and (b) because objects can move in and out of view  (e.g., by passing behind an occluder).  For organisms that live  in a complex, moving, three dimensional world, such complex  changes are the rule rather than the exception.  The problem that  this creates for infants as they track physical objects can be  likened to a radar operator who has to track \"objects\" on a radar  screen.  When two blips appear on different locations on the  screen, the operator can register the number and location of the  objects and track them continuously as they move across the  screen.  However, one of the blips might move off the edge of the  screen and after a short period another blip might appear.  Is  this the same object as the one that disappeared?  How many  objects should the operator report, two or t hree?  The infant  brain must regularly face a similar dilemma because of gaze  redirection, occlusions, and so forth.  Physical objects in the  world do not have transponders to identify themselves to the  infant brain!  Despite this, infants manage to identify and track  physical objects, learn verbal labels for them, and even to  enumerate small sets of objects.  This project will investigate  how infants first individuate, then re-identify physical objects  that from time to time pass behind occluders.  Experiments will  measure how infants allocate their visual attention to physical  objects based on both locational and featural information and on  the integration of the two kinds of information.  Experiments  will also determine what limit there may be on how many objects  infants can track at any one time.  The results of these studies  will reveal properties of early emerging, and thus basic, brain  functions that support learning and general cognitive  development.  Longer term, such investigations will bear upon  early brain and cognitive development and education issues as  well upon the design of artificial systems that can behave  intelligently in complex environments.  ***",
