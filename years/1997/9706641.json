 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706641    Pipher      This project is concerned with the applications of techniques  of harmonic analysis to various problems in linear elliptic  theory. It uses Littlewood-Paley theory to study boundary value  problems for second order divergence form equations, in   particular for equations with non-smooth coefficients and/or  whose matrix is not assumed to be real-valued or symmetric.  There are close connections to linear problems in non-smooth  domains. Thus, included in this project is the study of   higher order elliptic operators in domains with Lipschitz  boundary. In particular, it treats boundary problems with  data in Sobolev spaces or Hardy spaces.      There are many problems arising in various areas of mathematics,  physics, engineering, and manufacturing which reduce to being  able to approximate solutions of linear partial differential  equations in regions which have corners and edges. This  phenomenon, the presence of corners and edges, causes inherent  mathematical difficulties in obtaining good approximations.   In particular, it is important to be able to measure how small  the error will be in terms of the data (the known quantities).  This project is concerned with formulating the theory upon  which these numerical approximations and applications are   based.",
