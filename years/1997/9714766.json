 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714766  Moody    This is an equipment grant to the University of Virginia's Department of Environmental Sciences, an interdisciplinary program concerned with the interaction of processes that shape the natural environment, offers undergraduate and graduate curriculum with four core components:  atmospheric science, ecology, geology and hydrology.  The computational and atmospheric data ingest capacities will be upgraded and the department's facility for atmospheric data acquisition and display for use in environmental research projects will be enhanced.  The facility will also contribute to classroom instruction in addition to research applications and hands-on laboratory activities using real-time meteorological data.  While many universities already provide a distribution of real-time and archived weather information and forecasts via the internet, the goal is not to duplicate these kinds of community service efforts to make processed data available.  Rather, the goal is to make real-time and archived weather information and data display tools available to this interdisciplinary community of researchers who are focused on a wide range of issues in which knowledge of atmospheric conditions, past, present and future often plays a role.",
