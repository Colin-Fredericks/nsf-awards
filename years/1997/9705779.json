 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705779    King    There are three projects described in this proposal, all concerned  with the physics of interacting many-body systems. The first is  \"Spontaneous and stimulated emission of photons\"; the problem here  is to find a useful approximation for the time evolution  operator in the simplest interacting quantum field theory, namely  a two-state atom coupled to the quantized radiation field, and  to investigate stimulated photon emission in this model.  The second project is titled  \"Mutually avoiding self-avoiding random walks\"; the goal is to locate  the exact phase boundaries of a model of non-intersecting random  walks on the lattice and to determine the correlation functions in each  phase.  The third project is \"Scaling behavior of correlations in a critical model\",  where it is proposed to find the scaling and large deviation  properties of an order parameter in a model of non-intersecting  random loops on the two-dimensional torus.      The broad goal of this project is to elucidate the macroscopic  behavior of a large system which is composed of many small  components by drawing mathematical conclusions from its  microscopic formulation. At the microscopic level, physics  provides well-understood laws which allow a consistent  mathematical description. The challenge is to predict the  macroscopic consequences of these laws.  This project focuses on two areas: first, the interaction of photons  with an atom, where the macroscopic behavior is the emission and absorption  of light, and second, the spatial fluctuations of vortex lines in  superconductors, where the macroscopic behavior is the sudden  occurrence of long-range correlations. There are many areas in science and  technology where local rules may conspire to produce huge effects  (for example congestion in high-speed communications  networks). This project will use mathematical analysis to address questions  of this type in the realm of theoretical physics.",
