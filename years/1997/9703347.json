 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research pursues the design and analysis of multiuser optical  communication systems to increase the performance, distance, and capacity  of existing and future systems.  The focus is on  the physical layer -  i.e., the actual single fiber links that connect the nodes of large.  The  intense demand for more data, voice, and video in and out of every home and  office has led to multiuser systems that are typically broadband and high  power, sometimes leading to severe linear and nonlinear degradation in the  signal due to properties inherent to the fiber.  Mastering these physical  limitations can translate into a hundred to thousand fold increase in  capacity of existing infrastructure, with a potential savings of billions  of dollars.    The goal of this research project is to identify, characterize, and combat  signal degradation in fibers, and to use this information to design the  highest capacity multiuser systems.  While the physical properties of  fibers have been broadly measured and defined, the proper design of fiber  systems to optimize signal properties for communications has not been fully  considered.  A tool has been developed that provides a method of obtaining  an analytical closed-form solution of a nonlinear differential equation  describing the propagation of optical signals through silica fiber.  The  result is a Volterra model for the fiber which can be used to both quantify  the signal degradation due to the fiber and to design algorithms and  devices to combat this effect.  The model will be used to analyze the  performance of optical TDMA, CDMA, and WDMA networks including realistic  distortions such as intermodulation products, intersymbol interference, and  multiple user interference.  This same model will then be used to define  signal processing algorithms and corresponding nonlinear devices to combat  signal degradation.  The possibility of creating a communication system  that uses the soliton waveform in multiuser systems will be studied.  Solitons are hi ghly desirable in that they take advantage of the nonlinear  fiber effects to cancel pulse dispersion caused by linear effects. Finally,  effects such as nonlinear polarization on coherent light communication  systems will be analyzed using a modification of our Volterra model.    The education portion of this study includes three new courses for  improving the instruction of undergraduates and graduates in optical  communications and multiuser communication at the University of Virginia.  Two courses emphasize development of the optical communication system from  the ground up (without relying on the usual RF analog), followed by a third  course in multiuser communication, tied directly to this and related research.    The primary goal of an educational institution to prepare the new  generations for tomorrow can be accomplished only if the institution  responds to the needs of the current and future students.  One important  aspect of this goal is to respond to the increased interest of women in the  field of engineering.  Following her hypothesis that women are socialized  to find importance in issues of human and social concern, this researcher  will be active in modifying the current methods of teaching engineering to  show the link between technical methodology and the resulting products and  services. Students will be encouraged to work within well defined groups  that echo the work place environment.  Being a female in a field that is in  transition from being male dominated carries the responsibility of being a  role model.  Female engineering students will be especially encouraged to  participate in a mentoring program instituted to promote success, a sense  of belonging and strong self esteem.
