The PFR extends the length of the axoneme after it emerges from the flagellar pocket and is built up from   discrete filaments organized in lattice-like arrays.  The major protein components of the PFR do not reveal   significant homology to other cytoskeletal proteins.  This lack of homology together with the elaborate and   unusual structure of the PFR suggests a novel type of cytoskeletal filament and organization. Based on the   characterization of L. mexicana lines lacking the major PFR proteins, PFR-1 and PFR-2, a simple model   for the organization of the PFR is proposed that has a number of testable features.  First, PFR-1 protein is   an essential constituent of the proximal domain of the PFR and PFR-2 is absent from the proximal   domain.  Second, PFR-1 protein can assemble into filaments in the absence of PFR-2 either forming a   homopolymer or polymerizing with as yet unidentified partners. Third, PFR-2 protein is a primary   constituent of the distal domain of the PFR.  Fourth, assembly of the distal domain of the PFR requires   prior assembly of the proximal domain of the PFR whose assembly in turn is coordinated with assembly of   the axoneme.  This ordering of PFR assembly explains the observed inability of PFR-2 protein to assemble   into a stable structure in the absence of PFR-1, and it explains the presence of a properly positioned   structure that contains PFR-1 in the absence of PFR-2.  Furthermore, it accounts for the puzzling   observation that in dividing cells examined by immunofluorescence with anti-PFR antibodies, the   daughter flagellum often stains more weakly than the parental flagellum.  This would be expected if the   PFR was assembled stepwise from the proximal to the distal zone. Genetic and cytological experiments   are proposed t o test and extend this model of the organization of the PFR in Leishmania mexicana.  These   specific objectives will be accomplished: 1.  Ultrastructural characterization of PFR-1 and PFR-1/PFR-2   null mutants. The objective of this set of experiments is to determine whether or not substructures of the   PFR are retained in the mutant lines that lack PFR-1 2.  Determination of the location within the PFR of   the PFR-1 and PFR-2 proteins.  The objective of this set of experiments is to separately localize PFR-1 and   PFR-2 proteins by immunogold labeling of thin sections and whole mount cytoskeletons. 3.  Test of the   order of assembly of the domains of the PFR.  The objective of these experiments is to determine whether   the nascent daughter flagella of dividing L. mexicana assemble the proximal domain of the PFR prior to   the distal domain.    Among unicellular organisms there is an immense diversity of differences in physiology and structure that   reflects the vast experimentation in form and function that has occurred during evolution. The means by   which unicellular organisms move using flagella and cilia as basis has been elaborated and altered as   among diverse unicellular organisms. In this award Dr. LeBowitz will study the function and form of the   paraflagellar rod of Leishmania. Understanding how the paraflagellar rod is assembled will yield   important information on the diversity of motility mechanisms of unicellular organisms. Members of   Leishmania species include pathogens that are causitive agents of human disease. Potential applications of   this information includes finding compounds that impede the formation of paraflagellar rod preventing   motility and spread of the organisms.     ***",
