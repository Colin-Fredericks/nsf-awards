 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research at Undergraduate Institutions project, supported in  the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the  preparation and characterization of chiral nuclear magnetic  resonance shift reagents formed by coupling paramagnetic lanthanide  ions with chiral resolving agents.  Professor Thomas J. Wenzel and  his undergraduate students at Bates College will combine the  results from this work with known chromatographic retention data  for optical isomers so that the assignment of the absolute  configuration of enantiomers can be made from resolved nuclear  magnetic resonance spectra.  This work has application in the areas  of the pharmaceutical industry and in magnetic resonance imaging  reagents.  Methods that permit the direct determination of the configuration  of optical isomers will be developed by Professor Wenzel and his  undergraduate students at Bates College.  Reagents will be prepared  that interact with optical isomers in a way that leads to resolved  nuclear magnetic resonance spectra.  Knowing how these reagents  shift nuclear magnetic resonance spectra will permit the assignment  of configuration to the optical isomers.  This work has potential  for application in pharmaceutical chemistry and in the are of  magnetic resonance imaging.",
