 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad objective of this project is to gain a more thorough understanding of word recognition processes.  The investigator approaches this goal by investigating an often-ignored variable in language comprehension studies-namely, grammatical class membership.  Recent research examining neurologically damaged populations reveals notable dissociations in the processing of nouns and verbs.  Research by the investigator has extended the finding of a noun/verb contrast to an unimpaired population.  These data indicate a greater left hemispheric involvement in the processing of verbs relative to nouns.  The present proposal expands this study to investigate localization issues in the brain.  Four experiments will be conducted.  The first two represent experimental modifications, using different tasks and extending the investigation to the grammatical class categories of adjective and adverb.  The last two experiments introduce a new methodology to test the claim of grammatical class organization in the brain.  These experiments contrast the simultaneous and successive presentation of pairs of visually-presented stimuli to trace the origin of interference effects in comprehension across the lexical spectrum.  The time course of activation for noun and verb stimuli will be explored by delaying input of one relative to the other.  Investigations of grammatical category issues are critical to the refinement of psychologically and linguistically valid theories of word processing.  The research contributes to this discussion by examing the interrelationship of lexical representations and processes in the brain.  Its goal is to test recent claims made in the neuropsychological literature-namely, that there exist separate subsystems for the processing of nouns and verbs.  If noun and verb locations are distinct, it is feasible that behavioral effects can be uncovered.  The POWRE grant will provide the necessary funds for career advancement for the investigator.  She is a non-tenure track Assistant Professor, a position she has held for the past five years.  The grant will allow her to concentrate on her own research and delineate a long-term research program.  It will also allow her to pursue a new methodological approach to the study of language processing.  In turn, the pursuit of a new experimental technique and subsequent publication of the results could aid the investigator in obtaining a tenure-track position.",
