 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  EEC-9712750      Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) is presently employed as a structural material in surface micro-machined sensors and actuators.  The design and fabrication of micromechanical structures can often be constrained by the deposition conditions and properties of poly-Si, therefore, the development of an alternative structural material which relieves these constraints would have a significant impact on MEMS technology.  Polycrystalline silicon-germanium (poly-SiGe) can be conformally deposited and doped at much lower temperatures (less than 500 lm1 (C) than poly-Si, and is readily etched by conventional wet or dry processes.  Low tensile stress can be achieved in as-deposited poly-SiGe films without high-temperature annealing.  These properties make poly-SiGe a promising structural material for surface-micromachined structures, particularly in integrated microsystems.  Because SiGe has only been investigated as an electronic material, its mechanical properties are note yet well known.    A comprehensive study of the mechanical properties of low-pressure chemical vapor deposited (LPCVD) poly-SiGe films, will be conducted to assess their potential for MEMS application.  The effects of deposition, doping and annealing conditions on film microstructure and mechanical properties will be determined for films of various Ge contents.  Established methodologies for evaluating poly-Si films will be employed to characterize stress and stress-gradients in poly-SiGe films.  The electrical conductivity and etching behavior of these films will also be studied.  The development of an integrated SiGe MEMS technology is a goal of this work.",
