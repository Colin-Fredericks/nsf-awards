 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with electronic gun control of  smart materials and structures. Smart materials such as  piezoelectrics,  magnetostrictives, and electrostrictives  are finding increased use in modern design because of the  direct coupling they provide between mechanical energy and  electrical energy. Upon application of a stress to  piezoelectric material an electric field is generated in the  material, and when an electric field is applied to the  material it changes dimensions. This makes piezoelectric  materials ideal for use in compact electromechanical  actuators. The electric gun control is accomplished by  critically examining the materials, structural modeling, and  the system itself. This includes characterizing the electron-  material interactions that occur when the electrons from the  electron gun strike the piezoelectric material. Advances in  structural modeling and system design are possible since an  elimination of the need for static electrodes in smart  structures gives the system designer a lever of latitude in  structural design and control algorithm selection that has  not been seen before. Successful realization of the electron-  gun control concept leads to significant technological  advances and industry applications in a wide range of  disciplines ranging from noise suppression to medical  imaging.",
