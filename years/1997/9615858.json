 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a multidisciplinary project focused on modeling, simulation, and control of metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) thin films. The project team is composed of senior investigators from four universities (California Institute of Technology, New York University's Courant Institute, the University of Minnesota, and the Colorado School of Mines), working together with an industrial partner, Superconductor Technologies, Inc. (STI).    Superconducting thin film devices have enormous economic potential in several applications, for example as compact, high-performance microwave filters. However, to make this technology economically viable, a high-throughput, low-unit-cost superconducting thin film deposition process must be developed. One promising technique is metalorganic CVD.    The goal is to use mathematical tools and methods to enable virtual prototyping and control of a robust, high-throughput MOCVD process for manufacturing YBCO thin films suitable for microwave filter devices. The work will span several fields, and will include    *  fundamental investigations of epitaxial YBCO film growth    *  development of predictive models for MOCVD of YBCO based on fundamental principles,    *  simulation-driven design and construction of an advanced, prototype MOCVD reactor with integrated sensing and control    *  and development and experimental validation of model-based process  control strategies.    Funding for this activity will be provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, the NSF Engineering Directorate, and by DARPA.",
