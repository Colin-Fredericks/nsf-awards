 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9712200  Potter    This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project will investigate the intrinsic properties of a new phosphor material. There is a critical need for efficient low voltage phosphors for the continuing development of field emission displays (FED) to compete effectively with entrenched active matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCDs).  The proposer has recently developed a new low voltage blue cathodoluminescent phosphor as a thin film as well as a proprietary FED.  Elevated temperature, and therefore expensive substrates, are required to integrate this new phosphor into the display device.  To permit integration at lower temperature on less expensive substrates, such as glass or plastic, the new phosphor material will be synthesized utilizing ceramic techniques and then deposited using rf sputtering, which is a low temperature process.  Process parameters will be optimized for low voltage cathodoluminescent efficiency and maximum luminosity.  Detailed analysis of the new material will enable the incorporation of dopants that will provide spectral responses suitable for full color displays. Establishing viable processes to incorporate the phosphor into FEDs will lead to the Phase II objective of fabricating the proposer's FED in existing integrated circuit (IC) foundries.         A wide variety of display technologies including field emission, electroluminescent, vacuum fluorescent, and surface conduction electron emitter display products.  ***",
