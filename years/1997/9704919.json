 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the 1997 Industrial Mathematics Modeling Workshop for  Graduate Students (IMMW97), an applied scientist or mathematician  leads a team of approximately 6 graduate students in the solution  of an actual problem from industry. Thus, applied mathematics  graduate students are exposed both to the types of problems  arising in industry and to the team approach of problem solving.   This enriches their graduate educational experience, and can  provide valuable training in the event the students choose a  non-academic career. Boeing, Kodak, Michelin, and the NSA are  likely to be represented by the industrial problem presenters at  IMMW97.  We strongly believe that workshops, such as the one  proposed here, are one of the best ways to heighten students  interest in industrial mathematics, to improve students vision  about the type of mathematics and science that should be learned,  and to accelerate the cross-fertilization between the applied  sciences and mathematics.    This workshop is modeled after the successful workshops,  ``Industrial Mathematics Modeling Workshop for Graduate  Students,'' held the past two summers at North Carolina State  University.  Last year's workshop was organized by Professors  Tran, Reitich, and Scroggs. In addition, Prof. Reitich, in  cooperation with Lord Corporation, was one of the problem  presenters.  This workshop series started in the summers of  1993 and 1994 at the Claremont Graduate School. Both of these  workshops were organized by Professor Ellis Cumberbatch of the  Claremont Graduate School.    This GOALI project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
