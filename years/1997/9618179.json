 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618179  Seewald        Although it is known that much of the organic matter in the  marine  environment  is generated at high  temperature  and  that  organic  species play an important role in a variety of physical,  chemical,  and  biological processes in the seawater,  sediments,  and  vent  systems, virtually nothing is known  about  the  high-  temperature  and high-pressure stability or rates  of  production  and reaction of such organic compounds.  One reason for this lack  of  understanding  is  the  relative  inaccessibility  of  marine  hydrothermal systems to detailed organic chemical analysis in the  field.   In this study the principal investigator will get around  this  limitation by studying stability relationships  of  several  types  of  organic  compounds  (especially  aromatics)  and   the  reversibility  of  their  reactions in  a  laboratory  especially  designed   for   high-pressure,  high-temperature   work.     The  principal  investigator expects that these studies  will  greatly  increase   our   current  understanding  of  the  processes   and  conditions responsible for the occurrence of these substances  in  marine hydrothermal systems.  ***",
