 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9704621  Rogers    This grant funds a program of mathematical investigations of the alpha-beta  phase transition in quartz.  In unstressed quartz this transition occurs at  about 574 degrees Centigrade, at which point a quartz crystal undergoes a  change in shape, volume, and symmetry.  The high temperature beta-phase has  larger volume and higher symmetry than the low-temperature alpha-phase.  The alpha-beta transition can be accompanied by an interesting triangular  microstructure that  is quite different from the layered microstructures  that are usually found in shape memory alloys and ferromagnetic materials.  An interesting mathematical feature of the problem is that the  microstructure is describe by the oscillation of a scalar order parameter.  Order parameters have been used in many other studies of phase transitions,  but they are usually hard to measure and are defined in fairly fuzzy  physical terms.  On the other hand, the order parameter in quartz is well  defined physically and there are good techniques for measuring it.  Thus,  it provides an excellent test case for mathematical models using order  parameters.  The proposers plan to use techniques of differential equations, the  calculus of variations, scientific computation, and bifurcation theory to  study both standard  models for quartz and models that they will propose.    %%%    When a material undergoes a drastic change in its fundamental properties we  say it has undergone a \"phase transition.\"  The obvious examples are  freezing and melting, evaporation and condensation, but more subtle atomic  rearrangements are covered by the term as well.  Despite the technological  importance of such material changes, the mathematical theory describing  them is nowhere near as well developed as theory describing the motion,  deformation, and thermal properties of materials.  This grant funds a program of mathematical investigations of a phase  transition in quartz.  The transition is caused by changing temperature and  occurs at  about 574 degrees Centigrade. At this temperature, a quartz  crystal undergoes a change in shape, volume, and symmetry.   The transition  can be accompanied by an interesting microscopic triangular pattern that is  quite different from the layered patterns that are usually found in shape  memory alloys and ferromagnetic materials.  An understanding of these  microscopic patterns (called \"microstructures\") is widely believed to be a  key to the understanding of the phase transitions that they accompany.  There are a number of reasons for focusing on this particular phase  transition.  Quartz has a number of important industrial applications such  as oscillators and optical waveguides.  In addition, the transition in  quartz is usually described mathematically by a quantity called an \"order  parameter.\"  Order parameters have been used in many other types of phase  transitions, but they are usually hard to measure and are defined in fairly  fuzzy physical terms.  On the other hand, the order parameter in quartz is  well defined physically and there are good techniques for measuring it.  Thus, quartz provides an excellent test case for mathematical models using  order parameters.  ***",
