 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705366  Social Organization and Task Allocation in a Eusocial Mannal    The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) occupies a unique  place among social vertebrates because of its behavioral  similarities to cooperatively breeding birds and mammals on  the one hand and eusocial insects on the other.  Naked mole-  rats are playing a pivotal role in attempts to unite  occurrences of alloparental care in vertebrates  invertebrates under a single theoretical and terminological  umbrella, to understand the relative importance of extrinsic  (i.e, ecological), intrinsic (kinship), and historical  factors in the evolution of eusociality, and identify  proximate and ultimate sources of conflict and cooperation  in animal societies.    However, comparative behavioral and evolutionary analyses  are presently stalled by lack of information, or existence  of conflicting results, on key details of intra-colonial  social organization and task allocation.  The P.I. s  research will address this need by quantifying the behavior  of mole-rats in 5 captive colonies (n=126 animals,  presently) housed in transparent burrow systems.  Four  specific questions will investigated: (1) Is there a  specialized dispersive morph, or are putative dispersers  actually colony defenders instead?, (2) Are burrows  excavated primarily by large individuals or small  individuals, or do large and small individuals participate,  but in different aspects of burrow excavation?, (3)  Do  particular colony members seek environmental heat sources  and then transfer heat to nest mates (like living hot water  bottles), thereby improving the work efficiency of the  entire colony?, and (4) How accurate is the recently-  discovered foraging recruitment system: do scouts that find  new food sources lay polarized trails to them, and how  precisely do the communicate information about food  quantity, quality, distance, and divisibility to potential  recruits?    For each question, straightforward, non-invasive experiments  and observations will y ield strong inference tests of  alternative hypotheses.  Overall, this research will deepen  our understanding of individual and group-level adaptations  in one of the most remarkably complex, cooperation mammalian  societies on earth.",
