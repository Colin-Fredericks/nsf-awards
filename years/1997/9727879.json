The first three meetings were held in Como, Italy  in June 1989, Montpellier France in June 1992 and Houston Texas in June  1995. With a frequency of three years ICOSAHOM has played the role of  an international focal point in the field of spectral and high order  methods and the conference and its proceedings have proven to be  essential to researchers active in developing new algorithms as well as  those that implement high order methods to solve realistic problems of  interest to scientists and engineers.  The objective of the conference  is to bring together researchers with interest in the theoretical,  applied and computational aspects of high order and spectral methods.  Subjects include, but are not limited to, spectral methods, high-order  finite difference and finite element methods, h-p finite element  methods and wavelet based methods for the solution of partial  differential equations. Applications include electromagnetics, fluid  and structural dynamics problems, efficient solvers and preconditioners  for high order methods and parallel aspects of spectral and high order  methods. It is anticipated that the participants will include  physicists, mathematicians, scientists and engineers from many other  areas involving and utilizing spectral and high order methods.",
