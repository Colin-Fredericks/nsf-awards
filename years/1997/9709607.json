 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY        This award will proved seed money to build infrastructure to promote interdisciplinary collaborations and train students in the applied mathematical sciences at MIT.  The theme of the activity is to set up mechanisms for substantive, direct collaborations between faculty members from different departments (Applied Mathematics and Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences) on research topics of common interest.  The plan is to create a research environment where important interdisciplinary problems can be addressed through a blend of analysis, numerical simulations and physical experiments.  The infrastructure includes the creation of special student seminars, computer equipment designed to increase visualization and educational capabilities, support for postdoctoral fellows and students, and funding to strengthen connections of the mathematical modelling of complex systems to physical experiments.    The seminar series includes an informal workshop, allowing students and group members to share ideas on current projects, as well as a series focusing on developing areas of research. The planned scientific areas extend current areas of individual faculty research to collaborations between many faculty members.  Specific research topics include the dynamics of interfaces, sedimentation and pattern formation in geophysical processes, and singularity formation in general relativity. Collaborations will be facilitated and sustained by joint postdocs and students supported partially through the infrastructure grant.  The diverse talents brought together in the group create the potential for a special environment for collaborative research and interdisciplinary education in mathematics and the physical sciences.    Funding for this activity will be provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.",
