 "awd_abstract_narration": "Roberts  IBN 9604641    Steroid hormones are integral modulators of neural communication and development.  These simple molecules, acting as hormones, have the potential to influence all neural functions from initiation of neural development to the activity of individual synapses in adults.  Recent advances in knowledge about non-genomic actions of steroid hormones, the interactions with glial cells, and the role of steroid hormones on neural organization, have had striking effects on neuroendocrine physiology, neuronal cell biology, reproductive physiology and non-reproductive behaviors such as learning and memory, aging, aggression, social context, feeding, and emotion.  This action will provide support for a Young Investigator Symposium to be held at the 1997, 1998, and 1999 Workshop on Steroid Hormone and Brain Function.  This workshop brings together scientists of varied scientific backgrounds and perspectives in order to integrate aspects of molecular biology, anatomy, physiology, and behavior within a single session focused on an important and timely issue concerning steroid hormones and brain function.  Topics have ranged from extranuclear steroid hormone receptors to a comparative approach to sexual differentiation to steroid modulation of neuronal survival.  Each year, new symposia are presented on interdisciplinary topics in a field that is rapidly changing and advancing.  The inclusion of the Young Investigator Symposium provides a mechanism to ensure the strong participation of beginning scientists, to recognize their achievements and potential, and to facilitate collaborative efforts that may significantly enhance our understanding of fundamental neurobiological mechanisms.    ??",
