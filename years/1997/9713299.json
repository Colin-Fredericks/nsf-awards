 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713299  Synolakis  This action is to support the organization of a two-day  workshop on seafloor ground deformation models. The workshop  is to be held at the University of Southern California  Marine Science Station on Catalina Island, 14-15 May 1997.    The objective of the workshop is to examine the state-of-the-  art of interfacial seismology and tsunami hydrodynamics; in  particular, whether the initial conditions for the seafloor  displacement inferred from seismic records are adequate for  tsunami runup computations.    Whereas there have been significant advances in  hydrodynamics, these advances have concentrated almost  entirely and appropriately on the refinement of the  inundation computations. At the same time, despite anecdotal  advances in seismology, these advances have not been  absorbed by the hydrodynamics community. As a result,  hydrodynamics modelers use very elaborate shoreline  computations, while using -- at the very best -- initial  conditions based on a dislocation theory which has been in  existence for twenty years or more. Also, the usefulness of  the hydrodynamics computations to better define the ground  deformation needs to be better understood by the seismology  community.    Since inundation maps for the west coast of the US are  currently being prepared using tsunami runup computations,  the question of the determination of the ground deformation  is critically important. It is the objective of the workshop  to provide a forum for seismologists and hydrodynamicists to  discuss advances, and to identify short-term research needs  to better use the respective results. In each of the one-day  discussions, the objective is to identify critical issues,  to attempt to answer all the criteria questions which lie  within the present state-of-knowledge, and to discover areas  requiring more extensive study.    At the conclusion of the workshop, it is expected that the  tsunami research community will be in a better position to  focus -- in a continuing way -- on the r emaining questions  whose answers are needed to quantify better the input  provided by ocean-bottom pressure transducer recordings to  tsunami warning systems.",
