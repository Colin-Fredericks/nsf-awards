It is   based on the premise that the full benefit of modern computer graphics   cannot be realized in regression analyses without sound theoretical   foundations.  Emphasis is placed on the expansion and application of   an emerging theory for regression graphics based on dimension-reduction   subspaces, and on the implications of this theory for the interpretation   of standard graphical constructions. Graphical foundations for   regressions with a censored survival time as the response are given   special attention.      The ability to visualize statistical data plays an important role   in analyzing complex relationships.  For example, a measure of   the marginal impact of mandatory testing in grade schools   requires understanding how different socioeconomic    settings influence performance. Recent advances in high performance   computing, one of the Federal Strategic Areas, allow for the opportunity   to develop new graphical techniques that go far beyond traditional   graphics in both applicability and power. This research centers on   finding how computer graphics can be used to investigate complex   statistical relationships.  It stems from the notion that, even in   complex systems, it is possible to construct easily understood graphical   displays that contain all or nearly all of the relevant information in   the data.  This ability to preserve information in easily understood   displays requires new theoretical foundations that are an   integral part of this study.",
