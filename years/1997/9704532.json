 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704532  Birgeneau    In   this   project,  we  will  carry  out  a  comprehensive  experimental study of three classes of materials (a) one and  two-dimensional quantum magnets, (b) Sr- and excess - Oxygen  doped  La2CuO4 high temperature superconductors,  (c)  model  crystalline   insulating   magnets   which   are   extremely  disordered at the microscopic level.  Problems (a)  and  (b)  have  evolved  into distinct, but closely related  areas  of  research.  For the copper oxides our understanding  of  both  the  normal  and  superconducting states is still  far  from  complete.   Research  in the copper oxides  has  produced  a  renaissance  in  studies of low-dimensional quantum  magnets  revealing  subleties which were barely suspected  until  the  recent past.  For the diordered magnets new issues connected  with   history  dependence  and  irreproducibility  of   the  properties arise which require an extension of our  existing  understanding of equilibrium properties of materials.  These  systems  will  be  studied  using  both  neutron  and  x-ray  scattering techniques.  %%%  There  is a remarkable variety of materials in Nature  which  exhibit properties as varied as magnetism, superconductivity  and  semiconducting  electronic  behavior.   Some  of  these  materials such as the semiconductors Si or Ga As as well  as  simple  metals such as Al or Cu are by now well  understood.  There   are,   however,  many  materials  such  as   ceramic  superconductors   or  magnetic  alloys  which   are   barely  understood  at all.  In this research program,  our  general  strategy  is to look at these materials at the atomic  level  using  specialized  techniques known as  neutron  and  x-ray  scattering and to see how the properties evolve as one  goes  from the microscopic to the macroscopic level.  Our goal  is  thereby to elucidate the fundamental physics which underlies  these materials.  ***",
