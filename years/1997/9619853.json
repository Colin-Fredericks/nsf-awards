 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to accelerate the rendering of three  dimensional surface models using multiresolution modeling  techniques.    Multiresolution modeling is the description of shape at multiple  levels of detail.  In conventional image synthesis, an object is  rendered from the same geometric model independent of its screen  size, but this is unnecessarily slow for small and distant  objects.  With multiresolution models, nearby objects are  rendered using a detailed model, while distant objects are  rendered using a coarse model employing many fewer polygons.    To date, the creation of multiresolution models has been largely  manual.  New algorithms will be developed to adaptively simplify  polygonal surface models, attempting to find an accurate  approximation to the surface using as few polygons as possible,  and to do this as quickly as possible.  Methods for smoothing the  transitions between levels of detail will be developed.  The  resulting image should be indistinguishable from a scene rendered  from a fully detailed model.    Multiresolution models can speed up a number of applications,  including flight and driving simulation, computer aided design,  visualization, video games, virtual reality, and computer  animation.  They can allow scenes of great complexity to be  rendered in real time.",
