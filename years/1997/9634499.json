The project will develop methods based on use of impact-  generated stress waves.  Preliminary studies on single ducts  located in plate-like structures have shown that such  methods have the potential to detect voids in grouted metal  tendon ducts.  However, a comprehensive and basic research  study is still needed to (1) understand the propagation of  transient stress waves in typical post-tensioned structural  geometries, (2) to understand the interaction of stress  waves with partial and full voids in ducts, as well as water-  filled voids in ducts, (3) the effects caused by the use of  plastic tendon ducts, (4) the interaction of stress waves  with ducts closely spaced and ducts located two and three  deep in a cross-section, and (5) to determine whether the  extent of grouting in ducts can be determined during the  grouting process.  ***",
