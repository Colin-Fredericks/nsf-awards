 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation enhancement grant supports a US graduate student, Kimberly P. Pfeifer, working under the guidance of Dr. Goran Hyden, Professor of Political Science at the University of Florida, to do field research in Tanzania.  The project will study the Fumba, Chakwa, Nungwi and Mkwajuni communities in Zanzibar to determine how they use their ethnic identities to influence the development and implementation of sustainable development and resource management policies created by Tanzanian state and nongovernmental organizations.  The results of this study should provide valuable information on ways policy-making organizations can incorporate the concerns of local communities into their strategies and policies to address global change problems.  The principal methods used will be interviews, focus group sessions, and archival research.  Staff members of the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Dar es Salaam will collaborate with Ms. Pfeifer on this project.  This study will make an important contribution to the understanding of how different ethnic groups contribute to the success or failure of national policies on conservation and resource distribution and management.  The grant will also provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong, independent research career.  Funding for this project is being provided by the Division of International Programs and by the Division of Social, Behavioral, and Economic Research.",
