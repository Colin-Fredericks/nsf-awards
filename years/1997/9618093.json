The Atlas will produce \"strand maps\" that portray the sequence and structure of knowledge and skills needed for students to achieve particular science literacy goals.  Resources will:  provide aid to those developing science frameworks at district and state levels; develop workshop guides to help preservice and inservice teachers improve heir knowledge and skills in science, mathematics, and technology, along with their instructional skills; and extend the procedure for analyzing science materials to mathematics and technology materials.  Finally, the project will work with reform leaders on using these materials.    The third party evaluation by SRI will continue.",
