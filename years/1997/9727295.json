Biological systems are  customarily studied by iterations between models of system  behavior and data describing that behavior.  As a newly-  formed field, industrial ecology has generated some usable  data, but has yet to have inspired much in the way of model  development.  However, if industrial ecology is to be  usefully informed by biological ecology, it is necessary to  begin to explore models of its behavior from an ecosystem  perspective.  In such a system, resources are provided from  virgin reservoirs by extractors, processed by one stratum of  \"organisms' (smelters, refiners, chemical transformers),  utilized by a higher stratum of \"organisms\" (manufacturers),  acquired by \"top predators\" (customers), and eventually  reclaimed by recyclers.  The work proposed here seeks to  gather relevant data for selected resources, materials  flows, and \"organisms\" in an urban area and to generate the  mathematical relationships needed to develop an industrial  ecology model describing reservoirs, the flows of resources  among them and the driving forces governing those flows.  The resultant model will be the first designed explicitly to  computationally investigate the flows of materials, energy,  and capital in an industrial ecosystem.    The industrial ecology model that will be constructed will  utilize as a framework the \"Gecko\" ecosystem ecology model  developed at the Yale University Center for Computational  Ecology.  The equations describing the flows of resources  will incorporate both resource constraints and economic  interaction parameters.  The investigators that will be  involved include an industrial ecologist (also an  experienced modeler of complex chemical systems), a natural  resources economist (also a specialist in water supply  economics), and a populati on ecologist (also a co-developer  of the Gecko model).    The result of this research will be a model that can be used  to investigate specific questions of interest to industrial  ecology, such as \"Are there optimal geographical patterns or  mixes of \"organisms\" in an industrial ecosystem?\"; \"What are  the barriers to improved industrial ecosystem realization?\";  \"How might these barriers be surmounted?\" \"How are the  results altered if (a) the natural resource base is changed  (by the exhaustion of a resource, for example); (b) the  economic structure is changed (by the initiation of a new  tariff, for example), (c) system boundaries are changed  (from an urban region to a state or subcontinent, for  example)?\" More important, it is reasonable to expect the  models to help frame the thinking of the industrial ecology  field, as has happened in so many other specialty areas.  One can then hope to take a more enlightened approach to the  role of industrial activity (broadly defined to include the  service industries, transportation etc.) in our highly  technological society.  This framing will be especially  important with the dynamic models that have the potential to  interact with global geosphere-biosphere models and  illuminate where we as a society and a planet have been and  where we might be headed.  ***",
