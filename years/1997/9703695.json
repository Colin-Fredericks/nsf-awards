Stability and instability phenomena will be investigated, particularly  in   the kinetic theory of charged particles with and without collisions.  Stability   problems for a variety of other kinds of waves, including breathers, solitary  waves   and dispersive waves, will also be explored.  Energy conserving waves of  marginal   stability will be emphasized, and methods of mathematical analysis will be  employed in   the investigations.      Waves occur in many forms in the physical environment, such as in the ocean,   the atmosphere, biochemical processes, acoustics, telecommunications, and so on.   The   most complicated ones are the nonlinear ones, where it is difficult to predict  the   outcomes without very complex calculations.  Some of these nonlinear waves are   unstable, which means that a small change creates a large disturbance.  Which  waves   are stable and which are unstable will be the focus of this project.  The basic   principles for understanding these phenomena are mathematical.  These principles  are   fundamental to the creation of high-performance computing algorithms.  We   shall investigate the stability theory especially within the   theory of physical plasmas.    The stability of nonlinear plasma waves is relevant to such diverse applications  as   fusion energy research and satellite and radio communications in space.",
