 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:  requested in this proposal will allow Florida A&M University to initiate institution-wide reform of the SME&T curricula.  The President of the University will serve as the principal investigator.  Day-to-day activities will be directed by the project director, who will be an Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs. The project director will interface with the Deans, department chairs and faculty and students for the implementation of the proposed activities.  The principal investigator will receive advisory directives from the curriculum reform committee, consisting of the faculty representatives from various sectors of the university community.         The specific activities to be implemented with funds from this project include:         1.  the development of a multi-disciplinary general science course that uses an integrated cooperative instruction model incorporating an inquiry format.  This course will be developed initially as a one semester sequence, and expanded in the second year to a two semester sequence. This two semester sequence will satisfy the general science education requirement for the core curriculum (for non-science majors),       2.  the implementation of a structured faculty professional development program that will enable faculty to utilize the current technological advances to enhance their teaching skills,       3.  the development of innovative methods of delivery of SME&T instructions that include ample use of current technology to transform the learning process from a passive activity to one in which the students are active participants,       4.  the implementation of the experimental reform activities that are initiated in this effort as a wedge to modify current teaching practices of all faculty at the university.    Upon completion of the reform described in this proposal, it is expected that FAMU graduates will:         1.  understand the uniqueness of the natural world and appreciate the relationship between life and the universe,       2.  b e technically informed citizens who can engage in intelligent discussions about science and technical topics,       3.  understand and utilize science related processes and principles to navigate the throws of everyday life,       4.  adapt to and become comfortable with the constant changes that result from the development of a more technological society,       5.  become talented and creative scientists and engineers for the 21st centry, and serve as creative enthusiastic teachers who convey the excitement of science to the next generation of citizens.",
