 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712602    This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award is  funded to  initiate efforts to provide guidelines for assessing,  controlling, and  monitoring ground movements and building damage that are  direct and  uncomplicated, that will be accepted by contractors,  designers, and  preservationists, and that will aid in the provision of  improved, adequate,  and economic protection of structures.  The research will  develop model  tests involving four large tieback walls, which will be  extensively  instrumented and monitored during testing by excavation.  Models will be  used also to investigate scaling relationships and  interaction between  ground, retaining walls, and surrounding structures, during  and after  excavation.  Results of analyses will be compared with data  from previous  and current field cases.  These efforts will be used to  support the  development and assessment of guidelines for controlling  damage.  By  capitalizing on their strong existing cooperative efforts  with industry,  the principal investigators will formulate new criteria that  will result in  safer, more realistic, and more economical control of ground  movements,  while providing a higher level of protection for historic  and urban  structures.  ***",
