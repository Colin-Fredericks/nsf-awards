 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN:  9722220  PI:  Eddins  Human hearing can detect even simple sounds better when they last longer, and this auditory temporal integration may be particularly important in processing more complex acoustic signals such as speech.  Although psychophysical studies of acoustic perception show this integration, we know very little about the underlying physiological mechanisms in auditory brain centers.  This project uses physiological recordings of evoked brain activity and of responses of single nerve cells to measure the changing thresholds for signal detection with stimulus duration, to model the contributions of different parts of the auditory pathway, and to clarify the parallels between single neuron activity and gross evoked-potential responses.  Integral to these research aims is the educational goal of this Career project to teach undergraduate and graduate students basic neurophysiological research methods, by developing an investigative laboratory course along with an interactive multimedia textbook to accompany the course.  Results will be important in neuroscience to clarify the important issue of the physiological nature of auditory temporal processing in the brain, and to understand processing of more complex sounds such as speech, and also will be have an important educational impact on many students in the speech and hearing sciences who might otherwise receive very little neuroscience background.",
