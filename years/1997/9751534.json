 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings current FT-NMR technology to science and non-science majors at Huntington College.  Students in general chemistry courses will be introduced to the theory and use of NMR through demonstrations.  Hands-on use of the instrument and analysis of spectra is initiated in the organic course and continues throughout the remainder of the curriculum.  Two-dimensional techniques, such as COSY and HETCOR, provide students with the training and experience required for industrial employment or graduate school.  The NMR spectrometer improves the scope of undergraduate research and sparks interest in science.  The project enhances the education and training of faculty and students from local colleges in special courses.  This expands the impact of the project on a wider audience which includes underrepresented groups.  The project is evaluated by feedback from participating colleges, the number of students in courses and undergraduate research projects, formal presentations, publications, and surveys of faculty and students.  Dissemination is occuring through presentations, publication, the Web, and interactions with educators at scientific meetings.  *",
