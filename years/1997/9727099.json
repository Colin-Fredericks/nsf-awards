The overall goals are to describe the extent to which various wellness, outreach and long-term care services are offered by integrated healthcare delivery systems, and to explicate how these services function as an integral part of the  continuum of care.  The study involves two activities: (1) analyzing secondary data collected on the American Hospital Association Annual Survey to develop a national profile of continuum services at the hospital, health system, and network levels, and (2) conducting interviews with 10-12 selected hospitals and healthcare systems about operational issues pertaining specifically to service integration.  The project will examine the involvement of 27 wellness, outreach, and long-term care services in integrated healthcare delivery systems.",
