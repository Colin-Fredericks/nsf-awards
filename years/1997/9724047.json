Pollen tubes also present an attractive model   system for the study of polarized growth, partly because they are haploid and can be easily cultured.  The   long-term goal of this project is to elucidate molecular pathways that govern polarized cell growth in   pollen tubes.  We have identified a rho-type small GTP-binding protein, Rop1, that preferentially   expressed in pollen and pollen tubes and is localized to the apex of pea and Arabidopsis pollen tubes.    Antibody microinjection experiments indicate that Rop1 plays a pivotal role in pollen tube growth likely   by modulating Ca2+-dependent exocytosis.  The goal of this proposed work is to confirm the role of Rop1   in polarized tube growth using a reverse genetics approach and to investigate underlying molecular and   cellular mechanisms for the function of Rop1 in pollen tubes.  The role of Rop1 will be genetically tested   using transgenic Arabidopsis plants that express dominant positive and negative mutant Rop1 alleles   under the control of a pollen tube-specific promoter.  The transgenic pollen tubes will be analyzed for   changes in tip growth and in vivo guidance.  The transgenic pollen tubes expressing Rop1 dominant   mutant alleles will also be analyzed for changes in the behavior of secretory vesicles using TEM and the   rapid freeze and freeze substitution technique and for changes in the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and the   tip-focused intracellular Ca2+-gradients using a Ca2+-selective vibrating probe and ratiometric ion   imaging.  These careful analyses will test the notion that Rop1 controls polarized cell growth by   modulating Ca2+ signaling-dependent polarized exocytosis.  To further understand the underlying   mechanism for Rop1-mediated polarized growth, Rop1 effectors will be identified by cloning genes   encoding Rop1 partners using  interactive cloning techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid method.  Rop1   effectors are expected to interact specifically with GTP-bound Rop1 (dominant positive mutant) but not   with GDP-bound Rop1 (dominant negative mutant).  These studies will establish a solid foundation for   our long-term goal of elucidating molecular pathways that lead to directional pollen tube growth.  This   work may also generate a broad impact on understanding the molecular basis of polarized growth in   higher organisms as well as produce useful information for manipulating sexual reproduction in higher   plants, such as engineering male sterility for hybrid production.    The polar growth of pollen tubes is an interesting and significant process in which a germinating pollen   tube extends in a single direction to mediate fertilization and reproduction in plants. The PI has identified   a protein (ROP1, GTP-binding protein) involved in the signal transduction system that appears to control   the polar growth of pollen tubes through calcium fluxes. With this preliminary data as a base the PI will   use mutants of ROP1 to examine the function of the protein. Using light microscopy assays the role of   ROP1 in inducing a calcium fluxes will be visualized and correlated with electron microscopy of the   intracellular events that are required to extend the pollen tube. ROP1 must interact with other proteins in   cascade that transmits signals through the cell. Proteins that interact with ROP1 will be identified and   characterized. This research is of fundamental importance in describing a critical process in the   reproduction of plants. Practical applications of the research include modifying plant reproductive growth   to create superior plants.    ***",
