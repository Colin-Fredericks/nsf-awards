 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:  Juraska, J.  IBN-9723918  Recent advances in imaging techniques have made the measurement of the gross structure of the human brain more accessible than ever.  Factors being examined include sex differences in brain structure, spurred by the sex differences in brain size and the possibility of links to sex differences in cognitive behavior.  However, an often overlooked problem is that gross size is not a directly meaningful entity for brain function; rather it is neurons and their interconnections that are the basis for neural function.  One notable example of this is the controversy surrounding possible sex differences in the size of the splenial portion of the human corpus callosum.  In rats, like humans, males have a larger overall brain size than females, and there are sex differences in non-reproductive behaviors.  The well studied rat brain is an excellent model for understanding possible neural bases for sex differences in gross brain size and their functional implications.  The goal of the present proposal is to understand the origins of sex differences in the cerebral cortex.  The gonadal steroids may be playing a role in sculpting both neuron number through the death of neurons in the cortex and axon number through the withdrawal of axons in the corpus callosum.  The emphasis is on the visual cortex (Oc1) and the concomitant portion of the corpus callosum, the splenium, in order to build on previous work from my lab that indicates that there are more neurons and glia in the Oc1B (binocular) area in male than female rats and our recent work on the late time course of axon withdrawal in the splenium of the rat corpus callosum.  As a source of natural variation, sex differences can be a valuable investigative tool for aiding in the understanding of developmental processes, models of brain function and the cognitively mediated functions being visualized with imaging techniques.  There are also medical applications.  Many developmental disorders such as dyslexia and stutt ering are found more in one sex than another.  In addition, there are sex differences in response to brain damage in both children and adults, in the incidence of mental illness and in the response to drugs.  Most of these dimorphisms involve brain areas not related to reproductive functions, such as the cerebral cortex - areas in which sex differences are not well understood.  Finally, steroid hormones are manipulated in a variety of therapeutic contexts in both adults and children and the consequences for brain structure may be widespread.     ??",
