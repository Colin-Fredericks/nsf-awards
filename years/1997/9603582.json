 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603582  Hartsel  Amphotericin B is one of the classic model compounds to study membrane ion channel formation and properties, but the molecular structure of the channel is still controversial.  The goal is to use fluorescence, absorbance and circular dichroism techniques to liposomal membrane vesicles treated with the polyene natural product Amphotericin B to uncover the molecular structure and kinetics of this membrane channel-forming compound.  Many polyenes may form ion permeable pores in cellular lipid membranes by organizing molecules with the polar polyalcohol region in the middle.  However, the size and nature of the channels seem to vary depending upon which sterol, ergosterol or cholesterol, is present in the phospholipid membrane and under conditions of osmotic stress (swelling).  The condition of osmotic stress in simple membranes will be used in an attempt to \"trap\" the exclusive active channel structure(s) with a minimum of complications.    Biological membrane channels or pores are ultimately the key to regulating fundamental processes from neurotransmission all the way to basic uptake of and elimination of nutrients and wastes in every cell.  This reach should advance our knowledge of polyene channels and membrane channels in general.  In addition, the proposed work will heavily involve undergraduate students in carrying out every aspect of the work, from experimental design and collection of data through polishing and presenting the data at scientific conferences and ultimately publication in peer-reviewed journals.  The P.I. has had extensive experience and success in using undergraduate research as a pedagogical tool for training of science students.",
