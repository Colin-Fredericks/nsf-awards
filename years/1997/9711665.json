 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teamwork is becoming increasingly critical in multi-agent domains ranging from virtual   environments for training and education, to information integration on the Internet, to   potential multi-robotic space missions. The overall goal of this research is to develop a   comprehensive model of teamwork, that explains the complex phenomena in teamwork,   such as commitments, coordination and communication. To this end, this project   investigates flexible communication in service  of coordination, to significantly enrich the   communication in existing teamwork models, and thus improve teamwork flexibility. In   particular, it examines the role of explicit communication to improve quality, accuracy or   efficiency of teamwork, as well as the role of implicit communication (via plan-  recognition) to maintain teamwork coherence. The approach is based on a model of   teamwork called STEAM.  STEAM enables agents to explicitly represent and reason with   joint goals and plans, and their commitments in team activities. While STEAM's   underlying teamwork model is based on the joint intentions theory, it also includes   significant novel additions in the form of monitoring constraints, team reorganization   capabilities as well as decision theoretic communication selectivity.  STEAM has been   implemented --- STEAM agents participate in teamwork in three complex domains. The   results of this research will enable significant improvement in multi-agent teamwork   flexibility, as well as reuse of teamwork capabilities, with possible applications in the   arenas such as education, entertainment, training, and others mentioned above.",
