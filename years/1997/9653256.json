 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will develop field exercises to integrate multidisciplinary elements of science and engineering in lower and upper division environmental engineering courses. The field exercises will be developed and implemented with the input of practicing professionals in the field of environmental engineering and science. The goal of the project is to provide experiences throughout the environmental engineering option for undergraduate students that imitate real-world problems in an authentic setting.  These exercises will be designed to 1.) stimulate student interest and knowledge in real problems, 2.) develop the ability to synthesize information from different disciplines, 3.) impart confidence to find information and resources independently, 4.) provide opportunities to apply science and technology to practical problems, 5.) motivate students to work effectively in a group, and 6.) improve communication skills.       The field exercises will be implemented primarily in the introductory courses of the environmental engineering curriculum. Undergraduates will be exposed early in their academic careers to actual environmental projects and problems so as to stimulate interest and enthusiasm, two elements critical for recruitment and retention. Two lower division courses, \"Aquatic Chemistry for Environmental Engineers\" and \"Environmental Biotechnology\", and the students' first upper division environmental engineering course, \"Introduction to Environmental Engineering and Water Resources\", have been targeted for five of eight field projects proposed here. The remaining exercises will be implemented in upper division, analysis and design electives.        While the individual projects are site specific, the exercises are readily adaptable to other locations by other undergraduate institutions. The effectiveness of these field exercises will be evaluated by faculty, environmental professionals participating in the project, and the student s. The  project will provide undergraduates with a unique experience designed to stimulate interest in environmental engineering and science and provide an unmatched preparation for professional practice.",
