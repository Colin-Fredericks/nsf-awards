 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700830  Schlesinger  This project, centered around the Free-Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE)  experiment in the Duke Forest of central North Carolina, is designed to elucidate changes in  soil carbon dynamics in response to an ecosystem-level atmospheric CO2 enrichment. In  reaching this objective, the research proposed here is intended to address questions  surrounding process-level understanding of soil function and its link with the atmosphere  and groundwater. Fluxes of carbon into and out of the soil system, as well as transfers and  storage within the soil profile, will be examined. Importantly, the study will capitalize on  the use of stable carbon isotope (C-13) tracers that will be introduced into the atmosphere  of the FACE plot with the CO2 enrichment. This isotope tracer will allow the examination  of the rate of carbon incorporation into soil organic matter, the effect of soil acidity on  weathering rates, and the potential of a long-term atmospheric carbon sink in soils and  groundwater. This research is of particular interest and importance to global change  scientists and policy-makers interested in the \"missing sink\", soil scientists examining  carbon dynamics, and geochemists interested in the extent of biotic control over chemical  weathering.",
