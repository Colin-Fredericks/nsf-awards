 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new chemistry curriculum designed around FT-infrared and UV-visible spectroscopy instrumentation is allowing students to approach the subject in a variety of non-traditional ways. The majority of our graduates enter technician-level positions and need to be familiar with chemical principles as well as the operation of various instruments. They are often responsible for calibration and maintenance. Spectroscopy applications intrigue students in many technology fields, and allow interest in computers or instrument design to drive their understanding of chemistry principles. Since all of our chemistry classes use the same laboratory, it is possible to give students access to instruments beginning with their first chemistry course. With this facility, spectroscopy is being used as a means to introduce chemical principles and to acquaint students with instrument operation and maintenance. The use of current spectroscopy instrumentation also is enhancing discovery-based laboratories used to individualize student understanding of chemical principles and to help apply those principles to specific examples in the student's field of study. Augmenting the chemistry portfolios, prepared for each class, with examples of this sort makes the portfolio assessment tool more powerful for students throughout their careers.  *",
