 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-frequency test equipment and a high-power dynamometer test stand are proposed for multidimensional research encompassing finite inertia power systems (FIPS), electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), and bulk power systems (BPS).  The need for this research has resulted from the incorporation of power electronic devices into many types of systems that have been historically mechanical including ship propulsion transmissions, actuation in aircraft (fly-by-light, power-by-wire), and electric vehicles in order to increase efficiency, bandwidth, and reliability, and at the same time decrease size and weight.  Power electronic devices also provide a growing basis for maintaining a high degree of power quality and reliability in bulk power systems in the newly deregulated electric utility environment.  However, the use of power electronic devices has also led to many technical challenges including not only traditional coordination and control concerns in FIPS and BPS, but also high-frequency noise and electromagnetic interference.  This interference can cause malfunctioning of the high-speed digital circuitry controlling the power electronics leading to subsequent (and usually catastrophic) failure of these devices.  In addition, the electromagnetic interference can also result in malfunctioning of other nearby communications or digital electronics.  Multi-dimensional research at UM-Rolla has grown out of this intersection of power engineering and electromagnetic compatibility concerns.  UM-Rolla has traditionally had strong programs in power engineering and EMC, and are recognized as leaders in these areas.  New multi-dimensional research efforts between these groups grew out of experimental implementation of a scaled shipboard FIPS.  High-frequency noise problems resulting from rapidly switching power electronics caused malfunctioning in the power electronic digital control circuitry and catastrophic failure of the power electronics.  Significant collaborative research resulted between the power and EMC groups in this relatively unexplored area in order to find solutions to these particular challenges.  In particular, the power/EMC team has attracted In excess of $3.5 million from a wide spectrum of federal and industrial sources for power electronics, machines and drives, power systems, and electromagnetic compatibility research.  This proposal requests equipment for the investigation of high-frequency effects in power electronic systems as well as the development of new design approaches for minimizing this noise.  This equipment will also be used for related research in finite inertia power systems, electromagnetic interference  and susceptibility in high-speed digital designs, and for bulk power systems.  The Emerson Electric Machines  and  Drives Laboratory  has  extensive capabilities for experimental research, and the EMC Laboratory has state-of-the-art high-frequency test equipment for research in the 1OOMHz-20GHz frequency range.  However, the primary frequency range for noise problems in power electronic systems is 0.01-IOOMHz, thus additional instrumentation is required.  The specific instruments needed in this range are a network analyzer, spectrum analyzer, impedance analyzer, time-domain reflectometer, LCR meter, and power amplifier.  Expanded research opportunities in characterizing, modeling, and developing design aids for avoiding high-frequency noise problems in power electronic systems are possible with the addition of the proposed test equipment.  Current facilities in the power lab are also not sufficient for pursuing studies of systems dominated by one prime mover such as next generation shipboard and aircraft applications.  A high-power dynamometer is required as a prime mover for this research.  The experimental capabilities  in both the power and EMC areas make UM-Rol a unique                        both universities and industries.  The proposed equipment will build on existing strengths for expanding research and education in the area of high-frequency problems in power electronic applications.",
