 "awd_abstract_narration": "Popescu 9610205  The principal investigator will pursue research in algebraic geometry, computational algebra, and computational algebraic geometry.  He will work on problems in the following areas:  (1) Calabi-Yau 3-folds, moduli and equations of abelian surfaces; (2) The Coble-Gale transform and free resolutions; (3) Vector bundle resolutions; and (4) Small codimensional smooth projective varieties.  The computational aspects involve the design of new algebraic algorithms and their implementation in some of the currently available systems: Macaulay, Macaulay2 and Schubert.  This is research in the field of algebraic geometry.  Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and robotics.",
