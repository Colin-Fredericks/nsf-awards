A part of this project is directed towards extending these  results to other interesting systems for which disorder strongly  affects wave propagation: acoustic, electromagnetic, and elastic  waves. Another goal is to extend the types of disorder allowed  to more realistic models such as the Poisson and random  displacement models. This will require an improvement of the  Wegner estimate obtained in previous works.  These techniques will be useful in studying the question of  correlated systems and high-energy localization for  two-dimensional disordered system.    The propagation of classical acoustic and electromagnetic waves  and of a single electron in perfectly ordered media, like a  crystal, is well understood. There are allowed and forbidden  energies of propagation for the waves. At the allowed energies,  the waves propagate out to infinity behaving almost as if  they were free waves. The effects of randomly distributed  impurities in solids, or randomly distributed defects in an  otherwise perfect material, is profound: the particles and waves  no longer propagate out to infinity. Rather, at many energies,  the transport of energy will be completely suppressed. This is  effect is referred to as localization. The goal of this research  is to better understand the mechanisms of localization for  classical and quantum mechanical systems for many models of disorder.  These results have applications to many engineering devices such  as the effect of random imperfections in wave guides, photonic  crystals, and superlattices.",
