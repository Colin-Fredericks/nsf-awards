 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614170  Wu  This project is concerned with theoretical studies of  lattice models in statistical physics with emphasis on exact  results and applications.  While most exact results are  limited to 2-dimensions, this project proposes to study the  3-dimensional systems by building around the 2-d solution.  Specific plans include: analysis of the relationship between  a quantum spin system in 2-dimension and a classical one in  3-d,  further work on certain conjectures on the  distribution of zeroes of the Potts model partition function  and directed percolation problem in 3-d.  Additional  projects involve: investigation of roughening of crystal  surfaces, gel-sol transition in a ternary polymer solution,  the mathematical problem of restricted partitions of an  integer and derivation of a new link invariant  in the  theory of knots and kinks.  %%%  This PI is widely known for his contributions to more  mathematical aspects of the materials related problems.  In  research on the fundamental properties of materials and  phase transitions, this PI has made contributions where the  problem has been simplified to the extent that a  mathematically exact and rigorous solution is possible.  The  more realistic problems then can be understood by building  up on the exact results.  Much of the present grant supports  search for exact solutions in bulk (3-dimensional) on  certain simplified models where the solution is known for a  thin film (in 2-d).  ***",
