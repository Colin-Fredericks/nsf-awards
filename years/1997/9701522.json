 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701522  RALEIGH        The University of Hawaii will operate the R/V MOANA WAVE in  1997  as  a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded  research  projects.   The MOANA WAVE is a  210'  research  vessel  owned  by the U.S. Navy and operated as a UNOLS vessel in support  of  academic  research.  The ship is scheduled for  190  days  of  which  170 are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.  All of  the  cruises are in the Pacific with three NSF cruises in the vicinity  of  Guam.  The remaining NSF cruises are of short duration out of  Hawaii  in  support the Hawaii Time Series project.  In  addition  the vessel will support three short cruises for NOAA.        The MOANA WAVE is part of the academic fleet used by NSF to  support  oceanographic  research.   Most  oceanographic  research  requires  highly specialized equipment that must  be  permanently  installed  on  a  ship  for which the ship must  be  specifically  designed.   This  equipment  also requires  highly  trained  crew  members  for  maintenance and operation.  These  vessels  do  not  operate  in the same manner as general cargo or fishing  vessels,  therefore,  NSF  supports the operation of a variety  of  vessels  specifically  dedicated  to  oceanographic  research   that   are  operated  by  universities and research institutions  around  the  country.  ***",
