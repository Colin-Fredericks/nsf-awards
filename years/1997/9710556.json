 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a unique graduate seminar on the design and supervision of undergraduate research projects in which graduate women across science, mathematics and engineering (SME) disciplines will be educated about academic and pedagogical issues related to undergraduate teaching and research design.  They will have direct experiences developing short research projects to be carried out by undergraduates in a linked undergraduate course, Introduction to Research.  The projects will be developed by pairs of students from different disciplines, will be in new or emerging SME fields and emphasize interdisciplinary or applied collaborations.  The graduate seminar/undergraduate course represents an innovative model for teaching and research that connects graduate and undergraduate education and emphasizes collaborative and interactive learning.  This model can be integrated readily into standard university curriculum and has the potential to foster interactions with industrial researchers that may lead to long-term associations.",
