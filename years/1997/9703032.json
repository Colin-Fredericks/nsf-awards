 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703032  Wurman         Under the Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER), the  Principal Investigator will pursue research and educational activities associated with  two new and innovative uses of Doppler radars for meteorological research.   Single  or multiple Doppler radars at fixed sites have been utilized for many years in  meteorological research and some aspects of their use are very mature.  Due to  technological advances, research Doppler radars have evolved to the state where they  can be mounted in mobile  ground-based and airborne platforms.  Under other  support, the Principal Investigator has begun to develop two mobile ground-based  Doppler radar systems which provide many advantages over fixed sites.  Primary  among these are the ability to acquire many more data sets and to obtain data at  much higher spatial resolution.  Along with these advantages, however, also comes  special problems in data analysis/synthesis.  For example, higher elevation angles  than normally encountered with fixed radar sites may cause some potential problems.   Additionally, the possibility of collecting data while moving also provides special  challenges in developing optimal experimental designs and in analysis of data.          The second area of research the Principal Investigator will pursue is the use  of bistatic multiple Doppler networks.  This is a network consisting of one  transmitting radar with a network of many, distributed receivers.  This is very new  technology that has the advantage, among many others, of providing relatively  inexpensive mapping of wind fields over large areas.  The Principal Investigator will  continue research into the best design and utilization of such networks.        Under the educational component of this CAREER award, the Principal  Investigator will incorporate the mobile Dopplers and bistatic networks into graduate  courses as well as host Summer workshops for students.  This will integrate students  into research that is at the very cutting e dge of development of new meteorological  radar technologies.  ***",
