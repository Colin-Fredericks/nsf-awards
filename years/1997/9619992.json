The University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) has been quite successful in attracting grants and establishing a state-of-the-art research facility in these areas.  The researchers at UMR are currently developing a collaborative relationship with the University of Turabo, Puerto Rico (a minority, undergraduate university) to conduct joint research in the field of mechatronics and smart structures.  The overall goals of the project being proposed are (i) introduction of mechatronics and smart structures concepts to junior/senior undergraduate students, (ii) development of an interdisciplinary educational experience for students working in teams involving students from different disciplines, (iii) providing a unique opportunity to minority students from the University of Turabo and other schools to conduct research in state-of-the-art laboratories, and (iv) involving undergraduate students with ongoing research programs in areas and technologies of national importance.  To accomplish these objectives, our approach will be to (i) develop a eight-week summer course on mechatronics and smart structures, (ii) develop team design projects, (iii) involve graduate students as mentors, and (iv) provide hands-on experience in the computer-aided design and control of mechanical systems.  The novel feature of this project is the involvement of minority undergraduate students in the development of a multidisciplinary research experience.  ***",
