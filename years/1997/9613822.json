 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Michael Harmata's studies of the cycloaddition chemistry of   cyclic oxyallylic cations are supported by the Organic Synthesis Program.    Dr. Harmata, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of   Missouri - Columbia, is studying (4+3) cycloaddition reactions, focusing   on several novel aspects of this class of reactions.  Cycloaddition   reactions of substrates containing halogen substituents provide products   which may be elaborated into more complex structures, particularly   through quasi-Favorskii rearrangements.  Use of chiral bases to mediate   the (4+3) cycloadditions, particularly in substrates designed to permit   intramolecular delivery of the chiral base, will impart chirality to the   cycloadducts.  Representative members of the cyclooctanoid class of   natural products, dactylol and 11-hydroxyjasionone, will be prepared   through synthetic routes highlighting the efficacy of the (4+3)   cycloaddition reactions of oxyallylic cations.  Synthesis of the often-complex molecules forming the basis of modern   chemical and pharmaceutical science requires the formation of   carbon-carbon bonds in a highly selective manner.  `Cycloaddition`   reactions, in which two (or more) reacting molecules add to one another   to form a cyclic product, represent a particularly powerful way in which   to achieve such selective bond formation.  Dr. Harmata studies   cycloaddition reactions which result in the formation of compounds   containing seven carbon atoms in a ring, exploring ways to introduce   additional selectivity and versatility into these reactions.  He will   exploit an unusual ring transformation reaction which allows the   conversion of these seven-membered ring compounds into products   containing eight-membered rings.  These studies will culminate in the   synthesis of several specific compounds, including 11-hydroxyjasionone,   which displays antibacterial and antifungal activity, and will serve as a   general platform for the synthesis of other eight-membered ring compounds   of known or potential biological or medicinal activity.",
