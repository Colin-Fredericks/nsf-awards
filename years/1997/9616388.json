 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Dynamics Program supports studies of photochemistry and   strained molecules carried out under the direction of Professor Richard   Johnson of the University of New Hampshire at Durham.  Through a   combination of experimental and calculational studies, Professor Johnson   explores the formation and reaction chemistry of high-energy organic   compounds with distorted multiple bonds, including small-ring 1,2-dienes   such as 1,2-cyclobutadiene and 1,2-cyclopentadiene and 1,2,3-trienes such   as 1,2,3-cyclobutatriene and 1,2,3-cyclohexatriene.  Other strained-ring   compounds, cyclopropanated phenanthrenes, serve as photochemical   precursors to vinylidene, vinylcarbene, cyclopropylidene, and other   carbenes.  Development of a fundamental understanding of chemical structure and   reactivity often requires the study of compounds designed to test   implicit and explicit assumptions about chemical bonding and stability.    Professor Richard Johnson, of the University of New Hampshire at Durham,   uses the energy of light to induce the formation of molecules designed to   stretch the limits of such assumptions, focusing on cyclic compounds for   which consideration of simple bonding principles would predict   impossibility of existence.  These studies, in addition to their   importance on the fundamental level, will lead to new routes for the   preparation of molecules with biological activity and for the preparation   of unusual polymeric materials, and may also shed light on phenomena   observed in combustion chemistry, fullerene (`Bucky ball`) synthesis, and   extraterrestrial chemistry.",
