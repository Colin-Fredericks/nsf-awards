 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the   Chemistry Division, Professors P. Kleiber and K. Sando of the University   of Iowa will continue their investigations of state-resolved molecular   dynamics using `half-collision` methods.  They pioneered the application   of the  technique known as scattering state spectroscopy in order to   study inelastic (including chemically reactive) collisions.  In this   project they will extend these experiments to collisions of metal atoms   with the molecules H2 and CH4.  Another, new technique involves   `fractional collisions,` in which scattering resonances in a   metal-ion/molecule collision complex are detected using orbital-following   models.  These are somewhat complementary techniques which help describe   different aspects of the collision process.  %%%  Theoretical models exist for the photodissociation of alkali diatomic   molecules, but such theories are often not amenable to simple physical   interpretation and can not easily be applied to complex dissociation   processes.  In some cases of current interest, such as collisions between   ultra-cold atoms, the underlying physics is not understood well enough to   allow application of theoretical methods with confidence.  The results of   these experiments on reactions between excited metal atoms and molecules   in relatively simple systems will allow theoretical dynamical models to   be tested before applying them to more complicated problems in the domain   of collision and photodissociation dynamics.  Practical applications   include a better understanding of chemical vapor deposition processes",
