 "awd_abstract_narration": "9709394  Reed  The Pacific Northwest has been subjected to a series of  crippling storms in late 1996 and early 1997.  A combination  of wind, ice, rain and snow have contributed to the shutdown  of the region's lifelines in transportation, communications  and electric power.  Flooding and mudslides associated with  the storm's aftermath are still underway.  This series of  events presents a unique opportunity to gather data for  investigation of lifeline systems failures.  The primary  objective of this work is to analyze the chain of events  involving power and other systems failures, through detailed  investigations of the following: meteorological conditions  and chronology; local utility data from Puget Power, Seattle  City Light and others; collection of data in the field by  the principal investigator, graduate research assistant and  others; and reports of the news media.  It is also planned  to establish a website asking for data from the greater  community as well.  Another objective is to develop  recommendations for damage mitigation and increased system  robustness with the goal of reducing losses.  ***",
