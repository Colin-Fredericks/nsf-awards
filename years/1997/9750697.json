 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and DSP hardware are extremely important in many areas of industry.  The use of these applications is expanding rapidly throughout the world, creating an extraordinary demand for professionals well versed in this technology.  Recent efforts in the College of Engineering have resulted in introducing a new hands-on project course that focuses on DSP hardware and applications.  The course material emphasizes the use of Application-Specific Integrated Chips in standard kits, manufactured by Texas Instruments.  It is extremely important that students know about these state-of-the-art DSP processors, which can be used in real-time applications.    This project addresses the resources needed for introducing DSP hardware and their real-time applications in the B.S.E.E. program.  This DSP course, with newly developed DSP experiments and projects, gives students hands-on experience.  Since these DSP tools are important and relatively easy to interface, they can be used to introduce first-year students to the design and application process of digital signal/image processing despite their lack of theoretical background in this subject.  The process involves analyzing a problem, making a decision on how to approach it, trying different design procedures and comparing the different outcomes.  This approach keeps the freshmen focused on their engineering major and helps in increasing overall retention.    The courses developed can be disseminated to departments that do not have a DSP hardware course.  Students also are encouraged to publish their research material in conference proceedings in signal processing, such as ICSPAT and ASEE.  *",
