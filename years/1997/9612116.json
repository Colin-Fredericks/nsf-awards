 "awd_abstract_narration": "Juang  9612116  This research is aimed at improving the engineer's ability  to predict earthquake-induced liquefaction hazards.  (Liquefaction is a serious form of soil failure resulting  from strong-ground shaking, typically associated with major  earthquakes, such as the 17 January 1995 earthquake in Kobe,  Japan.) It employs the fuzzy neural network methodology, an  emerging technology which can learn and adapt structured and  unstructured knowledge.    Historical data on field liquefaction performance, in terms  of causes and effects, is re-cataloged in a consistent  pattern usable by fuzzy neural networks. Uncertainty  associated with field performance data and the  interpretation of liquefaction hazards is handled through  the use of fuzzy sets, which allows for approximate and  continuous classification. Membership functions of fuzzy  soil and geological parameters are established through  consultation with experts in soil failure and fuzzy neural  network methodology. The collected data and expert opinions,  presented in a form usable by fuzzy neural networks, is then  used to generate trained neuro-fuzzy systems for predicting  liquefaction hazards.    It is expected that this research will result in a new  design methodology and procedure to predict earthquake-  induced liquefaction hazards using neuro-fuzzy systems.",
