 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Michigan-Dearborn seeks funding for equipping a student-tutor and technology- based Mathematics Learning Center (MLC).  The equipment requested includes computer hardware and related software and audio-visual workstations.  Creation of this new facility is proposed for the purpose of improving access to the mathematics program for students at three levels (I) the freshman remedial level (II) the freshman-sophomore calculus sequence level (III) the junior-senior concentrators' program level, with emphasis on nonconcentrators.  Existing data show wide discrepancies, in courses at these three levels having a specified prerequisite course, between students who completed the prerequisite course at UM-D and those who did not.  The MLC will facilitate access to the mathematics program for large numbers of students who currently experience difficulty in joining a structured sequence of mathematics courses at a stage other than the beginning.         This proposal has the endorsement of the Department Executive Committee.  More than half the full-time faculty in the Department have contributed actively to its formulation.  The MLC Committee chair, the principal investigator in this proposal, is the department chair.  It also has the enthusiastic support of central administration, demonstrated through a number of grants, including a recent $12,000 salary grant for a program development pilot project, currently under way   *",
