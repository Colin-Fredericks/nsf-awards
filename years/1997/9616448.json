 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ingush grammar, dictionary, and texts    Ingush is a language of the Northeast Caucasian (or  Nakh-Daghestanian) language family of the northern Caucasus in  Russia.  It is closely related to Chechen, with some mutual  intelligibility.  There is no accurate or complete description of  Ingush; there is an Ingush-Russian wordlist but no dictionary; no  way for Ingush to learn English except through the intermediary  of Russian; and no way at all for an English speaker (or any  other foreigner) to learn Ingush.  The present Russian-based  orthography so misrepresents the sounds of the language that even  if an an otherwise excellent dictionary of the language did exist  it would be near-useless for learning or interpreting the  language.            The project will produce the needed descriptive materials  and make the importance and interest of Ingush better known to  the world through scientific linguistic publications.  It will  produce a full-scale descriptive grammar, a bilingual  Ingush-English, English-Ingush dictionary, and a set of texts, as  well as several typological, theoretical, and historical  publications.  The grammar will be a full, descriptively and  typologically sophisticated reference grammar of Ingush.  The  PI's pilot work has produced an all-ASCII phonemic transcription  system in Latin script, which would also make a serviceable  practical orthography, and project materials will use this  system.  The dictionary will contain full information on grammar  (inflectional paradigms, case government, etc.), pronunciation,  usage, and etymology.  A networked electronic database version of  the dictionary, continuously updated, will serve the university  users; hard copies (preliminary pocket dictionary printout, then  full published version) will serve the Ingush community,  journalists, and others.         Benefits will include improved problem sets and other  materials for undergraduate courses (in linguistics and in  courses on post-Soviet nationalities, Eurasian  history, etc.),  student training and visibility, description of an important  language, improved awareness of the Ingush language and culture  among American and European linguists, access to English for  Ingush speakers and vice versa, and testing and dissemination of  the proposed practical orthography.  The lexical database will be  directly applicable to future work on closely related Chechen.",
