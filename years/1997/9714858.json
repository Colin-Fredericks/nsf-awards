Crouse, Dames & Moore    The strong ground shaking recorded at the Jensen Filtration  Plant during the 1994 Northridge earthquake sequence  (mainshock and aftershocks) offers a unique opportunity to  study soil nonlinearity.    Two accelerographs stations close together at the Jensen  Filtration Plant in California recorded the earthquake  motions; one station was situated over moderately stiff  soil, the other on very stiff soil. The character of the two  recordings -- which were quite different -- suggests that  nonlinear soil response could have been significant at the  moderately stiff soil site during the mainshock. However the  two buildings containing station accelerographs at this site  were also different, which raises the concern whether soil-  structure interaction affected the motions at one or both  stations. Thus the objective of this study is to investigate  the influence of soil-structure interaction on the  recordings.    Two Federal agencies are collaborating in the support of  this project: the US Geological Survey and the National  Science Foundation.",
