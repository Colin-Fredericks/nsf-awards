 "awd_abstract_narration": "Significant advances in the primary scientific disciplines have blurred the boundaries between biology, chemistry, and physics.  During this visiting professorship, Dr. Carleton will build on her chemical and physical expertise by gaining new biological capabilities.  By acquiring college-level teaching experience and establishing an interdisciplinary research program, she will make the transition from industry to academia to work at this exciting scientific interface.    Dr. Carleton will develop a new course in introductory physics, teaching physical concepts entirely through biological examples.  The course will focus on physical concepts most relevant to understanding biological organisms and most likely to engage biology students.    Dr. Carleton also will carry out research on the visual system of cichlid fishes from Lake Malawi, Africa.  These fishes have undergone an extraordinarily rapid radiation, which is thought to have been driven by sexual selection.  While visual communication plays a key role in cichlid mate choice, little is known about the spectral characteristics of the visual signals (male color patterns) or their reception (female visual spectral sensitivities).  The goals of the research are to interrelate the visual capabilities, the color patterns, and the photic environment to assess what role mate choice has played in generating the spectacular diversity of cichlid fishes.",
