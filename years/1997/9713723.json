 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to develop a finite algorithm and forecasting procedure for the determination of optimal decisions in the context of a non-stationary model that accurately reflects a future characterized by technological change.  In particular, research will be directed toward establishing both existence of, and a algorithm to discover, a finite planning horizon guaranteed to yield an optimal policy choice for today's decisions.  For the forecasting function, a hierarchical model will be developed that simplifies the task of data forecasting by decomposing the system being modeled into elementary components, each assumed to exhibit costs that grow by a constant proportion over time.   Selection of a planning horizon for non-stationary models has been in the past based upon tradition or engineering judgement.  When the horizon is myopic, the resulting decisions taken can be short-sighted and fail to properly position the firm for a future characterized by rapidly changing technology.  The overall goal of this research is to provide a rational framework that leads to a planning horizon choice that is far-sighted, leading to decisions undistorted by potential end-of-study effects.",
