 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation examines how resources, political structure, and collective values contribute to different styles of participation in environmental decision making in rural communities in the Czech Republic.  It uses several theoretical frameworks; resource mobilization, political opportunity structure, and framing, and hypothesizes that different levels and combinations of resources and opportunities are associated with specific types of political behavior: confrontation, institutional mechanisms, and silence.  It maintains that values, interests, and beliefs communicated in public presentations moderate the predicted relationships.  The fieldwork uses survey and case study methods.  Employees of the Institute for Public Opinion Research in the Czech Republic will be trained and conduct the interviews.  Data bases and archival sources will be used to address relevant demographic variables and supplement information collected in the survey.  The information sources will be supplemented by qualitative fieldwork, providing a series of comparative case studies of proposed developments in locations where community members had different reactions to similar proposals.  The dissertation should contribute to social theory and public policy, by providing a basis for refining the structure of institutions and political processes in order to facilitate community participation.",
