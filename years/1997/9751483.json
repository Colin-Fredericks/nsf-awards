 "awd_abstract_narration": "As analytical instrumentation becomes more sophisticated yet more routine, college raduates from a variety of disciplines need to become familiar with available methods of chemical analysis in their respective fields. This not only includes chemistry graduates, but also those in other fields such as agriculture, forensics, etc. This work proposes the acquisition of a basic gas chomatograph/mass spectrometer system to be used across these discipline boundaries. Though the major use of the equipment is in the chemistry curriculum, there are also substantial components proposed in the agricultural science and criminal justice areas. ln addition to the standard uses of this instrumentation in the chemical curriculum, it will be used in agriculture courses in topic areas such as pesticide analysis and tracking of 15N for nitrogen balance concerns. In the area oi criminal justice, the instrument will be used in a criminalistics course concerned with drug analysis, identification of arson accelerants, and a variety of other topics. Though students are required to cross disciplines in their educational process, there is no similar requirement for the instructors of those courses. The addition of this instrumentation and its interdisciplinary use will help open the communication channels between these particular disciplines on campus and will likely lead to enhanced cooperation and a strengthening of undergraduate education.  *",
