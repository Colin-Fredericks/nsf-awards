 "awd_abstract_narration": "9711226  Yu  The proposed research is directed at the chain dynamics on  surfaces of water, polymer covered glasses and silicon  wafers in order to investigate the influence of confined  geometries on the chain motions.  In addition, interest is  focused on the chain diffusion in highly interacting systems  wherein the diffusants are known to impact on rheology of  the entire system even when they are present as minor  components.  With the interfacial dynamic techniques of  surface fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, surface  quasielectric light scattering, in-plane steady shear  viscosity by canal flow, in conjunction with the interfacial  static techniques of atomic force microscopy, x-ray photon  spectroscopy, neutron reflectivity and spectroscopic  elllipsometry, the PI will examine 1) polyelectrolyte  diffusion on functionalized glass surfaces, 2) polymer  monolayer shear viscosity and dilational viscoelasticity at  the air/water interface, 3) polymer diffusion as a function  of film thickness, and 4) polyelectrolyte diffusion on  planar surfaces consisting of polar heads of surfactant  molecules.  %%%  The purposes of the proposed research are to come up with  better materials design methods covering a wide range of  advanced organic materials that are used in many different  applications such as in artificial organs and implants, all  spill confinement materials, drug delivery devices, and  lubricants.  This study is at the molecular level.  ***",
