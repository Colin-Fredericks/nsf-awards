 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program provides support to Dr. Thomas R. Cundari, Chemistry Department,   University of Memphis, for continued development of computational   approaches to modeling the bonding and reactivity of inorganic and   organometallic complexes.  Molecular mechanics strategies, which are less   computationally intensive, will be applied to transition metal complexes,   particularly to develop a force field to efficiently and accurately   predict geometries.  Three specific areas will be emphasized:  methane   activation by mercury complexes, multiply bonded transition metal   complexes, and molecular mechanics of biochemical and catalytic   intermediates.  The mercury system differs from more usual high- or   low-valent oxidation methods and the electronic details of the activation   process are not well understood.  Transition metals that participate in   multiple bonding to heavier main group elements have potential in   advanced materials and in catalysis, and more efficient methods for   modeling the chemistry of these systems will be developed.  Describing the electronic properties of molecules containing transition   metals and a large number of atoms is a computational challenge, and it   is particularly difficult to develop effective methods for modeling their   dynamical behavior or reactivity with other molecules.  Dr. Cundari will   use new and efficient computational approaches for describing these   molecules and their changes during important catalytic reactions.",
