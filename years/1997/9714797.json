The Purdue University research site of the I/UCRC for Software Engineering and the Duke University research site of the I/UCRC for Advanced Computing and Communication will collaborate on the project \"Architecture-Based Estimation of Software Reliability.\"    The Purdue research site will:  1.) assess the value of both simulation and execution based approaches to software reliability, 2.) investigate the accuracy of reliability estimates and   3.) investigate the use of interface mutation for the estimation of interface reliability.  The Duke University research site will:  1.) investigate the combined coverage and time-based approach for the estimation of component and application reliability and also 2.) investigate dependency modeling for inter- and intra- component dependencies.  Both research sites will work together with the same large commercial system in the second year of the project.",
