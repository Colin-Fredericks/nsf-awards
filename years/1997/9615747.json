 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conceiving society as a complex nonlinear system of interacting individuals, dynamic social impact theory explores how individual experience and social influence lead to the regional differentiation and temporal evolution of all forms of culture (including scientific knowledge). Changes in the attributes (e.g. beliefs, practices, theories) of spatially-distributed individuals resulting from the interactive, reciprocal, and recursive operation of social influence processes can be modeled through computer simulation, using dynamic social impact theory, a simple but very general model of social influence. Surprisingly, several macro-level phenomena can be predicted to emerge from the operation of these micro-level processes, including a consolidation with reduced diversity, a clustering into spatially coherent subgroups, a correlation of initially unrelated positions on different issues, and often, a continuing diversity, as minority clusters protect each other from exposure to outside influence. Empirical research with people interacting in electronic mail networks, in lecture halls, and in dormitories will test these predictions and extend them to new arenas. This research will contribute to understanding the complex interaction between individual psychological processes and social outcomes in groups ranging in size from families and other small groups to organizations, communities, scientific disciplines, and even nations. Concepts and procedures developed in this research should be applicable to understanding the historical development   of regional and disciplinary differences in customs, values, and beliefs, both constructive and maladaptive, and such elusive phenomena as fads, social movements, consumer confidence, national character, and public opinion. The research will also have implications for predicting both positive and negative consequences of the increasing use of electronic communication in workgroups and society.",
