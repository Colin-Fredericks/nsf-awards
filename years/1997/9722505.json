 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one-year award supports US-UK cooperative research on engineering of biomaterials   between Robert Latour of Clemson University and Larry Hench of Imperial College,   London, United Kingdom.  The objective of the research is to investigate model protein-  surface adsorption behavior.  The investigators will study the fundamental mechanisms   governing protein adsorption at the three basic levels of protein structure:  primary (amino   acid sequence), secondary (configuration of molecular chains in helices, sheets, and   loops), and tertiary (organization of secondary structures into the actual protein structure).    Following the implantation of a biomaterial into the body, proteins rapidly adsorb onto the   implant material's surface.  Biologic response and the body's reaction to the implanted   material are controlled by cellular reactions to this adsorbed protein layer.  This project   will advance our understanding of the mechanism controlling protein adsorption and   adsorbed protein conformation and contribute toward the long-range goal of designing   implant surfaces for controlled biologic response.  It takes advantage of British expertise   in biomaterials and protein sequencing at Imperial College and at the Interdisciplinary   Research Center in Biomedical Materials at the University of London.",
