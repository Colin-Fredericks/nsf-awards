 "awd_abstract_narration": "Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) has emerged as a leading technique for wide are networking.  The world's telephone companies are well on their way to total conversion to ATM which is expected to take about 25 years.  Utilizing a small 53-byte cell structure, ATM enables effective communication between a large variety of broadband technologies that are currently evolving.    Accordingly, there is strong interest in formulating a switching architecture suitable for ATM-based wide area network, for which several studies can be found in the literature.  Often, these studies reported specific switching architectures along with performance data such as throughput and delay, but little in the way to indicate their effectiveness as large, wide area switches.    This project entails comprehensive investigation in developing a framework for wide area ATM switching.  Based on the extensive experiences derived from our recent prototyping effort for the Washington University Multi-Channel Switch (WUMCS), we incorporate several important technological constraints in the investigation of the characteristics of wide area switches, such as scalability, synchronization, high performance, fault tolerance, fairness, and modularity.    Use of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) is necessary in order to provide the extremely high clocking and data transfer rates needed in wide area switches.  The number of integrated circuit (IC) chips in a switch translates directly to the cost and implementation complexity.  We attempt to minimize the IC count in the switch by implementing each switch module with the maximum possible throughput in a single IC.  Significant effort is devoted to the investigation of various options in the design of switch modules that result in the maximum possible throughput, while taking into consideration constraints associated with VLSI such as die size, electrical propagation delay, power dissipation, and pin limitation.  An important goal of the proposed work is to determine the VLSI chip limi ts of various switching architectures in terms of maximum throughput, maximum number of input/output channels, and maximum achievable channel speed, when implemented in a single IC.    Since any realistic wide area switch requires throughput that is not achievable in a single IC, we investigate methodologies of scaling up the switch by interconnecting switch modules.  We explicate the benefits to a wide area switch of integrating multi-channel switching which balances loads across the switch modules in a switch.    In the project , we develop switch architectures which are optimized for VLSI implementation, and conduct comprehensive analytical studies on their efficacy under varying traffic and network conditions.    In addition, there will be a significant amount of implementation.  The proposed implementation work will comprise of:      * Design and development of switch ICs  * System board construction  * Software controller development  * Demonstration testbed development     The first part of the implementation work will be the definition of the functional requirements for the switching system, followed by the design specifications for the switch ICs and the software controller.  IC design will be the first actual electronic design step.  We will most likely employ a  schematic capture process for the IC design, utilizing VHDL mostly for the functional and logical verification.    We will utilize a conservative CMOS technology from a reputable foundry.  The estimated IC size for switch  module is 150 square milli meters, and the IC will require about 350 pins and consume 1.5 watts.  We expect that the system board will be 12 inches by 16 inches in dimension, implement the line interface, timing, switching, and header translation functions for 10 giga bits per second throughput.    By the conclusion of this project, we expect to have created a promising methodology for guiding the development of wide area ATM switches.  Our overall goal is to suggest methods to alleviate the size and speed l imitation of current electronic switches by proposing scalable and simple-to-implement architectures that can support very high bandwidth and a variety of traffic types seen in wide area networks.    Given the growing deployment of ATM in local area networks and the increased interest in using it in wide area networks, we believe that the proposed work is very timely and can serve to establish a framework for future work to follow.
