 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for support of a cooperative research by Dr. Hassan Nagib, Professor and Director of the Fluid Dynamics Research Center, Dr. Ahmed Naguib, Assistant Professor, both in the Department of  Mechanical, Materials and Aerospace Engineering at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, and Dr. Suhil M. Kiwan, Assistant Professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the  Jordan University of Science and Technology in Amman, Jordan.  The research aims at refining and extending an anisotropic turbulence model which has been recently developed at IIT.  Dr. Kiwan, who developed the initial model and demonstrated its efficient use, will work on the enhancement and refinement of the model and will calculate predictions from the model for experimental work being carried out by the IIT team.  The model is specifically targeted to the study of turbulence of non-equilibrium, complex flows, which are important in designing aerodynamic vehicles, gas turbines, and flows in pipes with complex geometry.  Scope:  This research project will be useful in promoting the development of modeling of turbulence in flows, for accurate design calculations in many engineering applications.  It involves US and Jordanian scientists with complementary expertise and laboratory facilities, in the field of aeronautical engineering,  at the two participating universities.  The project involves two junior scientists, Dr. Naguib of IIT and Dr. Kiwan of JUST, both of whom received their Ph.D.'s recently.  This proposal meets INT objective of increasing U.S.-foreign collaboration in areas that benefit both sides, and in enhancing junior scientists' international experience.",
