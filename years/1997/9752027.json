 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Biotechnology Technicians for the Future\" is expanding and disseminating successful activities developed and implemented through \"An Advanced Biotechnology Education Partnership Program,\" funded through the ATE program (94-54555).  The overall goal of the project is the improvement of technical education in biotechnology.  It represents a collaborative effort among the Biotechnology Laboratory Technician Program at Madison Area Technical College, the University of Wisconsin Teacher Enhancement Program, and the industry-supported BioPharmaceutical Technology Center Institute.  Efforts-to-date include the development and dissemination of curriculum materials for technician training at the two-year associate degree level; teacher enhancement activities for associate degree instructors and high school teachers; and, school-to-work experiences for high school students.  Through this grant, these activities are being significantly enhanced through: (1) continuing technician curriculum development and dissemination, (2) expanding participation geographically through collaboration with other University of Wisconsin system campuses and other technical and community colleges in the state and in the Midwest region; (3) increasing participation by students and faaulty at all levels from middle school through baccalaureate programs; (4) offering opportunities for \"lifelong learning\" to technicians already employed; and, (5) increasing the participation of qualified women, minorities and persons with disabilities.  This partnership, supported by an extended network of collaborators, is poised to effectively meet the challenge of recruiting, training and providing continuing education for employees so critical to the continued success of the biotechnology industry, offering the Wisconsin Model for replication.   *",
