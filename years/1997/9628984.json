 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9628984  Sutherland  This effort is focused on research related to environmental issues associated with machining processes.  The research emphasizes characterizing the role of cutting fluids in machining with the goal of fluid reduction/elimination.  In order to eliminate, or in the short term reduce the environmental impact of cutting fluids, a better understanding of the role and function of cutting fluids is required, including the effects of fluid concentration, flow rate, pressure, and point of application.  One negative aspect of cutting fluid use is mist formation.  Research to characterize the mechanisms associated with mist formation is being undertaken.  The effects of cutting fluids in terms of heat transfer and lubrication are also being examined.  A teaching effort is also underway that includes the development of courses in environmentally conscious manufacturing.",
