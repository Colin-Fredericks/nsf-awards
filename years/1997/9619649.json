 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multi-disciplinary research project will investigate,  apply, and evaluate new computer graphics tools for  understanding vector- and second-order tensor-valued volume  data.  The efficacy of the tools will be evaluated by the  extent to which they generate insight into several specific  physical phenomena: fully-developed turbulent flow, the  progression of disease in a mouse analogue of multiple  sclerosis, and the neonatal development of the mouse brain.  The application of the new techniques and collaboration with  researchers in other fields provides the opportunity to  validate the techniques and ensure that they are responsive  in addressing the scientific problems.    The techniques will be developed using a painting metaphor.  For centuries artists have used a divide-and-conquer  approach to creating paintings, representing different  aspects of a scene in different layers of paint.  In  addition, artists use brush strokes, with their many  characteristics of texture, size, shape, color, and opacity,  to represent important features of a scene on a canvas,  depicting the essence of the scene and eliminating  unnecessary detail.  Both techniques, and the collective  artistic experience in using them, can be applied to  computer graphics in the context of displaying volume data.  Techniques for understanding vector-valued and tensor-valued  volume data stand to benefit particularly, because volumes  contain so much information and because tensor and vector  values have many relevant, interdependent aspects.  Existing  techniques are limited in their ability to abstract the data  effectively and to display the many relevant aspects of the  data simultaneously, but the new techniques will address  both of these problems.  As a result, they will be more  effective in generating insight into the physical phenomena  measured as well as in communicating the insight.  Because  the techniques will be developed with application to three  specific problems in two disciplines, they are likely t o  have broader application.",
