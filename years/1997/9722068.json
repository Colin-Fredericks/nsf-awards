 "awd_abstract_narration": "A variety of general relativistic systems will be studied  using computational techniques: research will focus on  critical phenomena in gravitational collapse, black hole  dynamics, and development of software infrastructure to  support general large-scale computations in numerical  relativity and other fields.  The studies of black-hole critical phenomena will involve  time-dependent computations in l, 2 and 3 spatial  dimensions.  The 1-d calculations will be used to  investigate the nature of critical phenomena in perfect  fluid and multi-scalar collapse as well as the stability of  various spherically-symmetric critical solutions in the  presence of other matter fields.  A new adaptive,  axisymmetric general relativistic code (including rotation)  will be constructed and used to study critical phenomena in  axisymmetry.  The code will incorporate couplings to scalar  and electromagnetic fields and will be used to search for  new critical solutions, to answer important questions  concerning the stability of spherically-symmetric critical  solutions to non-spherical perturbations, and to investigate  the role of angular momentum in critical collapse.  Preliminary studies of critical behaviour in a fully 3-  dimensional context will also be undertaken in collaboration  with other researchers involved in the Binary Black Hole  Grand Challenge effort.  Research on black hole dynamics will focus on the issue of  determining coordinate systems appropriate for the  simulation of general black hole encounters.  Black hole  excising techniques, in which the computational domain is  constructed to roughly coincide with those regions of  spacetime which lie outside of event horizons, will be  further developed and used in conjunction with these  coordinate systems.  Adaptive mesh algorithms for use on massively parallel  hardware will be implemented and rigorously tested.  This  work will be initially performed in the context of the  relatively simple model of non-relativistic boson stars  interacting through the Newtonian gravitational field.  Work  will also continue on the construction of rapid prototyping  environments for the solution of general time-dependent  finite-difference systems, and on the development of  software for the analysis and visualization of the output  from large scale computations.",
