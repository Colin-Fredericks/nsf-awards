 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robertson  9701317    This award will provide funds to develop several projects in structural graph theory associated with the graph minor relation.  Much of the work involves ongoing joint projects with Paul Seymour, Robin Thomas and others; and the research of graduate students supervised by the principal investigator.  The main topics of this proposal are summarized below.  These topics  cover a large part of graph structure theory as it relates to the graph minor inclusion relation.  In fact, each topic contains major problems, often well known and difficult, and so significant progress in any direction is likely  to absorb a great deal of time.  There are at present serious attacks (which our group welcomes) being made on many of these problems elsewhere in the graph theoretical community. The main topics are as follows:   (1) To continue the attack on the open problems in explicit finite graph minor structure.  (2) To continue the attack on the open problems in general finite graph minor structure.  (3) To attack coloring problems made accessible by the improved proof of the four-color theorem and structure theory results.  (4) To continue to study connectivity at the levels exhibited by the graphs of the Platonic solids and the toroidal regular lattices; in particular chains of minors or types of minors at a given level.  (5) To continue to detelop surface embedding structure theory by studying questions about how nontrivial closed curves on the surface meet an embedded graph.  (6) To extend graph minor theory to binary matroids.   (7) To attack some problems in algorithmical graph theory and matroid theory.          This research is in the general area of Combinatorics. One of the goals of  Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections  of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely  important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the d esign of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research.",
