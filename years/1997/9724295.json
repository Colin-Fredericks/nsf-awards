 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF) Program and the Major  Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will   assist the Department of Chemistry at University of Iowa to acquire a 400   MHz nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment will   enhance research in a number of areas including the following: (1)   synthetic fluoroolefin chemistry, (2) novel biologically active natural   products from fungi, (3) organometallic chemistry and reactivity of   unusual iron porphyrins, (4) synthetic chemistry and biology of novel   nucleosides, nucleotides and nucleic acids, and (5) synthesis of   phosphonates and bis-phosphonates.   Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.",
