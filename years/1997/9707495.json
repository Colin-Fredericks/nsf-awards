 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed experimental methods will allow: (1) the use of novel laser   flash techniques for unprecedented levels of control of polymerizing   systems; (2) measurement of concentrations of free radical polymerization   living chains over a broad range of conditions by a multitechnique   approach; (3) measurement of molecular weight distributions of living   chains by a novel `photocopying` technique; (4) characterization of   structures and dynamics of the radical end-groups; and (5) controlled   generation of well-characterized monodisperse macroradicals to test   fundamentals of polymer reaction kinetics by specific syntheses of   monodisperse macroradicals.  A range of theoretical predictions will thus   be tested by these experiments.    With this award, the Organic Dynamics Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities are supporting the research of Drs. Nicholas   J. Turro and Ben O'Shaughnessy of the Department of Chemistry at Columbia   University.  The project is an interdisciplinary joint   experimental-theoretical effort with an object of obtaining a mechanistic   understanding of  free radical polymerization and the closely associated   phenomena of interpolymeric reactions.  The expertise of a photochemist   and a theoretical polymer physicist will unite to allow theory to proceed   in close collaboration with experiments employing novel methods to   measure various fundamental properties of free radical prolymerization   and other reacting polymer systems.",
