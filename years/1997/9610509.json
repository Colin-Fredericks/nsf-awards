The equipment will be used for several research projects.  The main research project to be supported from  this equipment grant is:    A Neural/Fuzzy Approach for Motor Incipient Fault Detection.    There are also several research projects which can benefit from this research equipment grant.  The equipment can provide actual data for the Fast Prototype Motor Simulation System project.  The IR camera will be used for research in image processing by adding an additional band to the multispectral images used in restoration work.  Projects entitled Digital Color Camera Design and Nonlinear Processing of Color Images will benefit from the proposed equipment.    The College of Engineering and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University have agreed to jointly provide  33%  of the total project cost as matching fund for this equipment grant                  A-t",
