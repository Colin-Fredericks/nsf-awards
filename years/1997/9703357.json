 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  CTS-9703357    This is an investigation of non-agglomerated nanoparticle productiol in low-pressure flat flames.  Production in low-pressure flames of a target group of materials including yttrium-stabilized zirconia, silicon oxynitride, alumina, zirconia, titania, and tungsten oxide, is demonstrated.  Parametric studies assess the effects of process conditions on the size, quantity, and morphology of the synthesized nanopowders.  Modeling and diagnostic work centers on a single nanopowder species with the goal of predicting particle sized, production rate, and degree of agglomeration given system process inputs.  A gas-phase chemical mechanism is included in the model along with mechanisms for particles formation and growth.  Multispecies laser-induced fluorescence is applied to the flames to quantify the gas-phase chemical environment, while laser absorption scattering measurements are probe sampling are used to quantify the particle size- and number-density fields.  Several baseline production conditions are characterized and modeled and the model is refined to match the experimental observations,  Analogous models are then produced for different powder species.    This work demonstrates a technique for high-rate, inherently scalable production of a series of industrially significant non-agglomerated nanopowders.  Process models for nanopowder production and developed.  Such models extend present understanding of gas-phase particle synthesis and allow computational optimization mf the synthesis process.  For scale-up operations, the models help in identifying appropriate process diagnostics for industrial reactors and enable development of closed-loop control algorithms.",
