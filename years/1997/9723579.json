 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723579  Ketchum      Potassium ion channels catalyze the transport of K+ across  cellular membranes.  These proteins are part of a large family of  cation transporters found in all three domains of life,  Eubacteria, Archae, and Eukarya.  All members of this family have  a common structural motif (M1-P-M2) consisting of a highly  conserved pore-region (P) bordered by two membrane-spanning  helices (M1,M2).  Sub-families are distinguished by the presence  of additional membrane segments, multiple M1-P-M2 motifs, or  associated regulatory domains.   These differences indicate that  both intragenic duplication and domain fusion have played a role  in the evolution of ion channel genes.   The first complete  sequence of an Archeon, Methanococcus jannaschii, was recently  published.  Three open reading frames (MJ0138, MJ0139 and MJ1357)  were identified which encoded peptide segments similar to the P-  region of K+ selective channels found in eukaryotes.  MJ0138 and  MJ1357 have a predicted membrane topology similar to inward  rectifier channels with two transmembrane segments.  In contrast  MJ0139 is analogous to Shaker K channels with 5 hydrophobic  regions.  MJ0139 is immediately followed by MJ0138 on the  chromosome. These proteins are translated in the same reading  frame and separated by 3 nucleotides of a stop codon.  Their M1-P-  M2 sequences display 65% identity suggesting that the adjacent  pore motifs originated from an incomplete, intragenic  duplication.  The fusion of these two would result in a coding  sequence similar to that of tandem pore channels found in  eukaryotes.  Thus these Archaeon sequences may represent an  intermediate stage in K+ channel evolution.  This research will examine the transport activity of the three  channel proteins from M. jannaschii, and determine whether these  proteins function in a similar way as the channels found in  eukaryotes.  Each protein will be put in two experimental systems  where K+ transport can be monitored: budding yeast cell and  Xenpo us oocytes.  A comprehensive computer analysis of K+ channel  genes  from eubacteria, Archaea and Eukarya will be done, to  identify conserved structural motifs and  establish the evolution  of this gene family.  %%%  The research in this grant will study the function and genetic  sequence of a new type of K+ channel in Archaea, and compare this  to similar studies in yeast and eukaryotes.  These studies will  provide important information on the evolution and function of  these channels which are important for the transport of K and the  maintenance of ionic charge in cells.  ***",
