 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences   Directorate, Professor Louis A. Carpino, of the Department of Chemistry   at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, develops novel techniques   for the solution and solid phase synthesis of peptides and peptide   segments.  Methods for the synthesis of longer peptides and small   proteins, whether by stepwise solution or solid phase techniques or by   segment condensation methods, are not wholly satisfactory, suffering from   problems in the coupling steps and the unavailability or instability of   suitably protected histidine and arginine residues.  Professor Carpino   explores new derivatives of these amino acids, permitting their   incorporation and deprotection in automated coupling schemes.    Solubilizing systems such as peptide bond protection and poly(ethylene   glycol) residues are examined for their ability to provide good   solubility of growing peptides in comparatively non-polar solvents and   for their applicability for the coupling of peptide segments by various   techniques.  Optimized techniques are then applied to the synthesis of   longer peptides.  With continued growth in the demand for polypeptides for a variety of   applications, including the study of fundamental biological and   biochemical phenomena and the development of new medical diagnostics and   therapeutic agents, new techniques for the rapid, efficient, universally   general, and, ideally, automated synthesis of polypeptides are required.    Professor Louis A. Carpino, of the Department of Chemistry at the   University of Massachusetts, Amherst, with the support of the Organic   Synthesis Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the   Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, develops such techniques.    His studies focus both on the design of suitable building blocks to   allow the automated sequential construction of peptides and on the   development of new techniques for the construction of peptides.  The   latter techniques center on the highly effective use of solid `supports`   as platforms for peptide synthesis and extend the basic premises of such   solid-phase peptide synthesis to homogeneous solutions in organic   solvents through the use of soluble polymeric materials as the   construction scaffold.",
