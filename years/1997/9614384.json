The time  series of volcanic aerosol and tephra deposition available in  high-resolution, bi-polar ice cores is the most reliable means of  developing continuous and lengthy records of past volcanic  activity and assessing the climatic and environmental impact of  global volcanism.  The volcanic records from the Siple Dome ice  core, initial ice core in the West Antarctica Ice Core Program  (WAISCORES), and the Taylor Dome core, recently collected from  the Transantarctic Mountains, will provide the Southern  Hemisphere component of this record.  These results will  complement the lengthy GISP2 volcanic record from Greenland.  Annual resolution should be available in the Siple Dome core for  the Holocene resulting in the longest volcanic record with such  resolution from Antarctica.  Total length of record thought to be  available from the Siple Dome core is 80,000 years whereas that  for the Taylor Dome core is probably over 100,000 years.  Although temporal resolution will be much coarser in the glacial  portion of the Siple Dome core and in much of the Taylor Dome  core, correlations and comparisons of the volcanic records from  those cores with those from the GISP2 core are still possible.  Evaluation of the timing of the volcanic signals in relationship  to the record of changing climatic conditions available in these  ice cores provides critical information on the climate forcing  capabilities of global volcanism on decadal to century time  scales through the Holocene.    The key to developing a reliable chronology of past volcanism  from the Siple Dome core is the simultaneous and continuous  measurement of SO42-, a direct measure of the volcanic H2SO4  produced from the eruption, and the search for tephra in the same  subsamples over the entire length of the core.  The  glaciochemical record will be available through other   investigators in the Siple Dome project.  The glaciochemical  record for the Taylor Dome core is presently available.  Locating  tephra and identifying the source of the volcanic glass through  both optical microscope and microbeam (both electron and ion  microprobes) analyses will verify the source of the chemical  signal and help differentiate between equatorial and local  eruptions.  Comparisons with the GISP2 volcanic record will  assist in achieving this goal.  This multiparameter approach to  deciphering the volcanic record will improve on our understanding  of the influence of volcanism on climate both  interhemispherically and intrahemispherically.  The correlation  of tephra found in these cores with that found in marine  sediments and in the terrestrial record will expand on the  chronology of global volcanism and improve the correlation among  ice core, marine, and terrestrial proxy climatic records.  Visible tephra layers that should exist in the Siple Dome core  and do exist in the Taylor Dome core will provide additional  absolute time lines for possible correlations between the two  cores, among previously collected Antarctica ice cores and with  tephra studies in blue ice areas of Western Antarctica and the  Transantarctic Mountains.",
