Price, Professor of Political Science at the  University of California, Berkeley, to do field research in  South Africa.  This project will study the development of  South Africa's taxation system and how it has been  influenced by the political issues of national identity and  state-building.  South Africa's tax regime is unique among  developing countries with similar histories, which typically  raise no more than five percent of their Gross Domestic  Product (GDP) as revenue.  Developed as a two-part taxation  system when the country was racially divided, the system was  raising fifteen percent of the GDP as government revenue  from taxes on income and profits by the 1980's.  It is  hypothesized that the politicization of a national identity  makes a significant, measurable impact on the establishment  and performance of a state's tax institutions, while also  influencing a group's propensity to make sacrifices in the  form of taxation.  By considering taxation as a historical  component of state-building, Mr. Lieberman will explore the  theoretical links between critical periods in South Africa's  history and the resultant impact on its economic  institutions.  Additionally, Mr. Lieberman expects that to  find that the post-apartheid era is leading to a new  definition of national identity, which could dramatically  alter South Africa's taxation institutions and the ways in  which revenue is collected.  The research plan will consist  of in-depth interviews, a survey, and an analysis of  archival records.  Staff members at the Institute for  Democracy in South Africa will collaborate with Mr.  Lieberman on this project.  He will also collaborate with  members of the Department of Political Science at the  University of Cape Town, where he will be a Visiting Fellow.    This study will make an important contribution to the  understanding abo ut the structure of taxation in a  developing country.  This grant also provides support to  enable a promising student to establish a strong,  independent research career.    ***",
