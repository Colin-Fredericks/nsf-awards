Two applications were determined to be  ineligible and were returned to the applicants as  inappropriate.   One application was withdrawn by the  applicant who received funding from another Federal agency.    A panel of experts from fields relevant to the fields of  biology supported by the Directorate for Biological Sciences  was convened for a meeting in Arlington, VA on March 31 and  April 1, 1997.  Prior to the meeting panelists had received  copies of all applications and written preliminary reviews  on 12 applications.  Each application was reviewed by 3  panelists using the review criteria outlined in the program  announcement, NSF 94-133.  Panelists were asked to assign a  preliminary rating of excellent, very good, or good to each  application.    After reading the references, the panelists discussed the  applications individually in random order and assigned each  one a final rating as follows:                Final Rating         # Applications                                                              Excellent                 7                E/VG                    5              Very Good                 9                Good                    7        The panel rated your application as excellent/very good.  It  is not possible to fund all applications with this rating.  In this application, there is an excellent link between the  planned fellowship activities and the applicant's career  goals.",
