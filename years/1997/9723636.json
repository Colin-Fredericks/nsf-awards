Environmental cues trigger a  variety of events within cells.  The concentration and  movements of calcium ions are essential regulators of many  of these cellular responses.  Proper control of  intracellular calcium is essential because at thigh levels  calcium can lead to cell damage or death. Calcium  accomplishes it effects through binding to specific proteins  such as calmodulin and calpain. Calmodulin, named for its  ability to bind calcium and to modulate the activity of  other cellular components, is an important mediator of  calcium signals and its mechanism of action is relatively  well understood.  The calpains are proteolytic enzymes that  are regulated by calcium binding.  Proteolytic enzymes  modify cellular proteins such that the target protein is  destroyed or is altered in its function. Calpains can modify  those proteins, called pumps or channels, that directly  allow calcium ion movement and therefore calpains may be  involved directly in helping cells to regulate calcium  signals.  Through its action on other key regulator proteins  and enzymes, calpains might also help to integrate cellular  responses that involve calcium with other events that do  not.  Although the activity of calpain is controlled by  calcium its action may be prevented by another protein  (calpastatin) that specifically inhibits these enzymes.  Although calpastatin does not bind calcium directly it binds  to calpain only when calpain has bound calcium.  Thus the  interactions between these two proteins is important in  regulating calpain function.  By comparison with calmodulin,  there is little known about how calcium regulates calpain  structure, function or its interactions with other proteins.  Thus the immediate goals for this proposal are to understand  more about the biochemical mechanisms that regulate calpain.  This project aims to answer two major questions: 1) how does  calcium binding  to calpain regulate the enzymatic activity?  2) can a calpastatin insensitive calpain be generated by  exploiting what is known about the interaction between  calpain and calpastatin?  An enzyme with this property will  be useful, in future studies, for determining the role of  calpains in cells. These goals will be accomplished through  techniques of protein chemistry and expression of  recombinant DNA molecules to generate modified enzymes or  enzyme fragments for study.  This knowledge will provide  information on the role of calpain in critical cellular  processes.  %%%        Calcium is important in the regulation of many essential  intracellular processes.  Many of the effecPts of calcium  occur after it binds to specific proteins.  One of these  proteins is calpain.  Calpains are proteolytic enzymes that  are regulated by calcium binding, and in turn modify other  cellular proteins in ways which often alter their function.  Little is known of the mechanism by which calcium modifies  calpain, and this project will study the biochemical  mechanisms that regulate calpain and the role of calcium in  these processes.  ***",
