 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California at Irvine Chemistry Outreach Program   directed by Professor James S. Nowick is being supported by the Special   Projects Office of the Chemistry Division for a three-year period of   transition from a pilot program to long-term funding from the private   sector.  The Chemistry Outreach Program aims to improve high school   students' interest in and knowledge of chemistry by sending teams of   graduate and undergraduate students to local high schools.  The   university students inspire the high school students by performing   chemical demonstrations and discussing chemistry, beginning with freshmen   students who are encouraged to enroll in chemistry classes.  The program,   which reaches about two thousand high school students per year at dozens   of Southern California high schools, will establish a web site for   dissemination of the instructional materials that it develops and for   propagation of this model program as a grassroots effort in educational   outreach.  The Chemistry Outreach Program is a university-based effort to improve   scientific literacy and inspire young people to pursue careers in science   through the vehicle of chemistry demonstrations and discussions in high   schools provided by undergraduate and graduate students from the   university.",
