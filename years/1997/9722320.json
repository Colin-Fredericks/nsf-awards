 "awd_abstract_narration": "deseree davisdeseree davis    The proposed research aims to develop instrumentation which  will improve the resolution of nuclear magnetic resonance  (NMR) microscopy by at least an order of magnitude to the (1-  2 m)3  range. Since mammalian cells are typically 5-10 m in  diameter, this advance would open up a whole range of  subcellular applications which are currently precluded.    The intrinsic advantages of NMR over other microscopic  techniques include the ability to provide full three-  dimensional information and its non-invasive character. NMR  microscopy not only gives spatial information, but can also  be used to determine chemical composition, proton mobility,  and molecular diffusion, the latter two measurements giving  information on the physical environment of the biological  molecules of interest. The major innovation in this research  will be the design and optimization of radiofrequency (RF)  microcoils of diameter 100-200 m, an order of magnitude less  than has previously been used in NMR microimaging  applications. In addition to the intrinsic increase in  signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per voxel for a given voxel  size, the use of small RF coils results in a lower  acquisition bandwidth and further SNR improvements over  larger coils. These RF coils will also allow the design and  construction of very small diameter, high strength magnetic  field gradients, which will be necessary to overcome  diffusion and susceptibility effects and achieve the desired  resolution. An integrated assembly of RF microcoil, magnetic  field gradients, and micropositioner will be constructed.  Filtered back projection (FBP) techniques will be used to  acquire the data, since these have an intrinsically higher  SNR than Fourier techniques, and require smaller gradients  for a given resolution.    The first experiments using the optimized imaging system  will be to determine experimentally the maximum possible  resolution by comparing competing theories of effects of  molecular diffusion, the lowest  detectable number of spins,  and the effects of phenomena such as edge enhancement at non-  permeable boundaries. These have not been rigorously studied  previously since the sensitivity of the radiofrequency coils  was not sufficiently high. Two major biological applications  of the research are proposed. First, high resolution  microimaging of excised spinal cord tissue. Non-invasive MRI  has shown that signal intensity changes are produced by both  spinal cord damage and subsequent regeneration. In order to  understand these changes fully, it is necessary to look at  the small structures within the cord, as opposed to a large  volume averaged signal intensity from the whole cord.  Second, we will use the microscopic radiofrequency and  gradient coils to determine the presently unknown physical  environment of protein-rich vesicles by two dimensional  diffusion-ordered spectroscopy, information which should  help to elucidate the action of certain neurotransmitters in  mammals.    The development of micro-NMR systems is an emerging area in  imaging which should be fully integrated into our academic  curriculum. Currently the applicant, together with his  colleagues, have developed a unique series of three courses  in magnetic resonance within the Department of Electrical  and Computer Engineering. The major educational thrust will  be to complete the integration of interactive computer based  learning into these three courses, combined with the  preparation of a laboratory based course on magnetic  resonance systems to accompany a graduate level lecture  series. The proposed research has many aspects which are  relevant to electrical engineering: high frequency modelling  and simulations, electrical circuit characterization, and  design optimization, as well as applications which are of  interest to the bioengineer. Indeed, since magnetic  resonance is not usually an active area for electrical  engineers, we anticipate that significant advances will be  made by the inclusion of faculty, underg raduate and graduate  researchers from this department. More than twenty students  within the department have already chosen this area for  undergraduate research and their Senior Design projects with  the applicant in the past two years.",
