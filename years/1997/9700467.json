 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with an in-depth analysis of  rotating mechanical systems. Such systems are modelled by  ordinary differential equations with periodically varying  coefficients. The models are very often high-dimensional,  possess non-linearities that cannot be neglected, and depend  on many widely varying design parameters. The point-mapping  based methodology used in this research combines the  advantages of analytical methods that allow qualitative  analysis and the ability of numerical  methods to analyze  high-order systems with parameters varying over a large  range. The point mapping approach results in an analytical  representation of discrete-time dynamics of the rotating  system. The equations for steady-state solutions, conditions  of stability and bifurcation of these solutions, and  sensitivity of the system's behavior to design parameters  are formulated in terms of closed-form algebraic equations.  The analytical formulation allows design tradeoffs to be  performed using computer algebra. The research includes  development and implementation of the theoretical and  computational aspects of the point mapping based  methodology, and study of important classes of rotating  systems. In each application, a detailed sensitivity and  design tradeoff analysis as a function of system parameters  is performed using high-speed computation algorithms.                                                         +\u2592+\u00ac                                                        \u00f3  \u00ac\u00f1\u00ab\u00ac^\u00e1\u00fa\u00fa\u00ac^\u00d1\u00bf\u00ab\u00f1    +\u2592+\u00ac                                                       \u00f3  \u00ac\u00f1\u00ab\u00ac^\u00e1\u00fa\u00fa\u00ac^\u00bd\u00bf\u2591     +\u2592+\u00ac",
