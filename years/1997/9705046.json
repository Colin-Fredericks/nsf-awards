 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705046  McMillan    This project focuses on issues of boundary stabilization/optimal control of   several linear and nonlinear dynamical systems on a bounded domain.  The   main goals of this study are the following:  (1)  To develop an abstract theory for the finite horizon indefinite cost    problems (including singular problems) for parabolic and   hyperbolic/Petrwoski partial differential equations (p.d.e.'s) with   nonsmoothing observation operators.  This result will be new even for   standard (positive definite) finite horizon cost problems.  In addition, we   would like to investigate conditions for solvability of certain differential   Riccati equations which are  related to certain nonlinear optimal control   problems.  (2)  Develop a minimax Riccati theory for indefinite cost problems, after   first developing the standard Riccati theory (i.e., the case where there are no   disturbances present in the system).  (3)  Verify various assumptions required by the minimax theory (which we   have developed previously) for various shell models.    The abstract problems that are being considered arise out of the   mathematical modeling of problems in mechanics and structural design.  In   particular, the focus is on large vibrating structures such as satellite dishes,   aircraft, antennae, etc.  By necessity, the modeling of the movement of these   structures results in systems of partial differential equations.  Ways will be   investigated in which to damp out (i.e., control) unwanted vibrations of   these structures. In addition, the project seeks to address the control of   vibrating structures in the presence of outside disturbances (e.g., external   forces on aircraft wings). The project's goal is to contribute in filling a large   gap in the literature on optimization problems for large flexible structures.",
