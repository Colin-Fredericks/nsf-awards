 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is a new family of  algorithms that has been recently developed  within the Computational Learning Theory  community. Algorithms in this family do  multiplicative updates to their parameters  instead of the usual additive updates  characteristic of the standard gradient  descent methods. The algorithms from the new  family have radically different behavior from  the algorithms of the gradient descent  family. The new family of algorithms is  particularly useful when the input dimension  is large and the best parameter setting is  ``sparse'' -- having only a few non-zero  parameters. In many simple settings, the new  family has proven loss bounds that grow only  logarithmically in the total number of  parameters when the best parameter setting  uses only a few parameters, whereas the  standard algorithms can easily be forced to  have loss proportional to the number of input  variables for the same targets. This  indicates that the new family of algorithms  is likely to be particularly effective in  settings where the input dimension is large  (such as in Information Retrieval) or where a  small number of inputs are expanded to a  large number of non-linear basis functions  over the original inputs. The goals of the  research are to extend the new family of  algorithms, quantify the qualitative  differences between the new family and  existing algorithms, and to demonstrate the  practical importance of the new family.***",
