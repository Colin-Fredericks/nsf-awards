 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science illiteracy is prevalent in our student population.  Although students have been exposed to sophisticated technology in their daily lives, they have a difficult time grasping abstract biological concepts.  They also lack the ability to collect, collate and analyze data.  The purpose of this proposal is to enhance laboratory experiments by creating a virtual laboratory.  Software in this laboratory will allow students to extend laboratory exercises to include variables not examined in their \"hands on\" experiments.  Computer simulations will be used to perform experiments requiring quantitative data analysis.  Students will have to \"collect\" collate and analyze their computer-simulated data.  Students will perform virtual experiments that are not currently included in the non-majors' biology laboratory because of time constraints or the lack of necessary equipment.    Computers with internet capability and commercially available software will be used to establish the virtual biology laboratory.  Software designed by faculty to meet our students' specific needs will be introduced in the future.  Internet access will be available for students to collaborate with other institutions in the design and implementation of three virtual experiments.    This project will influence nearly 2,000 students during the two year period of this study.  The project will increase students' understanding of biological concepts, increase critical thinking skills and stimulate the imagination and interest of our students.  This project will increase retention of students enrolled in this course and lead to an increase in overall science enrollment.  Results of this study will be disseminated through meeting presentations and in appropriate journal articles.",
