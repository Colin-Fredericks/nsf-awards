The FutureCar Challenge is a competition for undergraduate students teams to design and build a mid-size, production-ready vehicle which can get up to 80 miles per gallon while still maintaining the performance, safety, and affordability of existing cars.   This competition is sponsored by the Department of Energy and USCAR, a research venture between Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors.   Curriculum will be developed to incorporate this vehicle competition into undergraduate engineering curriculum that combines advanced automotive technology, business skills, problem-solving, marketing, management, teaming, and leadership.",
