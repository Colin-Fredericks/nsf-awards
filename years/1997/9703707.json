The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Geoffrey B. Parsons to work with Dr. Victor L.  J. Tybulewicz at the National Institute for Medical Research  in London, England.    Dr. Parsons proposes to study an innovative way of assessing  the role of a suspected participant, Syk tyrosine kinase, in  mouse B cell differentiation and signal transduction.  The  host lab of Dr. Tybulewizc has created transgenic mice that  lack Syk.  Using these mice will allow the study of Syk's  role in BCR (the antigen receptor of B cells) signaling as  well as more long-term tests of B cell function, such as  examination of the role of Syk in somatic hypermutation and  B cell memory. The experiments they have jointly developed  will shed light on how Syk functions in the mature B cell.  ***",
