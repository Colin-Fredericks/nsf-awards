 "awd_abstract_narration": "To reverse the historically poor preparation of many of California's elementary school teachers in science, and to increase the quality and quantity of science instruction in the state's elementary classrooms, California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), in collaboration with five local community colleges, will develop Contextual Coursework for Elementary Pre-Service Teachers (ConCEPT). Because most elementary teachers fulfill their science requirements at community colleges, ConCEPT will target prospective elementary teachers at CSUF and the community colleges (a pool of 3,500-4,500 students). ConCEPT will draw on existing exemplary curriculum materials to develop three 3-unit courses, including laboratory experience, designed to help future K-6 teachers understand science concepts, acquire science process skills and implement the K-6 National Science Education Standards. The courses will be cross-disciplinary, with a contextual approach to science and a hands-on, inquiry-based pedagogy. ConCEPT courses will be developed collaboratively during the first year and refined and piloted during the second year. ConCEPT's immediate impact will be to change the way future elementary teachers at the six participating institutions experience science. Within a few years, as newly credentialed teachers enter their own classrooms, ConCEPT will begin to affect the way California's elementary students learn about science as well. The ConCEPT courses will have application at any institution where future elementary teachers fulfill their general education science requirements and after successful field testing, will be disseminated to institutions throughout the U.S. Beyond the course design, ConCEPT will establish an innovative model for higher education collaborations generally and course development specifically, creating a new approach to articulation between community colleges and four-year institutions. Ultimately, it will help lay the foundation for general education science courses at institutions  across the country.",
