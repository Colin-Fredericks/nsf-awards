 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710789  Martinez-Miranda  Nanometer size particles or films of materials have structural, electrical and mechanical properties that differ from those of the bulk material, due to confinement effects and the presence of a large number of interfaces.  These materials have potential new applications in devices.  Their use as device elements depends on the careful control of the materials' properties, achieved through the careful control of the processing methods used to develop these materials.    Many methods are used to prepare nanoscale materials.  This proposal concentrates on the analysis of materials grown by solution chemistry, specifically using a non-aqueous, alcohol-based route known as the polyol method.  Scientists at the Naval Research Laboratory have used this method in the metallization of electronic ceramic substrates.  Little information exists about the process of metal precipitation on the substrate, and of the eventual process of nucleation and film growth.  Similarly, the structural evolution of the film during the deposition process is not known.    This proposal describes a collaborative effort to study the in-situ structural evolution of metal deposition on AIN substrates between the University of Maryland and the Naval Research Laboratory.  Film structure can be probed using diffraction methods.  The project consists of two activities: 1. the development of a deposition cell suitable for in-situ diffraction studies; 2. An in-situ combined grazing incidence asymmetric Bragg (GIAB) diffraction study and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) study of film evolution during deposition.  This study will examine the following issues: 1. the possible existence of predeposition nanometer size agglomerates; 2. the formation of (reaction) layers during the first stages of deposition; 3. metal deposit evolution.    These two activities combine expertise available at the University of Maryland (characterization) and at the Naval Research Laboratory.  The activities will expand the charac terization capabilities available at the University of Maryland as well as provide an increase understanding of how processing parameters affect film formation.  This project will impact other potential collaborations involving the solution-based deposition of magnetic multilayers and ceramic materials' films and particles.  ***",
