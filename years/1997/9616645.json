 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616645  Sholkovitz         One   of  the  tasks  facing  geochemists  interested   in  understanding how Earth's climate has changed over  time  is  the  discovery  and development of tools (paleo-proxies) for  deducing  what  past climates were like.  Paleo-proxies are generally  some  sort  of  paleontological (for example,  fossil  forminifera)  or  geochemical  measurement (for example, oxygen or carbon  isotopic  composition) that is assumed to relate to the climatic phenomenon  of  interest - temperature, salinity, oxygen, atmospheric  carbon  dioxide.  The problem is that the proxies themselves are  usually  not  the result of any one of these paleoclimatic conditions  and  thus  lead  to  equivocal interpretations about ancient  climatic  conditions.        In  this  project,  the  principal investigator  will  used  archived modern coral samples collected from various regions  for  which  there  is  also  an  extensive database  of  environmental  observations such as temperature, salinity, runoff hydrology, and  biology.   Since  rare earth elements (REE) are supplied  to  the  ocean  by  weathering  of rock exposures on  the  continents,  he  expects  to  see  the REE signal from river runoff  -  reflecting  rainfall conditions - preserved in the coral.  If successful,  he  would be able to extend this study to much older corals form  the  geologic  record  and  comparison with other  currently-available  paleoclimate  proxies.   The investigator anticipates  that  this  would  lead  to  the  development of  a  new  tool  for  studying  paleoclimate.  ***",
