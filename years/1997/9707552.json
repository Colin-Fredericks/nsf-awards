 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pigliucci  9707552         Molecular geneticists and physiologists working with the  model system Arabidopsis thaliana have achieved a detailed  mechanistic understanding of two distinct forms of phenotypic  plasticity: the response to light quality and the response to  photoperiod. These analyses have clearly established that there is  extensive overlap among the genes that regulate these two forms of  plasticity, raising questions about the evolutionary origins and  ecological implications of pleiotropy and genetic redundancy. The  PIs' understanding of these genetic details allows us to address a  complex question: how do plants integrate a suite of cues that  provide information about different aspects of multifactor  selective environments?         For annual plants, light quality serves as a specific and  reliable cue for present and imminent competition for light,  because encroaching competitors alter light quality (i.e., the  ratio of red to far-red light - R:FR). Similarly, in the temperate  regions where A. thaliana grows, the length of the photoperiod is  an indicator of seasonality. Can natural populations of A.  thaliana respond to selection on the ability to sense and respond  to light quality cues? How strong is the relationship, if any,  between the R:FR-mediatedplasticity syndrome,  andphotoperiod-mediated plasticity?         The PIs will propose a short-term selection experiment with  replicated selection and control lines. The PIs will work with a  large natural population already under intensive study in East  Tennessee. We will select directly on the R:FR-mediated plasticity  of flowering time. While assessing the response to this direct  selection, we will also examine two forms of indirect response.  First, was there a response in the R:FR-mediated plasticity of  other traits? Second, was there a response in the  photoperiod-mediated plasticity (i.e., a different cue) of the  same trait, flowering time?         The PIs' plan to address the interaction among traits and  be tween R:FR- and photoperiodmediated plasticity in a series of  mutant lines. These mutants lack specific photoreceptor genes that  affect a suite of traits, including reproductive fitness.  Furthermore, in these mutant lines and their associated wild  types, normal and altered patterns of plasticity occur in the same  genetic background. Thus, it is possible to make strong inferences  about how a gene (or genes) controlling plasticity affects the  whole organism, including its performance or fitness (pleiotropy).",
