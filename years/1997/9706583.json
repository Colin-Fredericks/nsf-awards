 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Sivakumar      Sivakumar will work on problems form the theory of radial-basis  functions (RBF).  The first part proposes the general study of   cardinal interpolation (i.e., interpolation at the multi-integer   lattice) by shifts of RBFs. The second part of the proposal deals   with the analysis of the cardinal-interpolation  operator. Stability   estimates relating to  scattered-data interpolation constitute the   subject of the third part of the proposal. The final section concerns   interpolation of scattered data on Euclidean spheres.  The focus   here is on interpolants which are closely related to RBFs, and the   goal is to develop a substantive quantitative theory of such   interpolation methods.    As evident from the preceding paragraph, the leitmotif of this  proposal is the theory of Radial-Basis Functions, a subject  which has been vigorously researched over the last 15 years.  These functions provide a viable tool for the interpolation (i.e.,    modeling)  of scattered data.  Modeling scattered data is as    natural as it is inevitable.  Data gathered for experiments in many    areas of science (e.g., geophysical or meterological data collected  over the surface of the earth via satellites or ground stations)  invariably come from scattered sites.  It is therefore important to  have at one's disposal, flexible and useful methods of producing  interpolants (i.e., surface fits) to such scattered data.  The   radial-basis-function method accomplishes precisely that; indeed,   its use was pioneered by the geophysicist Rolland Hardy in his  studies on topography.  The current proposal seeks to undertake  theoretical studies connected with radial-basis-function  interpolation.  Some of these issues, especially those   addressed in the third and fourth parts of the proposal, also  have some practical significance.  These issues concern  the so-called quantitative theory of interpolation which  strives to explain how stable the interpolation (modeling)  process is likely to b e.",
