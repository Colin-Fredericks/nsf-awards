 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Claremont Colleges propose to develop a six college intercollegiate, interdisciplinary  neuroscience program. At the core of this program, a new interdisciplinary, introductory  neuroscience course will be developed that focuses more on the fundamental neuroscientific issues  from a philosophical, historical, and methodological point of view than is typically the case. We  argue that this approach will be mutually beneficial to the general education student, the potential  major in neuroscience, and individuals who have been underrepresented in science. Students will  emerge from this course with a better understanding of how science progresses and will be better  prepared for a general understanding of future scientific developments, if they do not major in  neuroscience, or for advanced coursework in neuroscience, if they decide to major in neuroscience.      In addition to the introductory course, new upper division courses will be developed within  two tracks, representing the principal division in neuroscience today: cellular-molecular and  cognitive neuroscience. Students selecting to major in neuroscience will elect to specialize in one  of the two tracks, which will include several courses in common. We will also develop a senior  capstone course that will include seniors from both tracks. This course will bring faculty and  students together to reconsider fundamental issues raised in the introductory course, but from a  more sophisticated vantage-point.      A significant part of the proposed program will involve opportunities for students and faculty  to work with pre-college students and teachers to develop science education in elementary and  secondary schools, which we expect will also encourage college students to consider careers in  education.",
