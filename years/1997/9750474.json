 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is updating introductory chemistry curricula by using modern instrumentation in undergraduate courses.  The updated curricula are enhancing the quality of introductory chemistry courses, improving the retention of science students, and easing the transition for community college students entering 4-year institutions.  Interactive instructional software that provides students and instructors with a \"virtual\"  Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) instrument have already been developed.  Similar software for a virtual Fourier-transform nuclear-magnetic-resonance (FT-NMR) instrument is currently under development.  This software can be used by instructors as a lecture aid for introducing spectroscopic methods and as a tutorial for the use of the FT-IR and FT-NMR instruments. For actual laboratory courses, students can submit samples from their own experiments to regional centers for FT-IR and FT-NMR measurements.  Data from each sample are stored on an Internet file server for students to download locally.  This file server provides reasonable access to instrumentation, which many community colleges and private colleges typically do not have.  By providing students with experience with modern instrumentation and interpretation of their own experimental data, this program is enhancing their understanding of important chemical concepts.  In addition, students are gaining insight into the collaborative nature of this scientific process.  *",
