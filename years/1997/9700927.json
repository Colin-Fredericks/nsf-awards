 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fomin  9700927   The research project is devoted to exploring new relations between combinatorics and algebra, in particular representation theory and algebraic geometry.  An approach to total positivity  based on generalized pseudo-line arrangements  suggests new developments and applications ranging from  combinatorics of canonical bases in quantum groups to numerical and symbolic algorithms of linear algebra.  The combinatorial problems arising  in the theory of quantum cohomology  provide another promising direction of research. The proposal outlines a plan for a detailed study of quantum Schubert polynomials.         This research concerns the interplay between combinatorics and algebraic geometry. One of the goals of  combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections  of objects can be arranged. The behavior of discrete systems is extremely  important to modern communications. For example, the design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, and the design of algorithms in  computer science deal with discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of  combinatorial research. Algebraic  geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but  one which has had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that could be defined  in the plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only from algebra,  but from analysis, topology, and combinatorics, and conversely is finding  application in those fields as well as in physics, theoretical  computer science, and robotics.",
