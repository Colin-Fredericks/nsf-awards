 "awd_abstract_narration": "Verbistky will investigate systematically an important  class of superlinear integral and  partial differential equations   which serve as  model problems in nonlinear analysis and also are   common in applications. Verbitsky will combine a number of analytic techniques  including discrete (wavelet-type) decompositions of linear and  nonlinear operators, weighted norm inequalities with iterated weights   and good control of the imbedding constants, quasi-metrics associated   with Green's kernels, refined 3G-inequalities and nonlinear potential   theory. An expected new development is that   arbitrary nonnegative coefficients at the lower order terms and data   can be handled without any a priori regularity assumptions. Essential   to this approach is an introduction of new function spaces   intrinsically associated with  nonlinear problems, identification of   their preduals and establishing basic imbedding theorems.  Exact pointwise estimates of solutions and their gradients up   to the boundary could be extremely valuable in applied problems.    The proposed research develops new applications for modern methods of  harmonic analysis and potential theory which previously were used  extensively in   linear analysis. Nonlinear techniques  lead to more accurate mathematical models and numerical estimates for  differential and integral equations with singular coefficients and   data. They describe many environmental and technological phenomena   with nonlinear sources, and are widely used in the studies of heat   transfer, fluid flow, control theory, and stochastic processes.",
