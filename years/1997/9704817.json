 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704817  Ivanov       This project is concerned with the algebraic structure of the  mapping class groups of surfaces and the geometric structure of  Teichmueller spaces.  As is well known, they are deeply related, and  also related to the combinatorial structure of complexes of curves of  surfaces.  The investigator, Nikolai Ivanov, has successfully exploited  these interrelations in the past, and intends to continue this line of  research.  First, he is planning to explore the possibility that the  mapping class groups are quasi-isometrically rigid, guided by the  analogy between mapping class groups and arithmetic groups and recent  results about arithmetic groups due to R. Schwartz, B. Farb, A. Eskin,  B. Kleiner and B. Leeb.  Another part of the project is concerned with  the structure of subgroups of the mapping class groups normally  generated by pseudo-Anosov elements.  The hope is that the  Teichmueller spaces are \"sufficiently hyperbolic\" (as evidenced by the  recent theorem of H. Masur and Y. Minsky about hyperbolicity of  complexes of curves) in order for such subgroups to exist in  abundance.  Finally, the investigator is planning to explore two more  recent geometric structures on Teichmueller spaces, namely, the  Thurston semi-metric and the Kerckhoff geometry.  In particular, he  is planning to find all automorphisms of these structures.       The global study of surfaces and of various geometric structures  on them goes back to the last century, with the foundations laid down  by Gauss, Moebius, and Riemann.  The mapping class groups encode all  possible symmetries of surfaces, while Teichmueller spaces collect  together all possible geometric structures of a particular sort on a  surface.  It turns out that these two aspects of the theory of  surfaces are deeply interrelated, and the project focuses on several  aspects of this relationship.  In the last decade, the theory of  surfaces acquired an additional significance as a result of a promising  physical \"theory of everything ,\" namely the so-called string theory.  In this theory, the elementary constituents of matter are not  point-like particles, but rather collections of loops (\"strings\")  sweeping a surface during their motion.  It turns out that both  various geometric structures on surfaces, as well as their symmetries,  are of fundamental importance here.  ***",
