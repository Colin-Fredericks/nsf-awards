 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gender differences in nonverbal communication, including sensitivity to nonverbal cues and expressive behaviors such as smiling, are well documented but poorly understood. One proposed explanation for why men are less nonverbally sensitive and smile less (among other nonverbal differences) is that men have more status and dominance than do women. This proposed explanation rests on the assumption that people with greater status and dominance behave in the `male` stereotypic manner, such as being less sensitive to others and smiling less. However, little research exists to support these assumptions. The present research will address the relations between the status/dominance concept and nonverbal behavior, with special emphasis on nonverbal sensitivity and smiling.  Of central importance to understanding status/dominance effects on behavior is the way in which people define their respective roles. That is, role motives may guide behavior more than roles per se. Several experiments will be conducted in which status/dominance will be experimentally controlled in a laboratory setting, along with manipulations of role motives. An example is whether the subordinate is motivated to be pleasing or to be perceived as competent. The behavior of both superiors and subordinates will be studied to better understand how nonverbal behavior and nonverbal cue processing are influenced by roles and role motives.  This research addresses a number of complex issues relating to gender and sex differences. The research has strong potential for offering new insight into very basic and important societal and interpersonal problems.",
