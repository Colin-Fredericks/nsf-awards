 "awd_abstract_narration": "BassiriRad  9728785            Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are nutrients that most often  limit plant production in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Limited  availability of these nutrients is also a major factor influencing  long-term plant and ecosystem responses to rising atmospheric CO2  levels i.e., the commonly observed short-term increase in plant biomass  may not be sustained over the long-term unless availability and/or  acquisition capacity for nutrients increases in concert with carbon (C)  gain. Therefore, it is critical to obtain a mechanistic understanding  of whether elevated CO2 can elicit compensatory adjustments that would  circumvent nutrient limitation of plant growth. Compensatory adjustment  such as (a) increased mycorrhizal development, (b) increased root N and  P absorption capacity, and (c) root growth can enable plants to meet  increased nutrient demand under high CO2 yet the extent of these  adjustments in response to CO2 enrichment is unknown.    In  addressing how nutrient availability could interact with plants and  ecosystem  responses to high CO2 several questions must be  considered:  Will plant demand for N and P increase in response to CO2 enrichment  ?  (Demand  as  a  concept  requires careful definition  on  temporal  and  spatial  scales which will be addressed here.) If nutrient demand  does  increase  under  elevated  C02,  what compensatory  adjustment(s)  will  plants make to overcome this greater demand? Will N and P uptake  scale  properly  with  measured  changes in relative  growth  rate  (RGR)  and  photosynthetic N and P utility? Does growth nutrient status affect  the  magnitude of the compensatory adjustments in response to CO2? Do  these  compensatory  mechanisms scale with CO2-induced changes  in  stages  of  development? Do plants of various functional groups e.g.,  C3  vs.  C4,  woody  vs.  herbaceous  vs.  grasses,  or  arbuscular  mycorrhizae  vs.  ectomycorrhizae differ in their nutrient uptake responses  to  elevated  CO2?  Does   a  better  plant capacity to scale up  nutrient  uptake  at  elevated CO2 confer enhanced competitive ability?        The  proposed  research  will  address  these  questions  with   an  emphasis on root and mycorrhizal N and P uptake kinetics. The  PI  will  use  both field and laboratory approaches to test our hypotheses  under  the  most  realistic  conditions  possible.  The  field  work  will  be  conducted  at  six  currently funded national FACE  sites  providing  a  comprehensive  cross comparison of different ecosystems and  functional  groups. At each field site, N and P uptake capacity will be measured on  intact roots of mature plants subjected to factorial combination of two  CO2  treatments  in the presence or absence of mycorrhizas.  The  field  experiments  will provide a unique opportunity to compare the  response  of   these  compensatory  adjustments  to  elevated  CO2  levels  among  different ecosystems, life forms, and functional groups of plants in  a  competitive  setting. Greenhouse-laboratory experiments  using  species  similar  to  those  from  the  field will  examine  the  more  detailed  questions  related to adjustments in uptake kinetics, relative  changes  in  root  vs.  mycorrhizal  uptake kinetics,  and  plant  physiological  demand.  The  data  will be integrated into a comprehensive  functional  balance   model  which  will  incorporate  physiological  and   biomass  allocation parameters.",
