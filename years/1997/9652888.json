 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science and engineering majors first encounter a serious study of Twentieth Century physics, frequently called Modern Physics, in their third semester. The Modern Physics course has a unique role in the education of future scientists and engineers. Physics students begin their study of topics of interest to contemporary physicists; engineering and other science majors have their only opportunity to study physics related to micro-and nano-technology - areas which will be of importance to their careers. Yet, the present course has changed little to reflect knowledge about student learning, computational technology, or recent research advances in fundamental quantum physics.      We are building on existing work (primarily Visual Quantum Mechanics) to create a new Modern Physics course. This modern Modern Physics course will utilize contemporary teaching-learning methods which are based on research into how students learn physics, computational and visualization techniques, and recent fundamental research results. Included in the materials to be developed are tools which will help students visualize the concepts of quantum physics, simple hands-on activities, and templates for computational tools. Many of these materials will be expansions of Visual Quantum Mechanics materials. By beginning with these existing quantum teaching-learning materials the project will be able to complete this effort at a relatively low cost.      The project will receive advice and direction from an advisory committee whose members have been selected for their knowledge and previous work in teaching modern physics.  Before the materials are released for commercial distribution extensive testing will be completed by field testers who will use the materials in classes throughout the country.       The result will be a set of modern learning materials which provide the opportunity for science and engineering students to learn about contemporary physics.",
