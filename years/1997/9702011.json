 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Getridge, Carolyn      Demographics:  The Oakland Unified School District is a minority  majority system with 93% of its 52,269 students ethnic  minorities, 46% of whom are AFDC eligible, while 60% qualify for  free/reduced lunch. 26% are Limited English Proficient.  This  proposal targets African American and Hispanic students, who make  up 73% of the school population, score significantly below  District averages, have lower enrollment and success rates in  gateway math and science courses, and have the lowest college  enrollment rates.  All 1200 elementary and the 435 secondary math  and science teachers will participate directly, but systemic  reform will impact all students and teachers.    Background:  The District and the six federal laboratory,  university and community partners in this proposal have invested  approximately $13.5 million over three years piloting best  practices to develop a systemic strategy of reform.  Math/science  reform has been the District's primary vehicle to create a  culture of inquiry at all grade levels and to implement a  thinking-centered, student-centered curriculum that will lead  underrepresented minorities to succeed in math and science.  The  District has:      adopted core curricula that is aligned with state frameworks    and national standards.    aligned the elementary instructional program with that    curricula.    adopted hands-on, inquiry-based math and science texts and kits    in 1992.    implemented the staff development program in math and science    for elementary teachers.    initiated Efficacy Training, a 3 year program to train all    employees in processes that maximize student learning potential    and success.    implemented a technology plan to support professional  collaborations and inquiry-based    learning.  Through this effort the Distriat has gained the depth of  understanding of the tremendous effort required to take reform to  scale in a large, high poverty urban district.    Goal/Objectives: The District's objectives fo r this five year  proposal are to:     Double the number of minority students who enroll in Algebra     in grade 9 by year 5.     Double the number of minority students who successfully     complete the college preparatory a.-f. course sequence and are     prepared to enter college by year 5.     Increase by 1 0% the number of students who take the SAT;     improve math scores by 1 0%.     Increase average performance on the new standardized tests by     5 percentile points.     Increase participation of minority students in AP math and     science classes by 100%.  The District believes that these ambitious objectives can only be  achieved through sustained systemic reform.  The District has the  requisite leadership and political will.  System-wide  transformation now requires a bridge of new resources and the  concentration of all existing District resources on a set of well-  defined, sustained strategies that will actually impact the  learning of children.    Proposed Activities: The District will continue to refine  science, engineering and math (SEM) standards, align policy with  reform goals and complete a K-12 SEM pipeline for all students.  The District is establishing more rigorous graduation  requirements and re-writing policies for attendance, grading,  retention and promotion of students, and accountability.  Building on the successful work at elementary grades funded in  part by NSF, the District will continue to implement an inquiry-  based SEM curricula at the middle and senior high school levels,  a process tied to 1997-98 grade reconfiguration.  To sustain  reform on a District wide basis, the District will build its  internal capabilities to deliver services now provided to a  limited number of schools by the six partners in this proposal.  With its partners the District proposes (a) to create the  infrastructure to ensure that classroom teachers gain in-depth  experience in inquiry based instruction through meaningful in  service activities coupled with in-classroom support  and timely  access to the appropriate materials (b) build in-house expertise  in SEM content, pedagogy, mentoring and change management and (c)  through these efforts train a critical mass of classroom teachers  able to implement the SEM curriculum which the District then will  be able to sustain through existing re-aligned staff development  funds and people resources.  A new Math and Science Resource  Center will manage this change process, coordinate partners'  support services, and implement a cost effective materials  distribution system.  The District will establish a continuum of  student support and family involvement activities to address  academic, attitudinal and socioeconomic barriers to learning.  The District's new comprehensive School Improvement Systems  assessment program will ensure accountability at all levels and  monitor student achievement of well defined SEM benchmarks.",
