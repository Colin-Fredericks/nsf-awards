 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, technological advances and bandwidth availability have  brought about a web of new multimedia and real-time applications, such as  internet telephony, interactive TV, video-on-demand, and  videoconferencing. These applications have important uses in a wide range of  activities from education and health care to entertainment.  Their full  deployment will clearly have a huge impact on the quality of our lives and  the society as a whole.    Such applications, however, are very bandwidth demanding, very sensitive to  congestion, and require real-time and reliable communication.  Although  appropriate protocols, such as the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)  protocol and an enhanced version of Internet's TCP/IP protocol (with RSVP),  already exist, Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning remains one of the  fundamental open problems that need to be addressed before real-time  applications can be reliably supported.  If congestion is not an option,  restricting the number of users that are allowed in the network becomes an  extremely useful tool in guaranteeing QoS. The central goal of this research  is to devise such an admission control procedure and test its performance in  practice.    To provide QoS guarantees the network should prevent congestion which causes  packet losses due to buffer overflows and excessive delays.  A worst case  based admission control algorithm (which allocates to calls bandwidth  equal to their peak rate) leads to significant underutilization of the network  resources, since traffic is typically bursty, i.e., the peak rate is not  sustained for long. To achieve more efficient use of the resources the  proposed approach will permit some congestion phenomena which will be  occurring infrequently enough to allow for the provision of statistical  QoS guarantees. More specifically, it is desired to operate the network in a  regime where loss probabilities and probabilities of excessive delays are  particularly small (e.g., on the order of 10^{-6}). Real-time app lications  can tolerate such small frequencies of congestion phenomena.    This research will draw upon methods developed in applied probability,  optimization, and optimal control theory, and will use, extending whenever  necessary, many of the ideas developed recently by the PI. Calculating  congestion probabilities for non-trivial traffic models is particularly hard.  The proposed work will therefore resort to asymptotic results using large  deviations theory (a subfield of applied probability) as the main analytical  tool.     Issues that are considered as prerequisites for successful admission control  will be first resolved. Among them the proposed research will address:   -Traffic Modeling.     The aim is to propose models that capture the statistical properties of the traffic which are relevant to admission control.   -Performance analysis.      The goal is to asymptotically estimate congestion probabilities in a     multiclass and multihop network environment.     The final product of the proposed work will be an admission control algorithm  that provides statistical QoS guarantees to admitted calls and possesses the  following characteristics:  -Support for multiple service classes.      Applications will be bundled in service classes based on the statistical     character of the traffic they generate and on their QoS requirements.  -Full utilization of available bandwidth.       The controller will be flexible enough to investigate different bandwidth     allocation strategies among service classes and deny admission only when     there is no feasible allocation that guarantees QoS to all connected calls.   -End-to-End QoS guarantees.
