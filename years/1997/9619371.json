 "awd_abstract_narration": "As internetworked computing becomes pervasive,  common  services will be accessed by a large number of widely  distributed clients. Thus, scalable implementations of such  services must deal with (1) large number of clients, and (2)  high latencies that will be common among widely distributed  nodes.  One approach for reducing server load and  communication costs is to create multiple instances of  a  service close to client groups that frequently access it.  Also, when possible,  resource rich clients can cache  service state to avoid communication latency for common  accesses. Service state replication and caching both lead to  multiple copies of the service state and lead to the problem  of consistency maintenance across copies when service state  can be updated (e.g., to support interactions across  clients). The focus of this project is on the  characterizations of consistency levels that are appropriate  in large scale systems with diverse sets of applications.  In addition,  scalable protocols will be developed  to provide both read and write access to service state  without requiring communication with all nodes that may have  copies of the service state.  A distributed object based  middleware will be implemented to support scalable service  and it will employ object caching  and replication to  enhance service access performance and scalability. This  middleware will be used in the development and evaluation of  services targeted to the home that are reached via a variety  of communication media such as POTS and cable  networks.",
