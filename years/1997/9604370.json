 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Douglas W. Moc, CO-PI: Hubert G. Schwabl  IBN-9604370      In recent years, the general assumption that parents value  all of their offspring equally has come into question.  In  many animals and plant groups, parents produce greater  numbers of concurrent young than can ordinarily be supported  fully, forcing a subsequent adjustment downward in family  size.  The underlying reasons for parental overproduction  stem from multiple sources of environmental unpredictability  (including resource unpredictability, accidental losses of  progeny, partial-brood predation, cannibalism by family  members or others, ect.), but the fact of it simultaneously  generates sibling rivalry, which creates incentives for  parents to produce a hierarchical sibship to minimize the  costs of such rivalry.  Thus, parents confer special  advantages on some offspring and/or handicaps on other, so  called  marginal  brood members.  The best-studied  manifestation of biological parental favoritism is probably  asynchronous hatching in many predatory birds species.  There, early onset of incubation gives embryos in the first-  laid eggs a developmental head-start that facilitates their  success in any ensuing sibling competitions for limited  food.  Hubert Schwabl s recent discovery that female  laboratory canaries deposit increasing amounts of  testosterone into yolks as the laying process proceeds  suggested a new mechanism for parental manipulation of  offspring vigar and inspired the collection of fresh eggs  from cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis), a species known to  practice fatal sibling aggression (or  siblicide ).  The   marginal  third egg of this species contained much less  yolk testosterone (plus two similar steroids) than those of  its two nestmates, which normally hatch 1-3 days earlier.  The fact that the egret pattern (decreasing steroid dose) is  exactly opposite that found in canaries, but congruent with  the effects of hatching asynchrony, suggests that hormone  depositions into yolks could be a  widespread and flexible  parental adaptation for rigging intra-brood competitive  dynamics and survival.  The proposed study aims to explore  this matter through two field studies.  First, the cattle  egret system will be experimentally manipulated by injecting  various levels of a 3-steroid cocktail into last-laid eggs,  then measuring the subsequent competitive behaviors (begging  and fighting) of the hatchlings under field conditions.  If  steroid-manipulation is part of an evolved parental strategy  for managing sibling competition, broods with boosted last-  eggs should show escalated fighting and begging, ultimately  to the detriment of parental interests.  Second, to test  whether the mother s cutback on steroids is a general  phenomenon and associated with families in which sib-  competition is especially keen, an exploratory survey will  be made of the other siblicidal species, each paired with a  closely-related but nonaggressive sister species.  As with  cattle egret pilot work, clutches of eggs will be collected  as soon as each is laid, their yolks frozen for later  laboratory assays of steroid content.  Through this work, we  expect to increase understanding of the reproductive  strategies of parents under natural conditions and to  determine whether maternal steroid dosing is a general  mechanism used to enhance parental fitness.",
