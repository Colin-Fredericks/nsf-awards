 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF) Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) will   assist the Department of Chemistry at University of Missouri at St. Louis   to acquire a high resolution mass spectrometer. This equipment will   enhance research in a number of areas that include the following: (1)   studies on organometallic species used as polymerization catalysts, (2)   synthesis and  reactions of metallaborane complexes, (3) organic   synthesis and development of synthetic methods, (4) natural product   isolation and reactions, (5) the analysis of unstable organic oxidation   products in simulated environments, and study of self-assembled   monolayers derived from modified cyclodextrins.  Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural   details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of   organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The addition of the   technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to proteins and nucleic   acid molecular weights far beyond any other technique. The use of   electrospray ionization in combination with high resolution provides the   latest techniques available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist   one of the most powerful tools available for the characterization of   compounds. The acquisition of this capability in mass spectrometry is   essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many fields of   chemistry.",
