CUNY Brooklyn College    Smart Object Interfaces for Collaborative Learning Environments     Smart objects are physical objects that serve as input devices to a   computer system. This effort aims to use pieces of a physical puzzle --   such as the Towers of Hanoi -- as smart objects that will help K-12   students to understand and appreciate mathematical and scientific concepts. The goal is to reach those students who are currently turned off by math and science, providing a way for them to learn collaboratively by manipulating real objects in the world around them.    The PI will use this planning grant to study the feasibility of this new research direction, and to devise a sound technical approach for implementing smart object interfaces for collaborative learning environments. Unlike traditional interfaces, a computer system employing smart objects must track multiple input devices in a three-dimensional space in real time, distinguishing between objects and accounting for precision errors.  Current sensor technologies are being examined to discover their capabilities and limitations. The PI is talking with other researchers and sensor experts and also exploring the software issues, aiming to ultimately develop a set of smart object interface tools. This effort will culminate in a long-term research plan and the beginnings of a new research laboratory.",
