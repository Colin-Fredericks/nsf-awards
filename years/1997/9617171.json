 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry program supports the research of Professor John F. Hartwig at   Yale University.  This work seeks to uncover unusual reactions and   fundamental principles in the chemistry of metal-boryl and borane   complexes by evaluating the chemistry of complexes with Lewis-acidic   ligands.  It endeavors to functionalize hydrocarbons with metal boryl   complexes and to synthesize metallocene borane complexes related to   catalytic hydroboration processes.  These topics are to serve as case   studies in how the electrophilicity of boryl ligands and borane   substrates leads to new chemistry that has not been observed with more   conventional organometallic systems.  Boryl intermediates that interact   with hydrocarbons will be investigated and substituent effects on   selectivity will be measured in order to address how the electrophoricity   of covalent ligands affects reactivity.          Both fundamental and practical aspects of the early metal-borane and   boryl species will be studied.  The properties that stabilize or enhance   the reactivity of these complexes will be studied with regard to their   effects in catalytic hydroboration. The chiral selectivity of   titanocene-catalyzed hydroboration and the selectivity of single addition   to dienes will be studied.",
