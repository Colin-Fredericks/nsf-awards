 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704891  Lodder       A major topic of research in the 1970's was the interplay between  foliations and Lie algebra cohomology.  A foliation represents the  solution of a partial differential equation on a space, and the cohomology  classes that detect a given foliation provide a concise numerical invariant  measuring the (global) twisting of the solution set of the equation.  The first cohomology class to be discovered in this way was the  Godbillon-Vey invariant, a single class in dimension three that is  an element of the classical de Rham cohomology group of the underlying  space.  (For codimension one foliations there are no other invariants.)  This project is based on a fundamentally new method of computing  cohomology that does not require the classical symmetries needed for  de Rham cohomology.  The ideas for this construction arise from   work of Jean-Louis Loday of Strasbourg, France, and are referred to as  Leibniz cohomology.  The results of preliminary computations are  striking.  In the codimension one case alone, there are infinite  families of invariants for foliations.  They begin with the  Godbillon-Vey invariant and then continue in dimensions 4n and  4n+3 (n any positive integer).  Although the new classes result  from a one-parameter variation of a foliation, it remains an open  question to interpret their meaning in terms of physical properties.       A more general topic of research in mathematics remains to classify  space according to the criteria set forth by Riemann nearly 150 years  ago.  Much progress has been made in the past century, but the  classification is not complete.  As an unexpected and highly  non-trivial invariant of space, Leibniz cohomology will be a new tool  in this field.  To aid in the interpretation of Leibniz cohomology, a  construction for this invariant in terms of more familiar spaces would be  helpful.  It is auspicious that the formalism used to define the Leibniz  groups appears quite naturally in quantum field theory.  By work of V. Kac,   the elements of a field theory form a classical Lie algebra---but only  after a certain number of them are set to zero.  If these elements are  not set to zero, the original elements form a Leibniz algebra lacking  the symmetries of a Lie algebra.  The cohomology groups of this  Leibniz algebra will be new invariants of quantum field theory.  ***",
