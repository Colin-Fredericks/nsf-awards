The  purpose is to study the  fundamental   and  technological  issues  essential  to  the  performance   and  competitiveness  of the MTJ.  The proposed work  is  closely  linked to activities at IBM Research, Yorktown Heights.  IBM  will, where appropriate, pay for the support of students for  work  done  at  IBM  Research.   This  activity  is  jointly  supported by DMR and the OMA office of the MPS Directorate.  %%%  Magnetic  tunnel  junctions are devices which  are  actively  pursued  by  industry as the new memory and sensor  elements  such as data storage reading heads and non-volatile magnetic  random-access-memory  (MRSM) cells.  The  scientific  issues  include  gaining  a  more  complete  understanding  of   the  magnetic   behavior  of  these  systems,  especially   while  illuminated by light and the effect of reducing  the  device  size.   The  GOALI  supported work links  expertise  at  the  academic   institution  with  activities  at  IBM  Research,  Yorktown Heights.  IBM will, where appropriate, pay for  the  support  of  students for work done at IBM  Research.   This  activity  is jointly supported by DMR and the OMA office  of  the MPS Directorate.  ***",
