 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704575  Vogelius    The research funded by this grant will focus on analytical and numerical   studies of partial differential equations. There will be an emphasis on direct   as well as on inverse problems. As far as direct problems are concerned, the   effective boundary layer behavior encountered in connection with PDE's   with rapidly oscillating coefficients will be investigated. PDE's of this form   are used to model the behavior of composite materials. Other   ``homogenization\" problems for composite materials, for example, certain   problems associated with the relationship between microscopic and   macroscopic failure (including debonding of closely spaced fibers and   delamination) will be studied. Concerning inverse problems, those to be   investigated include 1) inverse \"coefficient\" problems for linear elliptic   equations with spatially varying coefficients and  2) inverse \"source\"   problems for semilinear elliptic equations. The data used for identification   in both cases consists of  overdetermined (Dirichlet or Neumann) boundary   data. The analytical component of this work concerns such questions as   identifiability and continuous dependence. For the inverse \"coefficient\"   problem, the investigation of the identification of cracks, inhomogeneities   and corrosion damage will be continued and a study related to the   ``imaging\" of thin films will be initiated; for the inverse \"source problem,\"   connections with the well known Schiffer (or Pompeiu) conjecture will be   investigated with particular emphasis on the relation between the   ``smoothness\" of the domain and the ability to identify. The numerical work   will be devoted to the design of effective reconstruction methods, which to   the largest extent possible rely on structural information about the solutions   of the underlying PDE.    The research funded by this grant will focus on analytical and numerical   problems related to continuum mechanics. The research on direct problems   has applications to several impor tant practical problems, for instance the   assessment of the strength and potential failure of composite materials   (including fracture, debonding of fibers and delamination). Special   emphasis is put on the understanding of the relationship between   microscopic and macroscopic behavior. The research on inverse problems   has immediate applications to 1) medical impedance imaging, 2)   nondestructive testing of mechanical parts (and sensors) as well as 3) the   interpretation of magnetic diagnostics for Tokamak (fusion) devices. Part of   this research is concerned with determining the sufficiency of the proposed   boundary data for the various identifications (proving uniqueness and   continuous dependence results). Another part of this research involves the   design of effective algorithms, for instance for the detection and location of   cracks and inhomogeneities in metal components as well as for the   determination of the level of oxidation of thin films (gas sensors) using real   experimental data. There will be an active involvement of post-doctoral   researchers as well as graduate students and hopefully even some advanced   undergraduate students in various aspects of the research.",
