 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT - BARSONY    A Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Engineering  (POWRE)award will support an 18-month Visiting Professorship at the  Physics Department at Harvey Mudd College.  This award will allow a  full time collaboration with Prof. Alex Rudolph to develop the  Claremont-Riverside InfraRed CAMera (CLRIRCAM-pronounced \"clearer cam\")  project.  The visit will start in January of 1998.  Harvey Mudd College  is one of the Claremont Colleges, a group of five small colleges  located in Claremont, California.  Pomona College, the oldest and  largest of the five, owns a 1.0-meter telescope, whose use is shared  among the five colleges.  A three-year collaboration with Dr. Rudolph  involves the acquisition of a near-infrared array camera for this  telescope.    The POWRE Visiting Professorship at Harvey Mudd College will be spent  developing the design specifications for the camera, developing  software for data acquisition-including an efficient mosaicing mode,  integrating the camera control software with the telescope control  software, developing an efficient data archiving system using writeable  CD-ROMs, and developing IDL data reduction routines for photometry,  astrometry, mosaicing, and re-scaling and combining of multi-color  images.  Well-documented software, and student manuals on the use of  the telescope, the instrument, and on the correct steps for data-taking  and data reduction with CLRIRCAM will be produced.    The Pomona College 1.0-meter telescope is a superb instrument for the  CLRIRCAM project.  It is located at Table Mountain Observatory, a high,  dry site, at an altitude of 7200 feet, on the other side of the San  Gabriel Mountains away from the lights of the Los Angeles basin, making  it ideal for near-infrared observations.  CLRIRCAM will open up  astronomical research opportunities for an entire community, including  faculty, post-docs, graduate students, and undergraduates from each of  the six collaborating institutions.    The research plans usi ng CLRIRCAM include systematic large-area  multi-color imaging surveys of dark, interstellar molecular clouds to  study embedded young stars and star clusters, the search for the  youngest protostars, and frequent and long-term monitoring projects of  variable young stellar objects (YSOs) to elucidate infall, outflow, and  disk accretion mechanisms. The YSO monitoring projects have the  potential to lead to new breakthroughs in our understanding of  fundamental physics relating to the gas motions in the immediate  circumstellar environments of young stars, that may also shed some  light on planet formation scenarios.",
