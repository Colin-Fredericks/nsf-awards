 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hundreds of biological databases which currently exist  on the Internet form the infrastructure which supports much  present research in basic and applied science, medicine, and  biotechnology.  They are significant information resources  that represent the fundamental research infrastructure for  future competitiveness in scientific research and  application of technology.  The rapid expansion of this  infrastructure and its new ease of access has outpaced the  scientific and business communities' ability to establish  economic support to maintain these resources over the long  term.    This project will explore alternative support mechanisms for  the maintenance, curation and further development of the  biological database infrastructure.  A multi-disciplinary  team will survey biological database developers on sources  for and stability of their funding; benchmark the University  of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database (UM-BBD),  URL -- http://dragon.labmed.umn.edu/index.html, three other  biological databases, and three non-peer-group information-  based systems, to analyze costs, value creation, and value  recover in information-based infrastructures and establish a  starting point for economic modeling of such systems;  and  develop at least one economic model for the long term  support of the biological database infrastructure.  At the  end of this pilot project, one will be validated by applying  it to the UM-BBD and other biological databases.  If  successful this pilot project will help assure the economic  survival of the biological database infrastructure.",
