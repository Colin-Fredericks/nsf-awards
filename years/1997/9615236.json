Up to now, no  Maestrichtian fossil land mammals have been found in any of these  continents.  The Lopez de Bertodano Formation of Vega Island,  Antarctic Peninsula, shows the best potential of yielding remains  of land mammals of Maestrichtian age in any southern Gondwana  location. This project is designed to grasp that opportunity as a  collaborative venture between St. Mary's University, University  of California, Riverside, and Argentine scientists.    Current theory predicts that the presently unknown Maestrichtian-  age land mammal fauna in Antarctica should consist (1) of a suite  of non-therian taxa remnant from an Albian-Campanian fauna that  occupied southern Gondwana from Australia to Antarctica to South  America and (2) a complex of marsupials composed of relict  peradectids and more derived early members of australidelphians.  The australidelphians should include early members of the  (currently) South American Microbiotheriidae as well as early  lineages of the (currently) Australian Peramelina, Dasyuromorphia  and Diprotodontia.    This awards supports work to test this hypothesis in terms of the  composition of the Maestrichtian land mammal fauna by conducting  field research in Vega Island of the James Ross Island basin,  Antarctic Peninsula.  The location has been chosen on the basis  of its known productivity in yielding Maestrichtian-age  vertebrates (presbyornithid birds and hypsilophodont dinosaurs)  in near-shore fine-grained shallow-water marine sandstones of the  Lopez de Bertodano Formation that are amenable to dry or wet  sieving collecting methods, methods that have proven successful  in obtaining fossil mammals from similar facies in the medial  Eocene La Meseta Formation of Seymour Island.    This is a cooperative project with the Antarct ic Institute,  Argentina, (IAA) and the Museo de La Plata, Argentina (MLP).  MLP  personnel are collaborating on research into the evolutionary  history of Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary therian mammals in  South America and Antarctica and the potential relationship of  these to the early population of Australia.  The collaboration  with IAA personnel is focused on litho- and biostratigraphy of  the marine successions.    The first grant year (1997) will focus on examining existing  material.  Years 2 and 3 will focus on field work on Vega Island  and follow up examination of any fossil discoveries.  The IAA  will supply all Antarctic logistic support for US as well as  Argentine personnel, including travel from Argentina to Seymour  Island, and logistical support in the field.  Collaborative  visits to participating institutions will occur as required over  the life of the project.",
