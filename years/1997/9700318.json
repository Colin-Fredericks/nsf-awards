 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700318    With passage of the Ocean Dumping Act and the lack of  containment facilities, the disposal of nearly 7 million  tons of dredged sediments per year become a major problem  for the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area.  The dredged  sediments in a slurry form need to be dewatered, remediated,  and disposed.  The contaminants (heavy metals and organics)  in the dredged sediments are usually attached to the clay  and silt fractions.  The action of applied ultrasound  techniques, coupled with extraction under partial vacuum, is  proposed in this study to remove contaminants and water from  dredged residues.  A complete treatment technology with  three different processes is proposed for commercial  implementation/.  In this research, two processes involving  ultrasound will be evaluated.  In the first process, the  fines near the ultrasound probe are separated from the bulk  dredged suspension and are removed using sub-atmospheric  pressure.  In the second process, the fines are  decontaminated and contaminants in water are removed using  sub-atmospheric pressure.  The remediated soil can be ocean-  dumped as clean material or used in construction.  The  extracted organic and inorganic waste will be concentrated  using membrane technology and disposed of in hazardous waste  landfills.  This technology can be easily added directly  into a dredging vessel to minimize material handling.  ***",
