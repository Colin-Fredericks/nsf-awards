 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710575  Software evolution is an important creative process, but it  carries serious perils, particularly when the software is  embedded in a critical enterprise and must evolve within its  operational context. Since even a small change in the software  can cause a large change in the behavior of the system, an  enterprise that incorporates an evolving software system is  susceptible to destructive and potentially disastrous effects,  caused by inadvertent errors or by malicious attacks by  programmers employed to maintain the software. The project  attempts to tame such perils by ensuring that some of the  architectural principles of a given system be maintained as  invariants of its evolution. Invariants of this kind, which  include permanent \"firewalls,\" access-control regimes, and  internal control discipline that ensure auditability, should be  invaluable for safety-critical systems and, more generally, for  systems that play some sensitive societal roles. The work will  start from previously created systems Darwin-E and Moses,  integrating the capabilities of the two, scaling up the approach,  and exploring its use in a particular application domain.  ***",
