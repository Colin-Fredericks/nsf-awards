 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701180  Wise  The proposed research will investigate the dynamics of predation by generalist ground predators - wolf spiders (Lycosidae) and ground beetles (Carabidae) - on insect pests of vegetables. Carabids and lycosids, which consume a wide spectrum of herbivore species, also prey on each other - behavior defined as intraguild predation (IGP). Four specific questions will be addressed: (1) Does predation by lycosids and carabids suppress densities of herbivorous insects? (2) Do lycosids and carabids negatively impact populations of other predators? (3) Does IGP limit carabid and lycosid populations? (4) Does the size structure of the ground-predator guild influence its impact on herbivore populations? Manipulative field experiments will address the above questions by controlling immigration of lycosids and carabids into fenced vegetable gardens, and observing effects on pest densities, densities of other predators, and plant productivity. The field experiments will be complemented with laboratory feeding trials. The research will elucidate the extent to which IGP limits the impact of generalist predators on herbivore densities. Since the study will be conducted in an agricultural system, results will improve understanding of the limitations and strengths of indigenous generalist predators as biological control agents, which will contribute to their more effective use in integrated pest management.",
