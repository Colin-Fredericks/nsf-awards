 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729148  The International Community on Audio Displays (ICAD) will be  holding its 1997 conference in Palo Alto, California, from     November 2-5, 1997.  ICAD is a forum for presenting research on the  use of sound to display data, monitor systems, and provide enhanced  user interfaces for computers and virtual reality systems.  The  first day of ICAD'97 will be made up of workshops.  The purpose of  the workshops is to provide an informal setting where a small  number of researchers (no more than 20) can have directed, in-depth  discussions on singular topics of interest to the ICAD community.  A workshop on \"sonification\" related to representing data through  audio has been of considerable interest to many researchers in  ICAD.  Past efforts have explored ways to listen to discern  components of infrared spectra samples, hear trends in seismic  data, support programming and debugging, analyze financial data as  well as applications in numerous domains including medicine,  education and complex systems.  Of particular note is the use of  sonification in interfaces and applications for people with  disabilities -- visual impairments and learning and cognitive  disabilities.  Sonification can be used to complement or replace  visualizations.  As a complement, sonification helps to highlight  trends in data that are difficult to visualize and to offload the  complexity of the visualization.  As a replacement, sonification is  useful in  situations when hands-and-eyes are busy -- such as in a  medical operating room -- or when the users are temporarily or  permanently visually-impaired. This workshop will allow researchers  to assess the current state of sonification research and commercial  developments.  From this assessment, and sharing of experiences and  techniques, the participants can collectively form a research  agenda for future efforts.  The needed research agenda will be  useful to NSF and other organizations and agencies involved in  conducting or supporting basic research related to  sonification and  other audio displays.",
