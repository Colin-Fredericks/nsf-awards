 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML) is a research unit of the  University of California (UC)located on the Sonoma coast 70  miles north of San Francisco. Since 1966 the Laboratory has  provided unique opportunities for field research on a rich  flora and fauna in close proximity to the Laboratory  buildings.  BML has well-equipped laboratories, strong on-  site support staff and a firm commitment from the Davis  campus to continue developing  the facilities and support  needed by the growing number of resident and visiting  researchers. The Laboratory is located on the Bodega Marine  Reserve (BMR), a 362-acre protected field site with a  diverse set of marine and terrestrial coastal habitats.  Adjacent subtidal areas are protected and available for  study within the Bodega Marine Life Refuge.    Oceanographic and meteorological data are essential  components of many of the field studies conducted at the  site.  Environmental monitoring systems at BML have incurred  problems in recent years, and now require replacement and  upgrades to improve reliability, flexibility and  accessibility to researchers.  The oceanographic pressure  sensor, operating in the severely adverse conditions of a  shallow water, high energy nearshore environment, has been  inoperable since winter storms two years ago.  This project  will significantly improve the monitoring system to provide  automated, quality-controlled, oceanographic and  meterological data and a processing and management system  providing improved access to researchers.    System will provide researchers with measurements of wind  speed and direction, air temperature, relative humidity,  barometric pressure, rainfall, total solar radiation,  photosynthetically active radiation, surface seawater  temperature, and seawater salinity, all in real time.  With  data logger technology, tidal heights, directional waves,  directional currents, bottom temperature, and bottom  salinity will be monitored nearshore where such measurements  are important to intert idal and shallow subtidal  investigations.  In deeper water, an Acoustic Doppler  Current Profiler will monitor the ocean currents responsible  for transport of sediments, plankton, and larvae.  Re-  engineered data acquisition and management systems will  increase the number of variables surveyed, improve the  quality and reliability of data collected, and provide  researchers with greater access to on-line and archived data  via modem, local area network, and the Internet/World Wide  Web.",
