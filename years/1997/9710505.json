The research is to carry out a  molecular-phylogenetic analysis of 5 genera with extant  species in the major Tertiary refugia in western Asia  (Turkey) to determine the pattern of relationships among  them and extrapolate their biographic history.  This will be  accomplished by: employing a phylogenetic analysis to  measure the amount of evolutionary divergence among species  within the 5 genera; determining the pattern of  biogeographic relationships among species within each genus  and determining the degree to which the five genera have a  common biogeographic history; comparing biogeographic  patterns determined from the molecular analysis to all  available information from the fossil record; and  hypothesize a possible evolutionary history of the major  refugia, particularly the affinities of the refugial  vegetation in western Asia.    Scope: The research project is intended to shed light on the  details of the relationship between the flora in the humid  regions in the North Temperate zones of Eurasia and North  America (the Arco-Tertiary vegetation).  The field research  in Turkey will involve two graduate students from UNC, Alice  M. Stanford and Fatih Coskun.  The Turkish scientist, Dr.  Ozturk, is planning to spend part of the first year at UNC  to become competent in modern methods of molecular  systematics, so that he can continue with this work after  the duration of this award.   This proposal meets INT  objective of increasing U.S.-foreign collaboration in areas  that benefit both sides, and in enhancing the international  experience of women scientists and junior scientists.  This  award includes funds from the Division of International  Programs and the Division of Environmental Biology.    ***",
