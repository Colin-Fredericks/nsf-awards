 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goals of this project are to develop undergraduates' ability in applying molecular techniques to answer questions in the biological and environmental sciences and to expand the scope of student research in these areas.  Techniques such as DNA sequencing, protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction, and tissue culture need to be used in undergraduate laboratories if we expect students to be competitive in graduate school and in the workplace.  The Biology and Environmental Science Departments are incorporating these molecular techniques into upper-level biology and environmental science courses as part of their effort to encourage undergraduate research.  Students apply a broad range of molecular techniques to environmental and biology studies and gain better understanding of biological functions of nucleic acids and proteins.  Success of the program is determined by conducting pre- and post-tests of students' knowledge and ability to apply molecular techniques and by monitoring student research projects.  The degree to which curricula changes prepare graduates for the workplace and graduate study is also assessed.  Evaluation results and student papers can be presented at the educational sessions of several scientific meetings to allow other colleges to consider using this approach to improve their biology and environmental science laboratories.  Approximately 240 local high school science teachers, the 7,000 high school students that they teach, and 125 Upward Bound students and their instructors can also use most of the new equipment.  *",
