The award provides travel support and subsistence to Dr. Gaudiot for   his collaboration with the French researchers.  The objective of the research is to   investigate formal description and extension of parallelization techniques and algorithms   for compilation of programs written in a functional language (Sisal) and in a parallel object   oriented language (Eiffel).  They will also explore their effectiveness in designing parallel   programming.  The project takes advantage of access to a programming language known   as Eiffel which was developed by the French investigators.",
