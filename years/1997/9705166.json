 "awd_abstract_narration": "SMITH  DMS 9705166    General circulation models (GCMs) are numerical models used by climatologists to predict patterns of future climatological change as a result of greenhouse gases and other factors.  In recent years, much attention has been given to the verification of GCMs from observational data, through pattern correlation statistics which measure how well the observed and model-based data agree.  The current research is a collaboration between a statistician and a climatologist, developing new tests for the significance of pattern correlation statistics and for estimating tuning parameters such as the weight to be given to different components of the climate signal.  The methodology includes developing new spatial-temporal models for the distribution of climate data, combining nonstationarity in space with long-range-dependence in time.    The broader context of the work is the debate over global warming and in particular whether observed changes in climate can be ascribed to man-made causes such as the greenhouse gas effect or merely reflect climate variability due to natural causes.  New statistical tests, currently being developed by the Principal Investigator, allow more rigorous discrimination between the effects of greenhouse gases and those of other causes such as sulfate aerosols and changes in solar flux.  The project is contributing to the strategic area of environment and global change, in the form of new methods of assessing the causes of global climate change.",
