 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electromagnetics, as traditionally taught, often concentrates on rigorous preparation for further work without emphasizing applications.  This approach fails to meet the needs of the majority of electrical engineering students who are not going to be fields and waves specialists.  The project is adding a laboratory component to first-semester electromagnetics that directly establishes its relevance to modern electronic systems, including digital systems.  Seven sets of apparatus are being constructed, which will (1) demonstrate transmission of digital signals over long transmission lines; (2) allow the study of pulse propagation, reflection, and distortion; and (3) permit the study of crosstalk and other forms of unintended coupling in printed circuits.  Most importantly, the apparatus is being designed so that students can analyze these effects using ordinary benchtop instruments (function generators and oscilloscopes) with which they are already familiar. They are also able to design solutions to electromagnetic-oriented problems using standard electronic components.  Equipment for electromagnetic interference (EMI) measurements is also included.  This equipment allows measurements of field strength, radiation patterns, and spurious emissions.  Students can make compliance measurements on personal computers, and design shielding solutions to interference problems.  This project is affecting every student in the electrical engineering program. The result should be graduating engineers who are better able to apply electromagnetics principles in modern high-speed electronic systems.  *",
