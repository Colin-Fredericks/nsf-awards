 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to introduce a laser photolysis experiment in the undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory.  The students in the laboratory course represent a significant number of underrepresented groups who are being strongly encouraged to pursue careers in science and technology.  The new laboratory is a simplified version of the current experimental methods in kinetic measurements.  At the same time, it conserves all the main features of modern chemical kinetics.  The main teaching objectives of the new laboratory are (1) to make students familiar with one of the modern approaches of studying fast chemical reactions laser photolysis combined with a transient spectroscopy; (2) to familiarize students with the concept of isolation of an elementary reaction and the pseudo-first-order conditions; and (3) to demonstrate the kinetics and mechanism of ozone formation and hydrocarbon oxidation in the atmosphere.  The new experiment is assigned to students in the four sections (18/section) of physical chemistry laboratory each academic year.  Several faculty are evaluating the effectiveness of this experiment for undergraduates and working to modify the experiment when necessary to fit logically into the existing program.  In addition, the laboratory is being used in research on kinetics of oxidation of halogen substituted radicals conducted by undergraduate students during summer and regular semesters.",
