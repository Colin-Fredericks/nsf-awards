 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713932  Jawahir  The awarded research is aimed at developing a comprehensive predictive model for turning operations. Quantitative experiments will be conducted to classify various groups of chip flow, curl mechanisms, and breaking mechanisms for the development of appropriate relationships for generic turning modeling.  Relationships for chip-side and back-flow mechanisms will be developed using fracture mechanics for 3-D chip breaking, as well as techniques for quantifying the effects of tool-chip tribological interactions. The results will be used to develop a predictive model which has a wide range of variability to represent a large spectrum of conditions.  Besides being useful to the development of applied machinability for machining systems, this model will enable the design of innovative chip-groove geometries for cutters used in turning operations.  This award could lead to a fundamental understanding of the complex tool-chip interactions in turning with grooved tools and the development of an accurate model for predicting 3-D chip flow, curl and breaking processes as well as the corresponding stresses, strains and temperatures.  The study is also practically important, especially for total chip control in uninterrupted automated machining.",
