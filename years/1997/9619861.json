Participating students are grouped into three research teams each comprised of three students and one faculty mentor.  The students work on projects involving robotics, pen-based computing, and modeling of file system performance.  They have full access to the computing facilities of the University including specialized equipment such as a laser operated white board which supports one of the projects.  Activities include conducting research as part of a team, disseminating results, and participating in a community of scholars.  Substantial effort is placed on recruiting students underrepresented in computing, particularly women, and students from non-research institutions.  Participants have normally completed their sophomore or junior year of college and are majoring in computer science.",
