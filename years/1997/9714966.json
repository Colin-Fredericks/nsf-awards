 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714966 Gibson   This SGER project will explore a unique approach to forming large ordered arrays of nanometer-scale metal particles separated by dielectric barriers. The idea is to combine a gold-particle supermolecule with Langmuir-Blodgett film deposition methods; the approach involves a variety of experimentation in dealing with the ability of the hydrophobic tails to be able to float large gold-containing head groups. The impact of the project could be significant because the presence of a metal particle with an organic shell would allow extension of research on colloidal dielectric sphere arrays to studies of x-ray photonic bandgaps; analogous supermolecules could be made with a variety of metal and semiconductor cores.  If successful the technique would impact research in several areas including x-ray optics, mesoscale physics, and advanced electronic devices. The ordered arrays will be characterized by TEM, x-ray reflectance, and transport measurements. %%%  This project will explore a new and innovative approach to the synthesis of photonic nanometer structures from the broad perspectives of chemistry, physics, and materials science.  The idea being explored is the potential use of surface chemistry techniques for the formation of ordered arrays of ultra-small scale metal particles which have significant potential applications in several areas of science and technology. This project sets specific goals and methods for an initial study to test these ideas, and several key issues can be appropriately addressed and resolved by the project. ***",
