 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support of   the research of Professor Patrick Mariano at the University of New   Mexico.  The theme of the research will be single electron transfer (SET)   photochemistry.  Specific goals will be to define the mechanisms of   photoredox processes, to define the nature and reactivity patterns of   ion-radicals which are intermediates in SET reactions, and to develop new   SET-photochemical reactions.  Specific areas of investigation will be   heterolytic fragmentation reactions of SET-derived cation-radicals,   synthetic applications of SET-photochemical and metal-catalyzed oxidative   cyclization reactions, and the photochemical generation and reactions of   azomethine ylides.  Photochemical single electron transfer reactions provide reactive radical   and radical ion species which are of fundamental interest, as well as key   intermediates in a variety of technologically significant synthetic   applications.",
