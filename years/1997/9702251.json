 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will have two primary objectives: (1) to continue to extend the development and understanding of more advanced reinforcement learning schemes, which have demonstrated the ability to handle larger-scale problems and to mimic aspects of learning in the brain more than the conventional reinforcement  learning schemes; (2) to apply advanced reinforcement learning to the development of more powerful intelligent agents for the Internet--and to use this application as a stimulus to the development of more powerful designs.   For example, existing search engines for the Web are an extremely  important class of agent, but also very limited in their capability because they tend to rely on simple string-mating techniques, occasionally supplemented by -and+ and  -or+ operators and limited types of user-supplied clues.    This work will explore a novel approach to this problem,  based on a distributed system of intelligent  agents which focus on different domains but learn to understand each other, in effects.  If this approach is successful, it could have further implications well beyond the need for better search as such Ultimately it could contribute to the vision of converting the Internet itself into one large distributed intelligent  system.  This project will also include a substantial effort to apply these emerging  tools in education, and the development of new courses related to this work.",
