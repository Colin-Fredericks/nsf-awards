 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long Island University, established in 1926 in Brooklyn, NY,  is the recipient of ARI funds to relocate, consolidate, and renovate existing research space for the Departments of Biology and Chemistry in Metcalfe Hall.  Constructed in 1927, research space as currently configured in Metcalfe Hall cannot adequately support research in biology and chemistry.  Research activities are dispersed over six floors of Metcalfe and between two buildings creating an inconvenient, inefficient and discouraging arrangement for research groups. Biology faculty and students conduct research in the areas of molecular biology, cell biology, microbiology, and developmental biology, as Chemistry faculty and students engage in studies involving organic, inorganic, biochemistry, materials science, and theoretical calculations. Consolidating disparate spaces into two centrally cohesive research facilities will improve the overall efficiency of the research enterprise at the University.  In addition to reconfiguring space, renovations will include:  the upgrade of plumbing, air conditioning and lighting systems, removal of asbestos, the installation of fume hoods, exhausts ducts, and ensuring that laboratories meet ADA specifications.  Fixed equipment, including an autoclave, cold room and water distiller will also be installed.  The creating of focused and integrated research facilities will have a major impact on the quality and quantity of scientific research performed, and will provide research opportunities not feasible with current facilities.  Reflecting the rich ethnic and racial diversity of its urban environment, revitalized research facilities will sustain Long Island University in its endeavor to provide a quality education for minority students and equip all students with the scientific skills needed to compete in a changing technological society.",
