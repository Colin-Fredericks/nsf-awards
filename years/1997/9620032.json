 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Missouri has been selected as one of ten recipients of the National Science Foundation's Recognition Awards for the Integration of Research and Education.  The university has approached the integration of research and education in a comprehensive and systemic fashion by initiating changes that integrate research and education in many important areas of campus life.  New discovery-based introductory courses are being implemented to reach all undergraduates, including non-science majors.  Future K-12 teachers are being prepared to use discovery-based learning methods through -Pedagogy Intensive+ sections of science courses.  Residential communities for freshmen are being established in which interdisciplinary group research is promoted and reinforced.  Persistence of female and minority students is being increased through engagement in freshman research experiences.  A capstone experience is being established for all students.  New support mechanisms are being created to promote faculty participation.  The university's efforts to integrate research and education were designed with specific outcomes in mind: increasing the representation of research methods in all courses; increasing student and faculty participation in mentored research projects; increasing the representation of female and minority students among science and engineering graduates; increasing retention rates for all science and engineering students; improving critical thinking and learning skills among science and engineering students; and improving the understanding of and appreciation for science and engineering among all students.  The university has achieved noteworthy success in achieving these important goals.  The university is being awarded $500,000 with the goal of expanding, documenting, and disseminating its exemplary practices over the coming three years.  Plans for the use of the award funds include: continued curriculum development; creation of a research internship-bridge program with Missouri industry; a longitudinal study of program participants with an appropriate control group; publication of assessment results in peer refereed journals; local workshops; and a national conference with published proceedings.",
