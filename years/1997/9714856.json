Two research programs have been recently  conducted, one in the US and the other in the People's Republic  of China, on integrated earthquake hazard mitigation strategies  for metropolitan cities.  The programs produced two computer loss  estimation software systems, HAZUS97 bu RMS, Inc., and P95-06 by  IEM of the State Seismological Bureau, respectively, which are  similar in scope but otherwise differ significantly in content.   This reflects the differences in natural and institutional focus.   This project will involve a joint effort to study the two  software systems to understand their similarities and  differences, with a view towards improving both.  In addition to  joint activities of exchange and cooperation, important tasks to  be performed include assessing the extension of HAZUS97 to other  countries with different seismic, geologic and building stock  conditions.  ***",
