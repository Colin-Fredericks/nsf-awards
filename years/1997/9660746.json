 "awd_abstract_narration": "9660746  McDonald       This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) I project will design and test key components of an advanced coring system.  The research will address real-time monitoring of the core length in the barrel and closure of the barrel opening to prevent core loss.  While partial or complete core loss is generally not a problem in competent formations, it is a serious problem in unconsolidated and highly fractured ones.  Partial core loss is experienced in approximately 20% of wells cored, representing considerable costs.  Phase I will combine acoustic measurement technology with a high speed, microprocessor-based data acquisition system and mud-pulse telemetry unit.  The acoustic sensors will be deployed along the inner core barrel.  The microprocessor will transmit the status of the coring operation to the surface by controlling the position of a valve located above the core barrel to modulate standpipe pressure using a pulsewidth modulation scheme.  The bottom of the core barrel will be fitted with a springloaded valve which fully closes to prevent core loss.  The valve is actuated by momentarily increasing the mud flow rate.       Commercial applications are expected in geologic investigation, fossil fuel exploration, and environmental remediation.  This technology will be compatible with conventional and wireline-retrievable coring systems for use in commercial coring services.",
