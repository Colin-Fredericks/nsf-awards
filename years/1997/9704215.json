 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704215  Eberhardt  This grant will support senior design projects to aid  persons with disabilities, for Mechanical Engineering (ME)  students, at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).  Projects are geared toward providing alternative, low cost,  custom designed devices and software that will directly aid  specific disabled individuals or groups of individuals.  They include devices to assist in environmental control,  communication augmentation, motorized devices for lifting or  grabbing and alarm systems which combine visual and auditory  warnings, just to name a few.  Project ideas have been  provided by United Cerebral Palsy (UCP) of Birmingham and  the Alabama Department of Rehabilitation Services (ADRS).  In addition, a cross-UAB-campus collaboration has been  established including Occupational Therapy, Spain  Rehabilitation, Orthopedic Surgery and the Injury Control  and Research Center, who have provided project ideas which  combine depth in both engineering and life sciences.    A three-member advisement committee will ensure adequate  student supervision and quality development of the project  device.  This committee will include the PI, one ME faculty  with expertise in the project area, and a collaborating  investieator from UCP, ADRS or UAB.  The fact that the  designs will be constructed, tested and used by the disabled  individuals will provide meaningful design experience for  the engineering student while serving the disabled  community.  This form of highly visible, funded senior  design projects will serve as an exceptional recruiting tool  to attract better students to the UAB School of Engineering.  It will further strengthen the collaborative link between  Engineering and the UAB Hospital and promote a planned  industrial track in Rehabilitation Engineering through the  UAB Department of Biomedical Engineering.  Links with local  industry will improve regional visibility of UAB, will  increase cooperation with the local community to the benefit  of both, and will  increase employment opportunities for  graduating ME seniors.  These same links will serve to  leverage funding at greater levels from industry, government  agencies and foundations to support this worthwhile effort.  ***",
