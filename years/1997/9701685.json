 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701685  Sooryakumar    This  renewal project will support the study, via inelastic light  scattering  methods,  of  exchange  coupling  mechanisms   across  magnetic  interfaces  separated by an ultra  thin  spacer  layer.  Special tri-layer structures with the ability to tune the  Stoner  exchange parameter will allow details of the spacer magnetic  and  electronic  structure  that  directly  controls  the  inter-layer  exchange   to   be   probed  and  provide  information   on   the  antiferromagnetic properties of ultra thin metallic films. Domain  wall  excitations  will also be exploited  to  study  inter-layer  coupling over microscopic length scales. In addition, the  strong  spin-lattice  and charge-lattice couplings in the  mixed  valence  manganites will be investigated by light scattering. This  effort  will  allow  for the unusual, but decidedly important,  interplay  between magnetic and structural effects in these materials to  be  studied.  %%%  This renewal project will support a laser spectroscopic study  of  magnetism  in layered structures that are likely to underlie  the  next  generation  magnetic  data storage  and  magneto-electronic  devices.   The  study  focuses on understanding  the  interaction  between  magnetic films separated by a few atomic layers  and  to  develop an experimental technique to probe this interaction  over  length scales not realized by other methods.  In addition,  since  the  electrical resistance of special manganite compounds can  be  tuned  by a magnetic field, these materials open new perspectives  into  novel  devices  based  on the spin  of  an  electron.   The  underlying  physics  associated with  the  coupling  between  the  electron  spin and crystal structure of these materials  will  be  investigated by laser light scattering methodologies.  ***",
