 "awd_abstract_narration": "9605044    This award provides short term support for a collection of  over 500 mutant zebrafish recently isolated by the grantee.  The funds will support distribution of mutants to other  researchers on request, and the preparation of frozen sperm of  each mutant strain that will be used to help found a permanent  collection at the University of Oregon sometime in the next  year.  Over the last few years, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has  emerged as a promising model system for genetic studies of  vertebrate development.  This small tropical fish has a  generation time of about 3 months and lays large numbers of  eggs.  The eggs are fertilized externally and develop into  transparent embryos.  For these reasons, the fish is amenable  to genetic analysis and experimental manipulation at a cost  significantly less than that of  the mouse, the only other  widely used model system for genetic studies of vertebrate  development.  Although the development of the requisite  techniques is relatively recent, a large and growing number of  investigators have begun to use the organism.",
