This period begins with the completion of the first computer and ends at a time when most research universities had established a Ph.D. program in computer science and many colleges and universities had opened undergraduate programs.  This project will result in drafts of some of the chapters of the history, will include several oral history interviews and will culminate in a proposal for completion of the overall effort.",
