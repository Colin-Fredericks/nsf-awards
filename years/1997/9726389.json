Many of the components in these products will be integrated circuits and MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) fabricated with massively parallel wafer etching technology. Conventional pick and place robotic techniques are inadequate for the efficient assembly of these micron-scale components. This proposal addresses an entirely new methodology founded on recent insights from sensorless and minimalist robotics: massively parallel manipulation.    The idea is to move parts using planar forces and moments that require a minimum of sensing and servoing. The shape of the field, as defined by the magnitude and direction of the force at each point, can be designed to position, align, sort, and assemble arrays of small parts in parallel.    Planar force fields have enormous potential for precise parallel assembly of small parts. The goal of the research is to develop an entirely new methodology for precision part manipulation and to demonstrate it with new theory, algorithms, and high-performance devices. This research has the potential to parallelize the manufacture of a new generation of consumer and industrial products.",
