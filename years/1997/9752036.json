 "awd_abstract_narration": "MPR Associates is preparing two multimedia curriculum packages to support curricular initiatives in both secondary schools and community colleges. Each module permits independent study, encourages collaboration among students, and provides a compendium of resources to assist students in addressing authentic workplace issues.  The project is taking place over three years during which two scenarios are being constructed and tested in NSF systemic initiative sites and elsewhere.  They are being built around the design and maintenance issues raised by the Boeing 777.    These materials will lead to strong learning experiences for high school students headed for careers as technicians in workplaces that rely on the use of advanced technologies.  The focus will be on careers in aviation and the mathematics, science, and technology subjects that arise in important and engaging ways within this industry.     National mathematics, science, and technology standards will be incorporated into two \"electronic scenarios\" combining video, graphics, gaming, simulation, and text into a computer-managed multimedia package, Products of this grant will include the complete multimedia curriculum packages, a teacher's guide, and evaluation and dissemination activities.",
