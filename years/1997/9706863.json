 "awd_abstract_narration": "Churchill  9706863       The investigator develops new statistical methods for  problems in molecular biology.  Three problem areas are  addressed: sequence alignment, phylogeny construction and genetic  mapping.  Although diverse and individually well developed, these  problems can be unified under a common statistical framework.  In  each problem, a graph-valued random variable is of primary  interest.  Hierarchical Bayesian models are developed for each  problem with an emphasis on common features.  The techniques used  to compute posterior probabilities from these models are Markov  chain Monte Carlo methods.  This computational approach is  neccessary because analytic solutions for these problems are not  attainable.  The overall goal of this project is to develop an  inference framework that is of general utility in a variety of  problems.  Toward this end, simple models are considered first.  The simple models are generalized to the extent that it is  feasible.  This project does not solve all of the problems of  computational molecular biology.  The purpose of investigating a  broad range of problems is to develop a common framework for  statistical inference.       This project develops new methods for the analysis of data  that arise in molecular biology and genetics.  These statistical  methods have a wide variety of applications and are motivated by  the dramatic increase in molecular data due to the expansion of  biotechnology and the human genome project.  Ultimately this  leads to a deeper understanding of evolution and the  relationships among different groups of organisms and their  individual genes.  It also addresses the problem of locating the  genes that affect specific traits in humans, plants and animals.  The greatest potential impact is on gene mapping in agricultural  plants, due to ongoing collaborations with plant breeders at  Cornell University.  Although the project emphasizes statistical  theory underlying the analysis of data, the methods are  implemented in softw are that is useful to other researchers.",
