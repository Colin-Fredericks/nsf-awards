 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT 9724012  Hines        This U.S.-Slovenian research project between Mark Hines of the University of Alaska, Anchorage, and Jadran Faganeli of the University of Ljubljana, Marine Biological Station, will examine the concentration, transport and dynamics of methylmercury in the aquatic ecosystems of the Idrija River system.  Findings will be compared with parallel research on the Carson River in Nevada.  Similarities and differences in these two systems will permit some delineation controls for net methylmercury formation and transport models.  Results are expected to improve our ability to understand and predict the potential impact on human life and aquatic food chains from mercury cycling in rivers.    The objectives of this multi-disciplinary investigation include: 1) locating sources and sinks of methylmercury; 2) studying bacterial processes such as mercury methylation and demethylation, genetic controls, and terminal decomposition processes; 3) defining the relationship between the sulfur cycle and mercury methylation and demethylation; and 4) examination of the effects of the marine environment on the transformation of mercury transported to the sea.  As planned, the full effort involves the conduct of a survey along a gradient from pristine sites through contaminated regions to help develop a simulation model that can guide research and aid in determining how changes in the system may affect methylmercury flux and bioaccumulation.    This project in ecology, earth sciences and environmental remediation fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.           ??",
