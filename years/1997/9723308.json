 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723308  Copley  Tetrachlorohydroquinone (TCHQ) dehalogenase is found in Sphingomonas chlorophenolica, a Gram-negative soil bacterium that completely degrades pentachlorophenol, a widely used wood preservative. This enzyme catalyzes two successive reductive dehalogenations to convert TCHQ to trichlorohydroquinone and then to dichlorohydroquinone.  The reducing equivalents for each step are provided by two molecules of glutathione. Previous work in the investigator's laboratory has shown that TCHQ dehalogenase is evolutionarily related to enzymes in the theta class of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily and that it, like the GSTs, catalyzes the nucleophilic attack of glutathione upon an electrophilic substrate to form a glutathione conjugate.  However, TCHQ dehalogenase has additional capabilities that allow it to convert glutathione conjugates to reduced products by replacement of the glutathionyl moiety with a hydrogen.  This study focuses on the catalytically important processes that are unique to TCHQ dehalogenase.  Catalytic acids and bases will be identified and their pKa values determined.  The role of a 20-amino acid insert that is not present in GSTs and that may provide part of a second glutathione binding site will be explored.  Pre-steady state kinetic experiments will be carried out to characterize catalytic events and conformational changes taking place during a single-turnover.  Finally, efforts to crystallize the enzyme will continue.    Chlorinated organic compounds, including many pesticides, are important environmental pollutants.  A number of these compounds are persistent in the environment, toxic and/or carcinogenic, and some may disrupt endocrine function in humans and wildlife.  Biodegradation of these compounds requires removal of chlorine atoms.  This type of reaction is catalyzed by microbial enzymes called dehalogenases. Tetrachlorohydroquinone dehalogenase catalyzes a key step in the biodegradation of pentachlorophenol, a widely used wood preservative.  Th e investigator will study the mechanism of this enzyme and its relationship to a broad class of detoxification enzymes that catalyze reactions that are similar in some respects.  This work will lead to a greater understanding of the evolution of enzymes for biodegradation of toxic chlorinated organic compounds.",
