Similarly, it is also known  that  such  organisms  are  capable  of secreting  complexating  agents  that  change   trace  metal  speciation,  making  them  more  or   less  assimilable  and more or less toxic.  It is known that  the  very  low  concentrations at which trace metals are present in  surface  waters   of   the  central  ocean  gyres  may  limit   biological  production, as has been demonstrated recently for iron.           In   this  project,  investigators  from  the  Woods  Hole  Oceanographic  Institution  and the  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology will study these phenomena as a two-way street:  water  column  trace metals affecting oceanic microbial communities  and  oceanic  microbial communities affecting the water  column  trace  metal  chemistry.  The studies will involve field (Sargasso  Sea)  and  laboratory  studies with two species  of  cyanobacteria  and  their  biogeochemical relationship with cobalt, iron, and  copper  in  the  water  column.  The primary emphasis will be  on  cobalt  because  of  its  importance as a micronutrient  and  because  so  little  is  know  about its chemical speciation  in  the  oceanic  environment.",
