 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of law firms in California's Silicon Valley, supported under the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program. It links organizational sociology with the sociology of law to explore the role of law firms, as organizational and legal actors, in local development.      The project integrates three objectives -- theoretical, empirical, and educational. Theoretically, the project will address ongoing debates over the characteristics of emerging organizational communities, over the interorganizational impact of the modern law firm, and over the role of formal contracts as economic governance mechanisms. Empirically, the project will construct and analyze two related data sets, one on the origins and effects of a key Silicon Valley legal device (the standardized venture capital financing contract, or \"VCFC\"), and the other on the structure and dynamics of the larger Silicon Valley legal community. The VCFC Study will allow multivariate statistical analysis of the emergence and diffusion of a novel contractual device within a new organizational field.  The Legal Community Study will explore the dynamics of the heretofore largely unstudied population of professional organizations that promulgated this legal innovation. Educationally, the project will introduce a sequence of innovative, experiential courses in legal and organizational sociology, whereby undergraduate and graduate students will gain new insights into the socio-legal environment of entrepreneurship and into the structure of professional careers.      The design incorporates three components -- two empirical and one instructional. To examine the emergence, diffusion and impact of the standardized VCFC, the project will compile data on approximately 300 first-round high-technology financings, occurring from 1975 to 1990. Data collection will link content-analytic information on the terms of each VCFC with (a) contextual data on the economic and institutional conditions surrounding the transaction and (b) outcome data on  the subsequent fate of the start-up company. Data analyses will seek to identify distinct \"financing archetypes,\" and to uncover the determinants and effects of choosing one such archetype over another. To examine the structure and dynamics of the Silicon Valley legal community, the project will compile longitudinal data on the population of law firms operating in the region -- and on the population of attorneys practicing within those firms -- from 1960 to 1990. Data analyses will examine whether the fates of these legal actors were shaped by the development of the surrounding organizational community and by the actors' own adoption or rejection of specific interorganizational roles. Finally, to integrate these empirical efforts into an ongoing program of teaching and research, the project will develop two new seminars, emphasizing experiential and collaborative learning techniques. The first seminar will focus on Law, Innovation and Entrepreneurship; the second, on the Sociology of the Legal Profession. The project will also enhance preexisting courses and launch a number of extramural outreach efforts.      Silicon Valley offers a rare opportunity to examine the mechanics of entrepreneurship and community development, and to link these crucial organizational phenomena to the activities of concrete inter-organizational pollinators. Previous research suggests that Silicon Valley law firms often play this pollinator role, transmitting basic operating know-how between otherwise isolated start-ups. Over time, it is likely that such activities have transformed the local business community, giving rise to institutionalized practices that today's community members largely take for granted. At the same time, however, local law firms have, themselves, experienced numerous pressures emanating from the turbulent environment around them. Thus, these firms must be seen as both creations and creators of the shifting community order, simultaneously shaping and reflecting surrounding flows of resources and i nformation in an ongoing coevolutionary interchange. A fuller understanding of this complex process promises to shed light on critical issues regarding organizational innovation, regional development, and the role of the legal profession in economic change.",
