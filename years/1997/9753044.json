 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bottlenose dolphins are characterized by a fission-fusion society, an elaborate communication system (e.g., vocal learning, acoustic memory, individual signatures, sonar) and long-term mother-offspring bonds (infants nurse for 3-6 years).  Dolphin mothers and infants appear to simulate the fission-fusion society at large by separating and rejoining frequently from the earliest days of infancy.  The communication system is likely to be the primary modality for maintenance of such bonds, yet no studies have identified how individuals use acoustic signals to indicate identity, location, or motivational state, and thus how they can coordinate movements over long distances.  The aims of this study are (a) to determine the functions (motivation, localization, individual identification) of bottlenose dolphin signature and non-signature whistles by examining their use in natural behavioral contexts and responses during whistle playback experiments; and (b) to determine how bottlenose dolphin mother-infant pairs coordinate separations and reunions over large distances.  Studies of dolphin communication have been limited because it is difficult for humans to localize the signaller and record the full spectrum of their high frequency calls.  However, with localization methods (an acoustic array) and high-frequency recording, Dr. Mann can determine who is calling, examine the use of \"eavesdropping\" among bottlenose dolphins, and explore the mechanisms and functions of their complex communication system.",
