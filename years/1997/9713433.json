 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713433  Ahzi  The mechanical processing of high temperature  superconducting tapes and wires is modeled by:  (1)  developing advanced micromechanical modeling of the elastic-  plastic response of compacted high temperature  superconducting powders with particular applications to Bi-  based oxides (BSCCO); and (2) implementing these models to  simulate wire drawing and tape rolling and pressing of the  oxide-powder-in-tube (OPIT) process for the fabrication of  superconductina tapes and wires.  The fabrication of the  BSCCO superconductors (tapes and wires) produced by the OPIT  process with optimal mechanical and electrical transport  properties is currently limited due to the lack of  understanding of the mechanical response during the  densification of powder oxides. Predictive tools for the  simulation and design of advanced processing methodologies  for producing long wires and tapes with optimal properties  are developed under this project. Physically-based models  for the polycrystalline matrix fully coupled with the  porosity modeling are developed.  These models are based on  rate-dependent plasticity and have the unique ability to  predict the evolution of texturing during plastic  deformation and the evolution of the relative density of the  materials.  For superconductors, both mechanical and most  importantly electrical properties are strongly dependent on  the the final texture, relative density, and on the presence  of microcracks.  Therefore, physically-based material models  with the ability of coupling the texturing, porosity and  microcracking effects provide a better understanding of the  mechanical response during mechanical processing of these  materials. The phenomenon of non-conformity (instability) in  the sectional area of the superconducting core of rolled  tapes, inherent to the rolling of two-phase composite  workpiece (Ag-sheathed BSCCO) is studied using  micromechanical models which account for the porosity,  textural hardening (locking), and weakening due to  micr ocracking in the superconducting core.  The modeling and  computational efforts are extended to simulate fabrication  of multifilamentary superconductors.  ***",
