 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705202  Kelton    The atomic structures of titanium-based quasicrystals and  related phases, the formability of the quasicrystal and  crystal approximants, the role of impurities in phase  formation, and the nature of the phase transitions  connecting the quasicrystal and the crystal approximants,  are as yet poorly understood.  Pursuing successes under the  past grant period, these points are explored in titanium and  zirconium-based quasicrystals and related crystal phases.  Subjects include: (1)  the investigation of the role of  interstitial impurities on icosahedral phase formation; (2)  the hydrogenation characteristics of quasicrystals, related  crystalline and amorphous phases, and the  hydrogen/quasicrystal phase diagram and pressure/composition  isotherms; (3) X-ray and neutron diffraction to determine  the atomic decoration of stable crystal approximants in  TiZrTM alloys; (4)  investigations of the sequence of phase  formation in TiCrSiO, TiZrNi, and TiZrFe alloys; and (5)  the nature of the phase transitions between the stable  icosahedral-phase and the rational approximant phases in  TiZrNi alloys.  Several collaborations are underway,  including studies of phase formation aided by drop-tube  experiments in collaboration with Cambridge University, UK;  the stabilizing role of impurities by magnetic  susceptibility measurements in collaboration with scientists  at Washington University; neutron scattering studies of  hydrogenated (and deuterated) quasicrystals in collaboration  with Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR), and  Saclay, France; NMR studies of samples with Knox College,  IL.  The elastic neutron scattering and NMR studies lead to  a better understanding of the distribution, symmetry and  chemistry of the hydrogen containing sites in the TiZrNi  quasicrystals.  These data will be used to refine  quasicrystal models constructed from determined structures  for the crystal approximant phases.  Inelastic neutron and  NMR studies allow estimates to be made to hydrogen  diffusion  rates in the quasicrystal.  %%%  This research provides fundamental knowledge related to the  potential for quasicrystal alloys to function as hydrogen  storage materials.  ***",
