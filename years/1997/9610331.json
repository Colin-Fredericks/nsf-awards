 "awd_abstract_narration": "9610331  Gray    The Boston Research Data Center is now in its third year of operation with 15 research projects underway or due to start soon.  Located at the Census Bureau's Boston regional office, the BRDC provides researchers in the Boston area with access to a variety of confidential Census datasets in a secure setting.  The data would otherwise be available only at Census Bureau offices in Maryland, which would severely limit the ability of Boston researchers to participate.  Most of the projects at the BRDC use plant-level Census data on manufacturing industries, linked in some cases to other Census datasets.  Several of the projects address environmental issues, using data from EPA and a Census survey on pollution abatement costs.  These researchers have formed an \"environmental group\", with regular meetings to pool information and discuss reassert strategies.  future research projects are likely in these areas, but one of the strengths of the BRDC is that it can provide access to a wide range of Census data.  BRDC projects have already examined agricultural sharecropping, the earned income tax credit, and human resource policies.  The additional two years of support will provide the time necessary to implement a plan for permanent funding of the BRDC, combining institutional support from the Boston Federal Reserve with laboratory fees from supported research projects.        ??",
