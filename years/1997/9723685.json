The model system used in these studies is the induction of plant defense responses, specifically   phytoalexin accumulation, in soybean (Glycine max) by oligosaccharides (elicitors) originating from the   mycelial wall of a phytopathogenic oomycete, Phytophthora sojae var. glycines.  Considerable information   has accrued about the structure of an elicitor (a branched hepta-beta-glucoside) derived from mycelial wall   glucans and about the identity and regulation of elicitor-induced genes encoding enzymes required for the   biosynthesis of the phytoalexins.  However, little is known about the mechanisms by which plant cells   perceive the elicitor, or how that signal is transmitted to the cell nucleus to initiate changes in gene   expression. The research described in this proposal focuses on the first step in the elicitor-stimulated   signal transduction pathway, namely the recognition of a hepta-beta-glucoside elicitor by a plasma   membrane-localized receptor.  Recent studies strongly suggest that the 75 kDa polypeptide previously   thought to be a hepta-beta-glucoside elicitor-binding protein (EBP) is, in fact, a non-specific glucan-  binding protein.  Preliminary studies using modified extraction procedures and photo-affinity labeling   have now identified a 90 kDa polypeptide as a candidate EBP.  The overall goal of the research proposed   in this application is to identify, purify, and clone EBPs from soybean root membranes and to obtain   evidence that the EBPs are physiological receptors for the hepta-beta-glucoside elicitor.  The first specific   goal is to identify and purify EBPs.  The number and identity of polypeptides in solubilized membrane   protein preparations that have hepta-beta-glucoside elicitor-binding sites will be established by photo-  affinity labeling. The specificity of the photo-affinity labeling will be rigorously established in l igand   competition assays with oligoglucosides structurally related to the hepta-beta-glucoside elicitor.   Polypeptides present in the membranes that bind to elicitor-inactive beta-glucans will be eliminated first   and then the EBPs will be purified by ligand-affinity chromatography.  Partial amino acid sequences will   be determined for the polypeptide(s) found to have a specific hepta-beta-glucoside elicitor-binding site.    The second specific goal is to obtain antibodies against the EBPs.  These antibodies will be used to   localize EBPs in plant tissues and to isolate genes encoding EBPs.  The third specific goal is to clone   cDNA(s) that encode EBPs.  Degenerate oligonucleotides will be synthesized and used to amplify, by   PCR, a double-stranded DNA probe from a heterogeneous population of single-stranded cDNAs made   from soybean root mRNA.  This probe will be used to screen a lambda gt10 library for cDNAs encoding   EBPs.  Alternatively, antibodies generated against affinity-purified EBPs will be used to screen a cDNA   expression library for clones expressing EBP sequences.  Any cDNA clones that are obtained will be   purified and sequenced.  The ability of the protein(s) encoded by the cloned cDNA(s) to bind the hepta-  beta-glucoside elicitor specifically and with high affinity will be determined.  The cDNA clones and their   derived sequences will be used to identify possible structural and functional domains in the EBPs that   might relate to their role in signal transduction. The research outlined in this renewal application will lay   the groundwork for future work that will test whether the EBPs function as physiological receptors and to   identify and characterize components that interact with EBPs and might function downstream of the   receptor in the cellular signaling pathway that results in the accumulation of phytoalexins in elicited plant   cells.  The results of these studies should provide additional insight into the mechanisms used by plant   cells to perceive and  respond to extracellular signals.  These studies should also increase our   understanding of the roles of carbohydrate signal molecules (oligosaccharins) in the regulation of   biological processes in diverse organisms.    Plants perceive and respond to pathogen attack. The perception of the infection of a pathogen is mediated   by the detection of specific compounds termed elicitors are associated with the attack. Cell surface   proteins detect the presence of these elicitors which signal a variety of processes within the plant cell to   marshal defense reactions. Dr. Hahn has identified a soybean cell-surface protein that binds an elicitor   originating from the pathogen Phytophthora. The binding appears to be highly specific to a single protein   and has characteristics that make it a candidate for the elicitor receptor. With this award Dr. Hahn will   purify and isolate the receptor protein. Data obtained from the purified protein will be used to obtain a   cDNA clone of the elicitor binding protein. The results of this research will yield information on the   mechanisms by which plants perceive infection of pathogens. This information is extremely important in   understanding how plants maintain growth in a hostile world and it has potential practical applications I   improving and modifying a plants response to pathogen challenge.    ***",
