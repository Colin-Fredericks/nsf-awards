 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604487  DonCarlos         Testosterone plays a fundamental role in the  development of the vertebrate nervous system.   Exposure to  this hormone during sensitive periods influences the  morphology, connectivity, and chemistry of the central  nervous system.  These early developmental effects of  testosterone set the stage for adult sex differences in  physiological and behavioral functions.  Brain regions that  are known to be sexually differentiated in the presence of  perinatal testosterone include areas involved in the control  of reproductive physiology and behavior, learning and  memory, cognition, play and social behavior, and aggression.  While testosterone is the major hormone of the perinatal  testes, this steroid can be converted enzymatically to  estrogen and to other androgens in the brain.  Thus, it  became widely believed that most, if not all, of the effects  of testosterone during the sensitive periods of development  resulted from its metabolism.  Indeed estrogen and estrogen  receptors are known to be present in the brain during  development and to participate in the differentiation  process.   More and more evidence is accumulating, however,  that suggests testosterone itself plays an important role.  Since androgen receptors are believed to be an integral  component of its action, Dr. DonCarlos will use    in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to identify  when, where, and in what cell types androgen receptor is  being expressed in the developing brain.  She will also  determine whether there are sex differences in androgen  receptor expression, and, if so, when such differences are  evident.  The results from these studies will contribute to  our understanding of the normal developmental process of  sexual differentiation of brain function, and will also  provide more general insights into how intrinsic properties  of neural development are modified by exposure to external  signals.",
