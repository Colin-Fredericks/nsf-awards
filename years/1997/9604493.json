Cohen, Department of Physics, University of California,  Berkeley, to pursue with Dr. Kee Joo Chang, Department of  Physics, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology  (KAIST), and Dr. Jisoon Ihm, Center for Theoretical Physics,  Seoul National University, for 24 months, a program of  cooperative research on the dielectric response function and its  applications to solid systems.  Applications will be made to  investigate optical properties, quasiparticle excitations  energies, electron-electron repulsive interactions in  superconductors, and dielectric screening of large systems.    Recent theoretical advances, going beyond the standard momentum  space formalism, have allowed the efficient first-principles  calculation of the dielectric matrix and the electronic structure  of solids.  The significance of the proposed research is to  provide deeper insight into the understanding of electron-  electron interactions in solids, in particular, those manifested  in exchange-correlation effects and local-field screening.  The  collaborators are recognized experts in the field of this  research.  Their collaboration, which will include their graduate  students, is intended to provide an intellectual bridge between  the U.S. and Korea in this field of science.  This project is  relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science  Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between  U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of  scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  This project  provides an international research experience for a U.S. graduate  student.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
