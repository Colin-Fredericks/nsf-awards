 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program supports Professor Daniel J. O'Leary, of   the Department of Chemistry at Pomona College, with a Research in   Undergraduate Institutions award for his studies of the synthesis and   conformational analysis of novel carbohydrate and polypeptide structures.    Working with undergraduate researchers, Professor O'Leary investigates   the pattern of hydrogen bonding networks in partially isotopically   exchanged diols designed to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, using NMR   isotopic perturbation techniques and appropriate theoretical analysis to   reveal hydrogen bonds and their arrays.  In order to probe the extent to   which long-range interactions help stabilize or destabilize carbohydrate   conformations in solution, Professor O'Leary synthesizes oligosaccharides   as models for hyaluronic acid and examines their conformational   preferences.  Synthesis of carbocyclic analogs of malformin A1, a   bicyclic pentapeptide containing a cyclo-cystine structural element,   helps to address the unusual conformational behavior of this naturally   occurring substance.  Professor Daniel J. O'Leary, of the Department of Chemistry at Pomona   College, is supported by the Organic Synthesis Program with a Research in   Undergraduate Institutions award for his studies of the three-dimensional   shapes (conformations) of biologically relevant molecules in solution.    Through the synthesis of comparatively simple model compounds and the use   of nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, Professor O'Leary probes the   factors controlling the specific shapes adopted by these molecules and,   by inference, the larger molecules for which they serve as models.  These   studies, carried out by undergraduate researchers, are expected to answer   questions regarding the effects of various groupings of atoms within   molecules on their conformational behavior, an issue of fundamental   importance in a wide range of fields, from biology to physical chemistry.",
