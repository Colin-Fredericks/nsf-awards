 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706961   Lopez and Shen      This project is to study dynamic control and parametric excitations in  hydrodynamic systems and to examine the interplay between parametric  resonance and stabilization/destabilization of  transitions/bifurcations, through an integrated program of analysis,  computation and experiment. Two basic flow sets, namely the  Taylor-Couette flow and vortex breakdown flow, have been chosen in  order to develop a general understanding of the complex hydrodynamics  and control strategies. These generic flows are attractive because the  degree of complexity can be precisely controlled by relatively simple  changes in the flow state or boundary conditions, and at the same time  they possess rich dynamics which are representative of a wide class of  general hydrodynamic systems that may respond to dynamic control in a  complex manner. In particular, these classes of flows may respond  resonantly to the parametric excitation of the applied control. An  investigation of the behavior of these generic flows will help to form  a better understanding of more general time-dependent hydrodynamic  systems. The interplay between dynamic control mechanisms and  parametric resonance will be investigated using (linear) Floquet theory  as a first step in understanding the dynamics at the point of  transition or bifurcation. Flows beyond the validity of the Floquet  analysis will be studied using three different nonlinear computational  approaches, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Their  combined implementation is capable of resolving a wide range of  problems and addressing distinct issues within each problem. The  results from the experiment will be used to refine the analysis and  control implementation.    This research will not only result in a deeper understanding of the  complex spatio-temporal dynamics of hydrodynamic systems, but will also  make a significant practical impact. For example, in the aerodynamics  industry, the control strategies will aid in drag reduction a nd reduced  fatigue due to aero-acoustic structural resonances; in fact, parametric  excitation in the form of span-wise oscillations of the boundary has  recently been demonstrated experimentally to reduce drag in turbulent  boundary layers by researchers at the University of Texas and others.  In the materials and chemical processing industries, many of the  manufacturing processes rely on an effective control of transitions and  instabilities. The new fundamental and practical insights on control  dynamics of complex systems anticipated from this research can provide  U.S. industry with a competitive edge.",
