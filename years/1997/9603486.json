 "awd_abstract_narration": "Construction of a detector for use in relativistic  heavy ion experiments will be carried out.  The detector  will be sited at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at  Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The detector, known as  PHOBOS, will provide a first look at the behavior and decay  of matter at the extreme energy densities that will be  created in gold-on-gold collisions with energies of  100GeV/nucleon in the center-of-mass system.  This work is  aimed at characterizing the hypothesized quark-gluon plasma  which is created in such energetic collisions, and in which  quarks and gluons are thought to be deconfined, unlike the  case in normal hadronic matter.  Specific elements of the  PHOBOS detector associated with the present activity include  the particle identification system which will permit the  different mesons coming from decay of the quark-gluon plasma  to be separately identified, which is important to  characterizing the properties of the plasma.      The data gathered by PHOBOS will extend our knowledge  of matter to energies and densities thought to have existed  only in the first microseconds of the early universe.  This  topic is a high priority within US nuclear science, as  established by the joint NSF/DOE Nuclear Science Advisory  Committee in its 1996 Long Range Plan.  Education of  students and postdocs is a strong component of this  experimental program.",
