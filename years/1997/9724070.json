 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for support of US scientists' participation in a `US-Egypt Workshop: Preparation and Applications of Ultra-Fine particulates, Cairo, Egypt, November 15-16, 1997`.  The US leader is Dr. Hassan El-Shall of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Florida, Gainesville.  The Egyptian co-organizer of the workshop is Dr. Adel K. Ismail, of the Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute (CMRDA) in Helwan, Egypt.  The purpose of the workshop is to bring the US and Egyptian scientists and engineers in a forum to explore the recent scientific developments and technical advances in the area of fine particles, and to identify specific research areas where their collaboration would be useful for both sides.  The workshop will be followed by an `Engineering Foundation Conference on Development of Nonrenewable Resources` on November 17-21, in Luxor, Egypt.  The workshop topics will be: advanced techniques for fine particle preparation; grinding of ultra-fine particles; characterization; separation of fine particle systems; surface modifications for specific applications; and research needs.  The EFC on Development of Nonrenewable Resources will focus on industrial minerals, non sulfide minerals, sulfide minerals, energy minerals, and environmental aspects.  The proceedings will be published prior to the meeting.  Recommendations on areas of scientific cooperation will be made available after the meeting.  Scope: This project deals with an area that is gaining in importance as most countries are attempting to develop their mineral and energy resources, because as the high grade resources are depleted there is increasing emphasis on efficient utilization of low grade resources preparation and new applications of fine particles.  The planned workshop allows a forum for scientists and engineers from both countries to discuss the challenges facing the preparation of fine particles and its applications in different industries as well as its environmental impact, and possible technical solutions to overcome these challenges.   Dr. El-Shall is the deputy director of the NSF-supported Engineering Research Center for Particle Science and Technology at the U. of Florida.  He will be assisted by a number of eminent scientists at that ERC and at other well known research institutes including Columbia University and the University of Utah.  The CMRDA is the largest such center in the Arab countries and provides a substantial capability for the workshop, the following conference, and for the cooperative research that is expected to result.  The proposal meets INT criteria for supporting activities likely to enhance technical and scientific collaboration between US and foreign researchers in areas of mutual interest.",
