During the planning phase, the applicants will:    * identify the unmet access, information and educational needs of children and youth with disabilities as they relate to the operations and services of science-rich museums nationwide;  * identify exemplary facilities, exhibits, materials, and outreach and programming efforts in the museum world that are currently meeting needs in this regard; and  * identify the most appropriate and feasible strategies through which science museums and similar facilities can attract and more fully respond to the needs of visitors with disabilities.    Toward the end of this effort, the project will develop and field-test a panel and workshop on accessibility at the ASTC 1997 conference.   The results of the surveys and the prototype workshop will serve as the foundation for design of a more comprehensive and sustainable effort to support accessibility in museums.",
