 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712270  Cockroft  ****    This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project will investigate the feasibility of engineering high efficiency in phosphors with strong near-infrared absorption that matches the requirements of  the proposer's display technology and of tuning the blue spectral @on properties by the precise control of dopant concentrations.  The development and validation of a design model that predicts optimum dopant concentrations by solving the dynamics of energy transfer is essential to the development of such a phosphor for our application.  In Phase I the proposers will establish and validate a model and demonstrate an improvement in brightness and spectral properties of the blue emission, relative to existing commercial materials, from a small phosphor volume representative of our anticipated pixel architecture. The proposer has  developed a new electro-optic flat-panel display concept offering significant advantages in brightness, scalability and screen flexibility over existing flat panel display technology.  Full consumer-market competitiveness of this technology will require innovative advances in the generation of full color emission using low cost lasers.  This proposal describes a novel phosphor concept to convert near-infrared radiation to blue emission.         Potential uses of the new spectrum for displays include industrial, business and military applications as well as mass market electronic products like TVs, computers and video games.  ***",
