 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide funds for the partial support of participants at a Gordon Research Conference on sea ice ecology, to be held in Ventura, California, in March 1997.   The amount requested from NSF will allow partial to full support of approximately 20 of the expected 135 participants.  Selection for support will be by application, based on need and contribution to the conference, and to establish a balance among established researchers, beginning researchers, and students who are actively engaged in the topical areas of the conference.   This conference on sea ice ecology is the first in an expected series of Gordon Research Conferences on the polar marine sciences.  Gordon Research Conferences provide a framework designed to foster creative activities in science and to enhance productive interactions among the international scientific community through free and unfettered discussions on innovative frontier research.   Sea ice ecology is an interdisciplinary study concerning the interaction among geophysical, biological, oceanographic, and geochemical processes within the sea ice and the underlying water column.  Areas of particular emphasis are the influence of the sea ice and snow cover on biologically significant processes, the operation of the polar marine food web through the seasonal ice growth and decay, and the transfer and exchange processes of carbon, silica, and other biogenic minerals.",
