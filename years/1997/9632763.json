 "awd_abstract_narration": "9632763  Smith  This proposal continues, for a second six year period, the  Palmer  Long-Term Ecological Research program which focuses on the  marine ecosystem in the western Antarctic Peninsula region.    A central tenet of this research is that the annual advance  and retreat of sea ice is a major physical determinant of  spatial and temporal changes in the structure and function  of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, from total annual primary  production to breeding success in seabirds.  We are  currently evaluating a number of testable hypotheses linking  sea ice to:       the timing and magnitude of seasonal primary    production,       the dynamics of the microbial loop and particle  sedimentation,       krill abundance, distribution, and recruitment, and       the breeding success and survival of apex predators.    The overall objectives are to:  (1) document the interannual variability of annual sea ice  and the corresponding physics, chemistry, optics, primary  production and the life-history parameters of secondary  producers and apex predators within the area,  (2) create a legacy of critical data for understanding  ecological phenomena and processes within the Antarctic  marine ecosystem,  (3) identify the processes that cause variation in physical  forcing and the subsequent biological response among the  representative trophic levels,  (4) construct models that link ecosystem processes to  environmental variables, which simulate spatial/temporal  ecosystem relationships, and employ such models to predict  and validate ice-ecosystem dynamics.    Since 1991 the program has included spatial sampling during  annual and seasonal cruises in portions of our regional grid  in the region and temporal sampling from spring through fall  (October to March) in the area adjacent to Palmer Station.  The program was designed to sample at multiple spatial  scales within one regional scale grid, permitting repeated  sampling on both seasonal and annual time scales, thus  addressing both short and long -term ecological phenomena, as  well as providing a basis for specific mechanistic studies.  To date, there have been seven regional cruises and two  additional cruises emphasizing microbial dynamics (Tables 1  and 2).  Core variables routinely sampled and monitored from  shipboard during annual cruises.    Documentation and data storage are organized through an  electronic hub at the Institute for Computational Earth  System Science at the University of California at Santa  Barbara which also serves as a data archive as needed.  There are on-line definitions of core data, datasets and  metadata, organized to facilitate rapid information exchange  and  on-line data documentation.  This multidisciplinary project,  sited in a climatically sensitive region, has the potential  to detect, against a background of natural variability, long  term trends in the Antarctic ecosystem.",
