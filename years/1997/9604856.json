 "awd_abstract_narration": "Turgeon  9604856  Filamentous fungi typically reproduce by both sexual and asexual processes.  Sexual ascomycetes may be either heterothallic (require a partner for mating) or homothallic (mate without a partner).  The term homothallic as used for filamentous fungi means that a single individual is capable of completing the sexual cycle, usually, but not always, because each nucleus carries both mating type (MAT) genes.  In the yeasts, homothallism refers to a change in mating type in some of the cells within a culture of a formerly uniform mating type, followed by mating of \"switched\" cells with \"unswitched\" cells.  Certain genera of filamentous ascomycetes contain both heterothallic and homothallic species.  One of these, Cochliobolus, a pathogen of maize, has been chosen for this study because of its natural diversity of life styles (asexual vs. sexual, heterothallic vs. homothallic, saprophytic vs. parasitic), ready availability of field isolates from a variety of natural habitats and geographical locations, and amenability to molecular genetic manipulation.  Like other ascomycetes, the type species (heterothallic C. heterostrophus) has a single mating type locus (MAT) with alternate forms (called idiomorphs and designated MAT-1 and MAT-2) which are each about a kilobase in size, unrelated at the nucleotide level, and encode different transcriptional regulators.  The idiomorphs are highly conserved among all Cochliobolus species; in heterothallic species each strain carries a single MAT idiomorph, whereas in homothallics each strain has both idiomorphs within about a kilobase of each other.  The sequences on both flanks of the idiomorphs are nearly identical between mating types of the same species and well conserved among species.  However, it has recently been found in Neuropora species that one flank of the idiomorph carries a variable region which is about twice as large (7 kb) in homothallic species as in heterothallic (3-5 kb).  In addition, the variable region is adjacent to a short ( 57-59bp) constant region which is highly conserved in both mating types and among all species.  Although the function of the MAT idiomorphs is clear, the significance of the variable and constant regions is unknown and not easily tested in Neuropora because the genus is not readily amenable to efficient gene targeting.  Preliminary evidence suggests variable and constant regions in Cochliobolus analogous to those in Neurospora.  One goal of this project is to utilize the efficient gene-targeting ability of Cochilobolus to investigate the functions of these regions:  are they important in mating, in the homothallic vs. heterothallic life style, in speciation, or are they dispensable for all of these processes?  The analyses will be performed by a combination of sequence analyses, heterologous expression in various genetic backgrounds and by specific gene deletions, replacements, or nucleotide substitutions.  Another goal is to construct a phylogeny based on sequences of MAT idiomorphs and flanking regions from a large number of heterothallic and homothallic strains.  The intention is to track the evolutionary histories of the various Cochliobolus life styles mentioned above.  A practical benefit of the project will be the demonstration, if successful, that a homothallic species can be converted to heterothallic by differential disruption of its MAT genes.  This would facilitate genetic analysis of homothallic plant-pathogenic fungal species by forcing crosses and eliminating selfs.",
