The format of the meeting is designed to foster extensive discussions of recent developments and ideas among researchers  from the U.S. and abroad.  Approximately  60 oral presentations and 150 posters will be included in the program, allowing  all laboratories working in this field to present their key findings.  Scientific sessions will compare and contrast the sensory and locomotor systems of a variety of prokaryotes  focusing on each step in their signal transduction pathways:  transmembrane signaling, signal transduction by intracellular  cascades, sensory control of cellular motility and gene expression, and the mechanics of cell motility.  In previous years this meeting has provided an important forum for emerging concepts concerning bacterial sensing and motility, and has presented the first molecular details of the structure and function of a family of signaling proteins that are pervasive in prokaryotic organisms and are now found in eukaryotic cells as well.    ***",
