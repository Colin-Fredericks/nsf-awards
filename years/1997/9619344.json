 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Miguel Garcia-Garibay, of the Department of Chemistry and   Biochemistry at the University of California at Los Angeles, is supported   by the Organic Dynamics Program for his studies of the ground state and   photochemical reactivity of triplet carbenes in the crystalline solid   state.  Carbenes are generated photochemically by extrusion of molecular   nitrogen within crystals of their arylalkyldiazo precursors.  Specific   substrates are chosen to allow the investigation of intramolecular   1,2-hydride and 1,2-phenyl migrations as well as hydrogen abstractions.    Professor Garcia-Garibay examines the correlation between solid-state   structural aspects of the precursors and reaction trajectories of the   resultant carbenes, studying both the energetics of the reaction   processes and their potential application in the synthesis of organic   compounds through stereoselective solid-state carbene rearrangements.  Although the chemistry of carbon compounds, forming the basis of organic   chemistry, is dominated by the preference of this element to form bonds   to four other elements, compounds in which carbon is bonded to only two   other elements are also known.  These so-called carbenes, which arise as   intermediates in a number of important chemical transformations, display   a variety of intriguing properties, including high reactivity and a   propensity to undergo molecular rearrangements.  Professor Garcia-Garibay   harnesses the chemistry of these reactive carbenes by generating them   within crystalline hosts, thereby permitting the physical and chemical   examination of their structures and chemical reactions.  These studies   address both fundamental issues regarding the chemistry of carbenes and   practical issues regarding the use of carbenes in the controlled   synthesis of important organic compounds.",
