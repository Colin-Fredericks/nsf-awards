The main purpose of the conference is to bring  together scientists from the Caribbean with government  officials interested in global change and to discuss the  possibilities for involving their countries in the Inter-  American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI).  In  addition, the meeting will provide an efficient mechanism  for the exchange of information about global change research  projects currently being supported by countries in the  Caribbean. Conference proceedings,  including summaries of the papers presented, discussions,  and final conclusions will be distributed to the  participants and other interested parties, and will be  available in English and Spanish. This workshop is being co-  sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) on behalf  of the IAI.  The IAI is a U.S. initiative to stimulate  cooperative research on global change issues among the  scientific institutions of the Americas.  The NSF is the  U.S. Government agency designated to carry out U.S.  responsibilities within the IAI.  %%%  The proposed conference and workshop will be held in  Mayag=FCez, Puerto Rico  during the second week of July, 1997.
