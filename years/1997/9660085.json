 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  96-60085  Seeker     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will study utilization of waste fuels for effective control of nitrogen oxides pollutants.  For many years, municipal solid waste (MSW) has been typically landfilled or combusted with emission of toxic compounds.  The problem of MSW utilization is twofold: a huge waste stream and the loss of the fuel energy content.  Another environmental problem faced by the power generation industry involves controlling flue gas emissions from coal fired boilers. Specifically, the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments mandate a 2,000,000 ton per year decrease in nitrogen oxide emissions.  An innovative technology for utilizing MSW as a means of control would provide solutions to the environmental problems of waste disposal and air pollution.  Furthermore, the net cost of waste fuel is low, and thus such a technology would have great economic benefits.  Phase I will investigate firing carbonized refuse derived fuels, specially prepared from MSW, by utilizing innovative advanced reburning (AR) technologies.  Based on kinetic modeling and experimental studies with natural gas, novel concepts are available to improve the conventional reburning process to over 90% nitrogen oxide emissions control.     The integration of AR technologies with waste fuel will offer electric utilities a low cost option for effective control of these emissions.  Other commercial utilization is expected in the MSW disposal industry where salable by-product fuels will alleviate some of the economic burden imposed by this massive waste stream as well as reduce landfill requirements.  ***",
