 "awd_abstract_narration": "9753000  Askin  This award supports a palynological survey of previously  collected Neogene sediments from the Transantarctic  Mountains and Ross Sea margin.  Because terrestrial  vegetation history is intimately linked to climatic and  tectonic history, this survey will provide valuable  information for tracing environmental trends through this  important interval of geologic time.  The survey will  include many of the Sirius Group strata cropping out in the  Transantarctic Mountains, and subsurface sediments  encountered in drillholes from McMurdo Sound and the McMurdo  Dry Valleys. These Neogene sediments (Miocene through  Pliocene) include glacial, fluvioglacial, glaciolacustrine,  and glaciomarine facies. Age control is from marine  microfossil assemblages (mainly diatoms) and radiometric  dates.  Palynomorphs, and wood and leaves at one locality  (Oliver Bluffs) have been reported from the Sirius Group.  Although relatively rare, the previously recovered spores  and pollen illustrate the potential for useful  paleoenvironmental information from a broader survey.  Specific objectives include a palynological survey of Sirius  and other Neogene sediments to determine presence or absence  of spores and pollen and any other plant remains derived  from contemporaneous vegetation. If sufficient spores and  pollen can be recovered from independently dated samples,  trends in vegetation composition, diversity, distribution  and extinction, might be identifiable.  Patterns of presence  vs. absence, composition and diversity will be used to help  interpret Antarctic climatic, cryospheric and tectonic  evolution.  If present, recycled palynomorphs from older  sediments will be used to help identify provenance of the  sediments.  Some marine units will be sampled, and search  for marine palynomorphs (dinoflagellate cysts and  acritarchs) will be included in the survey, as these have  great biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental potential.  This award is supported by the Office of Polar Programs  under  the National Science Foundation program entitled  Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and  Education (POWRE).  This POWRE award affords the  investigator an opportunity to broaden her research career  to include a significantly different interval of geologic  time.",
