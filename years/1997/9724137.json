 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is the comprehension redesign of the neural  simulation toll referred to as GENESIS (GEneral NEural  SImulation System).  GENESIS was developed initially as part  of the P.I.'s ongoing efforts to build realistic models of  nervous systems.  GENESIS has been made available for use to  laboratories outside Caltech for research and education, and  has become an important tool for the computational  neuroscience community.    The overall design objective for the GENESIS project is to  provide neurobiologists with a powerful tool for simulating  neruobiological systems, while at the same time promoting  the interactions between different modeling efforts.  We  will concentrate on two areas: first we will continue to  provide ongoing user support.  This includes on-line  services, continued development of documentation, bug fixes,  and promotion of collaborations between GENESIS users and  between GENESIS developers.  The second major focus of our  activities will be the redesign of GENESIS itself.  The  basic software design of the project has not changed  substantially since its inception in 1986.  It is now time  to completely redesign GENESIS to provide far more efficient  portability across platforms free extensibility and exchange  of code, flexibility lump missing parameters and  compartments, and provide granularity along multiple axes.  Achieving these goals should result in a move useful, more  easily federated system which is far less expensive to  extend and maintain.  The redesign is beginning by first  taking a parallel systems view point, rather than starting  with a sequential platform and later parting to parallel.  This work is supported by the Computational Neuroscience  program, and the neuroscience's cluster (all in Bio).  This  effort will focus on both support for parallel architectures  as well as new graphics languages.",
