 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main focus of this project is to develop statistical  methods for mapping genes affecting polygenic and multi  factorial traits (referred to below as Quantitative Loci or  QTL) in large, complex pedigrees.  The project has three  interrelated objectives:  (i) We are expanding our QTL  mapping software to the analysis of multi-generational  pedigrees, to choice among models with different numbers of  QTL polymorphism, and to discontinuous but polygenic  (disease) phenotypes; (ii) we are comparing and providing  tolls for model checking and choice for Bayesian analysis of  Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) in general and QTL  models in particular, as well as investigating alternative  sampling algorithms necessary to implement these methods,  and (iii) We are investigating strategies for the fine  mapping of QTL to enable positional cloning of important QTL  and to increase the efficiency of marker-assisted selection  in livestock.    The availability of mderate resolution maps in livestock an  high resolution maps in humans has created a substantial  demand for statistical methods and tools which make optimum  use of the available data and are capable of handling large,  complex pedigrees, unknown number of QTL, and unknown nature  of genetic variation at QTL.  Current  methods do not yet  have all of these capabilities.  However, the importance of  methods and software extends far beyond livestock.  They are  critical to understanding and mechanisms and evolution of  polygenic and multifactorial traits, designing more  effective breeding regimes for domesticated plants and  animals, and understanding and treating inherited human  diseases.  This work is supported by the Computational  Biology Activity and the Program Population Biology (Bio).",
