 "awd_abstract_narration": "Civilization arose independently in many areas of the world and archaeologists wish to understand the underlying processes responsible for this phenomenon. To achieve this goal they have worked to reconstruct each of the individual cases and then compare them to look for common patterns. In Northern China this development culminated in the emergence of the Shang dynasty. While Chinese archaeologists have studied the ceramics and other objects produced by the Shang and have focused on major sites such as Anyang, the last Shang capital, very little is understood of how this complex society developed and functioned. With National Science Foundation support Dr. Rapp and his Chinese collaborators will initiate a long term collaborative project directed at this question. The research has two aspects. The first involves a regional survey of the Huan River valley in which Anyang is located. Preliminary work indicates the presence of numerous archaeological sites some of which date back to Paleolithic times. Through a study of the distribution of sites, their age and their location in the landscape it is possible to delineate settlement systems, to infer social and economic relationships and to determine how these changed over time. The team will conduct extensive survey as well as limited excavation and they will collect many sediment cores. Given the geologically active nature of river valleys and the cumulative effect of thousands of years of human impact, one can not assume that the landforms and pattern of vegetation one observes today were constant over time. Through the analysis of cores it is possible to gain insight into such changes. This work will be complemented by an extensive environmental reconstruction program. This will include coring, geomorphological analysis, and collection and examination of pollen and macro botanical remains. Magnetic susceptibility measurements will be used to reconstruct climatic changes.  This research is important for several reasons. It will increase our understanding of the processes which led to the rise of civilization. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists and it will help to introduce into Chinese archaeology a set of techniques widely used in the United States but rarely employed in China.",
