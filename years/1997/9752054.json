 "awd_abstract_narration": "Daytona Beach Community College (DBCC), utilizing computer and engineering technology faculty and consultants, proposes to create a new instructional environment for introductory classes in electronics, computer aided design, civil engineering and computer programming.  This new environment addresses the various learning modalities, diverse schedules and lifestyles of the non-traditional students found in ever increasing numbers at institutions nation wide.  The virtual classroom will permit students to access their computer technology and electronics courses at any time and from any place through the resources and capabilities of the internet and the World Wide Web.     The specific objectives of this project are to: 1) Develop and implement a Virtual Classroom Environment which allows time/place in dependent access to course materials and teaching/learning interchange for students and faculty; 2) Develop and implement the appropriate interactive curriculum for the virtual classroom to ensure not only the success of students in their field, but to continually enhance the learning process as a by-product of this environment; and 3) To provide in-service training for participating secondary school teachers through Tech-Prep and School-to-Work programs on the use and development of interactive computer aided instruction.     The significance of this project is that it will demonstrate how the virtual classroom environment can be developed and utilized to train postsecondary students in various disciplines; produce course database on CD-ROM or disk media, and have national and international impact though the Internet and the World Wide Web.",
