 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary purpose of this project is to enhance and reform the learning of mathematics in the undergraduate curriculum according to the current calls for change in pedagogy predicated by the Mathematical Association of America and the American Mathematical Society.  To implement this nationally promoted educational reform program, the university is providing a computer-assisted technology classroom, the use of which brings new methods of mathematical instruction to the students, prepares them for the use of technology and industry-standard mathematical software, and increases their capacity for the application of mathematics to other disciplines.      The project strives to accomplish the following objectives:  provide computer-assisted instruction and learning facilities and disseminate the information regarding the activities made possible by these facilities; increase the amount of mathematical content taught in courses and its retention by students; motivate students to learn with the use of open-ended, real-world applications; emphasize active, creative, problem-solving approaches to learning through group work, class projects, discovery exercises, and other reform-oriented methods of instruction; use technology as it naturally fits into course work so it becomes an integral, rather than a peripheral, part of learning; acquaint students with changing and emerging technologies in order to make graduates more competitive in the marketplace.  *",
