In ordinary and invasion percolation the critical   behavior of the chemical distance will be investigated. Another project is concerned with   the large deviation behavior of the random resistor network. In Ising and random cluster   models the investigator intends to study the rigidity (roughness) of certain phase   boundaries. In particular, questions related to roughening in higher dimensional   percolation models will be studied.  The investigator also intends  to work on questions   concerning the shape of certain interfaces. The project in first passage type models   includes work on comparison principles between minimizing paths and certain random   walks, and (jointly with another colleague) on the confinement property of directed   polymers in a random environment.   The aim of this project is to study certain geometric aspects of random spatial   systems. In some random systems geometric objects (in this case surfaces) which are   deterministic on a macroscopic scale arise naturally. Examples of such objects are phase   boundaries and droplets (\"crystals\") in spin systems or the frontier of the invaded region in   first passage percolation, which is a basic model for randomly evolving (growing)   surfaces.  Both the (asymptotic) shapes and the fluctuations of these objects  are of  prime   concern  with great theoretical  and practical interest. Many of the proposed problems and   models have their origin (and  are still studied) in statistical physics, materials science,   chemistry, and condensed matter physics. The project's final goal is to gain some insight   into the behavior of random surfaces - objects which seem to appear just about   everywhere in nature, but are known to be difficult to understand from the theoretical   (mathematical) p oint of view.",
