Measurements  of  magneto-transmission of  superconducting  films  using   circularly   polarized  radiation  with   frequency   and  temperature  variation, followed by kramers-Kronig analysis  will  determine   the   full   complex   frequency-dependent   magneto-  conductivity  tensor.  Features in such data recently  discovered  to   be   related  to  vortex  pinning;  the  hybridized   vortex  pinning/cyclotron resonance, the hybridized vortex pinning/vortex  core  resonance, and the low frequency depinning loss band,  will  be  a  focus  of  the experimental work.  The  effects  on  these  properties  of  vortex pinning as introduced by ion  implantation  will  be studied.  Additional topics include studies of Josephson  plasmons,  and of plasma and magneto-plasma modes  of  arrays  of  superconducting disks.  These studies are novel and will  provide  new  information on high temperature superconductivity, with  the  possibility  of opening new paths for the science and  technology  of superconductivity.  %%%  This  experimental  research project makes use  of  sophisticated  optical  measurements  to  clarify the  interaction  of  magnetic  fields   with   cuprate   (high   Tc)   superconductors.    These  superconductors have the potential for application in motors  and  generators,   where  the  loss-free  electrical  conduction   and  potentially high levels of magnetic field could lead to  smaller,  lighter,  and  more  efficient motors and generators.   The  full  exploitation  of  this potential has not been reached  thus  far,  because  of  heat generating motions of the magnetic field  lines  inside  the cuprate material.  Such motions, and how they may  be  reduced  by  introduction of \"pinning cent ers\" by irradiation  or  other  means,  are  one  of the topics  to  be  clarified.   This  experimental  grant  may  thereby help  to  develop  an  improved  electrical   technology.  Results from this research may  include  unusual  new effects or structures which may find application  in  technology.  This research project is interdisciplinary in nature  and involves graduate students who will be excellently trained to  enter positions in industry, government or education.  ***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This  experimental  research  is on the  infrared  and  microwave  magneto-optical  properties  of  Type  II  superconductors,  with  emphasis on cuprates, in both normal and superconducting  states.
