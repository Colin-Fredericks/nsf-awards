 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712820  Doyle  The aim of this research is to perform reverse engineering of the  baroreceptor control mechanism to develop practical process  control algorithms.  The primary role of the baroreceptor reflex  mechanism is the modulation of blood pressure by regulating heart  rate on a short time frame.  From a systems perspective, the  heart is a massively instrumented actuator with multiple  hierarchical effector signals from the central nervous system,  complex local circuitry, and has as a primary objective the  regulation of blood pressure.   In particular, the investigators  plan to study local control loops in the baroreceptor reflex.  They propose that these local loops, which function independently  of the central nervous system, can be emulated and applied to  real-world process control problems.  The investigators will map  out motor cardiac fibers associated with the baroreceptor reflex  by using fluorescent labeling and confocal microscopy.  The local  control loops in the reflex would be carefully analyzed in order  to develop a theoretical formulation for locally intelligent  control algorithms.  These algorithms would be applied to a  difficult polymerization reactor control problem and to local  control valve actuation to overcome performance degradation due  to wear or mechanical failure.  The reactor control problem  concerns a difficult polymerization grade transition problem,  where the temperature is periodically changed to alter the free  radical polymerization of ethylene in a reactor.  This system is  subject to an extinction phenomena if the reactor temperature  exceeds a lower limit.  The intelligent controller of this  research would be used to obtain tight control while avoiding  extinction.  ***",
