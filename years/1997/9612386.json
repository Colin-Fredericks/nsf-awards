 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612386  Chu  This research aims to develop and study metal nanoparticles  by taking advantage of the well-organized  microheterogeneities in hydrogels.  Two types of such  microheterogeneities are proposed:  the study of weakly  charged polyelectrolyte hydrogels with microphase separation  due to the competition of polyelectrolyte/hydrophobic  interactions, and hydrogel/surfactant systems which can form  highly ordered supramolecular nano/microstructures.  The  metal ions can be replaced by noble or rare earth ions whose  subsequent reduction will then bring to the formation of  metallic nanoparticles inside the gels or microgel  particles.    Water is obviously the best choice as a solvent for a number  of reasions, including environmental considerations,  potential use for widespread catalytic reactions which take  place in aqueous media, and the possibility for biological  applications.  The synthesis of metal nanoparticles within  the gels which can swell intensively in water should be very  useful, because the highly responsive medium has a high  susceptibility to any changes of the external aqueous  solution.  We aim to control the size and the shape of metal  nonoparticles, as well as the polymer properties, such as  mesh size, in order to regulate the catalytic activity of  metal nanoparticles and surfaces.  %%%  This research is in the area of nanotechnology and should  help to lay the foundation for design and environmentally  conscious processing of  polyelectrolytes, gels, and  nanoparticles.  ***",
