Under this Program, the National Science  Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Office of Naval Research are jointly  evaluating and supporting research of high priority to the USWRP.           Accurate quantitative forecasting of precipitation (Quantitative Precipitation  Forecasting, QPF) has proven to be an especially difficult problem and one where  little progress has been made over the last several years.  For this reason, better QPF  techniques has been identified by both the scientific and operational communities as  an area ripe for research.        The Principal Investigator will investigate new applications of statistical  techniques designed to improve QPF.   Two nonlinear methodologies will be  pursued in this research with statistics derived from 33 years of 3-hourly surface  observations and 12-hourly upper air observations covering the United States east of  the Rocky Mountains.  One involves the design of neural networks with outputs that  correspond to the probability of occurrence of standard precipitation threshold  values.   The other methodology involves the use of analogs of time sequences  (rather than instantaneous values) of synoptic variables obtained from ensemble  numerical forecasts to specify precipitation probabilities.    ***",
