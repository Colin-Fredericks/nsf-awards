Six modules have been developed that apply important concepts in science and mathematics to the properties and use of materials. This project is to add assessments to the modules and subject them to extensive field testing to gather data about student achievement of important learning goals.  The teacher materials provide information about the design process and addressing the learning goals.  Two more modules on Materials and Environment and Sports Materials are developed and tested.  All of the modules are indexed to comprehensive curriculum materials in the disciplines. The project develops kits, interactive CDROM with databases, and support for teachers both on-line and through organizations, as well as print modules and teacher materials.",
