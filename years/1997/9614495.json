 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michael Fisher is jointly supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the   Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research to   continue his theoretical research in statistical mechanics, the study of   ordered states of matter, phase transitions between states, and critical   phenomena.   The methodologies to be used include thermodynamic and   scaling analyses, renormalization group methods, Monte Carlo simulations,   and analytical and numerical techniques.  Applications include: 1)   investigations of fluid electrolytes that undergo Coulombic as opposed to   solvophobic phase separation; 2) investigations of two-dimensional, hard   core ionic fluids which provide a basic model for real systems exhibiting   superfluidity and superconductivity; 3) the characterization of   thermodynamic behavior near critical endpoints, particularly in fluid   mixtures; 4) investigations of wall free energies and universal aspects   of critical adsorption.  Theoretical models of complex molecular systems are useful for   understanding and interpreting experimental observations on these   systems.  They provide molecular insights into the complex molecular   interactions that are responsible for macroscopic behavior and physical   properties.  Such insights are frequently also useful in optimizing the   design of new materials having desired properties.",
