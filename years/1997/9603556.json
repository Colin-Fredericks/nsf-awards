 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603556  Jardetzky  The goal of this research is to (1) To develop a physical  model to relate the motion of the protein backbone to the  ensemble average of auto-correlation functions for NH and CH  bond vectors, which are measured using NMR.  In order to  overcome the time limit  (1 ns) on calculating molecular dynamics of proteins,  molecular dynamics with random walks in dihedral angle space  - the MCDIS-MD (Monte Carlo in Dihedral Angle Space with  Molecular Dynamics) procedure recently reported by Zhao and  Jardetzky will be used.  Correlation functions based on the  investigator's theoretical results will be calculated from  the trajectory, which can be Fourier transformed to spectral  density functions.  Probability distribution and correction  matrices among the various dihedral angles will also be  constructed.  (2) To identify relevant time scales by  carrying out a detailed analysis of relaxation data, using  the formalisms developed by Lefevre et al. and King and  Jardetsky. Three proteins on which extensive relaxation data  are already available are chosen for the initial analysis:  lysozyme staphylococcal nuclease and trp-repressor. (3) To  use the percolation formalism of Hoch to identify clusters of  trajectories that reflect conformational transitions that may  be expected to be slow and to match the spectral density  terms calculated from each cluster against the spectral  density terms independently derived from experiment.  Modeling the types of motions that can account for the slow  motion terms in NMR data would be a significant advance in  the understanding of protein dynamics.    Understanding a protein as a molecular mechanism - which it  is - requires detailed and accurate knowledge of its  structure and dynamics.  Knowledge of protein structure is by  now very extensive - over 1000 structures at atomic  resolution have been determined by x-ray and NMR.  In  contrast, knowledge of protein dynamics is still rather  fragmentary.  Theoretical Molecular Dynamics simulation s of  protein motions have contributed greatly to the understanding  of proteins, but remain limited to the study of very fast  (piconanosecond) motions for both theoretical and practical  reasons.  To interpret the information on slow motions ( on  nano-to microsecond or longer time scales) contained in NMR  relaxation and proton exchange measurements, more powerful  statistical mechanical tools must be applied, such as the  MCDIS-MD method to be developed under the terms of this  grant.",
