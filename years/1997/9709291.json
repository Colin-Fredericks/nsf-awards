Title: Paleoclimate Variability Recorded in Varved Sediments of  Lake Malawi, Tropical Africa    The award supports the collection of sediment cores from four sites  in northern Lake Malawi, to establish a robust, high-solution  record of past climate change that spans the entire Holocene.  The  cores will be dated by Pb-210, AMS C-14, and varve counts.  The  sediments will be analyzed for weight per cent biogenic silica and  for light and dark layer thickness of the varves.  Biogenic silica   abundance is believed to reflect primary productivity, which is a  function of upwelling intensity, related to wind strength and  seasonal cooling.  The light layers in the varve couplets are  diatom ooze, also reflecting primary productivity during the dry  windy season (June - August).  The dark layers consist of  terrigenous silts and clays with admixtures of diatoms.  These  reflect the intensity of river runoff during the rainy season in  the austral summer (Dec. - March).  The varve thickness records  (light layer, combined) will be subjected to evolutionary spectral  analysis, paying particular attention to ENSO-scale variability  through the Holocene.  Pilot studies on the sediments will include  redox-sensitive elemental analysis, organic matter isotopic  composition, and diatom assemblage composition.  This research will  be in collaboration with the Malawi Global Environment Facility  (GEF) program funded by the World Bank, which will provide ship  time, logistical support in the country, and Pb-210 analyses of the  sediments.  This will be a collaborative effort with scientists  from Malawi, Canada and Norway.  This paleoclimatological  investigation on Lake Malawi will be conducted as part of the  International Decade for the East African Lakes (IDEAL).  IDEAL is  a multi-disciplinary, multinational program of research and  training on the large lakes of East Africa.",
