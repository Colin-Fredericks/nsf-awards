As  part  of that application, the  research  will  quantify source impacts and develop sensitivity coefficients  for various model parameters (e.g. deposition velocities and  chemical rate constants). Because of  its climate and  rapid  growth and industrialization, the Mexico-southwestern United  States  border  area experiences elevated  levels  of  ozone  exceeding  the  national standards  of  the  two  countries.  Addressing  this  air quality problem in the  region  is  of  particular   interest  for  several  reasons:   first,   the  international nature of the problem, and the expected trans  boundary  pollutant flow, along with recent trade agreements  (e.g.  NAFTA and Maquiladoras); second, the high  population  growth in the area; and, third, the level of controls  which  differ  widely  between  the various  regions.  If  one  can  adequately  demonstrate the source-air quality relationships  through  the  application  of sensitivity  analysis,  it  is  possible  to  develop  much more cost  effective  integrated  strategies for air pollution control in the region.  It  is  proposed  to  develop  a computationally  attractive  sensitivity  analysis technique for use in  multidimensional  air quality models based on the direct decoupled sensitivity  method.    The   resulting  method  will  be  designed   and  constructed  in  such  a way as to be  easily  transportable  between  air  quality models that are in common  application  today, and are being developed for future use.  Furthermore,  the system will make use of parallel computing environments.  The method will be applied to air quality modeling along the  Mexico-southwestem   U.S.  border   to   better   understand  pollutant dynamics in that region, and  to quantify the model  responses  to inputs and model parameters.  Finally,  as  an  example of the power and uses of such techniques, the method  will  be  applied  to  address  three  specific  issues   of  importance  in air quality engineering of interest  in  that  region:  explore the use of formal sensitivity analysis  for  model  evaluation  and intercomparison, quantify  how  ozone  concentrations respond to emissions of various compounds and  sources,  and  to  further explore the  use  of  sensitivity  analysis   in  studying  volatile  organic  compound   (VOC)  reactivity scales.  The expected results from this project are:  development  of  a  computationally  efficient  sensitivity  method  for  air  quality  modeling;  application of the sensitivity  analysis  method along the Mexico-U.S. border to better understand the  dynamics  of  air pollutants in that region,  assessment  of  model  sensitivities and uncertainties  in  the  application  along  the border region, and a growing relationship between  Georgia  Tech and Instituto Technologico Estudios Superiores  de  Monterrey  (ITESM) due both to the direct  collaboration  between the two principal investigators, but also due to the  advanced  education  of a Mexican student  (from  ITESM)  at  Georgia Tech.",
