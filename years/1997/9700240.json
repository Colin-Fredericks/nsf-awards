 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic   Chemistry program funds research in the laboratory of Kenneth J. Balkus   at the Univesity of Texas at Dallas.  The objective is to prepare new   zeolite host-guest materials that would offer clear advantages in   catalytic and adsorption processes.  Work will contintue to exploit   occluding guest molecules into zeolites and other porous materials   through adsorption, ion exchange, complexation and templated intrazeolite   assembly.  Emphasis will be on the synthesis of the host matrix around   the guest molecule, which occludes as a well-defined species.   This   approach has already resulted in the discovery of the largest pore   zeolite known.  The focus will now turn to multidentate chelate complexes   such as phthalocyanines, polyamines, polyethers and Schiff base ligands.    Chiral functional groups will also be introduced in order to prepare   chiral host materials and to induce asymmetric catalysis.  New host-guest   materials will be evaluated for binding and activating small molecules,   such as molecular oxygen, hydrogen, nitric oxide, and olefins in   catalysis, separations and gas-sensing applications.       New materials will be prepared with spaces designed to hold   catalytically important molecules.  These materials hold the prospect of   functioning as asymmetric catalysts, chemical separators and sensors.",
