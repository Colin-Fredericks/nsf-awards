 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing equipment for new undergraduate courses in Computational Chemistry and Data Visualization.  Computational Chemistry is aimed at chemistry majors, and Data Visualization is designed for non-science-students in the undergraduate core curriculum.  Although different in content, both courses have the same laboratory exercise format and require the same computational equipment.  The Computational Chemistry course is designed to generate an understanding of the interplay between basic theory and computational methodology, the circumstances under which computation is the preferred tool for problemsolving, and the accuracy with which those problems can be solved. The Data Visualization course includes both the methodology of quantitative analysis of visual information and the experimental process of image acquisition.  The idea that the process of image acquisition cannot be divorced from the analysis process is emphasized because the methods of data generation influence both the interpretation of the data and the methods of data analysis.  The goal of these classes is to enhance critical thinking about scientific problems.  Computation can assist in achieving that goal.  *",
