 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Interagency Agreement is related to the U.S. Navy nuclear  submarine yearly science cruise.  It will cover Arctic Submarine Laboratory's anticipated expenses in support of Special Data Acquisition.  This funding is being requested to cover the following:    a)  Support for non-baseline Temporary Alternations (TEMPALTs).  These are the Gravimeter System (including the Data Acquisition System), the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), the Zero Angle Photometer System (ZAPS), the Concentrator/Filtration System, and the In-line Sample Manifold modification to the Torpedo Room Sampling System.  The Arctic Submarine Laboratory will perform the following tasks:    1)  Interface with investigators to determine the scope and details of their TEMPALTs.  2)  Prepare and /or modify TEMPALT drawings and other supporting documentation for submission to Naval Sea Systems Command for approval to install these systems.  3)  Fabricate a locking ring for mounting of the ADCP window.  4)  Fabricate the In-Line Sample Manifold.    b)  Purchase the expendable conductivity-temperature-depth (U/I SSXCTD) probes.  The current planning calls for the expenditure of 139 probes during pre-deployment testing and scientific data collection.  The Navy is providing 59 of these probes.  Therefore, the budget calls for the purchase of 80 probes.  The participating scientists have expressed a desire for the submarine to carry additional probes to increase the potential for denser sampling in certain areas of special interest.  As many as 95 probes can be provided at the same per-probe cost.",
