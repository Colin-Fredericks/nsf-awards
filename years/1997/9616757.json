University of Illinois at Chicago    CISE Research Instrumentation: Visually Servoed Micromanipulation     The research projects supported by this award address a potential technology barrier to the commercial success of MEMS devices by theoretically and experimentally investigating micropart manipulation of rigid and deformable objects. The equipment provided by this award, high performance computing hardware for image processing and computer graphics, microforce sensors, micro positioning devices, and high resolution optics, are an important part of the following projects:  Visually  Servoed Micromanipulators for Automatic Assembly and Packing of MEMS Devices- Sensor-Based Manipulation of Deformable Objects and  Microstructures The first investigates and develops  visually servoed micromanipulators including development of a real-time task representation defined in terms of geometric object models of rigid objects, sensor models, and the microphysics of micromanipulation.  The latter investigates and develops a real-time task representation defined in terms of deformable object models of rigid objects, sensor models, and the microphysics of micromanipulation.  The projects pursue experimental and theoretical analyses that illuminate the similarities and differences between sensor-based manipulation in macro and micro domains. The realization of successful micromanipulation strategies contributes to the development of automatic assembly machines for assembling and packaging future MEMS devices that require increasingly complex assembly strategies.",
