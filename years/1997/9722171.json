 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN-9722171    Hill    Bright colors and beautiful song are among the most  conspicuous features of birds, but these traits pose a  paradox for evolutionary biologists.  How could such gaudy  traits, which seem to waste energy and expose individuals to  predators, have evolved by natural selection, a process that  should promote survivorship and reproduction?  The generally  accepted answer to this question is that such ornamental  traits arose through sexual selection, a process that  promotes access to mates either through mate attraction or  mate defense.  Female mate choice has been shown to be an  important selective agent in the evolution of ornamental  traits, but why should females choose such traits?  One  explanation for this riddle is that ornamental traits serve  as honest signals of male quality.  By choosing males with  well-developed ornaments, females choose better-than-average  males.  The plot thickens further, though, in that most  species of animals have not one but multiple ornamental  traits.  For instance, most species of songbirds have both  colorful plumage and song.  This research will study the  function of song and colorful plumage in the House Finch, a  common backyard bird found throughout the contintental U.S.  Studies will test the idea that female House Finches gain  different information about male quality from different  ornamental traits.  Colorful plumage in the House Finch is a  result of carotenoid pigments, which birds must obtain from  their diet.  Thus, plumage brightness is a function of the  nutritional condition of males at the time when feathers are  grown.  The control of song development is less well  understood, but it may also be dependent on nutrition.  The  focus of this work is on two measures of male quality:  disease resistance and parental effort. Using a combination  of experiments conducted with captive birds and observations  of wild birds, the study will determine how song and  ornamental plumage coloration of male House Finches relate   to two different types of disease: coccidia, a chronic  intestinal parasite, and conjunctivitis, a bacterial  infection of the eye and upper respiratory system with rapid  onset.   The prediction is that song, which is produced at  the time of display, will be a better indicator of fast-  acting disease of short duration.  In contrast, plumage,  which is grown over a six-week period, months before it is  used in display, will be a better predictor of chronic  infection.  Song and plumage may also convey different  information about the ability of males to provision young.  This research will be among the first to simultaneously  investigate the function of multiple ornamental traits, and  will provide new insight into the process of sexual  selection and the evolution of ornamental traits in animals.    The idea that conspicuous ornamental traits in male animals  might convey information about prospective mates to females  is an intuitively appealing hypothesis that many students  (in the broad sense - including high school students,  science teachers, undergraduates and adult education  students) find compelling. The research project will  incorporate an educational focus involving participation by  the previously-mentioned student populations. The House  Finch is an ideal species for studies intended to introduce  students to field biology - they are small, docile, easy to  catch, have bright colors that are easy to quantify, are  habituated to people, and nest in conspicuous locations on  campus. In addition, House Finches are found in nearly every  schoolyard in the U.S., and part of this study will also  develop science exercises with  high school teachers, and  allow students to experience the challenge and excitement of  real scientific investigation.",
