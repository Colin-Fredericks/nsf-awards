 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Winkler    Supernovae are the cataclysmic events in which massive stars (more than  about 8 times the mass of our Sun) end their lives. They are the most  energetic localized events which now occur in the universe: a typical  supernova explosion releases in a few seconds an energy of about 10 to  the 44th Joules, comparable to what the Sun will expend throughout the  entire course of its 10 billion year lifetime.  Not surprisingly, such  a prodigious release of energy can have profound effects on the  dynamics of galaxies in which supernovae occur. The shock waves from  supernovae are believed to trigger episodes of star formation when they  encounter dense interstellar clouds. Furthermore, supernovae are  responsible for the production and distribution of most of the heavy  elements in the universe. Virtually all the elements from helium to  iron, on the periodic table, were created by nucleosynthesis in the  cores of massive stars, and these elements have been distributed around  the cosmos through the supernova explosions of the stars in which they  were originally formed.  By studying supernovae and the remnants they  leave behind, we can gain insight into the processes of  nucleosynthesis, the evolution of the universe's chemical composition,  and the effects of such prodigious energy release on the host galaxies  of supernovae.    Extragalactic samples of supernova remnants (SNRs) offer two  significant advantages over ones in our Galaxy: (I) the view toward  other galaxies is far less impeded by interstellar absorption than in  the Milky Way, where fewer than a third of all known remnants have been  detected at all by optical means, and (2) all the remnants in another  galaxy are at the same, known distance, making comparisons among them  much more meaningful and reliable.  Supernovae searches to be conducted  in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, nearest neighbors to our  Milky Way, and in M31, the largest galaxy in the Local Group, should  increase the samples of SNRs in t hese galaxies several-fold.  Wide-field digital imaging through the use of CCD cameras on small  Schmidt telescopes at Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo observatories will be  used.  A technique which has already led to the identification of over  100 SNR candidates.  These supernovae candidates will be further  studied through spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging to confirm  whether they are, in fact, SNRs and then their properties will be  observed.  The expanded extragalactic SNR samples will be used to study  the local environments of supernovae, to probe elemental abundances and  abundance gradients in galaxies, to measure the energy of supernova  events, and to study the effects of supernovae on galactic structure.    Detailed attention will be focused on the handful of young SNRs where  uncontaminated ejecta from the supernova can be identified. In older  remnants, which are much more numerous, shocks driven through the  interstellar medium can probe the density, structure, and abundances of  the interstellar gas. Wide-field imaging techniques will be used to  study individual SNRs in our Galaxy in unprecedented detail. The  proposed optical investigations will be combined with new radio and  X-ray data to study the interstellar environments of supernovae and the  fundamental physics of shocks. These detailed studies of a few selected  objects will complement the broader extragalactic surveys.    Significant collaboration with undergraduate students is integral to  carrying out the research.",
