The university partner has  pioneered in the creation of Thin Film Transistors (TFTs) for Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays (AMLCDs) by printing technology.  The small firm and university research groups have joined to demonstrate a new technology for printing the metallization on large arrays of TFTS.  This will eliminate most or all of the expensive photolithography required to produce AMLCDs and reduce the cost of manufacturing the displays by as much as half. Preliminary work has identified bonding between the printed metallization and the silicon or glass substrates as the key technical barrier.  The objective of this proposed program is to identify solutions to the bonding problem and demonstrate the feasibility of low-cost printed TFT arrays.         The work proposed will make AMLCDs that are bigger, cheaper and much easier to produce. This will result in really large, low cost displays  that can be used for picture-on-the- wall HDTV.  ***",
