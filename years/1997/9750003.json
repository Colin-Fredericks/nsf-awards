These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative, computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled \"DNA Sequence  variation of the Y chromosome in Great Apes:  molecular  evolution and natural selection of the male specific  chromosome.\" This research plan focuses on the Y chromosome  of the primates most closely related to humans:  chimpanzee,  gorillas, and orangutans.  The molecular evolution of the  \"male\" chromosome has become important and controversial in  population and phylogenetic analyses of primates.  Sequencing and PCR amplification of variable repeats of  DNA  are being used to assess the variation of the Y chromosome  between and within the great ape species.  Evidence is being  sought for natural selection on the Y chromosome in this  group of animals.",
