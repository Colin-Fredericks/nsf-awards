 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701688  Goldburg    This experimental research project is concerned with the study of  laminar  turbulent flow in 2 and 3 dimensions, and the  influence  of polymer additives on this flow.  Special emphasis is placed on  the  quasi- two dimensional flow produced in soap films, and  the  interaction  of  flowing  film  with  the  surrounding  air.   In  addition, experiments are carried out on turbulence generated  by  an  oscillating  grid  in  a closed container.   This  experiment  probes the velocity fluctuations in the bulk of the fluid and for  particles  floating on the surface.  The spatial correlations  of  the  fluctuations  are  measured  from  the  measurement  of  the  velocity at two separated points.  %%%  Soap  films  can serve as a model for the flowing  of  fluids  in  nature.   The  films  exhibit various types of commonly  observed  flows, including the very difficult type of turbulent flow.   One  area  of special interest is the effect of shear in low in a soap  film  and  the role paid by the concept of the viscosity  of  the  liquid.   It is of great interest to note that the soap  film  is  observed to have a viscosity a hundred times that of water,  even  though  the  film is 99% water and 1% additive.  Another  problem  studied  is  the surface motion on the turbulent fluid  which  is  related to the study of the motion of buoys or the dispersion  of  a contaminant of the surface of a turbulent sea.  ***",
