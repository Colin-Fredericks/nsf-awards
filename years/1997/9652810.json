 "awd_abstract_narration": "Learning to Teach School Mathematics with Technology (LTSMT) is a project to develop a combined methods and content course for preservice teachers focusing on the use of computer and calculator technology in secondary school mathematics. Goals of the LTSMT project for the preservice teacher are a) to develop confidence and ability in the use of commonly available mathematics software; b) to build an understanding of the importance of providing Accessibility to software for students as a matter of equity, of developing meaningful conceptual understanding, and of promoting mathematical power in all; and c) to develop a reflective attitude that brings about a serious examination, in light of available software, of beliefs about what mathematics is, what topics belong in the curriculum, and what roles the teacher and learner should play in classroom interaction. LTSMT materials will contain a rich mix of mathematics content and methods consistent with the NCTM Standards and other reform recommendations. Seven modules organized by content area will involve students in individual and cooperative-group investigations.  Students will use a function grapher, a data analysis package, a dynamic geometry program, a programming language, and a symbolic manipulator. In order for LTSMT students to be exposed to the latest in mathematics content and reform-oriented curriculum projects, problems and investigations from recent NSF-funded middle and high school curriculum development projects will be incorporated into the materials, coordinated with a systematic examination of their pedagogical implications. The three-year project will create, pilot, and evaluate these materials, with the goal of publishing the results for use in preservice programs throughout the U.S. The flexible, modular design of the materials will allow teacher educators to customize their use in a variety of course formats, hardware and software configurations, and personal inclinations toward mathematics content.",
