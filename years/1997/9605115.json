 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Vogt  The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) will  establish an REU Site under the aegis of the Laser  Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)  Project.  LIGO, a collaborative effort between Caltech and  MIT scientists, is designed to make broad-band (~10 Hz - 10  kHz) observations of gravitational waves predicted by  General Relativity and generated by a variety of  astrophysical processes, including neutron stars, black  holes, supernovae and other sources yet to be discovered.  LIGO is sponsored by the National Science Foundation,  construction is underway at two observatory sites at  Hanford, Washington and Livingston Parish, Louisiana.  LIGO offers exceptional opportunities for involvement of  undergraduates in research.  LIGO detectors cover a large  number of physics disciplines and tools, including  metrology, optics, lasers, mechanical systems, controls, and  electronics.  LIGO observations are concerned with strong-  field gravitation and a large spectrum of astrophysical  phenomena, ranging from the Big Bang to neutro-star and  black-hole binaries to neutron-star creation in supernova  collapses.  But most of all, LIGO will open a new window  onto the universe through the new force medium of  gravitational waves and the information carried by them.  The LIGO project has a large and high caliber scientific  staff, which can serve as mentors for the undergraduate  students.  The LIGO REU Site will be under the jurisdiction  of Caltech, which has a tradition of excellence in  undergraduate science and engineering education.  ***",
