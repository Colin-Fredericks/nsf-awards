This  investigation relates the activities of specific brain cells  and the connections between them to the generation of  complex motivated patterns of behavior. The project focuses  on the role of  chemical substances called neuropeptides,  which modulate the activity of these nervous system cells  during motivated behavior such as eating. The studies are  conducted as part of an undergraduate summer program at the  Institute of Neurobiology in San Juan, Puerto Rico so that  every step of the research program involves undergraduates.  Most organisms, including humans, exhibit a variety of  motivated behaviors. This project investigates the  fundamental principles underlying the brain mechanisms  controlling such behaviors. By coupling the research to the  undergraduate summer research program, the project provides  students with access to hands-on research opportunities and  experiences that were previously inaccessible to students at  the host institution.",
