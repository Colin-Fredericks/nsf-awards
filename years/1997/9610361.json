 "awd_abstract_narration": "9610361  Starnes  The proposed research is directed toweard the ultimate goal  of obtaining useful polymers with superior properties.  Two  parallel projects are envisaged.  They are related in the  sense that both are concerned with chlorinated polymers and  with free-radical chemistry.  One project deals with the  preparation of new forms of chlorinated poly(vinyl chloride)  (CPVC) having unusual physical properties that should make  these resins excellent candidates for utilization as high  performance materials.  In this context, a specific  synthetic target is poly(1,2-dichloroethylene)(PDCE), whose  glass transition temperature has predicted to be much higher  than those of the current commercial CPVC's.  Approaches to  the preparation of PDCE and other new CPVC's will include  (a) the chlorination of poly(vinyl chloride)(PVC) with  molecular chlorine in the presence of various solvents that  can complex chlorine atoms, (b) the chlorination of PVC with  other reagents whose selectivities are unusual, and ( c)  synthesis by alternative routes in which no substantive  chlorination occurs.  This work will be extended eventually  to the preparation of other new chlorine-containing  polymeric materials.  The other project is designed to  identify and enumerate the anomalous (defect) structures in  vinylidene chloride polymers (PVDC's) and to elucidate the  mechanisms by which these structures are formed during  polymerization.  Particular attention will be paid to  thermally labile structures, because their mechanisms of  formation may suggest ways of modifying the polymerization  procedures in order to create polymers whose stabilities are  greatly enhanced.      %%%      This research could lead to the preparation of important new  materials that are very useful technologically and are in  the family of polymers that contains PVC, the world's second  most widely used thermoplastic.  The work also will make a  major contribution to science education by training advanced  researchers and by all owing Chemistry students at one of the  nation's premier undergraduate schools to do research in a  frontier with an internationally recognized group.      ***",
