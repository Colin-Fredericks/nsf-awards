 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706950    Biegler    This proposal deals with the development and application of  interior-point methods (IPMs) to nonlinear programming (NLP) problems.  Particular attention will be devoted to large-scale and structured  quadratic programming problems that are encountered as subproblems in  the solution of NLPs coming from chemical process engineering.  The  proposed research will focus on exploiting the structure of various  classes of process engineering problems through efficient decomposition  methods in large-scale linear algebra.  In addition, principal  investigators will develop and refine an interior-point strategy that  has close parallels with successive quadratic programming (SQP)  algorithms and address some open questions related to the efficient use  of warm-starts in IPMs.  Finally, these algorithms will be implemented  to demonstrate their performance on large-scale problems in process  engineering.    Increased international competition along with environmental  constraints and resource limitations require much more sophisticated  design and manufacturing strategies for chemical process industries.  Over the past decade these needs have started to be addressed by  efficient optimization strategies. Nevertheless, the size and  complexity of these problems (with sizes approaching a million  variables) impose a heavy burden on current optimization algorithms.  The proposed research will allow the solution of much larger  optimization problems faced by this industry. Through the development  and application of interior point methods for nonlinear programming, we  will be able to develop tailored solution strategies for the  optimization of large-scale steady state and dynamic process models.  This will lead to consideration of much larger and more difficult  process engineering models, as well as the integration of multiple  processes. The result will lead to chemical processes that are  environmentally benign, very efficient in the conversion of raw  materials to products and hi ghly competitive in today's marketplace.",
