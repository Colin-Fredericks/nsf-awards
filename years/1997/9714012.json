 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714012  Scott    Abstract    This award supports a collaborative interdisciplinary project to  characterize the carbonates and associated minerals in Martian  meteorite ALH84001 toward an improved understanding of the  conditions and mechanisms involved in their formation.  It is  supported by the Office of Polar Programs, the Chemistry  Division, and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  These chemically and isotopically heterogeneous carbonates have  been described as possibly containing organic and inorganic  fossils of ancient Martian biota.  Understanding the origin of  the carbonates is the key to evaluating these interpretations.  Two models for the origin of the carbonates in ALH84001 will be  studied: shock melting of carbonates at high temperatures, which  would virtually preclude the presence of fossils of carbon-based  life, and low-temperature deposition in pores and fractures from  aqueous fluids.    Petrologic studies using optical and electron microscopy and  electron probe analysis of thin sections will focus on the  effects of shock melting and shock metamorphism of minerals in  ALH84001.  Shock-formed silica and plagioclase glasses will be  studied in pyroxene fractures, crushed zones and uncrushed  regions and compared with analogous phases in other shocked  meteorites and terrestrial analogs to constrain the shock and  deformation history of ALH84001. Carbonate globules, disks and  grains in pyroxene fractures, crushed and uncrushed regions and  their associated oxides and sulfides will be studied to test  whether carbonates could have crystallized from shock melts that  formed and were partly mobilized during the impact that melted  plagioclase and silica.    Carbonates and shock-formed glasses will also be studied in  sections with laser micro-Raman spectroscopy and FT-infrared  microscopy to search for carbonate ions in glass and to  understand the shock and thermal histories of glasses and  carbonates.  Carbonates, glasses and other phases will be studied  on  fracture surfaces of the rock with atomic force microscopy  (AFM) to clarify the origin of the carbonate and its relationship  to the glasses.  AFM studies will focus on the distribution of  organic phases in the carbonate, its crystallinity and  the  degree of rotational disorder of carbonate-ions.  These features  will help in distinguishing biogenic and abiogenic carbonate  mineral phases.",
