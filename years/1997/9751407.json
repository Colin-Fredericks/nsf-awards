 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics and Statistics is strengthening the undergraduate program in mathematics by providing students with the technological tools necessary to solve complex and realistic problems.  Faculty efforts focus on five key courses: multivariate calculus, linear algebra, mathematical statistics, numerical analysis, and the undergraduate research project in mathematics.  These courses are using Maple, MATLAB, and SPSS with the goal of helping students to develop a qtrong conceptual understanding of mathematical ideas, the ability to apply mathematical ideas in meaningful and complex contexts, and the ability to clearly communicate mathematical ideas orally and in writing.    This project is establishing a computer classroom dedicated solely to mathematics and statistics instruction.  The classroom consists of 20 computers networked to a server and connected to the World Wide Web.  The addition of this facility is making possible the implementation of a technology-intensive mathematics program. The department has previously used the computer facilities to pilot sections of multivariate calculus, linear algebra, and numerical analysis.  The revised mathematical statistics course is drawing from faculty experiences teaching elementary statistics in a computer laboratory.    Half of the mathematics majors in the department are preparing to become secondary mathematics teachers.  The program impacts these students in two direct ways:  (a) by increasing the emphasis on modern technology, the mathematical and technical skills of future teachers are improving and (b) by actively involving students in their own learning, the future teachers are preparing the implement NCTM standards that emphasize appropriate use of technology throughout the curriculum.",
