Bordner at the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical  Physics, Kyoto, Japan.  Dr. Bordner will work with Dr. Ryu  Sasaki, professor, on a research project entitled, \"Quantum  Integrability and Strong-Weak Coupling Duality of the Affine-  Toda Field Theories.\"    The proposed research will examine the equivalence involved  in a quantum field theory that displays characteristics of  strong interactions between fundamental particles, yet, at  the same time, indicates weak mutual interactions.  This  equivalence would be useful in understanding how to  calculate physical quantities in a strongly coupled theory,  such as that describing nuclear forces.  The proposed  research will examine a particular class of theories  designated \"Affine-Toda field\", the rationale being that  they are hypothesized to exhibit not only strong-weak  coupling equivalence, but are also hypothesized to allow the  calculation of all physical quantities without any initial  approximation methods.  In the past, physical quantities  have been calculated only in theories with a weak coupling,  and then only using approximation methods.  This solvability  has led to a postulated form for the S-matrix, a concept  that describes the scattering of an arbitrary number of  particles as a result of coupling.  The research will  provide a valuable test of how different quantum field  theories are in fact different formulations of the same  theory, a finding that may eventually provide a solution for  how to predict properties of nucleons from a fundamental  theory of quarks.  ***",
