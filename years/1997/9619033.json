 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619033  Fox    The Austin Collaborative for Mathematics Education is a 54-month NSF Local Systemic Change project at $5,059,324.  Austin Independent School District collaborates with the College of Education and the College of Letters and Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin and with the Charles A. Dana Center at the University of Texas.  Estimated cost-sharing from partners is $ 2,906,011.  The project targets all approximately 2400 K-8 teachers of mathematics.  Each teacher will participate in at least 126 hours of formal professional development in summer workshops, institutes with students, and academic year sessions along with at least 120 hours of campus level support and classroom coaching, linked with the implementation of comprehensive, standards-based instructional materials in mathematics - Investigations in Number, Data, and Space in grades K-5 and the Connected Mathematics Project in grades 6-8.    The Austin Collaborative seeks to 1) build on sound and proven practice in mathematics education, 2) implement consistent and proven mathematics curricula by providing a common learning experience for every teacher in every school, and 3) create a professional development strategy that is intensive, on-going and a part of every teacher's day, every day.    Intensive staff development will be conducted by grade level, beginning with grades 5 and 6 in the first year and moving outward each year so that once a student starts, there will be no gaps in the delivery of the new standards-based mathematics program.  In year 2, grades 4 and 7 are targeted.  The summer institute will coincide with a lab school experience in which teachers and principals try out some of the new materials and strategies with summer school students.  Release days during the following school year will give teachers the opportunity to share experiences, reflect and ask questions.  Cohort teachers will come together in the second summer and the following school year.  The third component will be campus based  and will include work of designated campus mathematics specialists who conduct training and coach or team teach with teachers in the building.  District level mathematics specialists are attached to implementing schools for regular classroom visits and coaching.    Campus mathematics specialists and principals will have a minimum of 102 hours of leadership training above the content and pedagogy and materials training that all teachers will have.    Evaluation of the Austin Collaborative for Mathematics Education will focus on student achievement of all student groups, including scores on the state mandated assessment, TAAS; percentage of students passing pre-algebra and algebra; end-of-course exam results for Algebra 1; and enrollment in advanced AISD mathematics courses.  Other indicators of the Collaborative impact will be the administrative support on each campus for teacher collaboration time, community support, coordinated districtwide professional development, the retention of new teachers, and electronic communication among teachers and their presentations at professional meetings.",
