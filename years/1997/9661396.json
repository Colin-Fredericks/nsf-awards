The objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate high current densities and yields in selective fluorination reactions using custom designed soluble mediators and anodically regenerated solid phase fluorinating reagents. This will constitute a generic synthetic method for the selective substitution of fluorine into aliphatic carbon atoms, and special attention will be given to the applicability of the chemistry to larger scale operation.                While the applications of  fluorinated drugs and specialty chemicals continue to expand, the synthetic methods for their preparation remain limited and case-specific. In most cases multi-step syntheses are required, and the overall yields are poor. A unique opportunity for the development of a new synthetic approach for the synthesis of a broad range of selectively fluorinated compounds has been identified. This method will give access to a wide range of existing compounds at more competitive prices and new compound for use in drugs, agrochemicals and other areas.",
