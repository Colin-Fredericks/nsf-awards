 "awd_abstract_narration": "9661574  Behling  This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research project is to transfer materials design 'know-how' which has been developed for the formulation and use of inks into the development of extruded, thermoplastic matrix composite tapes which can be used for widespread, innovative and cost-effective over voltage surge suppression applications. Oryx Technology has successfully developed such a material in the form of a conductor-filled, polymer matrix, thick film ink which can be applied to the fabrication of small, discrete device structures.  Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a transient over-voltage event which poses a serious threat to integrated circuits (IC's) rendering them irreparably damaged due to the associated over-current flow through the circuit.  The standard means of contending with over-voltage threats is  to place a surge suppressor in parallel to the IC.  These suppressor types include diodes and varistors.  A need exists for a new generation suppressor concept which exhibits far lower leakage current and capacitance than existing devices.  These applications will include direct mounting of tapes onto printed circuit boards as well as the creation of on-leadframe and in-IC package placement.",
