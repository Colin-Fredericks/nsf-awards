The purpose of this grant is to study the relationships between three members of one gene family.  Hemocyanins are giant copper-containing protein molecules found freely dissolved in the hemolymph or blood of arthropods and molluscs.  Like hemoglobin, hemocyanin transports oxygen.  The PI has found that hemocyanin of a crab, Cancer magister, undergoes changes in structure and oxygen binding properties during development of the crab from megalopa to adult.  The PI seeks to explore how expression of hemocyanin subunits during development is influenced by internal, physiological factors including hormones and external, environmental factors such as temperature and food availability.  The crab also contains another hemolymph protein, cryptocyanin, that is similar to hemocyanin in size and shape but does not combine with oxygen.  A third related protein is present in the crab's nervous system.  The presence of three potential members of the hemocyanin gene family in one organism offers a unique opportunity to compare the expression of their genes and their physiological functions.  The PI will prepare specific molecular probes to study the site of synthesis of each protein and assess the effects of hormones, temperature and food levels on protein synthesis.  The PI will use techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, Northern blots, in situ hybridization, and antibody recognition.  The PI will also examine the role of cryptocyanin in molting and in forming the crab's new exoskeleton.  Comparisons of the amino acid sequences of the proteins will be used to help us understand the evolutionary relationships between these proteins and similar proteins found in insect hemolymph.    Results of this study will significantly increase our understanding about the structure, function and development of hemocyanin and related proteins. The studies may lead to a better knowledge of how giant, multisubunit prote in molecules are synthesized and assembled.  Basic knowledge about the effects of factors like hormones and nutrition on development, molting and growth of these economically important crustaceans will be beneficial to maintaining a healthy fishery as well.  ***",
