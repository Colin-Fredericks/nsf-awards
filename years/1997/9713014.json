 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a fundamentally new intersection of computer  scientists, mathematicians and molecular biologists working in an  area loosely known as DNA computation, in which the basic set of  questions are in the process of being defined. The field was born  in 1994 when Len Adleman (USC) showed how to solve a version of  the traveling salesman problem using DNA (Molecular Computation  of Solutions to Combinatorial Problems. Science, 266, 1021-1024,  1994).   Adleman's paper had a catalytic effect on the scientific  imagination even though it admittedly solved only a \"toy\" problem  that could easily be solved using pencil and paper, let alone a  teraflop supercomputer. By clearly articulating the principles of  his computation, the massive parallelism inherent in DNA  reactions, the energy efficiency of these reactions, and the  enormous storage capacity of DNA, he challenged the community to  discover the limitations of this approach. Furthermore, it is  widely believed that, if these principles are scalable, the  potential of DNA computation would be truly spectacular. Richard  Lipton (Princeton) published a paper a few months later in  Science (DNA Solution of Hard Computational Problems. Science  268, 542-545, 1995) generalizing Adleman's result to a  fundamental problem in the class of problems known as NP  complete.   The objectives of the Third DIMACS Workshop on DNA Based  Computers will be to present new work in the field and to  disseminate in printed and electronic form, information in all  areas that relate directly to computing with DNA including:  algorithms, applications, techniques, architectures, practical  obstacles to DNA based computers, proposed solutions to such  obstacles, computational processes in vivo, and  relevant  ideas regarding biological evolution. We will encourage papers  reporting experimental results.   The Organizing Committee is composed of a diverse group of  individuals from around the United States. The Committee has made  a commitment to make sure that st udents and investigators with  various and diverse backgrounds will attend the meeting. We  expect approximately 200 individuals will attend.  DNA  Computation, is a relatively new field, without an established  Journal. The June International Meetings are the focus for the  field.   The Conference will be held at The University of Pennsylvania,  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on June 23-25, 1997. The meeting will  be announced in several scientific journals as well on as on a  dedicated web site.  There will be three days of talks with time  for informal sessions and impromptu presentations. The  Proceedings of the Conference will be disseminated, as before, by  AMS- DIMACS.",
