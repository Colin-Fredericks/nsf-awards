 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Stinebring    Turbulence in the interstellar medium provides the support needed to  keep the gas from collapsing into a pancake.  Evidence from pulsar  observations indicates that a turbulent cascade of energy may exist  over 12 orders of magnitude in scale size from 10 to the eighth (one  hundred million) cm to 100 parsec. This turbulent cascade is not well  understood, although high mass stars probably account for much of the  energy input to the cascade through stellar winds, ionization, and  supernova explosions.  In particular, the dissipation of turbulent  energy into heat at some scale size less than 10 to the tenth (ten  billion) cm must occur, but the details of the mechanism and the  physical conditions under which this happens are sketchy.    The research to be carried out is aimed at determining the strength of  the turbulent cascade at a size scale around 10 to the tenth cm and  smaller and to learn more about the dissipation mechanism.    The main technique employed will be the observational study of radio  pulsar scintillation in the weak scattering regime.  This is an  opportune time to embark on such a study since both the upgraded  Arecibo, Puerto Rico telescope and the soon-to-be-completed Green Bank  Telescope will provide outstanding opportunities for pulsar  observations above 1 GHz.  This is the frequency range in which weak  scattering phenomena can be studied effectively.    The phenomenon of image-splitting, in which the pulsar image separates  into two or more distinct pieces due to scattering in the transition  regime between strong and weak scattering, will also be explored. The  goals are the same: to better elucidate the strength of the electron  inhomogeneity spectrum in the Galaxy and to seek evidence for a  dissipation scale.    High time resolution studies of bright pulsars will also be undertaken  using a well-known VLBI recording system, the S2 system, to obtain  baseband sampled data.  These observations, which can be conducted at  several observat ories (and observing frequencies) simultaneously, will  allow high-precision monitoring of pulsar dispersion measures.  This  provides additional information about the electron inhomogeneities in  the Galaxy. As a secondary effort, the baseband sampled data will also  be analyzed to study brief and intense radio emission from pulsars in  order to better understand the emission physics.    Undergraduate students from Oberlin College will be centrally involved  in all of these projects and will participate in observations,  analysis, and the presentation of the results.",
