 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal consists of two projects that extend theoretically and empirically the PI's previous work on increasing returns and local factor productivity. The research uses variants of the familiar division-of-labor models, which are now standard in trade, development, and growth to estimate the importance of external economies through increased local specialization.  The first project tests the effect of factor supplies on relative wages directly using panel data from the PSID.  The local division-of-labor model suggests a relationship between factor supplies and factor returns that is observationally distinct from alternative model specifications. New theoretical work shows that this relationship is observationally distinct from the Heckscher-Ohlin model and a model in which scale economies in education do not have a sectoral bias, as in Miyagiwa, 1991. Thus we test the local division-of-labor model against theoretical alternatives.  The second project is an estimation and analysis of state-level total factor productivity.  The theoretical model suggests that states with greater variety in intermediate inputs should have higher TFP. The basic model suggests a particular relationship between TFP and this characteristic of the local economic base. The first task of this project is to calculate TFP indices across industries and states. In doing so we follow procedures similar to those used by Harrigan (1996) to calculate TFP indices across countries. The second task of the project is to estimate the relationship of these indices to characteristics of the local base. Among the characteristics we consider are descriptors of the manufacturing base, the local service sector, and local relative supplies of human capital. An important aspect of this project is the development of additional measures of `local diversity,` estimating the correlation of these measures to TFP.",
