The symposium is being held to focus on recent progress in a research area rapidly evolving toward achievement of better understanding and practical device realization.  Organic electronic and photonic materials have significant projected advantages, for example, in reduced cost and large area display capability,  for a variety of communication and display device applications.  NSF funds will be used to support participation by graduate students and young faculty.  There will be an opportunity to assess the field, and to establish ties between universities, research institutions, and industry.  It is expected that top scientists in the field will attend, and that the symposium will provide an effective forum to discuss and delineate critical scientific issues in this rapidly developing research area. %%%  An evaluation of the progress and status of Organic Electronic Materials and Devices and related materials processing and characterization issues, especially critical materials research areas of synthesis, processing, and the relationship of materials research to device fabrication along with current assessments of the most important developments in this field will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of organic and polymeric materials in the field of electronics and photonics.    ***",
