To some extent, this is a natural and  inevitable consequence of individual choice, but several of the reasons for the lack of minority science,  mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) majors are largely reversible.  These include:  (1)  negative attitudes toward science and mathematics; (2) few or no role models; (3) lack of motivation; (4)  little or no knowledge of scientific engineering career options open to them; (5) engineering's unexciting  public image, and (6) a number of academic and cultural barriers that are particularly discouraging to  minorities.    Development of quality educational programs to attract and retain underrepresented minorities in SMET  careers is a well-established national priority.  This proposal describes a program designed to improve  the educational framework for emerging minority scientists and engineers.  The proposal focuses on  undergraduate education as its core component as well as the essential elements required to increase the  percentage of students in post-graduate SMET programs.    The partners in the prmposed Alliance represent diverse programs, yet have remarkably common  objectives.  The unifying goal is to build on the existing knowledge base relative to minority participation  in SMET fields and to expand the available opinions to enrich programs at partner institutions and  beyond.    North Carolina A&T State University (lead campus), Fayetteville Sate University, North Carolina Central  University, North Carolina State University, the University of North Carolina-Pembroke, the University  of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, the University of North Carolina-Charlotte, and the University of North  Carolina-Greensboro join in this project to increase access and opportunities for minority students in  SMET.  The goals of the Alliance are:  1) to  improve the quality of the learning environment for  minority SMET students at all schools, 2) to substantially increase the numbers of minority students  graduating with degrees in SMET disciplines, and 3) to develop and implement effective methods of  attracting talented minority students who would not otherwise choose careers in SMET.    The project emphasizes collaborative learning approaches, positive and sustained interaction with faculty,  intensive interaction with other support persons, and hands-on research and internship experience.  Using  this philosophy, three project areas have been chosen as crucial focal points for achieving that qualitative  and quantitative goals of the project.  These project areas utilize strategies with demonstrable effectiveness  in the retention of minority students in SMET.  They also focus on innovative methods interesting  community college students in SMET careers and concentrate on the transition point to graduate school.   All project areas involve faculty and industry members in the design and implementation of  improvements.    In this program, assessment is built into each project areas as a result of the formulation of specific,  measurable quantitative and qualitative objectives.  These objectives are reviewed and revised on an  ongoing basis.  Advisory committees composed of administrative personnel from the eight universities  oversee all aspects of the program.    Communication and ongoing exchange of ideas among partner institutions and beyond the Alliance are  primary objectives contributing towards the creation of permanent, positive changes in the infrastructure  of education for minority students in SMET disciplines.",
