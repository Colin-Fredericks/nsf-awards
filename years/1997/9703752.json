 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703752  Yau   The  incompressible  Navier-Stokes equation have been proved  as the   hydrodynamical limit equation of stochastic  lattice gas  models in  dimension 3. The first   project investigates the following three related topics:  (i)  the  scaling limit of  tagged   particles, (ii) the equilibrium fluctuation and  (iii) the appropriate time scale for dimensions   1 and 2.  The first problem emphasizes the  individual behavior of a typical particle instead   of the collective behavior of all the particles. The second problem is a question about the  central limit theorem. The third problem addresses  the time scale  in dimensions 1 and  2,   which is conjectured  to be very different from the diffusive scale in dimension 3. The   second project  studies the relaxation  rates of the Kawasaki dynamics of  Gibbs states in   infinite volume. This is believed to be  a power law. The method is  based on the Poincare   inequalities (spectral gap), logarithmic Sobolev inequalities and some entropy estimates.   The third project concerns the scaling limit of a quantum particle in a random potential.   There are two limiting cases: the low density  limit and the weak coupling limit. In both   cases, the phase space density of the quantum evolution  defined through  the Wigner   transform or the coherent state is expected to converge weakly to  a linear  Boltzmann   equation with  collision kernel given by the quantum   scattering  cross section.   This research addresses in particular the following two questions: (1) What is the   typical behavior of an individual particle in a fluid? Though the collective behavior of fluid    has been studied intensively, the important  question of the propagation of individual    particles in the fluid has not. The project will study this question with stochastic models   which are believed to capture the essential behavior of  the fluid.  (2) How does a wave   travel in random media. It is believed that  with high disorder, a wave in random media    becomes loca lized. The important question is to analyze the low disorder region when a   wave propagates. This can be considered as a model for conduction  of current in a   semiconductor, or propagation of radio waves or seismic waves. The practical  equation   governing all these diverse phenomena  is the  Boltzmann equation. This study will try to   validate the Boltzmann equation from more basic models involving  wave equations in   random media and to understand its next order corrections or fluctuations.",
