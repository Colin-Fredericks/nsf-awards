 "awd_abstract_narration": "9604408  Berridge    This project investigates how neural systems in the brain  control the sequential order of movements so as to produce  effective, coordinated action. The neural system targeted by  the project, the striatum, is known to control movement and  some aspects of natural behavior, and in humans it also  appears to help coordinate the sequence of words in language  and the sequence of thought patterns. The goal of this  project is to reveal the identity and characteristics of the  crucial neural circuits within the striatum that are most  involved in controlling sequential patterns of behavior, and  to understand how they provide normal coordination.  Experiments test the hypothesis that the sequencing circuit  uses the neurotransmitter dopamine to communicate between  neurons in the striatum in order to increase the strength of  particular natural sequential patterns of action in an  adaptive, goal-directed way. The project also examines how  the striatum uses modulation of sensory processing and  responsiveness to control sequential coordination of  movements. The results of the project improve the  understanding of how the brain coordinates normal behavior.  They may also provide insights into the processes that are  disturbed in human diseases that are characterized by  abnormal sequences of movement or thought (for example,  Huntington's Disease, Tourettes Syndrome, or obsessive-  compulsive disorder),",
