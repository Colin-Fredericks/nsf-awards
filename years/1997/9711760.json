The project will seek to obtain a deeper understanding of major forces in the change process and relies on theory regarding the restructuring process, consumption, ideology and identity, and the social construction of nature and place.  The methodology consists of three phases: cross-sectional analysis, mail surveys and case studies with interviews.  The research will contribute to a better understanding of the shape of restructuring and how social and economic restructuring are connected to a change from productive to consumptive uses of the landscape and different social constructions of nature and rural.",
