 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from Case Western Reserve University.  The project is to study the nature of self-medication with antibiotics by women in a regional city in Zaire.  The student hypothesizes that self-treatment with antibiotics has become the preferred therapy among women regardless of variation of illness conceptions or severity of symptoms.  The study will collect data from women of reproductive age using in-depth interviews, systematic elicitation techniques and open ended questions from a relatively small set of women. Based on the knowledge gained a survey will be designed and administered to about 250 women selected through a multistage sampling method.  From this sample a subsample of 15 women who report having experience with STD symptoms will be interviewed in-depth in order to examine the actual context of decision making.  Pharmacists and other antibiotic drug vendors will also be interviewed.   This research is important because powerful antibiotic medications are commonly sold without prescription or other expert medical control all over the developing world, leading to the development of drug-resistant strains of disease.  The new knowledge from this project about how and why people self-medicate will be valuable to health planners and decision makers in designing programs to address health needs while minimizing inappropriate use of antibiotic medicinal drugs.",
