 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9660988  Mehrotra      This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a semi-automated tool, based on the Multi-ViewPoint Clustering methodology to perhaps discover significant underlying structures of such complex systems from multiple points of view. By presenting different perspectives of the system one can gain significant insight into different interrelationships across the exposed structures.  The ability to develop and maintain large, reliable, complex knowledge-based systems in a cost-effective manner is still a challenging problem. A viable tool to structure knowledge-based systems before they become operational, will enhance their reliability and maintainability.  Phase I of the effort will look at the  feasibility of automating the analysis process in the MVP-CA software and design an interactive interface for useful information exchange between the user and the system. Such information will prove an invaluable aid for many software life cycle activities such as verification, validation, testing and maintenance of a knowledge-based system.   MVP-CA tool will be a significant advantage to software developers and maintainers.  It is expected that this tool will be integrated as a value-added product into software development environments to support the following activities: verification, validation, testing, maintenance reengineering and migration of knowledge-based systems software to object-oriented platforms.  ***",
