 "awd_abstract_narration": "Established in 1972, the University of Puerto Rico - Aguadillia, is a public institution serving the educational needs of students in the Northwestern region of the island.  A large majority of the students enrolled at the university are first generation students with limited role models and support from home for their university experience.  The University is a beacon of hope to many in a community plagued by illiteracy and poverty.  Originally authorized to grant associate degrees, the university has expanded its offerings to include bachelors degrees, including biology and chemistry in the sciences.  Striving to become a model of excellence, the institution's strategic plan stresses the importance of research and research training activities.  In support of faculty and students engaged in the scientific enterprise, the university with assistance from the National Science Foundation, will provide financial resources needed to improve research training facilities.  Specifically funds will be utilized to consolidate research space that has been shared with instructional activities.  Renovations will encompass:  upgrading the electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems; installing fume hoods, benches, cabinets and security devices; and  ensuring the facility  complies with ADA regulations.  A dedicated laboratory will be created to allow faculty and undergraduates to conduct investigative work in microbiology, biochemistry, inorganic, organic, analytical and industrial chemistry.  The project will enhance the ability of the Natural Science Department to accomplish significant research and training endeavors, provide assistance to the professional development of the secondary school science community, and encourage students to pursue advanced levels of scientific study.",
