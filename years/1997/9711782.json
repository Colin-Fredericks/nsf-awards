 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the mainstream theories on human movement coordination and  learning states that complex human movements are organized  as  a  concatenation of simpler movement primitives, which are  in  turn  scaled  with respect to space and time to generate a more diverse  range  of  movements.   The goal of this project  is  to  provide  machines  with  similar  motor  intelligence  capabilities:   the  ability to generate complex movements from a vocabulary of  basic  movement  primitives, to optimize movements for a  given  desired  objective,  and  to incorporate feedback mechanisms  that  ensure  proper  execution of the movement in the presence of  uncertainty  and disturbances.  Based on studies of human and animal movement,  basic  movement  primitives are identified for a  wide  range  of  robotic  systems  (e.g., manipulators and walking  machines).   A  \"motion  compiler\" will be developed that, given  a  sequence  of  primitives,  appropriately adjusts the sequence,  and  determines  optimal  time  and  space scalings with  respect  to  a  suitable  performance  measure.   The physical end-product  is  a  software  system  that  takes as input a machine's kinematic structure  and  dynamic  properties, a set of movement primitives, and a  desired  goal,  and  produces  an optimal coordinated  movement.   Key  to  developing  an  efficient  and  reliable  motion  compiler  is  a  powerful  set  of  recently developed multibody  system  analysis  tools based on the mathematics of Lie groups and Lie algebras.",
