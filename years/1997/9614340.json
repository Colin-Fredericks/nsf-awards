 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614340  Thurlow    The Mount Washington Observatory will produce a nationally syndicated, short-format radio series on the weather over a three year period.  The request is for a declining amount in each of the three years with the project becoming self-sustaining at the end of that period.    The daily, two-minute programs present facts about and explanations of the physical processes in all levels of the atmosphere, the nature of meteorological systems, weather observation and forecasting, and first- and second-hand accounts relating the effect weather and climate have on people.   During a fifteen month pilot stage, Weatherwise (Title to be changed to The Weather Notebook) has been carried on 115 public and commercial stations.  The NSF grant will provide the producers with the resources needed to expand carriage with a goal of carriage on at least 225 stations, to implement formative and summative evaluation, to upgrade production, to increase promotion, and to make ancillary material available to the public.  The ancillary materials will include a printed weather notebook which serves as a field guide for listeners in which they can make their own weather observations and draw conclusions, an educational weather poster, The Weather Notebook  transcripts and study suggestions, and a weather observation exhibit at the Mount Washington Observatory Museum.      The PI for the project will be David Thurlow of the Mount Washington Observatory who will serve as writer, host, and program coordinator.  The producer will be Douglas Mayer whose previous experience includes with NPR on Car Talk.  Evaluation will be conducted by RMC Research Corporation.",
