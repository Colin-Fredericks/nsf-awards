 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for support of a cooperative project by Dr. Steven Manson of the Physics Department at Georgia State University in Atlanta and Dr. Altun Zikry of the Physics Department at Marmara University in Istanbul, Turkey.  The project focuses on photoionization of open-shell atoms using many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), with particular emphasis on the very difficult transition metals and rare earth elements, and photoionization with excitation of closed-shell atoms.    With the advent of the new powerful synchrotron light sources, these kinds of systems will be more readily explored in the laboratory, thus rendering this study quite timely.  The further development of the MBPT codes will engender the possibilities of applying this very powerful methodology to systems where the amount of work was previously unmanageable and take full advantage of the revolution in computer hardware.    Scope:  This research project will be useful in promoting the scientific knowledge on the electron and photon interactions with atoms.  It involves US and Turkish scientists with complementary expertise.  Dr. Manson is an expert at extracting physical insights from conceptually simple and well-designed calculations of photoionization processes and the ionization of atoms by high-energy, charged particles.  Dr. Altun is most familiar with the use of the codes developed earlier for many-body perturbation theory.   This proposal meets INT objective of increasing U.S.-foreign collaboration in areas that benefit both sides.",
