It has been reported, however, that silica glass  optical fibers can be made flaw-free and that these pristine  glasses can also exhibit mechanical fatigue.  Recent  observations by atomic force microscopy (AFM) of glass fiber  surfaces showed that the initial strength degradation of  optical fibers is due to surface roughening rather than  crack propagation.  Thus it is necessary to understand the  mechanism and kinetics of surface roughening of pristine  glass surface in order to predict the fatigue life time of  optical fiber correctly.  The initial stage of the surface  roughening kinetics of silica glass with or without stress  will be investigated using an atomic force microscope and  will be compared with the theory for the surface roughness  development such as the noise-induced roughening theory and  the stress-induced roughening theory.  %%%  The long term mechanical stability of silica glass optical  fiber is an important concern in optical communications.  Life time prediction of optical fibers requires the  understanding of the mechanism of mechanical fatigue. In  spite of extensive investigations, the mechanism remains  unclear.  Recent observations by atomic force microscopy  (AFM) of glass fiber surfaces showed that the initial  strength degradation of optical fibers is due to surface  roughening rather than crack propagation.  Thus it is  necessary to understand the mechanism and kinetics of  surface roughening of pristine glass surface in order to  predict the fatigue life time of optical fiber correctly.
