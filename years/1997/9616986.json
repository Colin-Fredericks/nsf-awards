 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616986  Park    This award provides partial support for the acquisition of   portable magnetometers and associated field equipment by the  University of California at riverside that will become part of a  centrally managed pool of equipment and made available to US  researchers for field deployment in projects using the  magnetotelluric (MT) technique to image the Earth's deep interior  structure. The University of California at Riverside is committed  to providing the remaining funds necessary to acquire the equipment  system.    Remote sensing  of the Earth's crust and upper mantle using MT  methods recently has made significant progress in producing images  of internal structures with good spatial resolution and with  content (electrical conductivity) that is distinct from seismic  images (seismic velocities). The MT method makes use of the  time-dependent natural electromagnetic fields (EM) induced inside  the Earth by the variations of the Earth's external geomagnetic  field. The induced electric (telluric) currents diffuse into the  Earth and are scattered back from heterogeneities in the electrical  resistivity structure. The complex, frequency dependent,  relationship between the horizontal magnetic and electric fields at  the surface is called the MT impedance and can be inverted to solve  for the resistivity (or conductivity) structure of the interior.  Conductivity properties of the interior are of considerable  interest because they depend strongly on the presence of conducting  ionic fluids or melts which are difficult or impossible to detect  with other remote sensing techniques.  ***",
