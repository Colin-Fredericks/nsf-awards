 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700139  Veenstra  This is an award to assist in the purchase of equipment for  conduct of research being conducted by seven co-investigators who  are investigating the fate of organic compounds when released  into the biosphere and concepts to decontaminate soil and to  reduce or prevent environmental pollution by production process  changes and by treatment of process residuals.  The projects  being conducted by co-investigators from the School of Civil and  Environmental Engineering and the School of Chemical Engineering  include development of a novel granular activated carbon  regeneration process, use of alternating current plasma reactors  for treatment of volatile potential air pollutants, biological  treatment of soil contaminated by pollutants produced during  production of munitions, development of a biofiltration process  for treatment of gases containing potential air pollutants and  development of a process for manufacture of sulfolane to minimize  production of environmental pollutants.    The proposal leading to this award, was submitted in response to  NSF 93-155, Research Equipment Grant Program.  This award will  assist the seven co-investigators involved in conducting research  using equipment obtained with assistance from this award to  increase their competitiveness, efficiency and output.  The  equipment will also enhance capabilities for education of  graduate and undergraduate students.  ***",
