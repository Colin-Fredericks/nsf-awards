 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Desrosiers  SURFing the Physics Lab is a NIST-NSF partnership to  encourage outstanding physics students by providing research  opportunities with the world-class atomic, molecular,  optical and radiation physicists in the NIST Physics  Laboratory.  To strengthen undergraduate AMO physics  curricula, the program director will work with department  chairs and directors of centers of excellence to identify  two or three undergraduates from each institution who are  prepared for, and would benefit from, off-campus summer  research in AMO physics.  The selected students will spend  12 weeks engaged one-on-one with NIST physicists in projects  combining quests for fundamental knowledge with direct  applications to problems of national importance.  Student  and advisor will be paired based on background and  interests.  The students will live in a nearby furnished  apartment complex and participate in the many NIST seminars  and in a weekly SURFing the Physics Lab summer seminar  series.  The students will present their research in a  seminar at NIST and be encouraged to participate in a  scientific conference during the following year.  NIST, NSF  and the participating schools will share the costs for this  program.  Given the significant lack of diversity in the  present physics work force, this program will actively seek  out competitive students from under-represented groups.  ***",
