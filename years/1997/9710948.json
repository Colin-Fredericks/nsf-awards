 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9710948  Carter  This Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project from ADA Technologies, Inc. addresses a fundamental difficulty encountered by a number of groups that desire to have networked students collect scientifically valid data for use by scientists.  The challenge is to have students collect accurate data which has been scientifically validated without sacrificing the educational aspects of the program.  An example network might measure the pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature in a river from its head waters to its outlet as an indication of the river's environmental condition.  ADA Technologies proposes to address this issue of data accuracy and validation by using a unique set of hardware developed by ADA along with unique software algorithms to be developed under this Phase II project.  The hardware includes a low-cost, hand-held, four channel data logger with a set of self-identifying sensor modules.  The unique calibration and data tagging aspects of this system provide an opportunity for data tracking that does not exist for any other product.  All this information will be processed using innovative software algorithms which will perform a number of internal consistency tests to validate the data.  These checks will be part of an education organizational model that will help students learn critical thinking skills and can be replicated in all the network programs.  This model will link students with scientists and promote direct interaction focused around a specific scientific goal.  The aim of this program is to develop an organizational model combined with unique hardware and software that can aid networks in gathering scientifically valid data while insuring an educationally significant experience for the students.   This project will lead to commercial data acquisition and analysis tools for use in science classrooms.  The capability of involving students in an authentic scientific research effort prepares students for a future in a scientifically and technologic ally-oriented society as well as teaches them much of what they must learn in a science course.  ***",
