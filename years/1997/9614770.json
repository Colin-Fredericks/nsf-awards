The Baikal Drilling Project (BDP) is a multinational  effort (Russia, Japan, Germany, USA) to extract the record of  global climate change and tectonic evolution of the Lake Baikal  sedimentary basin.  Historically, the BDP began in 1989 as a joint  Russian-American scientific venture.  In January 1993, the BDP  team, in cooperation with the NEDRA Drilling Enterprise of  Yaroslavl, Russia, successfully deployed a light-weight drilling  rig from a barge frozen into position on the Lake.  With this  system, the first long (>100m) hydraulic piston cores were  successfully recovered from two holes in 354m water depth providing  climate data spanning the last 600,000 years.  In January-March  1996 technological improvements of the BDP drilling system made by  NEDRA enabled drilling to a subbottom depth of 250m, providing data  on climate change up to 4.5 million years ago.  Planned drilling  will examine the response of Siberia's energy balance to the  initiation and intensification of northern hemisphere glaciation (3  - 2.8 Ma) and the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau.  One of the  important hypotheses to be tested is the extent to which the long-  term climatic evolution of Siberia has influenced the distribution  of tundra and wetlands in central Asia and thus affected the global  methane balance.  ***",
