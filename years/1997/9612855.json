 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support for emerging network applications requires that the basic  delivery service provided by the network infrastructure be augmented  with services that are implemented in the end systems connected to the  network.  Examples of such services include: recovery from messages  lost in the network; encrypting transmitted information; verifying  that received information was not forged or modified in transit;  adjusting the rate of transmission to available bandwidth; and  attaching identifying information to the transmitted data so that the  receiver can process it even if it arrives out of order.  Some of  these services are provided today by protocols that are organized in  layers.  Although it is a very useful paradigm for organizing network  functionality, research and experience have identified several  problems with layering as it is applied to end-to-end functions  (i.e. those that are implemented in the end systems rather than the  network). In particular, layering causes services to be too coarsely  grouped together, so that applications may have to make use of some  services they don't need in order to get others.  (For example, TCP  forces an application that needs congestion control to also accept  reliability -- which, if not needed, just adds unnecessary overhead.)  Layering also causes functions to be implemented in more than one  place in the stack, and hides information that might be useful for  improving efficiency.    This project aims to develop and deploy a platform for end-to-end  functions that incorporates the lessons learned about protocol design  and implementation over the last several years.  The platform, which  is called Tau, is not intended to identify all the functions that  applications may ever require, but rather to streamline the process of  incorporating those functions into systems and applications as they  are identified and developed.  The approach involves developing a  simple conceptual framework and a common message format that supports  optimization of  common processing paths, while also allowing for  extension at a (modest) cost in efficiency.    Tau has three main features.  The first is an explicit composition  mechanism (a metaheader) that promotes modularity of function and  implementation but avoids the problems associated with layering.  The  second is a generic protocol interface, which allows individual  protocol functions to be implemented separately, then composed  efficiently, to provide just the services required by the application.  In developing this feature, the project will contribute new methods of  integrating code for fast execution while preserving modularity at the  source code level.  The third feature is a set of protocol functions  that can be extended to include new services in addition to the  traditional ones mentioned above.    Information on the Tau Project is available via the World-Wide Web at  http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Ken.Calvert/Tau.html",
