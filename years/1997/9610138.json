 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to investigate several types of  cryptographic protocols that are unconditionally secure, i.e.,  their security does not require any computational assumptions.  Examples of topics to be studied include construction of  efficient authentication codes, robust secret sharing schemes,  key distribution schemes and broadcast encryption schemes.  All  of these topics are of fundamental importance in cryptography in  providing for confidentiality and/or integrity of information. As  the Internet becomes increasingly important in everyday life,  security of the information it contains is a critical factor.  Hence, methods of providing information security are of great  practical importance.  Unconditionally secure protocols are very  desirable precisely because their security can be rigorously  proved and quantified. The main mathematical tools used are  combinatorial in nature; error-correcting codes and combinatoral  designs play an essential role.  Other mathematical techniques  come into play in an important way, including information theory  and number theory.  The two main objectives are to construct new,  practical, efficient schemes, and to evaluate them in terms of  the amount of secret information that needs to be exchanged and  the computational complexity of the actual algorithms that  implement them.  Thus there is a whole spectrum of activity to be  carried out, from initially providing a mathematical solution to  the actual implementation of an algorithm.",
