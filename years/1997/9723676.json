 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723676  Schneider     Nerve cells communicate with each other by the release of  chemical messengers or neurotransmitters, which then act on  neighboring cells to complete transmission of the message.  The release of the chemical neuro- transmitter is regulated  by a brief rise and decay in cell calcium in the nerve  endings or terminals. Whatever regulates the calcium levels  in the nerve terminals will in turn regulate the rate,  amount and duration of release of the  chemical  neurotransmitter. The objective of the present project is to  clarify  the mechanisms regulating the calcium signals for  neurotransmitter release using a model nerve cell system  known as adrenal chromaffin cells. Chromaffin cells derive  from the interior of the adrenal gland and like nerves,  secrete their neurohormones, adrenaline and noradrenaline,  in response to a rise in cell calcium. While the cellular  mechanisms regulating the rise in cell calcium  are well  understood, those regulating the buffering and decay of the  calcium signal for secretion are not well defined. Such  mechanisms are important since they in turn will regulate  the strength and duration of communication between nerve  cells. The present project will test a novel mechanism for  regulating  calcium signal decay which uses a sodium-  dependent calcium transport protein to  remove calcium from  the cell. Such transport proteins are known as sodium-  calcium exchangers and may exist in several different forms  in different cellular compartments. The role and nature of  the sodium-calcium exchange proteins in calcium signal decay  will be determined. The project should result in an improved  understanding of the cellular mechanisms regulating the  calcium signal for neurotransmitter release and the  identitiy of the calcium transport proteins involved in  cellular calcium clearance and signal decay.",
