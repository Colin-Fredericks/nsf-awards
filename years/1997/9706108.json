The idea is  to find the least number of elements from one of these sets to   give a good approximation to problems in these areas.  This will  allow finite dimensional techniques to be used on  infinite dimensional problems as well as giving quick  approximations to solutions which are more accessible to the  computer.  We use, and extend, deep results from the local theory  of Banach spaces to stronger results in Hilbert spaces to carry  out the goals of the project.  The project also involves work     on the L(1)-Problem:  Is every complemented subspace of L(1)    isomorphic to L(1) or l(1)? A new approach to the problem    relies on shifting the problem to an equivalent problem on a    more computable space than L(1).  This setting may     allow a solution to the problem.    The main goal is to reduce calculations of wavelets and frames    to the least number of vectors possible.  First, this will allow    infinite dimensional calculations to be reduced to the finite    dimensional setting.  Second, in the finite dimensional setting,   it may reduce the number of necessary calculations to something    closer to the capacity of the computer.  This could significantly    reduce the length of time for calculations and for transmitting    data.  These methods are some of the most applied techniques around    today.  They are used in imaging problems from everything from    satellite imaging to x-rays.  If one could significantly reduce the    calculations necessary for such computations, it should have broad    application to all of these important imaging problems.",
