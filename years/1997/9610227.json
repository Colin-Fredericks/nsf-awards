 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program supports Professor Nathan L. Bauld's   investigations of the chemistry of cation radicals in solution.    Professor Bauld, of the Department of Chemistry of the University of   Texas at Austin, is developing a convenient mechanistic criterion for   distinguishing electrophilic additions to alkene pi bonds from additions   proceeding via initial electron transfer reactions.  Formation of   homobenzylic cations through addition of electrophiles to aryl vinyl   ethers and sulfides, wherein the alkene is insulated from the aromatic   ring by virtue of the heteroatom, correlates with the Hammett sigma   value, while one-electron oxidation of such substrates correlates with   the Hammett-Brown sigma-plus value.  In contrast, when the alkene is   directly attached to an aryl ring, both protonation and ionization   correlate preferentially with sigma-plus.  Professor Bauld is developing   a unique set of substituent parameters which promise significantly better   correlations for cation radical formation, permitting the distinction   between electrophilic and electron transfer reactions of styrene   derivatives.  A new addition polymerization strategy based upon   sequential cation radical reactions offers an attractive route to   Diels-Alder and other cycloaddition polymers and will be explored   mechanistically and as a method for the synthesis of new materials.  Professor Nathan L. Bauld, of the Department of Chemistry of the   University of Texas at Austin, with support from the Organic Synthesis   Program, carries out studies of the formation and reaction chemistry of   two classes of reactive molecules, one (`cations`) bearing a net positive   charge, the other (`cation radicals`) having a positive charge and also   containing an unpaired electron in addition to those electrons involved   in forming the chemical bonds in the molecule.   He is developing a set   of parameters to describe the reactions which can lead to the formation   of either of these classes of molecules, determining which types of   molecules lead to simple cations and which to cation radicals.  The   importance of these unusual species is highlighted by Professor Bauld's   investigations of a new method for the formation of polymeric materials   based upon the reactions of cation radicals.  This chemistry promises to   afford both new materials and milder routes to known materials displaying   a range of important properties.",
