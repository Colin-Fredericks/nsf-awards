 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of Native American varieties of English indicate that  these varieties may combine source language transfer from ancestral  Native American languages, generalized adaptive interlanguage  processes, and even the elements of a more expansive, pan Native  American English variety. Although a limited tradition of  sociolinguistic inquiry into Native American English varieties has  now developed, some essential dimensions of these varieties remain  largely ignored. Curiously, one of the most critical but neglected  areas of study with respect to Native American varieties of English  is the extent to which these varieties may or may not adopt local  dialect norms. Such linguistic accommodation is often an important  index of assimilation and may indicate in subtle but essential ways  how such groups situate themselves sociolinguistically and  culturally. Furthermore, the investigation of the types of  sociolinguistic boundaries that exist between vernacular varieties,  particularly in tri-ethnic contexts, is critical in addressing  central issues concerning the dynamic nature of ethnolinguistic  boundaries in American English varieties. This research examines  language change and variation in the English of three post-insular  Native American communities in rural North Carolina. The Lumbee,  Haliwa Saponi, and Cherokee Native American communities of North  Carolina represent instructive contrasts in terms of (1) their  recognized status as Native Americans communities, (2) their  historic isolation from surrounding communities, and (3) their past  and present language contact situations. These situations thus  offer a unique laboratory for comparing how ethnic groups configure  their sociolinguistic identity over time and space. Extensive  cross-generational sociolinguistic interviews are being conducted  in each research site, both with local Native Americans and with  cohort speakers from corresponding contact varieties.  Qualitative-descriptive and quantitative-variationist analytical   models are applied to the emerging data, and the objective analysis  of language variation is complemented by the analysis of data  obtained from subjective speaker identification tasks. The  comparative analysis includes both intra- and inter-regional  dimensions in order to determine the dynamic nature of  sociolinguistic boundaries. In addition, data gathered in a variety  of speech situations will be utilized in the examination of  intraspeaker variation. The research seeks to explicate on an  empirical basis the principles and mechanisms that account for  language adaptation, variation and change found in language contact  situations",
