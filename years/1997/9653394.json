 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Applied Aquatic Science and Aquaculture will conduct a three-week summer project for 20 undergraduate faculty that demonstrates environmental problem-solving as an effective teaching strategy to stimulate undergraduates' interest in environmental science. Using the theme of Stressed Stream Analysis, participating facultv will learn NEPA-based environmental analysis concepts and techniques and will work in teams to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for a new pollution source in a disturbed stream ecosystem. Concepts and skills participants will learn and use hands-on include: hierarchical habitat analysis, employing biotic indices and microscopic techniques to evaluate pollutant effects on organisms, analyzing anthropogenically-induced landscape changes over time with GIS (Geographic Information System) technology, and water quality analysis of nutrients, metals and microbes in a stressed stream ecosystem. In the year following the June 1997 program, participants will develop and implement new curricula at their home institutions then meet for a three-day workshop to report on and discuss successes and problems. Written reports by the participants will be compiled into an edited report available at cost to other educators and advertised in professional newsletters and on the Internet. We seek applications from a diverse mix of new and experienced faculty who teach at colleges that emphasize undergraduate science education and student research opportunities.",
