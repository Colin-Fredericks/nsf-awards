The project will be based upon the successful Physics  Teaching Resource Agent (PTRA) model.  Teachers will be selected  from urban schools throughout the country to participate in an  intensive one-week program each summer for five years.  In the  program, project staff will teach teachers physics content and  innovative teaching strategies.  The workshops will take place just  before the AAPT summer meetings which these teachers will also  attend.  In each of the academic years of the project, these  teachers will carry out in-service programs with colleagues in  their districts who teach physics or physical science so that the  knowledge gained in the summer program will be disseminated  throughout the urban area.  This in-service activity will be  supported by project staff and lead PTRA teachers from their  geographic area.  Altogether, 575 teachers will be served by the  project.    Matching funds constitute 7% of the NSF award.",
