 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701826  A four-year program of research and education is proposed,  covering a range of topics connected by a common concern with  OBJECTS and concentrating in two major areas: (1) development of  STATIC TYPE SYSTEMS for object-oriented languages and (2) study  of CONCURRENT and DISTRIBUTED OBJECTS. Specific goals include:  comparison and consolidation of different type-theoretic models  of objects; investigation of the key mechanism of \"polymorphic  update\" of structured data; development of useful partial type  reconstruction techniques for languages with subtyping and  polymorphism; investigation of the role of parametric  polymorphism in modular reasoning about concurrent systems; and  the study of type systems capable of ensuring various forms of  noninterference between concurrent activities. An important  research vehicle is the experimental programming language Pict, a  testbed for statically typed concurrent programming using  objects, based directly on Milner's pi-calculus. Teaching  projects focus on the development of the programming languages  area at Indiana University; major goals include a new core course  on Type Systems and a course on avant-garde \"web languages.\"  ***",
