 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707567   Fu    The pattern of segregating nucleotides in a sample of DNA sequences from multiple individuals of a population contains rich information about the history of that population, and can therefore be used to make inferences on various aspects of the population history. The goal of the project is to develop methods for estimating the age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of a population. The methods will be developed based on coalescent theory and computer simulation, and will make full use of the pattern of segregating sites in a sample. Several population genetics models will be considered, including the neutral Wright-Fisher model and population growth. Various degrees of uncertainty in the values of population parameters that are required for estimating the age of the MRCA will be incorporated into the methods. The methods developed will be applied to available data, particularly those from humans. The computer programs resulted from this project will be available to researchers through the World Wide Web.    The age of the MRCA of a population is an useful quantity for studying the evolution of that population. For the origin of modern humans, the age of the MRCA is crucial for distinguishing the two major hypotheses, the \"out of Africa\" hypothesis, which postulates an African population rapidly and completely replaced the populations in all other regions of the world, and the \"multiregional\" hypothesis\", which postulates a gradual and simultaneous transformation of archaic regional human populations into modern populations. Since the methods developed in this project make use of the pattern of segregating sites, which is highly informative, and do not require haplotype information, which is costly and time-consuming to obtain, they will be particularly useful for samples from a nuclear genome. The project will contribute to the theory and methods for the inference on the age of the MRCA of a population, and will facilitate the study of human evolution in particular.",
