Students participate in a spring semester research seminar offered at the University and on-line via the WWW to off-campus participants.  The seminar covers basic research, writing, and presentation skills, and helps students to select an advisor and design a research project in their advisor's area of specialty.  The participants are selected from area universities and community colleges, including the five Tribally Controlled Community Colleges located in North Dakota.  Research areas include neural networks, computer vision, speech recognition, network design and simulation, human-computer interfaces, and application development for remote sensing tasks.  Students are able to select from this diverse set of topics for their summer projects.  The goal of the project is to provide research experiences and training to undergraduates in computer science, focusing on students from regional institutions where opportunities for research are rare.",
