Compared to bulk single  crystals, the nonlinearity of ferroelectric thin films is smaller  and the loss is higher, the cause of which is not well  understood.  This project aims to address these problems by  focusing on the effects of four factors: (1) Stoichiometry; (2)  Crystallinity; (3) Interface layers and space charges; and (4)  Soft-mode phonons. The goal of the research is to reveal the  fundamental mechanisms so as to reduce the losses while  maintaining a high nonlinearity in ferroelectric thin films.  The  education plan is to develop a \"Ferroelectric Thin Films\"  experiment for the Physics undergraduate laboratory course, which  includes film deposition, structural and electrical  characterizations and data analysis.  %%%   This integrated CAREER research and education project focuses on  ferroelectric thin films used in voltage-tunable microwave  devices.  Such application requires large dielectric nonlinearity  and low microwave losses in ferroelectric thin films.  This  research aims to reveal the fundamental mechanisms that determine  these properties in order to improve them thus impacting the  development of ferroelectric tunable microwave device  technologies.  The education plan attempts to incorporate  research experience into the physics undergraduate curriculum.  A  \"Ferroelectric Thin Films\" experiment will be developed and  included in the regular laboratory course so that students can  get real-life research experience in this course.  ***",
