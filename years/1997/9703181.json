 "awd_abstract_narration": "The implementation of the National Information Infrastructure initiative will  require the efficient transmission and storage of voluminous amounts of  multimedia traffic, particularly image and video data.  This project offers a  multidisciplinary attack on this challenging problem with the goal of providing  a system-wide optimized solution rather than a possibly mismatched collection of  efficient subsystem solutions.  It advocates an integration, in both research and  education, of relevant aspects of three engineering subfields that have been  traditionally treated separately: Signal Processing, Communications, and  Networks.  The primary educational goals are to help develop interdisciplinary  specialists, and to integrate research more heavily into engineering education.    This project promotes an adaptive and integrated approach to the algorithmic  design and architecture of next-generation visual communications systems for the  compression and reliable delivery, over noisy time-varying channels and  heterogeneous networks, of images and video. A unifying thread is the use of  flexible multiresolution-based frameworks for 1) source coding, 2) channel coding  and 3) joint source-channel coding, with the goal of maximizing the delivered  image/video quality using fast algorithms.  In education, the primary goals are  to help develop multidisciplinary specialists, and to integrate research more  heavily into both undergraduate and graduate education.",
