 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this research is to investigate resource   management and traffic-related issues that will enable efficient transport  of compressed video streams over an ATM network.  These issues include the  determination of network resources to be allocated for a given traffic  stream,  the prioritization of compressed video streams, the design and management of  scheduling techniques that the network can implement to provide differential  service to various priority levels, and the effect of resource sharing on the  effective bandwidth and buffer size allocated to a stream.  In order to study  the aforementioned issues, an accurate characterization of compressed video  traffic is required.  Accordingly, we will first capture, digitize, and   compress (via compression standards) several video streams (e.g., movies),  whereby the picture dynamics (in terms of scene changes, panning, zooming)  varies from one movie to another.  These captured traces will be used to   develop traffic models for single and aggregate (statistically multiplexed)  compressed video streams.  The traffic models developed will extend beyond  the entry node of an ATM network to include compressed  streams at intermediate   nodes inside the ATM network.  Performance studies (queueing-based) will be  done of interfering traffic mixed with compressed streams (MPEG-2).  The ATM   testbed at Michigan State University will be used for the proposed research.
