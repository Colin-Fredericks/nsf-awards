 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of our NSF grant (USE 91-56112) was to support the development and evaluation of a new curriculum and supporting materials focused around the practice of computing. The keystone of our new curriculum is a four-course core sequence which incorporates closed laboratories. Lecture materials and content are supportive of the laboratories rather than the other wayaround. We are presently in our fourth year of development with the first three core courses firmly in place and with the fourth course taught for the second time this Spring, 1996 semester.    We are ready to begin active dissemination efforts. We are conducting a Workshop for Course Curriculum Change Using C++ and the Closed Laboratory Model this Summer, 1996 (NSF-DUE-9554715). Based on the overwhelming response we received, we propose to offer this workshop again and other dissemination efforts during Summer, 1997.      This proposal requests support for a more aggressive dissemination effort. Specifically, we propose a four-prong approach:    1. A Mini-Workshop for the participants of this year's (1996) NSF UFE Summer Workshop for Course  Curriculum Change Using C++ and the Closed Laboratory Model (DUE-9554715) to assess the impact of the Summer, 1996 workshop.     Two new workshops for Summer, 1997:    2. the first one (Workshop for Course & Curriculum Change Using C++ and the Closed Laboratory Model) will be similar to the Summer, '96 workshop for faculty who have a working knowledge of C, but not C++ and are interested in implementing the closed laboratory model in their CS curriculum.  3. the second workshop (Workshop for C++ Syntax and Course and Curriculum Change Using the Closed Laboratory Model) will focus more on the specific needs of Community College faculty, high school Advanced Placement Computer Science teachers, and faculty from colleges and universities who do not know C or C++.    4. Panel Presentations at regional small college computing conferences by workshop participants and UVA faculty.      We believe  these efforts will enable the participants' schools to enhance their computer science curricula in a contemporary and efficient manner and will help other schools to begin thinking about their curricula needs.",
