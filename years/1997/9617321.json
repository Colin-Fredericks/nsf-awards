Michigan State University     CISE Research Instrumentation: Equipment for Real-Time Interaction with Images     This research instrumentation grant enables the purchase of equipment to be used in the following research projects: -Self Organization for Vision-Based Learning, Databases and Content-Based Retrieval, Modeling , Tracking, and Interpretation of Human Faces.  Research is being performed in vision-guided robotics, visual learning, organizing  and accessing databases of images and modeling and tracking human faces. Key elements of the research include - investigation of systematic methods for automatic learning over multiple tasks including navigation and object recognition, -organization of imagery for fast access using integrated features such as shape, texture, and color, and -modeling and storage of objects for fast recognition and real-time tracking. Advancement in the research projects depends critically on the new instrumentation which will provide the capability to interact in real-time with both sensed images from the environment and images stored in memory. A steerable camera system will be used for experiments in navigation, hand-eye coordination and tracking of hands and faces for gesture recognition. RAID disk memory connected to two powerful workstations will provide for large and fast storage for two simultaneous experiments which may be storing or searching video images or performing real-time   model-based tracking. We anticipate that our  research projects will yield several benefits, including improved man-machine interaction, better access to image databases, and better methods for learning automatic recognition procedures needed in many practical problems.",
