 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722545  Sohn    This award supports a two-year collaborative research  project between Dr. Andrew Sohn of the New Jersey Institute  of Technology and Dr. Dongseung Kim of Korea University in  Seoul, Korea on \"Modeling and Analyzing Communication  Behavior of Parallel Programs on Distributed-Memory  Multiprocessors.\"  The objective of the project are to 1)  model the capabilities of hardware and software for  overlapping communication with computation, and 2) compare  the overlapping capabilities of distributed-memory  multiprocessors on selected benchmark problems.    Distributed-memory multiprocessors are known to have the  architecture needed for increasing the machine's capability  by simply adding more processor to the system.  Programming  distributed-memory machines, however, is often difficult due  to many practical issues including algorithm design, data  distribution, and workload distribution.  When a large  number of processors work together to solve a single  problem, communication between processors becomes key to  determining the performance of large scale distributed  memory machines.  This project will combine the expertise  and facilities of the U.S. and Korea research groups in  addressing this important problem in computer science.  ***",
