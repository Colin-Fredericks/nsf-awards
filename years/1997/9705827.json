 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forstneric will work on  (a) the holomorphic  automorphism groups of certain complex manifolds, with the emphasis  on Stein manifolds with infinite dimensional automorphism groups  (such as the complex Euclidean spaces); (b) applications of the  above to the construction of proper holomorphic embeddings in  Euclidean spaces with low codimension (such as the embedding of  open Riemann surfaces in the complex two-dimensional plane);  (c) topics in polynomial and rational convexity; (d) topological  properties of pseudoconvex domains. The research topics in (a)  include the approximation and interpolation of holomorphic mappings  (or smooth mappings from real submanifolds) by holomorphic  automorphisms, the classification problems for finite holomorphic  transformation groups on low dimensional complex Euclidean spaces,  existence and classification of (complete) holomorphic flows on low  dimensional Euclidean spaces and other related manifolds, dynamical  properties of automorphisms, etc.      In many natural and social sciences one tries to explain phenomena  by choosing a suitable model space (usually such a space is a manifold  in mathematical language) such that each point of the space represents  certain state of the observed system, and the laws governing the  system can be expressed as algebraic or differential conditions  (equations or inequalities) on the given space. Global symmetries of  these model spaces (automorphisms in our language) often play a very  important role in understanding the structure and properties of  solutions of the considered problem(s), and they often help  simplifying the problem by changing it to certain standard  (model) problem for which the solutions are well understood.  Often the natural model spaces are complex manifolds (as opposed  to the real manifolds), the simplest being the complex Euclidean  spaces. Their automorphisms have much more rigidity and are much  less understood than their real counterparts. This is our main  motivation for studying g lobal automorphisms of model complex  manifolds and their applications.",
