 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the extent to which peoples' behavior in games reflects their attempts to predict others' decisions by taking their incentives into account.   (These games are interactive decision problems in which each person's rewards may depend on others' decisions as well as his own, so that a person's best decision may depend on his predictions of others' decisions.)  This notion, called `strategic sophistication`, is of primary importance in predicting the outcomes of economic, political, and social interactions.   Not surprisingly, it is also a central issue in theoretical analyses of strategic behavior.  The leading theoretical frameworks treat it very differently: Noncooperative and cooperative game theory take the degree of strategic sophistication to be unlimited, while evolutionary game theory and adaptive learning models take it to be nonexistent or severely limited. The persistence of such disparate theoretical treatments suggests that questions about strategic sophistication are unlikely to be resolved by theory alone.  Empirical analysis requires tight control of preferences and information, which seldom occurs naturally in the field but which can be achieved in laboratory experiments. Experiments have an additional advantage for studying sophistication, which has not yet been fully exploited.  Sophistication is an aspect of cognition, which usually must be studied indirectly, by drawing inferences from the model that best describes observed behavior.  However, Camerer, Johnson, and their collaborators have developed methods to study cognition via subjects' information search patterns in `extensive-form` games--games in which peoples' decisions are represented in sequence, as in a decision tree.  Their results suggest that appropriately designed experiments make it possible to study sophistication more directly. Camerer and Johnson's designs exploit special features of the extensive-form games they studied, but the Mouselab software they developed also makes it possible to present games in `normal form` -- as payoff matrices or tables in which subjects can look up their own and others' payoffs for the different possible combinations of decisions as frequently as desired, one at a time.    The experiments in this project use Mouselab to study strategic sophistication in normal-form games. There are close connections between game-theoretic analyses of behavior in extensive- and normal-form games, but their cognitive foundations are very different. The different presentation and processing of payoff information in normal-form games make it possible to explore aspects of sophistication that do not come into play in extensive- form games.  The main goals are to test noncooperative game theory's cognitive implications, and to learn whether deviations from them help to predict the occurrence and nature of deviations from the theory's behavioral implications.  The experiments should yield cognitive insights complementary to those of  Camerer and Johnson, and shed new light on strategic behavior.  The proposal concerns experiments to be designed and conducted in collaboration with Miguel Costa Gomes, a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego, and Bruno Broseta of the University of Arizona.",
