 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Arthur J. Ashe, III, Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan,   is supported by the  Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program   of the Chemistry Division for the study of  heteroaromatic compounds   involving group 13 and 15 elements and their transition metal complexes.  Previous research has demonstrated that boratabenzene zirconium complexes   can serve as homogeneous  catalysts for the polymerization of olefins.   Building on this result and by analogy to  ansametallocenes that are known   to be active catalysts, a series of metal complexes containing  heteroaromatic ligands will be designed with the goal of obtaining highly   active and stereospecific  olefin polymerization catalysts. Specifically    boratabenzene complexes which bear pendant  substituents of varying   electronic and steric demand and a series of bridged boratabenzene  complexes will be prepared. These compounds will exploit variations in   electron donating ability  possible with the heteroaromatic ligands to   fine tuning and develop more effective polymerization  catalysts.  Finally   new boron containing heterocycles will be prepared in order to extend the  range of heteroaromatic compounds available to be used as ligands.  Transition metal complexes promote  very selective catalytic and   stoichiometric transformations of organic compounds. Much of the unique  reactivity at the metal center is a reflection of the density of   electrons surrounding the metal and  this electron density can be   controlled by adjusting the groups that are attached to the metal. A  very   common 'group' contains a ring of carbon-hydrogen units in what is called   an 'aromatic'  arrangement. In this project a series of metal complexes will   be prepared in which an 'aromatic' group  composed of carbon-hydrogen and   boron species is attached to a metal. This will permit the electron  density about the metal to be carefully adjusted in order to promote   specific chemical and catalytic  behavior and will set the ground work   both to understand existing processes and to rationally design  new ones.",
