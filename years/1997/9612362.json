The key component of the ocean power project that makes if  feasible is the recently invented helical turbine that is a  breakthrough technological innovation to use hydro energy of  the oceans.  Technical development of the helical turbine  has been sponsored by the U.S. DOE, New England Power  Company and Allied Signal, Inc. in 1995-1996.  The Allied  Signal acquired the exclusive worldwide license on the  turbine and committed to build a demonstration project.    The research includes the following major tasks:    1. Development of theoretical and physical models of     oceanic power farms.    2. Fundamental research on engineering aspects related to     harnessing oceanic energy by means of such power farms     constructed under ocean surface.    3. Mathematical and experimental modeling and analysis of     the influence of the projected power farms on the global     ocean and atmospheric circulation and the water ecology.  ***",
