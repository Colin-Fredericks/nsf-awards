 "awd_abstract_narration": "Faculty  from three departments  (Mathematics,  Biology,  Physical  Science)  prepared this group proposal.  Its goal is to enhance understanding  of mathematics, science, and their interactions and relevance to  students.  Objectives are to increase scientific literacy, student  awareness  of  connections  between  mathematics  and  science,  critical  thinking and problem solving skills, and ability of future teachers  to incorporate math into their classrooms.   This proposal will  develop a multidisciplinary, general education level quantitative reasoning course that will use basic algebra to answer science questions.      Students completing this course should have better problem  solving skills and exhibit a greater level of scientific literacy.  Assessment will include comparison of students in newly developed  and preexisting courses through value-added testing, performance on  standardized tests,  and tracking student success in subsequent  courses.  Dissemination may include presentations, publications,  and a Web page.  This project will encourage minority participation  in math and science.  Approximately 30% of the students at SOSU are  Native American and less than 20% major in mathematics or science.",
