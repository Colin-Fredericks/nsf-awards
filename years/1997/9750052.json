These  fellowships support studies involving the theoretical,  comparative, computational, and/or experimental analyses of  biological patterns and processes at the molecular level  within the framework of organismic evolutionary change and  adaptation.  These studies also include the use of molecular  data to address broader evolutionary questions.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled \"Coevolution  of nuclear and mitochrondrial cytochrome C oxidase genes in  a marine copepod.\"  The marine copepod Tigriopus  californicus is being used to determine the degree to which  cytochrome C oxidase genes are coevolving.  Cytochrome C  oxidase (CO) is a key enzyme of cellular respiration and is  composed of subunits encoded by genes in both the nuclear  and mitochrondrial genomes.  Sequence variations are being  used to determine the coevolution of these genes in  genetically divergent Tigriopus populations.  Also, it is  being determined if nuclear genes from one population can  regulate the expression of mitochrondrial genes from another  population and affect their assembly into the holoenzyme.",
