 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9604108  Ballester      Technical         This proposal is studying proteins which are important in  maintaining the integrity of the cell wall of the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  The cell wall is responsible for  the morphology of the yeast, its mechanical strength and  selective uptake of molecules.  Its composition and structure  changes during the cell cycle and in response to environmental  signals.  The cell wall integrity pathway is required for cell  wall biosynthesis, and it is composed of Rho1p, protein kinase  C and a MAP kinase cascade of serine/threonine protein  kinases. This investigator has identified a family of plasma  membrane associated proteins - Par7p, Par 15p, and Par 18p  that function upstream of protein kinase C.  Association with  the plasma membrane and sequence characteristics of Par  suggest that these proteins act as receptor molecules required  for the activation of the cell integrity pathway.  This grant  aims to characterize the role of the Par proteins in the  regulation of the cell integrity pathway.  Other genes in  yeast with a functional relation to PAR will be identified,  and the component of the pathway that they regulate will be  determined.  This will be done by characterization of  extragenic mutations and high copy suppressors of the lysis  defect of a par mutant strain.  These studies will also  determine whether Par 8, a protein with homology to the Pars,  is a new member of the PAR family.  This will be established  by deletion analysis of the PAR8 gene and complementation of  the phenotypes of the par mutant to test its functional  relation to the cell integrity pathway.  These studies will be important in understanding how yeast is  able to maintain its cell wall during during normal cell  growth and in response to its environment.      Non-Technical       This proposal is studying the role of a new family of  plasma membrane associated proteins that are required for  maintaining the integrity of the yeast cell.  The regulatory  p athways affected by these proteins will be identified.  ***",
