 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, addresses the dynamics of high energy particle  bombardment of organic surfaces, and the laser ablation of these  systems.  The computational studies of this project focus on  questions of angular distribution and identity of sputtered  species, and in the case of the laser ablation simulations, also  consider the possibility of excitation and relaxation processes  in the desorption.  Close interaction with experimentalists  studying these processes is a hallmark of the computational  studies being carried out here by Professor Garrison and her  students at Pennsylvania State University.  The detailed  understanding of these processes is essential to the development  of processing and analytical techniques in the semiconductor  industry and in the analysis of  biomaterials and organic interfaces.  A detailed understanding of the dynamics of ion or photon induced  desorption of organic species from organic thin films is  necessary for the development of analysis tools in the electronic  materials industry and for the design of biomaterials and  biocompatible interfaces.  One approach  to developing this understanding is to simulate the processes  computationally, and to search for insights into the processes  based on these simulations.  This is the goal of this research  project.",
