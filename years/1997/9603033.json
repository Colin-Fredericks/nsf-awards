This research project will undertake a study of the  long-term performance of geosynthetically reinforced walls  and implications of creep and stress relaxation on design.  The problem of time-dependent response of geosynthetically  reinforced soil structures requires study from the  standpoint of fundamental mechanics and current design  procedures, for future applications.  The major goals are:  1) to experimentally study stress relaxation of selected  geosynthetic reinforcement;  2) develop a simple  constitutive model to realistically simulate the time  dependent behavior of the reinforcement;  3) implement this  model into an existing finite element computer code; and  4)  conduct an extensive numerical parametric study of  geosynthetically reinforced walls at working stress  conditions.    The proposal brings together two laboratories that have  constituted different parts of the process:  the Americans  will be responsible for conducting the analytical parts of  the research and the Japanese will be conducting the  centrifuge tests.  The results of the research will  facilitate the understanding of time dependent behavior of  geosynthetic reinforcement interactive with backfill soil  and will make the design of such structures more rational.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project  will broaden our base of knowledge and promote international  understanding and cooperation.  ***",
