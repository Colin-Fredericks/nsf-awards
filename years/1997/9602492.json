 "awd_abstract_narration": "9602492  Katz    This award supports U.S.-Japan collaborative research  between Dr. J. Lawrence Katz of the Department of Biomedical  Engineering at Case Western Reserve University and Professor  Noriyoshi Chubachi in the Department of Electrical  Engineering at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.  Dr. Katz  will be spending six months at Tohoku University undertaking  scanning acoustic microscopy studies of micromechanical  properties of osteoporotic bone. The researchers will  research ultrasound techniques which measure sound velocity  and/or attenuation through specific bones, in vivo, to  assess the level of \"bone quality\" in order to develop more  effective screening techniques for osteoporosis as well as  providing an indication of when bone might be at risk of  fracture.  This technique  provides an advantage over dual  energy x-ray absorptionmetry (DEXA)  which provides information about the material properties of  bone, such as stiffness and rigidity, rather than bone  density.  By developing correlations between elastic  properties and bone strength, it then would be possible to  develop a fracture risk index which could become the basis  for early intervention of medical procedures to prevent the  occurrence of fractures.    The U.S. researcher brings to this collaboration his  knowledge of  the scientific relationships between  structure, function and properties of  bone tissues.  More  recently he has been involved in research into the form  function relationships in bone tissues undergoing material  changes (losses) due to the onset of osteoporosis.  This is  complemented by expertise of the Japanese researcher in the  area of high frequency scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM)  for bone micromechanic studies.  His laboratory is equipped  with a state-of-the-art SAM for work at very high  resolution.  The project is expected to result in greater  prediction of fracture risk to the large number of women,  people in long term bed rest, and astronauts in the  microgravity environment o f space who have, or are prone to,  the serious condition of osteoporosis.  Both researchers  have expressed their expectation to continue research on  their project after the conclusion of  the six month visit.",
