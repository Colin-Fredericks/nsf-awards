This money was awarded to investigators through  joint NSF/USGS peer review panels. A stipulation in each award  was that investigators contribute to a special report on the  earthquake that would serve as the definitive report on the  earthquake.  Thus this report should serve as the major reference  on the earthquake for future generations of scientists,  engineers, and social scientists.  This award provides funding  for publishing that part of the report focusing on the  performance of the built environment, which is the portion of the  research supported primarily through NSF's Earthquake Hazard  Mitigation Program.  This is a collaborative effort between NSF  and the U.S. Geological Survey.  ***",
