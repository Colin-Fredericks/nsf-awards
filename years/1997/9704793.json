 "awd_abstract_narration": "Papageorgiou    This project will study several nonlinear problems involving  free surfaces separating fluids with different properties and  where surface tension is important. We will study flows  modelled by nonlinear evolution equations which encounter  finite-time singularities as interfaces touch and a change in  topology takes place. An example is the breakup of a liquid  jet into droplets. A paradigm problem of physical interest is  the compound jet comprised of a core fluid surrounded by a second  immiscible annular fluid. Breakup under the capillary instability  usually produces compound spherical particles and analysis of  the local singular phenomenon is of value in both designing  experiments and incorporation into and testing of hybrid large scale  simulations. In addition we will study the motion and management  of bubbles in surfactant solutions (fluid phases with impurities).  Of particular theoretical importance is the prediction of parameter  ranges where the bubble is remobilized after its bouyant or  thermocapillary motion is arrested or retarded by surfactant build-up  at the back end of the spherical bubble. In many cases system parameters  are large and asymptotic solutions of the singular perturbation  type will be constructed and analyzed.    We study two related classes of fundamental problems  encountered in several key technological and  manufacturing situations. A common feature is the presence of interfaces  separating fluids. These have important effects on how the fluids move  and the mathematical and computational analysis of such models is  extremely useful in diverse manufacturing processes as well as on-going  experiments in microgravity environments (for instance parabolic flights  as well as in the space shuttle). Using tools of mathematical  analysis and modern computational methods will enable us to identify  important physical regimes which would perhaps be prohibitively  expensive in the laboratory or in space. In addition, the use of mathematical  analy sis is imperative in extreme situations (which are more the rule  rather than the exception in many processes - for instance the  breakup of a liquid jet into droplets). Besides their intrinsic usefulness,  such mathematical solutions can be used to make large scale computations  more accurate and efficient as well as test the accuracy of existing codes.  Liquid jet breakup has many modern applications in addition to the more  traditional ones of printing and fuel injection systems. Compound jets  are useful in the manufacture of compound particles used for slow drug release,  the manufacture of fibres used to reinforce mechanical or aerodynamic  components, and color printing with environmentally friendly inks and dyes.  Our studies of bubble dynamics should lead to identification of efficient  operational regimes in large scale purification systems (contaminated liquids  are often purified by passing large numbers of gas bubbles through them),  provide theoretical guidelines for the design of safe agricultural sprays,  and produce theories that can be compared to experiments done in space  aiming at the production of sophisticated materials in  containerless microgravity environments.",
