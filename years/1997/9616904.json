 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an ethnography of the social and cultural worlds of ;modern cosmology and cosmologists.  A contribution to the emerging field of anthropology of science, it endeavors to open up new perspectives for studying the relationships between culture and knowledge production in scientific communities.  Although cosmology is a traditional subject in anthropology, no one has of yet turned an anthropological eye to the making of our own culture's scientific cosmologies.  The concept of cultural contact, central to this inquiry, will be used as a theoretical lens to investigate how researchers from very different scientific lifeworlds -- theoretical particle physics, observational astronomy, and theoretical astrophysics -- are interacting and negotiating with one another in constructing a picture of the origin and evolution of the universe.  Methodologies will include 1) interviews; 2) observations of cosmologists in their work settings, e.g. research group meeting, informal lunchtime discussions, seminars, and national conferences; 3) analysis of the scientific literature, both technical and popular; and 4) examination of how institutional forms -- departments, journals, conferences, interdisciplinary centers -- are changing due to the interdisciplinary interactions in this field.                                                     %?\u00a2?\u2551\u00a9\u00c1\u255d\u00a2  \u2551?%\u2563\u2502` _/,\u00c1\u255d\u00a2  />\u2524 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u00c0\u00c1>\u00c1\u255d/% \u2551\u2510\u2593%\u2563\u2502",
