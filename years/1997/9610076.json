 "awd_abstract_narration": "9610076  Chen    The principal investigators will study second order partial differential   equations of elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic types containing certain types   of nonlinearities. The objectives are:  (a) The exploration of spatio-temporal   chaotic vibration phenomena for the one dimensional wave equation with   nonlinear boundary conditions;  (b) The use of boundary elements and   quasimonotone iteration techniques to analyze and compute controlled   coupled semilinear elliptic and parabolic systems with point observations   and inequality control constraints; (c) Visualization of state and control on   annular and dumbbell-shaped domains by varying the geometries involved   in order to understand the control effects.    The two investigators will develop effective and innovative theoretical as   well as numerical tools to study the nonlinear problems involved. This   research promises to enhance, through visualization, the understanding of   complex nonlinear phenomena and pattern formation in many fields such as   mechanical vibration, acoustics, mathematical biology, chemostat and   chemical reactors, and ecology. This in turn will further aid in the   development of new mathematical techniques for nonlinear sciences.",
