The underlying equations are   those that arise in elasticity and viscoelasticity and the desired   singularities are point discontinuities.  Problems that will be   considered include: the existence of singular solutions to quasilinear   elliptic systems; the existence of, and admissibility criteria for,   singular solutions to hyperbolic systems; the existence of minimizers   with singularities for problems in the calculus of variations; and,   the determination of whether known discontinuous solutions to   quasilinear elliptic systems are in fact minimizers of the   corresponding problem in the calculus of variations.  %%%     The research area of this grant is the mathematical analysis of   equations that arise in Materials Science.  The most common way to   determine when a material will fail under the influence of external   forces is to subject a piece of the actual material to tensile   loading until failure occurs, i.e., \"pull on it\" until it breaks.    This is fine if one is interested only in the gross properties of   the material.  However, if one wants to understand the reasons for   material failure then one must have recourse to mathematical models   of the material.  Experiments on certain rubbery polymers, called   elastomers, have shown that when one pulls on an elastomer small   holes appear in the material.  These holes then grow in size and   combine to form cracks.  A similar phenomenon occurs in optical   fibers.  If one tries to send too much power through an optical   fiber then a series of holes can form in the core of the fiber.    These holes seriously degrade the ability of the fiber to transmit   information.   In this grant, the principal investigator will uncover   the mechanisms that cause the creation and growth  of holes in polymers   and glasses by examining systems of partial differential equations   from the theory of elasticity and viscoelasticity.    ***",
