 "awd_abstract_narration": "Instruction-level parallel (ILP) processing has been an area  of great interest in the computer architecture community and  the semiconductor industry.  Almost all of the processors  developed since the last decade do ILP processing in a major  way.  Ongoing advances in ILP processing necessitate a careful  examination of the amount of parallelism that exists in  typical programs under various execution models. The main  objective of this research is to investigate the potential of  pursuing multiple control flows in ILP processors.  The study  starts by quantifying the effect of different control flow  constraints on available parallelism.  Software support for  pursuing multiple control flows is then studied.  Novel  methods to specify control independence and data independence  to the hardware are part of this study on software support.  This research also studies hardware issues relevant to  pursuing multiple control flows, such as tradeoffs between the  number of speculative paths and performance using detailed  simulation models.  Preliminary simulation studies have been  conducted to get an idea of the amount of parallelism  available with single control flow and multiple control flows.  These preliminary results indicate a factor of 2 increase in  available parallelism when multiple control flows is pursued  instead of a single control flow.",
