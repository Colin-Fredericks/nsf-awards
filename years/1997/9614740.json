The film will introduce viewers to the methods and significance of scientific field research and the rigor and excitement of the scientific endeavor through an expedition to the top of the world's tallest mountain.  An international climbing team of women and men will advance the research of geophysicist Roger Bilham who has been influential in applying Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to the study of earthquakes in the Himalaya.  The film also will explore the physiological challenges the climbers face at extreme altitude.  Endoscopic and microscopic photography will reveal the human body's amazing adaptations to a cold, low-oxygen environment.  A comprehensive package of ancillary materials for teachers, students, film exhibitors, and the general public will enhance the educational experience of the film.    Greg MacGillivray, President of MacGillivray Freeman Films, will be the PI and Executive Producer/Co-Producer/Director/Photographer.  Stepehen Judson and Alec Lorimore, both of MacGillivray Films, will be Co-writer/Director and Co-Producer respectively.
