 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a keen interest in developing ceramics for a  variety of applications ranging from use as structural  components, to energy-efficient thermal barriers, to high-  performance electronic substrates.  Structural ceramics have  unique properties that can be used to great advantage in  advanced heat engines, such as automotive gas turbines, and  low-emission high-efficiency diesel engines.  Certain  composites are also being developed for various high-  temperature applications such as wear resistant materials  and smart structure application.  Smart ceramic fibers and  piezoceramic patch sensors may be attached to the external  surfaces of structures, or directly embedded within  materials such as advanced composites, to provide in-situ  measurements of composite curing, health monitoring of  structures, estimating aerodynamic loads on flight vehicles,  etc.  Thin film oxide-based structures, including high-  critical temperature superconductor (HTSC) structures and  ferroelectric perovskites, are needed for fabrication of  electronic devices such as various sensors and transducers,  filters and nonvolatile memories.  This film III-V nitrides  have also generated tremendous interest because of high-  brightness semiconductor light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and  injection lasers with wavelengths ranging from red to  ultraviolet (UV).    This proposal focuses on basic science issues affecting both  advanced structural ceramics and electronic ceramic  materials in a synergistic manner.  The research team  includes North Carolina A&T State University (NC A&T), North  Carolina State University (NCSU), Oak Ridge National  Laboratory (ORNL), and selected industrial partners.  NC A&T  State University has been associated with both ORNL and NCSU  for many years in the advanced ceramic materials research  area, and has trained and graduated students together with  these organizations.    This proposal addresses the fabrication of advanced  materials and smart structures using innovative materials  proce ssing methods ranging from ion-assisted pulsed  deposition and plasma-source molecular beam epitaxy for thin  films, to liquid infiltration and reaction synthesis for  bulk materials.  The advanced materials and their structures  of particular interest include structural (surface  engineered ceramics, metal-ceramic joints, metal-ceramic  composites, tungsten carbide-aluminide composites, and  piezofiber composites), and electronic (high-Tc  superconductor heterostructures, piezoelectric thin film  structures, and wide-bandgap III-V nitride heterostructures)  materials.  The proposal emphasizes materials processing,  characterization, structure-property correlations,  performance testing, and modeling for all the proposed  materials structures in a coherent way, utilizing  complementary skills at NC A&T, NCSU, ORNL, and industry  partners.  The Center will systematically investigate the  influence of various processing parameters on microstructure  evolution and properties.  Additionally, the atomic  structure and chemistry of defects and interfaces will be  investigated using high resolution TEM (with 0.18 nm point-  to-point resolution) and STEM-Z contrast (with point-to-  point resolution 0.13 nm) microscopy techniques.  The above  combination of techniques, expertise and instrumentation  affords the exploration of the nature of metal-ceramic  interfaces produced under pulsed laser irradiation, and of  interfaces in superconductor and semiconductor  heterostructures; and these will then be correlated with  properties and performance of these novel materials  structures.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be  trained under the joint supervision of NCA&T, NCSU, ORNL and  industry partners.  We propose to build upon existing  collaborative research and education programs involving  various combinations of the proposal partners (NCA&T-NCSU,  NC A&T-ORNL, NCSU-ORNL, NCSU-Kopin, NCA&T-numerous  industries, etc.).  Strong outreach efforts targeted towards  the local community will also be a pa rt of this center  activity.",
