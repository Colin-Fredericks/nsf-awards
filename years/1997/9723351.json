 "awd_abstract_narration": "Muscles are designed to perform many different functions within the body.  Different muscle types perform each of these different functions.  There are certain key characteristics within a muscle that makes it better suited to perform a particular function.  For example, those muscle groups involved with sprinting, or any high power activity, have a typical \"fast muscle\" phenotype.  That is, these muscles can move limbs extremely fast and can generate energy for that movement quickly.  However, these fast muscles fatigue very quickly.  Muscles that are designed for posture or endurance exhibit a typical \"slow muscle\" phenotype.  These slow muscles produce much less power than fast muscles, but can remain active for much longer than fast muscles.  Thus, muscles show an inverse relationship between power production and fatigue.      Muscles have the remarkable ability to change fiber type phenotype.  For example, a person training to become an endurance runner will significantly increase his/her number of slow muscle cells within locomotor muscles.  This ability to adapt allows organisms to better handle a new environment.  The studies to be performed during the present proposal address the fundamental mechanisms that dictate muscle fiber type diversity in animals.  Specifically, the genetic component of muscle fiber type adaptation, i.e. DNA, will be studied herein.",
