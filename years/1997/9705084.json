A shaking table is requested for  the Center for Structural Dynamics Research at the Virginia  Campus of The George Washington (GW) University.  As one of the  research arms of GW's Department of Civil, Mechanical, and  Environmental Engineering, the Center has solid potential to  emerge as a leading site of earthquake engineering research and  education.  The shaking table will be used to enhance ongoing  experimental research at the Center.  In addition, it will  provide a unique opportunity for the Center for Structural  Dynamics Research to offer extensive educational and training  programs in the area of earthquake engineering.  The shaking  table will also provide a reliable and versatile tool to help the  center integrate its already well-established theoretical  research activities with experimental validation and evaluation.    The requested system is a shaking table with six degrees of  freedom measuring 2 meters by 2 meters bearing a payload of 8,000  pounds.    The George Washington University has committed 38% in matching  funds towards acquisition of the shaking table and is committed  to provide the necessary costs for the site preparation and for  the equipment installation.  ***",
