 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703997  Salvucci    The research described in this proposal addresses the spatial structure and the scaling properties of hydrologic fluxes over complex topography.  It is designed to test the hypothesis that under certain geologic and climatic conditions, the spatial structure of hydrologic fluxes is controlled by the two-way coupling of ground- and surface-water processes as constrained by topography.  The issue of spatial structure will be addressed using recent advances into the understanding and modeling of interactions between long time scale groundwater flow and short time scale surface hydrologic processes (Salvucci and Entekhabi  WRR, 30 (10), 2737-2749, 1994; WRR,31 (7), 1725-1739, 1995 ).  These studies demonstrated that the vadose zone interactions between shallow groundwater and surface fluxes can in theory be parameterized by the equivalent steady-state moisture profile (the steady moisture profile which transmits the long term mean recharge to or discharge from the saturated zone.)  This simplified coupling represents the critical feedback between the depth to groundwater and the near surface soil moisture, which in turn has a strong influence on event time scale evapotranspiration and runoff generation.  Through this feedback and a statement of long-term mean continuity, the equilibrium surface water balance, water table depth, and groundwater divergence are uniquely related.    Here this technique will be applied to a series of groundwater simulation experiments over a well-studied prairie landscape in Canada  Toth, 1966 .  The numerical experiments will be used as a means of testing whether or not the observed spatial patterns of recharge, midline and discharge can be explained by the coupling expressed by the equivalent steady moisture profile.  If verified here and in future studies, this approach would offer both a tractable way of conceptualizing certain groundwater-surface water interactions and a practical alternative to the current practice of a priori specification of  recharge and discharge areas in regional groundwater modeling.  For this site the influence of naturally occurring sub-hillslope length scales of recharge, midline and discharge on the scaling of hydrologic fluxes will be studied.  Prgogress in the scientific understanding of these issues has direct impact on practical problems involving the spatial disaggregation of remotely sensed estimates of soil moisture and the parameterization of subgrid scale land surface fluxes in numerical climate models.",
