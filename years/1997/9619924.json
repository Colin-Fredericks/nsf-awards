Selected graduate students will act as co-mentors.  Current research projects are in the areas of:  electronic materials and devices; photonics and optoelectronics; computer engineering; communications; signal/image processing.  In order to expand their exposure and experience, the students will also have half-day-a-week involvement with our undergraduate semiconductor processing laboratory, our signal processing laboratory, and a series of informal seminars on \"current\" topics in electrical engineering.  Ethics and the role of the technology in society will be introduced in a way so as these social concerns will not be seen in isolation, but rather, as an important component of ones professional activities.   The goal of the program is to increase the pool of domestic applicants to graduate study in engineering, and help clarify their views of the fields of engineering and science.  This will be accomplished by involvement in cutting-edge research and exposure to a variety of areas within the field of electrical engineering.  ***",
