 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the  development and characterization of novel fiber-optic sensors for  the determination of part-per-billion concentrations of  pesticides in real environmental samples.  Professor Booksh and  his students at Arizona State University will develop a variety  of such sensors including antibody immobilized devices that  utilize attenuated total reflectance of their surface plasmon  resonance signals in order to achieve selectivity and  sensitivity.  The probe geometry will be optimized for this  application and multivariate calibration algorithms will be used  to improve data quality when system parameters vary.  This CAREER  research project will also expose students at the undergraduate  and graduate levels to the power of multivariate methods when  analytical measurements involve complex real world samples.   Professor Booksh will also mentor disabled students interested in  scientific careers.  The determination of the concentrations of pesticides in the  environment is an important health problem that is highly complex  due to the variability of real world sample composition.   Professor Booksh and his students at Arizona State University  will develop fiber-optic sensors based on antibody/antigen  reactions that produce analytical signals that can be reliably  interpreted over time.  This CAREER project will provide students  with a stimulating research experience in an area of immense  societal importance.  The extreme sensitivity and selectivity of  antibody/antigen reactions coupled with fiber-optic sensor probes  will be exploited using attenuated total reflectance of surface  plasmon resonance signals that follow these reactions.  In  addition to the pedagogical value of teaching students useful  applications of this chemistry Professor Booksh will mentor  disabled students interested in scientific careers.",
