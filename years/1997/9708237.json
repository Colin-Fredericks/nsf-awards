 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor William S. Jenks, of the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State   University, is supported by the Organic Dynamics Program and the Office   of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences   Directorate for his studies of the photochemistry and photophysics of   sulfoxides and related species.  Through a combination of experimental   and calculational studies, Professor Jenks targets the characterization   of the photochemically active excited states of alkyl and aryl sulfoxides   and their dynamics, the determination of the mechanisms by which   sulfoxides quench traditional triplet sensitizers in cases where energy   transfer is unlikely due to energetic considerations, and the   determination of mechanisms by which other molecules can quench sulfoxide   excited states, with particular emphasis on development of electron   transfer reactions.  Through the study of a variety of photochemical   reactions of sulfoxides, including stereomutation, alpha cleavage, and   deoxygenation, a predictive paradigm will be constructed to assist in the   analysis of photochemical properties of sulfoxides and the development   and exploitation of their photochemical reaction chemistry.  With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences   Directorate, Professor William S. Jenks, of the Department of Chemistry   at Iowa State University, studies the interactions of light with a class   of organic molecules known as sulfoxides, containing a bond between   oxygen and sulfur.  Such compounds occupy an important niche in organic   chemistry due to their unique combination of chemical and physical   properties.  Whereas the thermal reactions of sulfoxides have been   well-studied and have been exploited for the preparation of a variety of   significant products, the light-initiated reactions of sulfoxides are   still in the discovery and development stages.  By applying a variety of   experimental and calculational techniques, Professor Jenks explores the   ways in which sulfoxides interact with light, the structures and   reactions of the species generated by such interactions, and the products   which may be obtained as a result of these reactions.  These studies   contribute to our fundamental understanding of photochemical reactions   and may lead to the development of useful new strategies for the   synthesis of important organic molecules.",
