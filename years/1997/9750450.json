 "awd_abstract_narration": "As knowledge at the molecular level is expanded, the understanding of processes at many other levels is enhanced.  This knowledge, and understanding of the tools provided by the techniques of molecular biology, is important for all students of biology.  However, there are three difficulties in teaching molecular biology effectively at undergraduate, liberal arts institutions.  (1) The techniques involved are time consuming and expensive and in many cases require specialized equipment.  (2) When students are conducting experiments in the laboratory, they are often so intent on learning unfamiliar manipulations and dealing with microquantities of reagents, that they lose the overall picture of the experiment.  This is even more of a problem when poor experimental technique results in ambiguous data.  (3) Many students have had little practice visualizing dynamic, three-dimensional interactions at the molecular level and find it challenging.  The objectives of this project are to provide students with the opportunity to learn a wide variety of experimental techniques and strategies, design their own experiments, and learn to visualize structure function relationships at a molecular level.  These objectives can be accomplished through the incorporation of computer facilities employing software for DNA and protein modeling, gene manipulation, and an exploration focusing on the relationship between DNA mutation and the forces of natural selection.  These resources are used for students to learn basic concepts of molecular biology and a wide variety of experimental techniques, many of which can also be performed in the laboratory.  With these tools, students can design new experiments in molecular biology.  *",
