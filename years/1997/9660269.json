 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9660269  Garst     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will determine the feasibility of developing a natural and easy system for input and editing of mathematical notation on a computer. Computer interfaces have made great progress in most areas, but communication of mathematical notation to computers remains unnatural and slow. It is believed that handwritten input of mathematical notation will be efficient and natural to users. The proposed Phase I work includes: collection of handwritten mathematical data; research into algorithms for recognizing and editing mathematical notation; and investigation into how to effectively integrate these capabilities into a natural user interface.   The market for natural and efficient input of mathematical notation is potentially very large.  This technology would allow the development of a range of innovative products catering to students and professionals in many technical, business and educational fields.  Examples include:  handhold calculators which accept symbolic problems as easily as numeric ones, word processors easier to use than pencil and paper for input of mathematical notation; easy communication of mathematical notation over computer networks;  and others.  ***",
