 "awd_abstract_narration": "9720606  Murphy  There are several compelling medical and biotechnological  reasons motivating the  development of new methods to probe the mechanisms and  kinetics of complex systems involving self-associating  peptides and lipid bilayers.  Key questions include: how  many peptides associate together to form a pore? does  peptide-peptide association occur prior to, coincident with,  or subsequent to peptide-lipid association? must the peptide  be in a specific aggregational state in order to interact  with the lipid bilayer?    This research plan proposes to investigate the feasibility  of developing two new methods to probe these kinds of  questions.  Research objective 1 is to establish whether  static light scattering methods can be applied to evaluate  the number and association state of peptides embedded in  membranes.  The pH-sensitive pore-forming peptide GALA and  an antibody-GALA derivative, mixed with phosphatidylcholine  large unilamellar vesicles, was chosen as the model system  for this investigation.  Standard static light scattering  methods yield information on molecular weight and size of  particles in solution, and requires that scattering data be  collected on both the sample of interest and the buffer.  This approach will be modified by collecting four sets of  scattering data: peptide alone, liposomes alone, buffer  alone, and peptide-liposome mixture.  By subtracting out in  turn the scattering from peptide alone, liposomes alone, or  buffer alone from the scattering of the peptide-liposome  mixture, it may be possible to infer the extent of peptide  association in the liposome and the total number of peptides  per liposome.  Research objective 2 is to investigate the  feasibility of using surface plasmon resonance (SPR)  spectroscopy to explore the importance of peptide  association state in modulating peptide-lipid association.  The model system for this investigation will be beta-amyloid  peptide monomer and fibrils associating with monolayers of  negatively-charged pho spholipids and phospholipid-  ganglioside mixtures, SPR is used most frequently to measure  binding kinetics of ligands to immobilized receptors.  In a  modification of this, the immobilized receptors can be  replaced by a self-assembled oriented lipid monolayer.  A  commonly cited difficulty with SPR is that the rates of  association can be mass transport, rather than kinetically,  limited.  The feasibility of turning this difficulty into an  asset will be investigated.  Since fibrils have  significantly slower diffusivities than monomeric peptides,  measurement of the mass transport rate should indicate  whether the predominant species associating with the lipid  layer is monomeric or aggregated.  ***",
