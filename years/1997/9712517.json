 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding to support a faculty member to be resident at NSF for the purposes of studying LIS proposals, funded projects, and related high technology sites with educational mandates for their potential benefit for education, generally, and educational research in particular. The study would proceed in the manner of case study formative evaluation plan that would include site visits, and holding workshops on themes similar to the ones addressed above.  The outcome of this SGER would be a set of papers for presentation to NSF and other interested audiences leading, perhaps to a publication that would allow NSF to inform the field of educational researchers about  NSF's research and development agenda in light of the innovations of LIS and, ultimately, Knowledge and Distributed Intelligence. Other outcomes could include the dissemination of these recommendations in other formats including conference presentations.",
