 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crandall  9702338    Phylogenetics is a field of study that is of central importance to  others such as ecology, molecular biology, systematics, and  evolutionary biology. As applications of phylogenetics increase,  so too does the breadth of ~ese applications. From molecular  studies of the biochemical function of genes, to human studies  such as transmission patterns in HIV-I, \"phylogenetic thinking\"  has lead to major discoveries in a broad array of disciplines. The  object of this study is to bring phylogenetics to a broader array  of peop e through high school outreach, museum displays, and  undergraduate/graduate education. In addition, phylogenetic  thinking is pervasive in my research program. The primary research  goal is to establish phylogenetic relationships among the 24  species within the two sister subgenera of freshwater crayfishes,  Jug~cambarus and Glareocola (Decapoda: Cambaridae). Once  phylogenetic relationships are established, the PI will test the  monophyly of these two subgenera relative to representatives from  five other subgenera within the genus Cambarus. Phylogenetic  estimates will be based on nucleotide sequences from the 1 6S  region of the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear gene astacin.  Once,a phylogeny is estimated and monophyly is established, the PI  will explore the evolutionary biology of habitat specificity using  comparative methods. The beauty of this group of freshwater  crayfishes is that they are distributed into the four main  ecotypes within which crayfishes are found: lotic waters (8  species), lentic waters (5 species), primary burrowers  (semi-terrestrial, 5 species), and caves (subterranean, 6  species). Therefore, they provide a unique opportunity to study  the evolution of habitat specificity in crayfishes. Do crayfishes  invade a habitat and radiate within that habitat? Is there a  repeated evolutionary sequence of habitat specificity, such as  lotic to lentic, to burrower, to cave? Or are habitat  specif~cities randomly distributed over  the phylogeny? The PI's  research will address these questions and use the answers as  examples of the utility of the phylogenetic approach in my  educational programs.",
