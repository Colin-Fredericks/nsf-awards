While plants,  protozoa, and bacteria are present at the fringes of the continent,  the combination of low temperatures, long periods of darkness, and  the absence of liquid water make the interior extremely hostile to  life. However, recent examination of snow from the South Pole  indicates the presence of microbes which contain DNA and  photosynthetic pigments. Snow samples were collected at South Pole  station in January 1997 and flown immediately to the Crary Lab at  McMurdo Base. Examination of snowmelt using epifluorescence  microscopy showed the presence of rod shaped particles approximately  1 X 2.5 um in size and a concentration of 130 (sd=64) cells per ml.  The particles fluoresced orange under blue excitation light and  reddish-orange under green excitation, indicating the presence of  phycobiliproteins and chlorophyll. These fluorescence signatures  combined with the particles' shape suggests that they are  cyanobacteria. Subsequent analysis using fluorescent DNA stains and  scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of DNA  containing microbes identical in shape to the autofluorescing  particles seen with epifluorescent microscopy. Further research will  confirm whether these microbes are indigenous to the Antarctic  interior and investigate their biology and ecology. The discovery of  organisms capable of survival in interior Antarctica would provide  us with new insight into the adaptability of life. Their  biomolecules and metabolism must be unique and could have great  value for molecular engineering research.",
