 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703667  Ritter    The objective of this research is to understand the  mechanisms involved in slow crack growth at polymer adhesive  interfaces that have been tailored to promote adhesion.  The  research involves both impenetrable and penetrable  interfaces.  An example of an impenetrable interfaces is  silane coupled epoxy/glass and of a penetrable interface is  PS/PMMA.  Slow crack growth is measured under both constant  and cyclic loading using the Double Cantilever Drilled  Compression (DCDC) test.  Although this test has been used  to study crack growth in monolithic glass and ceramic  materials, the use of the test to study crack growth at  polymer adhesive interfaces is new.  The unique advantages  of this test is that crack growth is stable and the  interfacial fracture toughness can greatly exceed the  fracture toughness of the adjoining materials because of the  stabilizing role of the compressive loads.  Finite element  modeling is used to estimate the energy associated with  plastic and viscoelastic deformation while the energy  associated with chain disentanglement, pullout, and scission  is estimated based on micromechanical modeling.  Direct  measurement of the intrinsic adhesive energy is by the  Johnson, Kendall, and Roberts technique, where the contact  radius between a sphere (made of polymer adhesive) and a  flat plate (made of the bonded material) is measured.  %%%  Through careful experimentation, micro-mechanical modeling,  and finite element analysis, the influence of slow crack  growth on the various mechanisms that contribute to the  fracture resistance of both impenetrable and penetrable  interfaces is explored.  This should significantly improve  understanding of adhesive bonding.  ***",
