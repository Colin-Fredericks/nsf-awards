Womack, Department of  Veterinary  Pathobiology, Texas A&M University in College Station, TX,  and Dr. Soheir El-Nahas, Department of Cell Biology at the  National Research Center (NRC) in Cairo, Egypt.  The  objective of this joint research is to utilize a panel of  hybrid somatic cells, generated in the Egyptian laboratory,  to map comparative anchor loci developed initially for use  in the cattle gene mapping in the US laboratory.  These will  include comparative anchor tagged sites (CATs) primers where  applicable, and custom designed bovine PCR primers for  anchor loci recalcitrant to mapping with CATs primers.  The  goal is to build a comparative map of river buffalo genome,  anchored at ten centimorgan intervals to the maps of cattle  and other mammals including human and mice.  These maps will  permit \"comparative candidate positional cloning\" of genes  of economic interest in buffalo from the high resolution  maps of other species.    Scope:  This research project will allow two experienced  researchers to collaborate on a project of significant  potential to the scientific interests in the United States  and in Egypt.  The project has great potential for the  improvement of buffaloes in Egypt through the identification  of genes for economically important traits and markers.  The  US laboratory will be able to continue its pursuit of  identifying the chromosomal homology between humans and  cattle, since most of the CATs primers remain untested in  cattle and consequently are unmapped.  Thus any primers  discovered to work in buffalo by the Egyptian laboratory  will have a high probability of working in cattle and can  then be added to the cattle map.  The net result of the  collaboration to screen the CATs primers will be a more  efficient screen than either laboratory can perform alone.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting U.S.-  foreign collaboration in areas that have  shared benefits for  both sides.  This project is being supported under the US-  Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to  scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out  these cooperative activities.  ***",
