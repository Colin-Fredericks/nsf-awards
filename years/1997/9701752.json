Dr. Ashworth will be working with Dr. Akio  Hosoya, Professor in the Department of Physics, on a  research project entitled, \"Quantum Tunneling between  Different Topologies.\"    Over the past several decades scholars have attempted to  unite two fundamental theories of current physics - quantum  mechanics and general relativity - in that although they  describe two different extremes of the universe, there are  indications that they should be considered limiting cases of  a broader theory.  One of the analytical areas that these  two theories have equal footing is in the early universe.  Research suggests that if the universe was exclusively a  quantum object it would have a complicated topology with  wormholes - something like a sponge.  A research question  that arises is: why has the universe not frozen into one of  these exotic typologies? One likely explanation suggests  that a process of \"quantum tunneling\" occurs between  different topologies, similar to that which occurs as  electrons tunnel through a potential energy barrier.  The  proposed research will focus on the process of quantum  tunneling, the goals being: 1) a more complete understanding  of  quantum gravity theory and universal topologies,  and;  2)  an attempt to consolidate currently competing theories.  ***",
