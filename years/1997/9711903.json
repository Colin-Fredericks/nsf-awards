They are also pioneers in  educational innovation by introducing and successfully  managing a dual degree program with a Ph.D. in Physics and  an MS in Computer Science.  This grant, to a university in  an EPSCOR state, is a renewal of their research program.  Specifically, it contains three foci: (1) Residual stresses,  nucleation and growth of cracks and delamination at Al/AlO3  and Al/SiC interfaces; (2) The structure-mechanical  properties relationship and dynamics of consolidation and  fracture in nanophase ceramic composites and (3) Stresses  and strains a as function of density, stoichiometry and  thickness of ceramic coatings on metals and semiconductors.  %%%  The two senior collaborators form an EPSCOR state have  clearly emerged as leaders in the new field of massively  parallel, multi-particle atomistic simulation of critical  material properties.   Supported by state of the art  computing resources,  they are studying the details of  growth and mechanical properties of ceramics and ceramic  coatings on metals and semiconductors.  They are also  studying the characteristic growth of a crack-tip front in  fracture of materials.  ***",
