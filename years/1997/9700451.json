 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Michael D. Hopkins, Department of Chemistry, University of   Pittsburgh, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division for the study of   conjugated transition metal compounds and materials. The project aims to   answer two questions: (1) How does metal-for-carbon substitution affect   the electronic structures of pi-conjugated organic compounds? and (2)   What implications does this hold for improving the technological   properties of these materials? A series of polyynes in which carbon atoms   are systematically replaced by metal centers will be prepared and their   bonding probed by electronic and vibrational spectroscopy,   electrochemistry, and X-ray crystallography. Initially the study will   concentrate on simple compounds in order to establish fundamental   structural and bonding properties of metal-ligand multiple bonds. Then   increasingly complex compounds, which potentially contain metal atoms   within conjugated pi systems, will  be studied in order to assess the   nature and extent of a metal atom's participation in delocalized bonding   networks. Variables to be investigated include the nature of the metal,   its ligands and oxidation state, the length of the polyyne chain, and the   number and distribution of metal centers within the pi network.   This work is significant at a fundamental level because the proposed   compounds represent a rare opportunity to examine systems that can be   theoretically described both using models commonly employed for organic   and others that are more appropriate for inorganic systems. The outcome   will be conceptual bridges to link the two ways of considering the   electronic structure of molecules. From a more practical viewpoint, the   results will be applicable to the design of optical and electronic   materials. Because of close structural and electronic relationship   between the metallapolyynes prepared in this investigation and the   conjugated organic materials currently used in a number of applications,   the correlations established during this project will allow the   technologically valuable properties of latter to be extended in a   rational fashion to the former. Two specific properties of   metallapolyynes that will be developed are intramolecular electronic   coupling and nonlinear optical responses.",
