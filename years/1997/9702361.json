 "awd_abstract_narration": "9702361  Smets  This is an award to provide support for research on appropriate  use of natural attenuation to develop biologically-based  technologies for removal of hazardous substances from soil that  is contaminated with these substances.  The research is based on  a hypothesis that the exchange and rearrangement of horizontally  transmissible genetic material is a major contributor to the  short-term adaptation of existing microbial communities in soil  and that characterization of the transfer process in the presence  of stress can provide insights that can be applied to engineering  design of systems for decontamination of soil.  This award also  provides support for the continuation of this investigator's  early development as an educator.  His education plan involves  addressing the engineering profession's demands for engineers who  couple a significant technical base of knowledge with an ability  for synthesis and cross-disciplinary integration.    The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to  NSF 96-115, \"Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program.\"  Quantitative knowledge of how microbial communities adapt to  contaminant stress can assist in the engineering design of  systems and procedures to exploit the capability of naturally  occurring communities of organisms to removal of contaminants  from soil and contaminated aquifers.  ***",
