 "awd_abstract_narration": "9605167  Schneider    The Neural Basis of Cognition Undergraduate Research Summer Program will annually train ten undergraduate students in an intensive ten-week interdisciplinary study of cognitive neuroscience.  The instruction and research effort will train students to interpret human cognitive behavior in the language of modern neuroscience.  Through lectures and laboratory activity, students will be exposed to the methods and results of multiple disciplines, including neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, neuroimaging, neuropsychology, biophysics, mathematics, and computational neuroscience.  The program takes advantage of the major joint initiatives of the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University in cognitive neuroscience, including the established research-training program in Neural Processes in Cognition and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, as well as the basic-research facilities of the University of Pittsburgh Medical School.  The program involves academic lectures and lab tours in the related scientific disciplines, lectures on career development and ethics, research reading groups, extensive laboratory-research experience, and social scientific interactions.  The program encourages college students to pursue graduate training and scientific careers in the emerging area of cognitive and computational neuroscience.  This unique program also provides a national example of interdisciplinary training for cognitive neuroscience.",
