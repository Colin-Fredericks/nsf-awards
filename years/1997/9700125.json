 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project covers the construction and testing of a large scale five-story precast superassemblage under simulated seismic loading.  The purpose of the project is to provide a realistic vehicle for verifying structural  concepts, design methodology and analytical procedures developed in NSF research initiative `precast and prestresses seismic structural systems` (PRESSS) Phases 1 and 11, and to evaluate the seismic performance of precast designs in terms of reduced damage and residual deformation compared with conventionally reinforced buildings.  The project forms the key element of PRESSS Phase III, in accordance with the original PRESSS master plan.  The structure will consist of five stories, with a two-bay by two-bay plan.  In one direction the lateral bracing will be provided by precast walls, and in the other direction, by precast frames, enabling different structural systems to be tested in orthogonal directions.  Different precast flooring systems will be adopted at different levels to investigate diaphragm action and frame-floor connection details.  Design will be in accordance with direct-displacement seismic design procedures developed as part of the earlier PRESSS phases.  Testing will primarily be under a multi-degree-of-freedom pseudo-dynamic testing procedure developed earlier for a five-story masonry building.  Sequential time-histories chosen to exercise the building to a series of limit states including (1) first-cracking, (2) first yield, (3) serviceability limit, (4) damage control, and (5) incipient collapse, will be applied to the structure.  Results from the experiment will be used to finalize design recommendations from the PRESSS project.  The five-story superassemblage test has extremely strong industry support, with more than 60% of the necessary cost being provided by the precast industry.",
