The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a six-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. Catherine Robb Bevier to work with Dr. Carlos  Arturo Navas at the Universidade de Sao Paulo in Brazil.    This project involves field and laboratory studies of two  tropical and two subtropical Brazilian treefrogs, the  Hylids.  These frogs exhibit variation in calling effort,  habitat types along altitudinal and latitudinal clines, and  body temperatures during periods of activity, allowing the  study of their underlying physiological mechanisms from an  ecological and behavioral perspective.  Brazil offers a  unique and environmentally variable field site, along with  access to a population of closely related but behaviorally  and ecologically diverse frogs. Dr. Bevier brings her  research experience in the area of physiological and  biochemical correlates of behavioral performance in frogs,  while Dr. Navas is an expert in metabolic physiology.  The  results of their research will benefit scientists who have  an interest in animal adaptation to cold and exercise  physiology.  ***",
