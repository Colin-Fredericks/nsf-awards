 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9710654  Sluis    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the transfer of pest resistance traits from wild species to domestic potato via the generation of periclinal chimeras.  Tissue-Grown scientists have developed a novel method for combining the best characteristics of two types of potato by forming chimeras.  Chimeric plants are composed of cell layers from different parents.  The goal of the proposed research is the creation of new potato varieties with the epidermal layer of a wild species and the core layers of a commercial potato variety.  The germplasm targets of this proposal would combine commercial potato varieties with wild species lines selected for insect resistance and tolerance to late blight (Phytophthora infestans).    The potential commercial application of the research is the rapid generation of new potato varieties that can take advantage of wild germplasm traits for pest resistance without the undesirable wild tuber traits so difficult to eliminate through breeding.  Wild species contain a wealth of disease resistance genes and genes of horticultural interest, but they also come with a heavy burden of genes detrimental to potato tuber production, such as delayed tuber set, odd colors, shapes and sizes of tubers, and excessive tuber glycoalkaloids.  Using chimeras, many well-established and valuable varieties can be enhanced without disturbing or damaging their primary commercial tuber traits.  ***",
