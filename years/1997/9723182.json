 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to construct a working database  of protein motions. This database will be made into a  publicly accessible WWW community resource, of general use  to the molecular biophysics community. It will meet the  needs of researchers trying to understand the principles of  protein structure and function (since motions are often the  link between structure and function). The database will be  associated with a classification of protein motions, based  on the packing at mobile interfaces. The construction of  this database has recently become feasible because of a  number of developments: the great increase in the number of  solved protein structures, the creation of an infrastructure  of linked biological databases, and work showing how packing  can be used to rationalize mechanisms for protein motions.    The development of the database will proceed in two phases  with two objectives in each phase (one computational and the  other biological). The principal objective in the first  phase will be to establish a working, prototype database of  protein motions. Motions in this database will initially be  arranged hierarchically in terms of size (i.e. fragment,  domain, and subunit) and then packing. The packing  classification will depend on whether or not the motion  involves sliding over a continuously maintained interface.  To achieve the first objective it will be necessary to  develop a standardized nomenclature and conceptual-  information model for protein motions. This will include  information such as the number of hinges, the magnitude of  the rigidbody rotation, and the number and size of the  mobile interfaces.    Building upon the framework established in the first phase,  the second phase of the project will expand the database and  associated motions classification. The goal will be to have  an entry for every known protein motion. In addition,  \"inferred motions,\" in sequence and structure homologues of  a protein with known motion, will also be included. To  han dle the large amount of data this will involve analyzing  and to help \"populate\" the database, an automatic  conformation comparison tool will be developed. This will  rapidly align and compare two arbitrary protein  conformations, identifying rigid core regions, flexible  hinges, interface packing differences, and so forth. It will  also determine whether these structures have any sequence or  structure homologues that share their motion.    The expansion of the database will require a more  sophisticated structure for describing the relationships  between motions and a more detailed motion classification  scheme than the size-packing hierarchy initially used. The  motions classification will be expanded through detailed  geometric analysis and calculation, principally focusing on  the packing at mobile interfaces.",
