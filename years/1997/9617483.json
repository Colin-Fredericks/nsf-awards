 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617483  Hixon         There is considerable debate regarding the major processes  that determine population sizes of organisms inhabiting rocky and  coral reefs. Most of these organisms have complex life cycles that  include widely dispersive propagules and relatively sedentary  juveniles and adults, such that the \"birth rate\" at a particular  reef is equivalent to the rate of settlement of propagules. The  controversy focuses on the extent to which supply of propagules vs.  post-settlement processes determine local population size and  dynamics. To resolve this issue we must know whether, and how, the  demographic rates that determine population size at a particular  site (settlement, immigration, mortality, and emigration) change  with population density (i.e., are the changes in these rates  density-dependent).  Answering this question is of more than  academic interest because, first, it provides the basis for  understanding how local population size is regulated naturally,  which is essential for effective management of fisheries and other  natural populations, and second, it has seldom been answered  adequately for any organism.         This collaborative research is designed to answer the question  of what drives local population dynamics in a comprehensive manner  for four species of marine fish inhabiting two very different  environments: temperate and tropical reefs. This multi-species,  multi-system approach will provide some generality which can  perhaps be applied to other marine systems, including demersal and  bottom fisheries. Using well-proven methods, the combined  experimental and observational design of this study will examine  the roles of larval supply, settlement, recruitment, immigration,  emigration, competition, and especially predation and its  mechanisms, in driving local population dynamics. Results of the  field work will be incorporated into mathematical models of  population dynamics to provide conceptual generality applicable to  other similarly organized system s.",
