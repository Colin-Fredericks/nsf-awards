 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, will use near-  field scanning optical microscopy to study polymer-dispersed  liquid crystal thin films.  Professor Higgins and his students at  Kansas State University will study the mesoscale structural,  electronic, and dynamical properties of these thin film materials  for application as flat-panel displays.  This integrated CAREER  research project will afford students the opportunity to learn  how the spatial confinement of organic mesostructured systems  affects their properties as relates to flat-panel displays.   State-of-the-art optical microscopy methods that provide  submicron spatial resolution will be used in this work.  Other  educational projects to be developed during this project involve  computer simulations on data analysis, analog electronics,  Fourier transforms, and chromatographic separations for use in  undergraduate course work and a new course in chemical  microscopy.  Many materials of scientific and technological interest involve  spatial variations in the electronic, structural, and chemical  properties on very small distance scales.  In order to devise  materials with desired features on this spatial scale it is  necessary to develop methods for quantifying the properties at  the near single molecule limit.  This CAREER research project  will apply state-of-the-art near-field optical microscopy to the  study of such properties of polymer-dispersed liquid crystalline  materials.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be exposed  to the application of these new methods to study these materials  that have potential for use in making flat-panel display devices.",
