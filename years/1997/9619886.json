Women, minorities, disabled persons, and students at other institutions are the primary focus.  Our objectives are to (1) allow participation in active environmental research with an interdisciplinary team, (2) encourage student-student and student-faculty interaction through the formation of 2 student research teams, (3) provide valuable field and laboratory research skills, and (4) maintain longterm contact with students to encourage research careers.  Although a separate project, the REU will capitalize on NSF-funded research at the landfill.  A common theme of REU activities is understanding the physical, chemical, and biological processes that transform the landfill environment.  Student Team I will characterize the physical state of ground and surface water at the landfill, and develop a predictive, physics-based model.  Soil cores extracted from the landfill will be characterized, and kringing will be used to develop a complete soil map of the landfill cap.  Plant species will be enumerated, and evapo-transpiration measured.  Students will learn to utilize meteorologic and soil moisture data obtained through remote sensing.  Geographical information information systems (GIS) will be calibrated and verified with site-specific data.  Students will also assist in evaluation of hydrodynamic processes via a forced characteristics of the leachate from the landfill, and examine chemical and biological interactions between soil and dissolved organic compounds present in the leachate.  Soil column will examine interactions of leachate with soil, and pre- and post-column leachate samples will be analyzed with GC/MS and HPLC to study biodegradation and bioavailability.  Results will be used to conduct human health a nd ecological risk assessments.  Other student activities will include 24-hour safety training, field trips to an EPA lab and a Superfund site, and presentation of research results at the annual Norman landfill conference.  ***",
