The goal is to explore the feasibility of a future  national implementation of the model.    The Parent-Child Interaction Project aims to empower underserved  parents to become their child's most important teacher and provide  these parents and their children the opportunity to gain science,  mathematics, and technology education together.  The participants  are the parents and pre-school children enrolled in family literacy  programs.  During the Project, parents and children will make at  least four trips to the participating science-technology center and  evaluate their trips during follow-up class sessions.    The joint efforts of the family literacy programs and science-  technology centers can achieve the following goals:         *    Improve the involvement of low-income and low-literacy            parents in the education of their children, specifically            in the areas of science, mathematics and technology.         *    Increase the awareness of local science and technology            centers as available community resources, particularly            for underserved audiences.         *    Use science center visits and related projects to extend            NCFL classroom learning for adult education students,            their children and their teachers.",
