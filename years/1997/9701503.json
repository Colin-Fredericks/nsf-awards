 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge-based   learning  environments   can   provide   highly  customized problem-solving experiences that are tailored  to  the  individual  needs  of  each student.  This  project  creates  the  technology  for  a  new  generation of  knowledge-based  learning  environments  by  developing  real-time  multimedia   explanation  generators   with   animated  pedagogical  agents.    Prominently  featured  in  learning environments, animated pedagogical  agents  can  observe  students'  progress,  provide  them  with  visually  contextualized  problem-solving  advice,  and  play  a   powerful  motivational  role.   The project has three  major  thrusts:  (1)  developing   a   computational  model  of  real-time   multimedia  explanation   planning   for  dynamically   creating   customized  multimedia explanations; (2) developing a computational model  of  animated   pedagogical  agents;  and  (3)  conducting   empirical  evaluations of the pedagogical effectiveness of these models.  In  addition,  the  project also develops a teaching  laboratory  for  multimedia  technology  and  initiates  a  new  multidisciplinary  course on Knowledge-Based Multimedia Learning Environments.  This  work  significantly advances the state-of-the-art  in  knowledge-  based   learning  environments  and  human-computer  interaction.  Coupled  with  rapid advances in affordable multimedia  hardware,  the  successful deployment of these technologies will have a deep  and  lasting  impact  on students at all  levels.   By  achieving  significant  gains in learning effectiveness, these  technologies  will  bring about fundamental improvements in both the  classroom  and the workplace on a broad scale.",
