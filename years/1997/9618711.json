 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618711  Tomanek    The North Dakota Science Teacher Enhancement Program (ND-STEP)  involves 20 teachers per year in a 14-month program of research and  inservice activities, at one of North Dakota's research  universities.  During each of 4-years 10-pairs of middle and high-  school science teachers from North Dakota and Minnesota will  participate in ND-STEP.  Each pair will work with one scientist.   The 6-week summer research experience is complemented by completion  of a graduate course on inquiry teaching and attendance at four  full-day sessions during the academic year where the focus is on  implementation of action plans and teaching by inquiry.  Teachers  may earn seven graduate credit hours for the summer activities and  2-Continuing Education credits for the academic year sessions. In  years 2-4 a small group of \"master\" teachers will be selected as  ND-STEP Adjunct Faculty.  Their preparation includes working with  NSF supported curriculum materials such as SEPUP, ChemCom, A  Private Universe, etc.  They will conduct science seminars for  their peers about the research they've done and lead inservice  sessions on the NRC Science Standards and inquiry teaching.  An ND-  STEP Steering Committee will meet twice a year to guide the  project.",
