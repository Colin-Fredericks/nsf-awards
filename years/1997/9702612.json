 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Proposal: CMS 97-02612  PI:  Srinivas Peeta, Purdue University    \"Career:  Efficient and Robust On-Line Control of Large-  Scale Dynamic Traffic Systems with Information Systems\" \"      This research addresses the performance optimization and the  efficient on-line robust control of large-scale traffic  systems as a substantive example of large-scale man-made  dynamic systems with capacity constraints and different  degrees of uncertainties in system inputs, in which flows  must be routed on-line from one node to another without  complete a priori information on future entries/demands to  the system.  The current lack of such accurate and detailed  real-time data on the state of the traffic system has  precluded a clear understanding of the dynamic phenomena  that govern system performance, limiting the development of  feasible and effective real-time control strategies for  large traffic systems.    This research will use nonlinear adaptive and robust control  theory and neural networks to develop a new realm of on-line  control strategies that seek the performance optimization of  large-scale traffic systems under certain future demands and  network state conditions.  The work will involve a blend of  theory, simulation, and operational experiments.  Real-time  data obtained from a recently installed advanced traffic  management system (ATMS) on a major interstate corridor in  an on-going collaborative effort with the Indiana Dept. of  Transportation and Hughes Transportation Management Systems  will be used to validate and evaluate the proposed models  and algorithms, leading to an enhanced performance  efficiency of existing road networks.    The education objectives are to systematically bridge the  gap between evolving technological advances in information  systems in the transportation arena and their absence from  existing curriculum through teaching and experimentation,  specifically in the areas of advanced sensor systems, on-  line data extraction and processing techniques,  robust on-  line control theory, and high performance computational  techniques.  Undergraduate students will be involved with  real-time data accessing and processing, and programs  accenting professional development and extension course  development are included in the companion educational plan.        ***",
