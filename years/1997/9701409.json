Growth  conditions will be chosen to produce novel crystal structures,  which are not ordinarily found in the bulk phase diagram. We  combine structural and magnetic measurements to correlate  changes    in   the   magnetic   phase   diagram   with   surface  crystallography  and morphology. Multiple structural techniques are employed,  including quantitative electron and photoelectron diffraction,  and   surface   x-ray  diffraction.  Magnetic  measurements   are  primarily  done using circularly polarized soft x-ray circular dichroism.  The emphasis is on ultrathin binary alloys, coupled ferromagnetic  bilayers, and 'wedge' and 'sandwich' nanostructures.  %%%  This  is a renewal project in which  modern techniques of crystal  growth  will be used  to create magnetic nanostructures which have  unique and surprising  properties.   We are searching for  ways to produce magnetic materials that can be useful in  a new generation of computer digital electronics. These  devices, called spin-valves or spin-transistors, use magnetism  in the way that the older transistor uses electronic  charge. Since the magnetic information can be stored for  long periods without the need for an external power source,  spin-valves are attractive as a new type of computer  memory device for portable computers. The physical properties  which are desirable for a high efficiency spin valve  require us to control the growth of magnetic layers with  atomic precision. The magnetic behavior of these metastable,  ultrathin, magnetic films can be completely different from  that of an ordinary 'bulk' material. We are studying the  relationship between structure and magnetic properties, to  develop ways of predicting and optimizing ultrathin mag nets  for spin valves.  ***",
