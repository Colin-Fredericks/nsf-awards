 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703550  Davies    Preliminary experiments that have been conducted on a member  of the PMN-relaxor family, PMT  Pb(Mg1/3Ta2/3)03  indicate  that the annealing temperatures utilized in all the previous  attempts to promote domain growth lie in a range where the  perovskite is kinetically inert.  By taking special  precautions that inhibit the volatilization of PbO,  higher  temperature heat treatments reveal that the size of the  domains and degree of cation ordering can be increased by  more than an order of magnitude.  These observations  unambiguously show that the currently accepted \"space  charge\" models for the PMN relaxors are invalid.  In this  model the fine-scale inhomogeneities in the arrangements of  the metal cations in the \"B-sites\" of the perovskite  structure are interpreted in terms of the formation of  negatively charged ordered nano-domains dispersed in a  positively charged disordered matrix.  The primary  experimental support for this interpretation comes from the  apparent absence of any growth of the domains or change in  the degree of ordering with extended thermal treatment.  This project will explore several new avenues of research  that emanate from these results and focuses on the structure  and properties of selected niobate and tantalate relaxor  systems.  The goals of these studies are: (1) to establish  how the structural state of PMN-type relaxors respond to  different high temperature treatments; (2) to develop new  crystal chemical models for the cation ordering that are  consistent with these observations; (3) to characterize how  the new variable of degree of order and domain size affects  the dielectric response of the PMN relaxers and; (4) to  exploit these models to develop new relaxor ceramics.  %%%  Since their discovery over 35 years ago, relaxor  ferroelectrics have attracted widespread interest for  applications in multi-layer capacitors, transducers,  electro-optic devices, and thin film memories.  It is now  well known that the dielectric properties  of relaxor systems  are intimately linked to the localized disorder in their  crystal structures.  However, a full understanding of the  origins of the structural inhomogeneities and their  relationship to the physics of the relaxor response does not  yet exist.  This is particularly true for the lead-based PMN  (lead-magnesium-niobium oxide) complex perovskite relaxors,  the most well known and widely studied family of relaxors,  which are the focus of this exploratory study.  The  extensive studies that have been conducted on the PMN  systems have led to the establishment and acceptance of one  model as a basis for explaining their structures and  properties.  Preliminary work by the Principal Investigator  has shown that this model may not be correct.  The project  will perform experiments to confirm the PI's model that will  then be used to develop new relaxor materials.  ***",
