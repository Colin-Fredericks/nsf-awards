The  activity is under the joint sponsorship of the American  Chemical Society, the Canadian Society for Chemistry, and  the Sociedad Qu mica de Mexico.  Activities at the Congress  will include the presentation of papers, panel discussions,  symposia, and other programs reporting the results of recent  research in the chemical sciences to enhance the  dissemination and exchange of chemical knowledge by  scientists of the countries of North America.  The Congress  will include symposia in analytical and environmental  chemistry, chemical education, inorganic and physical  chemistry.  A one-day workshop will be held to generate  plans for improving chemistry cooperation in the Americas.  Selection of the early career participants will be on the  basis of their contributions to symposia in their fields.    ***",
