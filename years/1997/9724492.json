 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724492  Simpson         This award provides partial funding (70%) for the acquisition  of a mass storage system to be installed and operated in the Data  Management Center (DMC) of the Incorporated Research Institutions  for Seismology (IRIS). The IRIS consortium is committed to  providing the remaining funds necessary for the acquisition of the  mass storage system.     IRIS is a consortium of 87 U.S. research universities with major  programs in seismology. The IRIS DMC is responsible for the  collection, quality control, and distribution of data collected by  a globally distributed network of permanently installed  seismographs and by a pool of portable seismographs deployed for  shorter periods of time to solve specific regional problems in  geophysics. The DMC services a very substantial fraction of the  world-wide community in seismology in its need for access to  reliable data to be applied to research in earthquakes and the  dynamics and structure of the Earth's deep interior. In addition,  the DMC also acts as a collection center for data collected under  the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) monitoring activity. The  data storage needs of the DMC are very large. Current storage is  approaching the 3 terabyte range, and there is an urgent need to  replace the current obsolete system with a new storage system.  ***",
