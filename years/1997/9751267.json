 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students graduating in biology must be intimately familiar with both the process and content of biological investigations.  They should be able to integrate information and use multiple levels of analysis.  In addition, they should be comfortable using a variety of data acquisition tools.  Scientifically literate non-majors must also understand the process of scientific investigations, as well as fundamental concepts.  This project is enhancing the investigative laboratories in physiology at all levels of the biology curriculum.  Additionally, because most biology laboratories emphasize data collection while analysis is done individually by the students, modern data acquisition and analysis techniques are being incorporate that promote analysis in class.  Students are active participants in their own learning, and are involved in all aspects of the experimental design and execution, including hypothesis generation, experimental design, data collection and analysis using modern equipment, and presentation of results in a variety of formats.  In three courses, Introductory Biology, Comparative Physiology, and the Human Physiology course for non-majors, two investigative laboratories are being added or enhanced.  In the upper-level neurobiology course, the laboratory is being entirely restructured to include three semi-investigative laboratories ion fundamental concepts in neurobiology, followed by a longer inquiry-based project.  By enhancing courses at all levels of the curriculum, the department is helping develop students better critical-thinking skills as well as understanding the process of science and the fundamental concepts of each level.  In addition, a large proportion of the students taking biology are being exposed to more realistic science, more discovery-oriented laboratories, and more modern scientific equipment.",
