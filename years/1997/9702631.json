 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focusses on the  development of analytical methods to quantify the partitioning of  substance P through the blood brain barrier.  Professor Lunte and  her students at the University of Kansas will study methods to  derivatize substance P so that it can be analytically detected.   One strategy involves pre- or postcolumn derivatization of  substance P with naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde combined with  capillary electrophoresis so that laser induced fluorescence  detection can be used.  The second approach involves precolumn  derivatization with the biuret reagent followed by  chromatographic separation with dual electrode electrochemical  detection.  This CAREER project will enable students to learn  state-of-the-art methods for quantifying picomolar concentrations  of biologically significant analytes and to test the hypothesis  that substance P crosses the blood brain barrier and plays a role  in central nervous system function.  Substance P is a neuropeptide that plays a role in maintaining  the functional status of the brain at very low concentration  levels.  The nature of its role has not been quantified because  there are no functional groups on the molecule that impart either  spectroscopic or electrochemical responses that can be used as  analytical signals.  In this CAREER research project Professor  Lunte and her students will develop two separate methods that  permit the analysis of substance P at the concentration levels  required.  Substance P will be modified so that a fluorescence  signal can be measured in one procedure and an electrochemical  modifying agent will be used in a second procedure so that an  electroanalytical signal can be measured.  These modification  procedures will be coupled with the separation method capillary  electrophoresis in order to make the analyses selective for  substance P.  In addition to the educational impact of involving  students in this work, Professor Lunte will implement a course  for all science students designed to improve the efficacy of  communicating scientific information between scientific  disciplines and to the public at large.",
