 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Thomas L.   Netzel, of the Department of Chemistry at Georgia State University, and   Professor Bruce E. Eaton, of the Department of Chemistry at Washington   State University, explore photoinduced electron transfer mechanisms in   covalently labeled DNA oligomers.  Through the synthesis and study of   short, covalently modified DNA oligonucleotides, Professors Netzel and   Eaton explore the rates of electron transfer among various DNA bases and   representative organic electron donor and acceptor molecules, probing   such issues as the rate at which an initially formed hole or excess   electron within DNA will travel to its final trapping site and the nature   of such trapping sites.  These studies provide the information needed to   design and interpret electron transfer in covalently modified DNA   duplexes, wherein the skewed pi-stacking of bases suggests the   possibility of enhanced electronic coupling between donors and acceptors   embedded within or attached to such a pi stack.  The uses of charge-separating supramolecules spans fields as diverse as   artificial photosynthesis, photocopying, and optical information storage   and processing, leading to great interest in developing spatially   well-defined molecular assemblies designed to effect efficient charge   separation through the harnessing of the energy of light.  Professor   Thomas L. Netzel, of the Department of Chemistry at Georgia State   University, and Professor Bruce E. Eaton, of the Department of Chemistry   at Washington State University, with the support of the Organic Dynamics   Program, prepare and study short pieces of DNA bearing chemically   attached molecules designed to probe the fundamental aspects of the   charge separation process.  These studies provide an initial framework   for the systematic design of DNA molecules which geometrically position   molecules at desired positions relative to one another for controlled   light-induced charge separation.",
