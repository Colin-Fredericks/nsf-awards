 "awd_abstract_narration": "Past failures in building large-scale distributed applications in  areas such as avionics and telephony are painful reminders of the  difficulty of developing and debugging distributed programs. As  applications become more ambitious in both scale and  functionality, these problems will only be compounded.    The Seuss project is based on the premise that this complexity  can be managed by adopting a simpler model of computation. The  Seuss programming model builds distributed applications from  large sequential components which interact through small but  complex interfaces. This project has the following goals:    (1) to develop conceptual tools for reducing the complexity of  these interfaces,  (2) to reuse sequential pieces of code written in standard  languages,  (3) to achieve efficiency by executing the various components  concurrently.    More specifically, the Seuss model of concurrent object oriented  programming reduces the complexity of concurrency by allowing  programmers to reason about distributed applications as if they  were sequential programs. At the same time, Seuss allows programs  to be executed with multiple threads of control. Finally, Seuss  provides a logic for proving the equivalence of sequential Seuss  programs and their multi-threaded executions. This project will  allow programmers to build qualitatively more complex distributed  applications with the assurance that they are both efficient and  correct.",
