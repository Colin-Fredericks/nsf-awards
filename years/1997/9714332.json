 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds an initial investigation of design, control, and  planning   issues   for  self-reconfigurable  robots.   A   self-  reconfigurable  robot is a set of one or more autonomous  modules  with  the  capability to self-organize, that is, to change  their  geometric shape autonomously.  Self-reconfigurable robots can  be  viewed   as   a  minimalist  approach  to  designing   versatile,  extensible,   and   reliable  robots.  They  are   suitable   for  applications   that  require  multiple  locomotion   gaits   over  different  types  of  terrain,  or  that  combine  mobility  with  flexible  manipulation in ways that could not be  anticipated  at  the time of initial design of a conventional robot. The focus  of  this work is task-directed self-reconfiguration, with an emphasis  on  robots  that can self-organize to support multiple locomotion  gaits and on robots that can sequence locomotion and manipulation  gaits.   This  research will explore several  designs  for  self-  reconfigurable  modules. The potential of  each  design  will  be  evaluated  by  geometrically characterizing the class  of  three-  dimensional  robotic structures that can be built with  it.  This  research  will  also consider control and planning approaches  to  self-reconfiguration.   For  each  module  design,  control   and  coordination algorithms will be developed and evaluated. A set of  basic  configuration structures that consist of the basic  module  designs  and  support specific manipulation and locomotion  gaits  will  be developed. Planning algorithms for transitioning between  any two such configurations will be developed and evaluated.",
