 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723459  Emerson  Because of past difficulties with isolating iron-oxidizing microbes at circumneutral pH, it has been difficult to prove that prokaryotes have the capacity to grow lithoautotrophically on iron at neutral pH.  Recently, pure cultures of bacteria that appear to grow lithotrophically by Fe-oxidation at pH 6 have been isolated by the PI. This research will focus on using one of these, strain ES-1, as a model organism to study the physiology and biochemistry of iron oxidation at neutral pH. The goals are to establish that this microbe is a chemolithoautotroph, and to begin to dissect the metabolic pathways by which it conserves energy from Fe-oxidation, and fixes CO2 .  Studies will be aimed at developing a continuous culture system for determining molar growth yields of cells growing on Fe2+, determining limits for Fe2+ and O2 tolerance, and for growing enough cell biomass for in vitro biochemical and molecular studies.   Further studies will be aimed at purifying an Fe-oxidoreductase enzyme that could be responsible for Fe-oxidation, and identifying other components of the electron transport system.  Two components of the electron transport chain of the acidophilic chemolithoautorophic  Fe-oxidizer Thiobacillus ferrooxidans will be used to initiate a search for analogous proteins in strain ES-1.  These are rusticyanin, a putative periplasmic electron transport protein and the enzyme that serves as the initial Fe-oxidase.  We will search for the genes for these proteins in strain ES-1 by using molecular techniques, and will attempt to purify the proteins, if present, using conventional biochemical techniques.  A molecular approach will also be taken to establish whether or not the key CO2 fixation enzyme, ribulose 1-5, bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBPC/O), is present in strain ES-1; both hybridization studies and PCR amplification of genes for RuBPC/O gene subunits will be performed.  Together these studies will lay the groundwork for future investigation of the metabolic bi ochemistry of a unique type of prokaryotic metabolism.    Iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust; it is also perhaps the most important trace element for all living organisms.  We understand very little about the role that microorganisms play in oxidizing iron at  neutral pH.  The signficance of this research is that it will increase our fundamental knowledge about the role life plays in controlling the iron cycle.  Due to the great abundance of iron its cycling influences other important elemental cycles including carbon oxygen and sulfur.  Iron-oxidizing bacteria are often found in industrial and municipal water distribution systems where they can cause fouling of pipelines and discoloration of domestic water supplies with significant economic impact.  Thus understanding the fundamental metabolic processes of these organisms will help in our efforts to exert positive or negative control over them.",
