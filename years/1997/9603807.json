 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603807  Frieden  The goal of this project is to examine the effect of site  directed mutations on interactions between similar units  within a filamentous protein.  The model system to be used  is actin.  The crystal structure of monomeric muscle actin  is known but it is not necessarily clear what the important  contacts between actin monomers within the filament are.  Thus, within the actin filament the interactions to be  examined are those that occur between actin monomers.  For  this study it is planned to use mutants of  yeast actin,  this protein being approximately 90% identical to muscle  actin. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) contains a single  actin gene obviating the need for separating different actin  isoforms. A number of yeast strains expressing mutant actins  are already available while others are under construction in  this laboratory.  Yeast  actin can be obtained in reasonable  yields from both wild-type and mutant strains.  The first  goal of this project is to examine the effect of site  directed mutations, based on the known monomeric crystal  structure, on the polymerization of actin itself to  determine whether the mutation affects the formation of  actin nuclei leading to filament formation or the elongation  of the filament or both processes.  Determination of the  mechanism of actin polymerization can be made using  sophisticated kinetic studies. Such studies are to be  carried out following the polymerization process either by  using a fluorescent label covalently attached to the actin  or the intrinsic fluorescence of actin.  Both these  fluorescent methods are applicable because the fluorescence  change is known to follow the incorporation of monomer into  polymeric actin.    Actin, a protein that is ubiquitous in all cells from yeast  to humans, is a critical component in metabolic function. In  muscle cells it interacts with the protein myosin to give  rise to muscle contraction.  In non-muscle cells, either  alone or in combination with other proteins, actin i s  responsible for maintaining the structure of the cell and  for many cellular functions.  The polymerization and  depolymerization of actin controls such processes as cell  movement, uptake of other molecules and response to  extracellular signals such as hormones.  The actin molecule  is made up of 375 amino acid residues which fold together to  give a specific three dimensional structure.  Specific  residues within this structure play an important role in the  interaction of actin molecules with themselves to form the  polymeric species while others are important for interacting  with other protein molecules which control cellular  processes.  In this project site-directed mutagenesis,will  be used to change specific residues in the actin molecule.  The effect of these changes on the properties of the actin  molecule itself and on its interactions with other proteins  will be determined. The results will help to clarify the  general role of certain amino acid residues in the  interactions between proteins.",
