 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal shall study gravity waves from binary neutron  stars near coalescence.  We will solve the relativistic  hydrodynamic and field equations in three spatial dimensions  employing both a conformally flat condition on the metric  and in the post-Newtonian approximation.  The gravity-wave  signal will be extracted via a multipole expansion including  up to l = 4 the mass moment and l = 3 in the current moments  as well as the leading slow-motion correction.  By applying  both numerical schemes we expect to gain better intuitive  insight into the relevant physical processes as the stars  approach and the effect of these processes on the emergent  gravity-wave signal.  An important feature of the proposed  calculations is the use of a realistic neutron star equation  of state which reproduces available constraints and is  amenable to a study of parameter sensitivity.  From these  studies we expect to obtain illustrative profiles of the  gravity wave forms during final orbits of a neutron star-  binary as a function of mass, spin, mass asymmetry and the  neutron star equation of state.  We will also study  compression and shock heating effects as the stars approach  coalescence and the effects of the linear and angular  momentum loss from radiated neutrinos on the emitted gravity  waves.  The coupling between the gravity wave signal and a  possible electromagnetic burst can also be analyzed.",
