 "awd_abstract_narration": "With a National Science Foundation Career Advancement Award Dr. Diane Chase will pursue a systematic course of assisted instruction in computer sciences and use this knowledge to develop a computerized data base for information collected during twelve field seasons of investigation at the Mayan archaeological site of Caracol which is located in Belize. The site is important because it provides insight into Mayan civilization at the pinnacle of its development. The Caracol project as a result of its chronological duration and the number of individuals involved has yielded almost 600 discrete excavations. The data pertaining to these continues to grow as investigators conduct specialized analyses of excavated materials and as the research extends beyond the city core into the surrounding region. The Caracol data is not easily moved or shared and investigators must come to, or arrange to have copied, information contained within Dr. Chase's research laboratory.   In the first stage of this project Dr. Chase will pursue a carefully designed education program. She will work with computer scientists to gain competence in internet technology, virtual environments, mapping software, distance learning and virtual organizations. In the second stage of the research she will construct a prototype information system and then scan and enter the Caracol archaeological data into it. The expected result is the incorporation of a massive body of archaeological information, including maps and site plans which will be electronically available to interested members of the research community. The Career Advancement Award, as its name indicates, will also serve a second function. It will provide Dr. Chase with the necessary time and tools to pursue her research career in a more effective manner.",
