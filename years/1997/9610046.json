 "awd_abstract_narration": "9610046  Ross       This research investigates certain properties of stochastic processes that have applications to operational problems in production systems.  In particular, for an independent, identically distributed sequence of random variables with arbitrary distribution, the investigator studies the distribution of the first time at which a particular (fixed) pattern appears.  Such a sequence may represent any of a variety of practical quantities; e.g., a moving average of observations of quality characteristics, or the successive states of a multi-component, failure-prone system.  Traditional approaches to this problem have attempted to study the structure of imbedded Markov chains and prove to be computationally intractable.  The investigator proposes a new approach based on renewal-theoretic arguments to obtain bounds and approximations that can lead to analysis tools and efficient simulation procedures.  A related problem, also studied in this project, involves improving on central limit theorem-based approximations of convolutions.   While the primary thrust of the work is theoretical, the investigator will study the computational aspects of these problems as well.         This work has direct relevance to fundamental problems in reliability and quality control, particularly in the area of multivariate control charts.  Thus this research is expected to result in both theoretical advances that can be applied to a wide range of problems as well as in practical new tools in the area of multivariate quality monitoring.  The latter is an active and extremely important area of operations research, and one in which stochastic process-based techniques can be expected to make significant contributions.",
