 "awd_abstract_narration": "Raskind 9700896  This award supports work on the theory of algebraic cycles on algebraic varieties over p-adically complete fields and over algebraic number fields.  The principal investigator will define and study p-adic intermediate Jacobians for algebraic varieties over a p-adically complete field which have a p-adic uniformization.  It is expected that these will be fundamental tools in the theory.  He will also study higher obstructions to the Hasse principle for varieties over algebraic number fields.  The theory of algebraic cycles is part of algebraic geometry, which is the study of solutions to systems of polynomial equations.  This is one of the oldest fields in mathematics, but it has experienced an explosion of new ideas and fundamental theorems over the past thirty years.  Also, new applications of the theory have been found to coding theory, cryptography and engineering.",
