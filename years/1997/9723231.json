 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9723231  Hille          The animal ooctye during its growth stores proteins and  messenger RNAs that are required for meiosis, fertilization and  the rapid cleavages of the egg that follows fertilization.  After  growth oocytes are usually arrested in prophase I of meiosis  until stimulated by a maturation hormone that activates the  stored components in a process called meiotic maturation.  Because of the availability of stored proteins and messenger RNA,  no transcription of new messerger RNA occurs during meiotic  maturation of any animal embryo.  Proteins in many complex  biological pathways are activated during meiotic maturation  including the maturation promotion factor (MPF), which leads to  the breakdown of the nuclear membrane and the meiotic reduction  of chromosome; proteins that  stimulate protein synthesis;  and  those that are required to recruit stored mRNAs.  This  proposal  is concerned with the activation of stored proteins that  stimulate oocyte maturation.  This laboratory had identified a  protein kinase C-like activity, which appears prior to MPF  activity and prior to the increase in protein synthesis rates,  and possibly represents one of the earliest enzymes activated  in  the maturing starfish oocyte.  A protein kinase C-related enzyme  that is a homologue of mammalian PKN gene and has abundant  transcripts in starfish oocytes, has been cloned by this  laboratory.  Experiments by other laboratories suggest that  mammalian PKN is activated by unsaturated fatty acids in vitro  and by Rho in vivo, and not by the traditional phorbol ester  activators of the protein kinase C family.  This grant  application hypothesizes that the early protein kinase C-related  activity in the starfish ooctyes is due to starfish PKN.  The  research  aims to determine: whether PKN is present in immature  oocytes,  when it is activated during meiotic maturation, the  function of PKN, and the mechanisms for its activation.  Information gained from this research will expand the knowled ge  of signal transduction pathways for the activation of maturation  in oocytes, and will serve as a prototype of a signal  transduction pathway in differentiating cells.  %%%      This research is studying the activation of stored proteins  that are important in the maturation of starfish oocytes.  This  investigator is looking at an enzyme identified in her  laboratory, which has similarities to a known mammalian enzyme  which is important in signal transduction pathways.  This  research will provide new information on the signaling mechanisms  in oocyte development.  ***",
