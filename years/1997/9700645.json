 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to produce a book on the history of field biology in the United States between 1890 and 1940, focussing on the continuing tensions between laboratory and field.  In the 1890s and 1900s, field biologists, spurred by their recent loss of status in comparison with physiologists and morphologists, borrowed laboratory methods and applied them to field work.  At the same time they reasserted their belief that authentic knowledge of plant and animal life could only be produced in nature.    In its methods this project extends the tools of environmental historians to the history of science.  Environmental historians know how to treat the varied ways in which humans inhabit, use, change and understand the natural world.  They restore to history a powerful sense of natural places and their effects on human actions, but without losing sight of `Nature` as a cultural representation.  They study how people know the natural world by making a living from it.  These methods are ideally suited to the history of field biology.  Several specific topics will be treated in the book.  First,  how did ecologists and evolutionary biologists devise ways of experimenting in nature without losing the rigor and control that experimentalists expect of authentic knowledge?  Second, how did field biologists invent the instrumentation (vivaria, field stations, biological farms) necessary for their research?  Finally, how was the work of these biologists shaped by cultural factors, including the nature movements of the early 1900s and the problematic cultural meaning of field work (which appears unscientific as it takes place outside the clean, well-lighted laboratory).  This project extends the well-developed study of laboratory life and experiments to the less-studied field sciences.  It enriches the history of science and environmental history by bringing them together.  And it contributes to our understanding of the field sciences as a cultural and social activity.",
