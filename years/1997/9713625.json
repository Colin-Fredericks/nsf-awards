 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for support of a cooperative  project by Dr. Jameel Hasan, Department of Wood and Paper  Science at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC,  and Dr. Housni ElSaied, Cellulose and Paper Department at  the National Research Center (NRC) in Cairo, Egypt.  The  objective of this joint research is to study ways to utilize  basic cellulosic raw materials considered  to be waste from  agricultural products, for producing high quality pulp. The  main materials to be studied would be rice straw and cotton  stalks.  The final pulp would be tested for use in the  packaging paper products in place of the expensive imported  materials or in combination with recycled paper material.  The use of mechanochemical processes can be expected to  increase the percent yield, in pulp from the raw material,  from the low 20's to the 80's to 90's, while reducing the  aqueous effluent which usually include black liquor.  The  research will include laboratory studies at the NRC, large  scale testing at  a paper company (RAKTA) in Egypt, as well as at the US  laboratory  at NCSU.   Scope:  This research project will involve  a US  scientist from a highly regarded department, with a strong  research program, and a senior researcher in the area of  paper and pulp at Egypt's largest research laboratory, as  well as one of Egypt's largest industrial concerns.  These  three groups will have complementary research facilities,  and should be able to produce the results described above.  The problem they are seeking to address is quite significant  for many developing countries, especially where forest  resources are few or non-existent, such as in Egypt and many  countries in the Middle East.  It is also important to the  US where the use of agricultural waste is quite desirable to  limit the use of the nation's forest resources.  The work in  this project will seek to reduce the resulting pollution  from this generally polluting industry which utilizes  chemicals for dissolving and polishing paper products.  The  collaborating scientists plan to do laboratory work, to be  later scaled up to manufacturing conditions.  This proposal  meets INT objective of supporting U.S.-foreign collaboration  in areas of mutual benefit. This project is being supported  under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants  to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out  these cooperative  activities.",
