 "awd_abstract_narration": "Automation in every discipline of Laboratory Science has made necessary an accompanying adaptation in instructional techniques and associated learning materials to accommodate these developments. This project will provide a relevant practical experience that allows computer hesitant science and microbiology students to learn and  apply a broad array of theoretical concepts in an environment that will closely simulate their work and learning environments upon graduation. Through the introduction of requested computers, cameras and microscopy, students will learn to visually recognize salient characteristics of microorganisms, blood and urine specimens and begin a chain of thought processes and applications of their theoretical knowledge to accurately apply appropriate tests, and report conclusions based on a patient case study model. The instructional model is enhanced through collection of live patient specimens from a nearby  hospital. These specimens will allow the progression of disease states to be observed in \"real life\" circumstances. Examples of cell abnormalities, e.g., will not be taken from text books or purchased CD-ROMs but be gathered, stained, studied and archived. Individual cases will be studied collaboratively and cooperatively through the integration of eleven linked microcomputer stations. The Project Director, in concert with students will develop computer aided instruction modules, in hematology, serology, immunology and medical microbiology. These modules will be adapted for use in a case study instructional  approach.",
