 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704210  Streiffer       This award provides partial support through the  Division of Materials Research and the office of  Multidisciplinary Activities for the acquisition of a  multiuser, four-circle x-ray diffractometer equipped with  parabolic condensing mirrors and an x-ray area detector.  Such an instrument presents the opportunity to perform  significant novel, nontraditional characterization of a wide  variety of materials because of its configuration.  This  instrument will benefit faculty and students in Materials  Research, Nuclear Engineering, Physics, and Chemical  Engineering, and will provide training for students.       First, four rotation axes allow a sample to be  arbitrarily positioned in real space using three axes, while  the diffracted radiation distribution is scanned with the  fourth axis.  The ability to orient a sample in three  dimensions has become crucial as increasing physical  anisotropy is routinely engineered into bulk specimens and  thin films, and as more single-crystal-like materials are  used in a wide range of applications.       Second, parabolic, graded multilayer x-ray optical  elements allow collection of Cu, Ka radiation from a wide  acceptance angle followed by conversion into a parallel  beam.  The concomitant increase in intensity relative to  flat crystal optics along with a beam divergence  intermediate between that of parafocusing or slit optics and  that of multi-bounce monochromators yields a collimated,  parallel beam that is ideally suited for experiments  performed on highly-oriented, but not epitaxial, materials,  and for experiments utilizing very low incident beam angles,  namely glancing incidence x-ray scattering and small angle x-  ray scattering.       Third, area detection of the scattered radiation  facilitates examination of large areas of reciprocal space  in an extremely time-efficient manner.  This is of paramount  utility for any case in which there is complicated  reciprocal space structure.  As examples, area detection  great ly simplifies the collection of pole figures from  textured materials and the determination of diffraction peak  shapes for complex microstructures.       This equipment is required to fulfill the general need  for advanced characterization in materials science and  engineering.  Current materials research programs will be  significantly impacted by the proposed instrumentation.  These include:  (i) structural characterization of  multicomponent oxide thin films and heterostructures; (ii)  investigation of complex morphologies in block copolymers;  (iii) characterization of semiconductor thin film  heterostructures; (iv) investigation of the effects of  texture on creep, deformation, fracture, and degradation of  metals and alloys targeted for use in aggressive  environments, and (v) phase identification, microstructure  determination, and investigation of transformations in  nanosized powders and powder composites.  There is great  scientific and commercial interest in each of these areas,  and the capabilities provided by new diffraction  instrumentation will significantly extend the scientific  contribution obtained from existing funding sources.  Finally, the importance of access to state-of-the-art  methodologies, as will be provided by such a diffractometer,  is emphasized for both graduate and undergraduate training.  ***",
