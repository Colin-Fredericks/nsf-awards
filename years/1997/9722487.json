Alberto Bandoni,  Planta  Piloto de Ingenieria Quimica (PLAPIQUI), Bahia Blanca,  Argentina.  The primary goal is to develop a software  platform for large-scale process optimization. This will  include leading edge algorithms for nonlinear programming,  and allow for the analysis and treatment of process  uncertainties in process optimization studies.  These  capabilities are not available in any large scale modeling  and design tools for process engineering.  The proposed  research will be devoted to three topics, executed in  sequence over the next two years.  They are: improvement of  optimization algorithms to solve larger problems more  efficiently and reliably; assessment of the influence  of  external parameters on the solution of the nonlinear  program, and; assessment of  the effects of uncertainty in  the design of chemical processes and related tasks.    In the last decade optimization strategies have seen  widespread application in process systems engineering and  chemical manufacturing processes.  They have also led to the  implementation of nonlinear programming algorithms in  commercial process simulators and the application to large  detailed, process models.  However, there are still a number  of current needs in algorithmic development, formulation of  large-scale optimization problems, and implementation within  efficient and reliable software, requiring further  investigation.  This project will research some of these  topics.    ***",
