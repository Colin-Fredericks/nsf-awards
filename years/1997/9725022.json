 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schoolnik  9725022    Generalized bacterial virus transduction occurs when a virus particle incorporates a piece of host (donor) DNA in place of viral DNA.  When that virus infects a recipient bacterium, a recombinant bacterium can be formed, carrying genes from the donor bacterium in place of the recipient's homologous genes.  The fate of the recipient genes displaced by the incoming transduced DNA has been a puzzle for many years. The objective of this project is to determine the nature of the DNA molecule in which a displaced recipient gene persists within a complete  transductant clone and to discover how it was produced. The working hypothesis is that the persistence of the recipient wild-type gene results from incorporation of the whole injected fragment (with its ends held together by protein) by a single cross-over into the recipient chromosome, producing a chromosome with two copies (each including a crossover) of a segment corresponding to the injected fragment, separated by a break bridged by protein. Such a chromosome could not be replicated but it could give rise to a normal chromosome by slippage recombination of the two copies of the repeated segment; this would leave the abnormal chromosome intact, able to confer motility on its viable recombinant host and to be transmitted to a single descendant, and so production of a reverse trail.  The methods to test the hypothesis of an interrupted-chromosome intermediate in complete transduction will be genetic: (i) isolation by micromanipulator of motile bacteria (abortive transductants or of the postulated broken-chromosome class) in a cross of a donor with a Tnl0 insertion in one motility-essential gene to a recipient with a mutation in a closely linked motility gene; (ii) examination of the growth of reverse trails; (iii) search for minute colonies in transduction of biosynthesis genes inactivated by transposon insertion; (iv) analysis of transductant clones for genetic heterogeneity; (v) testing of the effect on the reverse-trail phen omenon of rec and related mutations, bacterial or phage, including one which reduces the ability of phage P22 to effect abortive transduction.  The significance of the research is that it may show that the process of complete transduction involves an intermediate of a previously unknown sort, with an interrupted chromosome, a finding of relevance to understanding of recombination generally.",
