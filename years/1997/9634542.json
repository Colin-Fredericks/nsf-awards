 "awd_abstract_narration": "9634542  Coldren  The performance of fiber-optic communications systems is fundamentally limited by quantum mechanical fluctuations in the processes of amplification and tapping of light.  The minimum attainable total noise is limited by Heisenberg's minimum uncertainty product.    The goal of the proposed work is the development of optoelectronic devices that would circumvent the quantum mechanical limits.  This is done by the redistribution of the uncertainty in the observables such that the quantity of interest for the system performance exhibits a minimum noise.  At the same time the noise of the conjugate observable is enhanced.  By means of photon number amplifiers and taps, the information encoded in the intensity of an optical signal can be amplified and measured with very little uncertainty at the expense of phase information which is destroyed and becomes totally uncertain.  The proposed work will emphasize the fabrication of practical semiconductor devices that will allow for virtually noiseless amplification and information tapping and generation.  The success for this project relies on the ability to fabricate and integrate different configuration of high quantum efficiency semiconductor lasers.  In addition to the fabrication efforts, considerable work will reside in the experimental verification of  the low quantum noise properties of these devices.    Noiseless taps and amplifiers that we propose to demonstrate are expected to have a strong impact in applications where information needs to be shared among many subscribers.  This is the case in optical interconnects and local-area networks:  If the devices developed here are implemented, each subscriber will be able to measure, amplify, and regenerate the information of further use without degrading the signal quality.  Further, the versatility of these devices, which includes the possibility of cloning a signal into many quantum correlated copies, and the possibility  of choosing freely the emission wavelength of the latter, may  be attractive in space- and wavelength-division multiplexing applications.  ***",
