Dr. Borowsky requests funds for student support and for  travel and field costs in Thailand to carry out a project to  assess the genetic diversity of five cave fishes of the  genera Noemacheilus, Homaloptera, and Barbus, and their  relationships to other close relatives of these fishes in  Thailand.  The results from this study can provide an answer  to the question of the origin of cave fishes, their  adaptations to cave life and, in particular their loss of  vision (regression evolution).    This study addresses a  very important fundamental question in the origin of genetic  diversity in cave fishes and will contribute to Thailand's  biodiversity research efforts.  The Biodiversity Research  and Training Program of  the Thailand  National Science and  Technology Development Agency will provide matching support  for the Thai students to allow them to participate in this  project.   This project addresses two major focus areas: a  unique site in a remote area with little or no data, and  supporting the participation of a U. S. graduate student in  international cooperative studies in developing countries  and the training of Thai students.",
