 "awd_abstract_narration": "Freeman  9616491    This award assists in the transfer of the mammal collection of some 4368   specimens from Chadron State College to the University of Nebraska State   Museum.  This is a significant collection, primarily from the Pine Ridge area   of Nebraska, and it complements the existing collection at the University. The   combined collection will be among the top 30 such collections in North   America, with good documentation of reproductive and ectoparasite status of   the specimens.  The project is a partnership among Chadron State College   (which is covering 18% of the total), the University of Nebraska (which is   covering 37%), and the Research Collections in Systematics and Ecology   program of NSF (which is covering 45% of the total).  This project has well-  thought out procedures that are time- and cost-effective, the transfer of   ownership of the specimens has been made clear in a Memorandum of   Understanding, and the Chadron State curator is deeply involved in the   project.  When complete, the mammal collection at the University of   Nebraska will contribute significantly to research and education, as well as   public outreach.",
