 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710735  Stanton  This project is concerned with the design of precast concrete  structural systems for seismic regions.  Three linked studies are  by separate groups, covering the design, laboratory testing and  analysis of a large scale precast concrete structure.  This  project addresses the design, the University of California at San  Diego is conducting large-scale testing and Lehigh University  plans to perform a program of analysis.    The overall goals of the complete testing program are to:         o  provide design recommendations for precast concrete              seismic framing systems,        o  demonstrate that seismic performance suitable for the               most severe seismic regions can be provided by precast           concrete framing systems,       o  use the complete superassemblage of precast elements to           investigate features of behavior that are not induced in           the statically determinate bean-column connection           specimens that have been tested to date.    The tasks in the study cover the design of the test structure,  limited comparisons of measured and predicted behavior and  drafting of the final design recommendations.  The testing  program will provide the final steps needed to equip engineers  and code-writers with the information that they need to formalize  suitable design rules and to permit this form of construction.    Significant benefits will accrue.  The primary ones are that  excellent seismic performance will be demonstrated to be  available from precast concrete and that design rules suitable  for inclusion in a code will be developed.  At a time when steel  moment frames have, in their traditional form, been found wanting  in seismic resistance, designers have few options in choosing a  framing system.  Development of a viable alternative has the  potential for broadening the range of design alternatives,  improving performance and reducing construction time and cost.  ***",
