 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research  is  to  be conducted in several key  areas  of  robotic  movement  planning.  The  emphasis is on  robot  motion  planning  algorithms for autonomous robots.  A principal focus  is  on  the  investigation   of  motion  planning  problems  with   incomplete  information   or  changing  information  about  the  environment,  requiring the motion planning algorithm to be adaptive. Moreover,  the research considers movement problems with inherent errors  in  the  sensing and control, so the motion planning algorithms  must  be  robust to a lack of information on the position of the robot,  and  if possible the algorithms must be minimal: that is use  the  least possible amount of information about the robot position and  environment.   The  investigations  will  also  consider   motion  planning problems in environments which are dynamically changing;  these  will  require dynamic algorithms that respond to  changing  inputs.   The  research  will  involve  solving  motion  planning  problems  using  new formulations that have not  yet  been  fully  investigated.   The  research  will concentrate  particularly  in  emerging new areas in robotic movement planning that impact  most  strongly  the  overall  goals of adaptive, robust,  minimal,  and  dynamic  robotic algorithms.  Examples of topics to be researched  are  on-line  planning algorithms for unknown environments  which  are  randomized and/or may dynamically learn probabilistic models  of  the  environment, and pursuit movement games  (which  involve  movement  planning with an adversary).",
