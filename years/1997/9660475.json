 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program addresses the feasibility of a  process to recover three platinum group metals including platinum, palladium and rhodium, and rhenium from spent catalysts. The catalysts to be treated will include spent automobile catalytic converters and petroleum refining catalysts. The technology is based on a hydrometallurgical technique using halogen salts. The process is inherently environmentally benign since the reaction takes place in a completely enclosed autoclave. Furthermore, the chemicals used in the process will be continuously regenerated and recycled resulting in very little solid or liquid disposal. In Phase I the following key factors essential to the success of the new process will be evaluated: (i) the optimum extraction conditions, (ii) solid liquid separation after dissolution, and (iii) separation of individual metals after leaching. The results will be related to Phase II (continuous pilot tests for handling of 20 kg a day process) and Phase III (commercialization for handling of 1 2 ton a day process operation).  The proposed technology is designed to be compatible with existing technologies by saving energy by 80% and also by an environmentally benign process. The number of units using this technology operated in the U.S. by the year 2010 is estimated to be 56 and the calculated energy savings by this technology would be over $100 million. The estimated waste savings in the same year is 300 million pounds and the estimated job savings would be over $100 millions.",
