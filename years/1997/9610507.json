 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Program   funds the research of Professor Alan L. Balch of the University of   California at Davis.  The oxidation of fullerenes to mono-oxo species   will be studied and the oxidized species will used to form   electropolymerized thin films, whose reactive and conductive properties   will be studied.  A family of flat triangular gold(I) complexes, which   exhibit remarkable solvoluminescence properties,  and analogs with Ag(I),   Hg(II) and Tl(I) will be used to construct supramolecular species.  The   possibility of electron transfer through columns of these triangular   clusters will be tested by examining their photoconductive properties.    The possibility of charge-transfer complexes forming between the gold   clusters (electron donors) and fullerenes (electron acceptors) will be   probed. Co-crystallization of fullerenes with porphyrins has already   yielded an interesting class of compounds in which the fullerene nests in   the porphyrin.       This project is concerned with new inorganic materials that exhibit   novel redox activity or  luminescence.  Fullerenes and triangular gold(I)   complexes will be used as precursors for constructing the new materials,   such as supramolecular arrays and molecular co-crystals.  Fullerene films   will be explored as new highly conductive materials.   A new form of   luminescence called solvoluminescence, which is light emitted upon the   dissolution of a previously irradiated substance, will be studied.  The   hypothesis that this results from a long range separation of an electron   from its original site in a column of triangular gold units will be   tested.  Understanding such charge separations is fundamental to our   understanding of natural energy storage and transduction devices and   developing new materials along these lines.    Information gained from   either fullerene or triangular gold precursor classes  will have an   impact on how the other class is developed and their combination may lead   to entirely new materials.  Porphyrin complexes that can wrap partially   around fullerenes will be used to develop new ways of chromatographically   separating fullerene molecules according to their various shapes, which   may make unusual fullerenes more available for development.",
