Each year 60 teachers from grades 5-9 will be provided an equivalent of seven weeks of in-service activities which will strengthen the teachers' content knowledge, allow them to carry out inquiry strategies in the classroom and develop leadership capabilities so that they will be able to do in-service activities with peer teachers.  A group of these teachers will continue to participate in the program in ensuing years.  As a result of the project it is expected that the district will develop a comprehensive Middle School science curriculum framework, provide the school with exemplary science materials, provide in-service opportunities to all teachers and set up two permanent Science & Technology Instructional Centers for the teachers in the District to use as a resource.    Matching funds constitute 33% of the NSF award.",
