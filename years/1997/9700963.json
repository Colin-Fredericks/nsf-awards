 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry   Program, focuses on the decomposition reaction of methanol on platinum   electrode surfaces and on modified platinum electrode surfaces.    Professor Wieckowski and his students at the University of Illinois at   Urbana will use electrochemical methods combined with core-level electron   energy loss spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and a new   radiochemical method to characterize the reaction mechanisms associated   with these reactions.  The goal of this work is to understand, and   thereby prevent, those reactions that foul the electrode surface during   methanol decomposition so that these sytsems can be used as practical   fuel cells.  This work has enormous technological potential.  Studies of the decomposition reaction of the simplest alcohol, methanol,   on platinum and modified platinum electrodes will be studied in this   work.  Over time, this reaction fouls the electrode and the reaction   ceases to occur.  This prevents use of methanol, an inexpensive source of   energy, in fuel cells that could otherwise be used in many practical   applications.",
