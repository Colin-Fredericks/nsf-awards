 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested to purchase a new preparative ultracentrifuge and  three ultracentrifuge rotors which will be used by four laboratories in the  Department of Veterinary Molecular Biology at Montana State University.  Ultracentrifuges are essential equipment for all research in biochemistry  and molecular biology. Currently, there is only one ultracentrifuge in this  Department, a 22 year old Beckman L5-65, which is not capable of meeting  the Department's current and future needs. In addition, the L5 is rapidly  becoming obsolete, and new drives will no longer be available for repairing  this centrifuge. The increased demand for ultracentrifugation resulting  from the additional faculty added to this Department over the last year  (both Dr. Quinn and Dr. Pascual were hired in 1995) and in the coming year  (another faculty member will be added to the Department in the next year)  further emphasizes our need for the requested equipment. The Department  also lacks sufficient rotors to carry out the proposed research, and this  proposal includes 3 new rotors. Currently, this Department has an older  fixed-angle rotor (>10 years old), a swinging bucket rotor, and a derated  Type 50 rotor. None of these rotors are capable of running at speeds over  60,000 r.p.m. and probably should not be used over 45,000 r.p.m. The rotors  requested in this proposal are capable of much higher speeds and would  facilitate faster and more efficient separations.    The new equipment will be used primarily by the labs of Drs. Quinn,  Jutila, Pascual, and Burgess, so this proposal contains descriptions of  their projects that utilize ultracentrifugation. These projects are all  funded by research grants from a number of agencies such as the N1H, NSF,  and USDA. Ultracentrifugation is required as part of these projects for  density gradient analysis of proteins and protein complexes, subcellular  fractionation, membrane purification, and DNA purification. In addition, a  small amount of centrifuge time (<5%)  will be available for use in  Departmental classes for training students in the use of modern biological  instrumentation.",
