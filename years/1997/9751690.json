 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer science majors can significantly enhance their ability to solve problems through introduction to exploratory research programming.  This kind of programming is not typically found in computer science classes in the normal course of study but is comparable with the kind of explorative study performed regularly by other science majors.  The objective of this project is to introduce students to exploratory programming techniques in the framework of large-scale, ongoing software projects.  Throughout the laboratory, students pursue five different projects pertaining to mobile robot navigation and having exploratory components.  These projects introduce students to current technology such as X-Windows programming and Unix TCP/IP network programming, while also requiring students to program sophisticated hardware devices such as stereo vision system, and various sensors.  Students receive excellent training in research programming and large-scale team programming projects to benefit those who go on to strong software development firms or excellent graduate schools.  The equipment benefits not only the university students and faculty, but also the Mathematics and Science Center and local area high schools.     *",
