 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the Department of Education extends a partnership between the two   agencies in cooperation with the European Commission.  The US partnership will support   two US consortia that will work with two corresponding European consortia to foster   student exchanges.  Support of this proposal will allow 30 students from six US   institutions to work at eight participating European universities supported by the   European Commission. One consortium, the International Operations Consortium, is   headed by Mark McKnew, Clemson University, and Joao Lisboa, at the University of   Coimbra in Portugal.  It is designed to integrate traditional business and industrial   engineering disciplines through new educational programs and multi-lingual materials for   global distribution on the World-Wide Web.  The second consortium, for Distributed   Geographic Information Education, is headed by John Wilson, University of Southern   California, and Josef Strobl at the University of Salzburg in Austria.  The participating   institutions will cooperate in developing a multi-disciplinary geographic information   science curriculum, teaching units, and laboratory exercises as part of an on-line media   resource.",
