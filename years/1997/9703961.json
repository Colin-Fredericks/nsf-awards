 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Peter Negroni  TEAMS  (Teachers  Emphasizing  Achievement  in  Mathematics  and Science) is an integrated, research based and systemic  five  year plan  designed by the Springfield (MA) Public  Schools to increase the  number  of  minority  students enrolling in and  successfully completing  precollege courses which will prepare them  to  pursue undergraduate  degree programs in the  sciences,  engineering  and mathematics.  The project  objectives have been developed to  meet this primary  goal.    1 .   To  increase  each year and by the end  of  the     five year project  to  increase  by  a factor of     three  the number  of minority students who     successfully complete Algebra in the 9th grade;       2. To  increase each year and by the end of the five     year project period  to increase by a factor of     two the number of  minority students  taking     advanced science, mathematics and  technology     course work, including honors and advanced     placement courses;       3. To  increase  the  number  and percent  of     minority students electing  to  enroll  in  the     High  School  of  Science  and     Technology by 5% per year for each of the five  project                       years;                            4. To  begin tracking the number of students     electing to major in SMET  courses  of  study     beyond high school with  the  first project     year as baseline data and to increase the     number  each subsequent year;       5. By  the  end of the five year project period,     to increase the number of minority group     teachers in mathematics, science  and     technology;       6. To  reduce the academic achievement gaps     between minority and non-minority students in     science and math by 5% per year  for five     years (with a total reduction of 25% by the     end  of  the five year project period);       7. For each project year, to improve the     instructional methods of math and science     teachers who receive training; and       8. To develop SMET pac kets of math/science  activities.    The TEAMS strategy complements the district's  dual philosophy  of increasing minority college  enrollment and increasing the  number of  students  excelling in math, science and  technology.                TEAMS will  involve  all 42  Springfield schools and will capitalize  on the  strong partnerships established by the  Springfield  Public Schools with the business,  higher education, social services  and minority  neighborhood communities.  Working  with  faculty from nearby   Hampshire  College  and  the  Five  College Partnership (Amherst,  Mt.  Holyoke, Smith, Hampshire and U/Mass  Amherst)  , major project activities will involve:    Upgrading  teacher knowledge and skills in  summer  workshops and with continuous support  throughout the year;    Working  with  students to develop their  own  science  and math projects  which  they  will  conduct in the  manner  of authentic  researchers;    Providing  mentors, speakers and field trips  to  encourage more minority students to enter math  and science career fields;    Establishing  neighborhood  Math/Science  Education  Centers to  assist all students to be successful in their  Disseminating summer math/science booklets to  assist all students to  be  successful  in these  courses and to courses by  offering tutoring,  help with homework and SAT Preparation;  reinforce  what has  been  learned during the  previous school  year  as  well  as prepare  for   the upcoming  year;  Instituting  Math/Science  Expositions  where  students will present the  results  of their extended projects.  This will  be City-wide and follow a format of authentic  research presentations;    Placing  advertisements/PSA's  on local  television  stations  to showcase  what  students  are  doing  in  math and  science  and featuring  people employed in careers requiring math and  science;    Exposing students to real-world math and science  with projects at local college laboratories and  exposure to career options in SMET fiel ds:    Increasing   parental  involvement  by  assisting   with summer projects/activities,  increasing attendance at the Expositions and  attendance at Family Math and Science nights;    Educating  administrators and counselors to  encourage and assist minority  students  in  participating in higher  level  math  and science courses and providing  the necessary help in enrolling  in college in  SMET fields; and    Providing a summer experience for students at  the end of Grade  5 and Grade 8.",
