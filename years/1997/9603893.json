This goal will be achieved by characterizing defects in poly(A) function and by identifying and characterizing specific classes of new mutations that affect the mechanism and function of polyadenylation in yeast.  Dominant negative mutations of the gene encoding poly(A) polymerase will be identified, characterized and used to study the mechanism and function of polyadenylation in vitro and in vivo.  New mRNA 3'-end processing mutants will be selected using a recently developed system to identify temperature sensitive mutations that cause defects in mRNA 3'-end processing.  These mutations also will be characterized in vitro and in vivo and the corresponding normal genes cloned by complementation.  %%%    Modification of most eukaryotic messenger RNAs by addition of polyadenylic acid or poly(A) to the RNA 3'-end is essential for normal mRNA synthesis and function.  The goal of this research is to understand the role of polyadenlyation in normal eukaryotic mRNA biogenesis and function.  This goal will be achieved by characterizing defects in poly(A) function and by identifying and characterizing specific classes of new mutations that affect the mechanism and function of polyadenylation in yeast.  ***",
