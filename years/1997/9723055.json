Learning involves the adjustment of this  transmission as a result of experience. There are a variety  of mechanisms that could potentially alter the communication  between cells in the brain. This project examines one of  those mechanism, the ability of cells to adjust their  release of the chemical substances important in transmitting  information from one cell to another, in an important part  of the brain called the hippocampus. Behavioral experiments  dissociate the different aspects of experience that are  critical for the modification of transmission between cells  in the brain, while physiological experiments at the  cellular level test hypotheses about the mechanism by which  the communication between these cells is altered to reflect  this experience. Examination of the role of different  aspects of experience in driving the changes in cell  function provides important information about learning.  Combining this with studies of the cellular processes  underlying these changes provides important information  necessary to understand fundamental mechanisms by which the  brain learns and adapts to novel environments, as well as  processes important in development, aging, and recovery from  injury.",
