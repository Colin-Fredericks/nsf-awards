 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708399  Loftness  There   is   a  major  need  for  advancing  the  scientific  understanding,      technological      innovation,       and  design/engineering   standards  for  integrating   building  systems   to   improve  overall  building  performance   and  environmental quality; such concerns exist equally  for  new  construction  and  for retrofitting of  existing  buildings.  Advances  in  scientific and engineering understanding  will  focus  on  the performance of integrated systems -  thermal,  visual, acoustic, spatial, and air quality, as well as  long  term integrity.  Advances in technological innovation would  focus   on  innovation  in  structure,  enclosure,   thermal  conditioning,  ventilation, lighting, power and  networking,  and interior space definition; the anticipated advances will  be  present  both in individual products and  in  integrated  systems.   Advances in practice would focus on the  building  delivery process, incorporating issues such as codes, design  standards,  education, quality assurance  procedures,  and  prototyping  of  flexibly  integrated  systems   to   ensure  organizational flexibility, technological adaptability,  and  long term environmental quality.    The  strategic research needs may vary significantly between  advancing  building  systems, integration  for  performance,  indoor  environmental quality, global resource  utilization,  and    the    competitiveness   of   the    United    States  building/construction  industry.  This  NSF  Research  Needs  workshop  will  be held in 1997, assembling  key  researchers, practitioners, government and industry  participants  to  map out  state-of-the-art  conditions and  to  identify  research needs                and  priorities.  The  workshop  report   will   be  distributed  to institutions, organizations, and  individual  researchers  active in this research area:  the report  will  also be available electronically over the World Wide Web.",
