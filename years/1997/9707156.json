 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:  The proposal is to support travel by U. S. scientists to a one-week workshop in computability theory to be held in Kazan, Russia, in July 1997, to be organized by Profs. Marat Arslanov (Kazan State University) and Sergei Goncharov (Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk Branch) as well as Steffen Lempp (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and Robert Soare (University of Chicago).  The proposed workshop (to be held jointly and at the same location as a workshop in complexity theory, organized by Profs. Razborov and Ablayev) is the first meeting of its kind, designed to allow close contact between approximately thirty Russian and thirty scientists from the U. S. and other Western countries.   Computability theory, the study of unsolvable problems in mathematics, is a well-established branch of mathematical logic, and is particularly strongly represented in the United States and Russia.  For obvious political reasons, interaction between the two countries in this area has been quite limited in the past.  Research interests have also developed in somewhat different directions within the field;  e. g., the emphasis in Russia is on applications of computability theory to algebra, whereas in the United States, classical computability theory is more dominant.  On the other hand, close connections between the various directions obviously exist, as is evidenced by the small amount of cooperative research already taking place.  While the political barriers have by now mostly disappeared, severe financial difficulties have proven to be almost as great an obstacle to mutual cooperation in the field.  It thus appears that the only way to organize a meeting including a large number of Russians is to organize one within Russia, cutting travel expenses for Russian participants and counting on the non-Russian participants to be able to raise travel funds more easily.",
