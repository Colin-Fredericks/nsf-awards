 "awd_abstract_narration": "The thrust of this project is to extend the underlying theory,  enhance, perfect, test, and write applications for the Octopus  System which was developed by the PI during 1994-96.  Octopus is  a uniquely novel software layer that harnesses together the  computing power of clustered workstations or PC boards to produce  a fault-tolerant, scalable system which provides high throughput  and fast turnaround for large parallel computations.  Octopus is  based on and realizes previous and current fundamental work and  is a prime example for theory translated into an actual system.  The project continues the fundamental work side by side with the  system building work, to the mutual benefit of both, and  investigates further applications of randomization. Over the past  four years the PI has innovated, in collaboration with others, a  theory of asynchronous parallel computations.  The Asynchronous  Parallel System (APS), consists of a number of processors  executing at possibly different rates and addressing a logically  (but not necessarily physically) shared memory.  The theory  showed how to efficiently simulate the execution of parallel  programs written for synchronous parallel computers without  faults on realistic asynchronous parallel systems in which  processors may also fail.  The most efficient simulations were  developed for large-grained n-thread parallel programs.  In such  a program most threads execute a substantial block of  instructions within each parallel step, and the program variables  comprise a large number of memory words (examples are: a row of a  large matrix, or a string of keys in a parallel merge-sort).  A cluster of workstations or PC boards connected by a high  bandwidth switch is one realization of the APS model.  The  asynchrony arises from the absence of a common driving clock and  the fact that each node may be multi-programmed.  The Octopus  System consists of such a cluster managed by the Octopus layer.  The system is up and running and realizes the control, loa d  distribution, and fault-tolerance properties of Octopus.",
