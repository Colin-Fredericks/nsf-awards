 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713286  Ataai  Purification of a target protein constitutes the major  fraction of the total cost of its production.  The high cost  of purification often limits the availability of such  proteins, which in turn impedes studies in immunology,  vaccine development, and the production of pharmaceutical  and diagnostic reagents for human health care.  Although  immunoaffinity purification should allow for purification of  such target proteins, it suffers from a number of  shortcomings including high cost of the ligand, and, in some  cases, strong binding of the target protein to the antibody,  which could require the use of extremes of pH or other harsh  conditions for the elution of the protein.  IMAC has shown  promise for the purification of proteins fused to metal  affinity tails.  Based on preliminary results, screening of  combinatorial peptide libraries may identify peptides  capable of purifying target fusion proteins in one  chromatography step with high recovery, purity, and low  cost.  ***",
