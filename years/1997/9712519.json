 "awd_abstract_narration": "In most vertebrates, either sons or daughters typically disperse farther from the birthplace than offspring of the other sex before breeding. Theory suggests that which sex disperses depends on the mating system and the degree to which males and females invest care in offspring.  In polygynous mammals males usually provide little care, and males disperse farther than females.  In contrast, in monogamous birds males often provide substantial care, and females disperse farther than males.  There is little understanding of dispersal in the few monogamous mammals in which males care significantly for offspring.  Through genetic analyses and behavioral observations, this study will investigate patterns of natal dispersal in the dusky titi monkey, a monogamous South American primate characterized by paternal care. The study will also investigate adult reproductive behavior. Despite pairing monogamously, female titi monkeys mate with males other than their mates.  Using genetic techniques and behavioral observations, this study will establish whether these extra pair matings produce offspring and will investigate the factors that guide female reproductive decisions and whether they affect paternal behavior and social dynamics between paired adults.  The results will broaden understanding of factors that affect the stability of the family group in monogamous primates.",
