 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  EEC-9712629  BAIER      This five year continuing award adds the University of Miami to the multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Biosurfaces.  The Center will now be composed of the State University of New York at Buffalo (lead), Memphis State University, Alfred University, and the University of Miami.  The center continues to develop collaboration and synergy.  Memphis State University is below the industry funding requirements, therefore future funding will be reduced if the program requirements are not met.    These are the Long Term Goals and Objectives of the proposed new Center:    (1) Characterization of the surface chemical/physical properties of various synthetic substrata that promote or bioadhesion, in aqueous media of varied organic/inorganic content, including materials contacting the lungs, eyes, mouth, skin, or interior body environments.    (2) Determination of the surface properties of biofluids and cells as they engage in interactions with well-characterized substrata, giving special attention to the dynamics of media flow, cell arrival, surface modification, bio-attachment and -finally-stability of the attachment mechanisms, as observed in wound healing, for instance.    (3) Documentation of reactions between cells and adjacent cells, films and surrounding media, and other cross-reactions, with particular attention to technology that may control these interactions to either promote or prevent bioadhesion in practical environment, occupational or therapeutic situations.    (4) Scale-up of these biotechnologies to macrosystem processes, like filtration and purification, that utilize safe and effective structural materials and formulations for improved health and comfort.    Additional funds to provide support for the extra administrative activities of a multi-university Center are provided.    The U.S. Department of Army is providing funding to augment the ongoing research program and to obtain a membership in the Center.    Funding for  a woman undergraduate research student is being providing through the Women, Minorities, and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program.  The student will work with Dr. Hwang, the director of the University of Miami research site, on a center project related to the design of documentation systems needed for the testing and evaluation of the Baxter Novacor cardiac assist devices.",
