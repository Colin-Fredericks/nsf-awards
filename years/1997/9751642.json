 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Technology Project is designed to address the curricular need for providing undergraduate machining students and area industry technicians with the opportunity to study advanced (up-todate) CNC conversational programming applications.  The specific project objectives are (1) to implement up-to-date CNC conversational programming applications incorporating additional CNC curriculum materials/courses into drafting and design, general engineering, and machining programs and (2) to increase the number of industries served and the number of area employees trained through the efforts of the college's Center for Business and Industry and participation in the Manufacturing Technology Consortium (MTC).  The college seeks to implement the curriculum reforms and industry training through the acquisition of a Mazak Vertical Machining Center with Mazatrol M-Plus Control, a Mazak Quick Turn 10 Universal Lathe with Mazatrol T-Plus Control, and Mazatrol software for off-line programming.  The target audience for this project is community college students enrolled in industrial/manufacturing technology programs and returning adult students seeking to upgrade their skills in CNC programming applications.  The college is collaborating with four other area colleges and regional industries through the MTC.  This project broadens the base of both the college and the MTC to provide advanced technological education to students in credit and noncredit programs across a 17-county region of southwestern Virginia.  *",
