 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peter Taylor is jointly funded by the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the the New Technologies   Program in the Advanced Scientific Computing Division to continue his   research in the development and application of methods for the   calculation of accurate structures, energetics, and properties of   molecules.   Methods will be developed for the computation of accurate,   ab initio, small molecule, electronic wavefunctions using contracted   Gaussian geminals (predetermined linear combinations of   explicitly-correlated, two-particle, Gaussian basis functions).  Geminal   parameters for molecules will be extracted from optimized atomic   wavefunctions.  Scalable algorithms will be developed for implementation   on parallel computers.    Taylor asserts that two-electron basis sets   offer much more rapid convergence and thus provide a route to higher   accuracy for small systems, and a way to extend existing levels of   accuracy to larger molecules.    Applications include the determination   of anharmonic frequencies and vibrational intensities for small   molecules, and studies involving the electronic spectroscopy of organic   and transition-metal systems and small elemental clusters.    Orbital-based concepts and computational methods play a central role in   modern chemical theory, but there is a practical limit to the accuracy   attainable in orbital-based computations using existing supercomputers.    The goal of this project is to develop improved computational methods   using geminals (explicit functions of the coordinates of a pair of   electrons) rather than orbitals.  If successful,  this will significantly   increase the accuracy of theoretical predictions of gas phase reaction   rates such as those required for improved computer  models of the earth's   atmosphere.",
