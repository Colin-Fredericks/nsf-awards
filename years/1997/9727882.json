 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research extends the  theoretical and empirical development of our understanding of  school-based violence.  The work adds to  prior research by conducting a sequence analysis of violent incidents among African-American public school students, and by conducting a formal content analysis from a social interactionist perspective  The project's database is transcribed interviews of participants in violent incidents. Both quantitative and qualitative (ethnographic) methods are being used to analyze data from 100 participants participating in approximately 250 incidents. The particularly intriguing aspect of this research and where it is likely to lead to a major contribution to the literature on violence is that the research analyzes the narratives of opposing antagonists in violent events.  In the past, research has typically been based on the account of only one participant.  Because of its interactionist perspective and use of the incident or event as a unit of analysis, the research has the potential to augment other ongoing work being conducted by researchers under the auspices of the NSF sponsored National Consortium on Violence Research.  The potential impact on the infrastructure of science is significant, as well.   %%%  This research extends the  theoretical and empirical development of our understanding of  school-based violence.
