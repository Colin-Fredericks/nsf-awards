University of Colorado  Title: High Resolution UK37 Alkenone Paleothermometry at Bermuda  Rise: The Last Interglacial to the Little Ice Age    Subtropical sea surface temperature (SST) is an important climate   boundary condition within much of the North Atlantic basin.  It is  not known, however,  whether sub-polar millennial- and century-  scale SST changes also affected the subtropical gyre, and to what  degree such changes were connected with variations in the rate of  formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW).  Recently recovered  long cores, by the Marion Dufresne, provide an unparalleled  opportunity to study highly resolved proxy records of SST  and NADW  variations.  Work supported by this grant will establish a time  series of SST at 50-yr to 100-yr sample spacing for the past 150  kyr in sediments of the Bermuda Rise using the alkenone  paleo-temperature estimation technique.  Similar measurements made  in a pilot study of the last 15 kyr provide evidence of large  swings in SST during the last deglaciation.  This is consistent  with SST estimates from foraminiferal assemblage data.  The pilot  results demonstrate that the proposed studies are likely to yield  a high-amplitude signal of SST variations for the North Atlantic  subtropical gyre.  The fidelity and geographic representativeness  of the Bermuda Rise results can be cross-checked at key intervals  by analysis of a second high deposition-rate core from Blake-Bahama  Outer Ridge.  Combining this work with other proxy studies will  produce paired proxy records of SST and NADW variation and will  allow the evaluation of the role of the ocean thermohaline  circulation in climate changes occurring on these timescales.",
