 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gaining an understanding of the evolutionary history among a  group of species is a fundamental problem in biology.  The  ease with which biologists obtain and disseminate genetic  information and the resultant desire to analyze this data  necessitates a valid statistical methodology which is  computationally feasible for reconstructing large  evolutionary trees and assessing the associated uncertainty.  Other existing methods for reconstructing trees with may  leaves depend on the computationally-intensive bootstrap  method of resampling, whose validity in this context has  been criticized by several authors.  The investigators are  developing Bayesian methodology and software implementing a  novel Markov chain Monte Carlo alorithm for searching a tree-  indexed parametric space, providing evolutionary biologists  with a computationally feasible and statistically valid  method of assessing uncertainty in reconstructed trees.  This methodology is substantially superior on computational  and theoretical bases to existing bootstrap methods.    This project provides a new sophisticated computational tool  for understanding evolutionary relationships of species on  the basis of genetic information via a collaboration of the  fields of statistics, computer science, and biology.  The  methodology the investigators are developing uses high  performance computing in a novel manner to greatly improve  the analysis of genetic data  to elucidate evolutionary  relationships.  The methodology is general and may prove to  be useful in wide-spread applications quite unrelated to  evolutionary biology.  This work is funded by Computational  Biology Activities.",
