 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710480  Mijovic  This grant concerns a fundamental investigation of the  dynamics of dipole motions in crosslinking polymers.  Dynamics of glass-forming materials are currently a subject  of considerable activity in the scientific community, but no  comprehensive study has been reported hitherto on the  dynamic of systems that undergo a temporal evolution of  structure as a result of chemical reactions.  The  advancement of chemical reactions alters the very nature of  the material and adds a new dimension to the study of  dynamics of molecular motions.  Changes in the chemical  composition, physical characteristics and morphology are  accompanied by a continuous variation in the time scale for  segmental motions or relaxations.  When a signal (electric  field in this study) is applied to a polymer, a number of  molecular segmental must respond in unison.  That requires  cooperation on the molecular level, and hence the  fundamental argument should begin with the proposition that  the relaxation processes are governed by intermolecular  cooperativity.  The principal objectives of the research are  to investigate the changes in dipole dynamics during  crosslinking and utilize the results to: 1) describe the  molecular origin of various relaxation process at all stages  during network formation; 2) formulate a methodology for  relating the chemical and physical state of the network to  dipole dynamics; and 3) provide an interpretation of network  dynamics in terms of intermolecular cooperativity.  %%%  The proposed methodology is of an interdisciplinary nature  and will permit a fundamental understanding of  reorientational dynamics and intermolecular cooperativity in  crosslinking polymers.  It is expected that the research,  when completed, will afford a molecular-level insight into  the reorientational dynamics of polymers that undergo a  temporal evolution of structure as a result of chemical  reactions.  ***",
