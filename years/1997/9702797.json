 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award supports research and curriculum activities for applied engineering analysis and product development.  More specifically, the grant will enable a design environment which reveals the first-order effects that drive the design behavior, aiding the engineer to better internalize the causality between critical design decisions and a product's performance.  The critical activity of the project is the development of analysis and design objects that permit automatic application of analytical methods, appropriate boundary conditions, and numerical solution to the features of a designed component. To develop and demonstrate the methodology, cost and cooling analyses are to be developed and applied in the design of injection molded parts. The developed methods can later be extended to mechanical assemblies, different manufacturing processes, and additional analysis types for integration into engineering education and practice.  The research results will be translated to academic curricula and industry application through integration with commercial design environments.  If the goals are achieved, engineers would gain the ability to synthesize designs with real-time feedback regarding the product's purpose and performance.  In academia, students could gain more thoretical understanding, engineering intuition, and confidence by exploring analysis in the context of design synthesis.  In industry, the integrated environment should aid engineers develop more robust molded parts with reduced time, effort, and cost.",
