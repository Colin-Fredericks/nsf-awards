 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation and the Medical University of South Carolina in a joint effort will  provide resources to modernize the central laboratories of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology.  This project is part of a larger endeavor by the institution and the State to strengthen the research environment of the entire campus. In accordance with the overall strategic plan for the University, the department's central laboratories are to be revitalized for research in the fundamental areas of environmental biology, bacteriology, and molecular virology.  Laboratories, housed in the Basic Science Building, a 26 year old structure, lack quality space consisting of insufficient fume hoods for safely conducting modern molecular biology experiments, and inadequate biological containment facilities for using recombinant DNA, tissue culture, or biohazardous viruses and cell lines.  The renovations of dysfunctional research space into modern facilities will have immediate and long-term impacts on research and training in terms of safety, accessibility, efficiency, collaboration, productivity, morale, retention and recruitment of high quality faculty and students.  The project will provide shared facilities for tissue culture, microscopy, computing and instrumentation, as well as more efficient and reliable environmental chambers.  The laboratories will be designed to promote optimum utilization of resources to enhanced cooperation and collaborations among research personnel, and increase the participation of faculty and students, including those underrepresented in science, in the scientific enterprise.",
