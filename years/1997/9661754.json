 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9661754  Mogee     In this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project, Mogee Research & Analysis Associates will apply co-citation analysis techniques developed in the field of bibliometrics to patent data in an effort to identify patents closely related in terms of subject matter that may represent valuable licensing packages.  Co-citation analysis techniques will be used to cluster the U.S. patents assigned to two companies in two different technologies based on citations they have received from U.S. patent examiners, European Patent Office examiners, and patent applicants.  The resulting patent clusters will be evaluated by licensing professionals to assess how the clustered patents relate to one another technologically and how valuable the clusters would be as licensing packages.  The co-citation clusters will also be compared to clusters generated using other standard search methods such as word searching and classification searching.  The goal of this research is to develop a tool that patent licensing professionals can use to group patents into valuable licensing packages more quickly, cheaply, and accurately than they can using current methods.   A primary commercial application of this research would be a software tool that could be licensed to companies or other organizations with large patent portfolios or to technology licensing companies.  This tool would help them identify potentially valuable clusters of patents within their patent portfolios and help them identify potential licensing partners.  ***",
