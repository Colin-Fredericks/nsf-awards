 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704980  Golubitsky    Bifurcations to spiral waves and to cellular patterns in partial differential   equations posed on a circular disk will be investigated.  In unbounded   domains, the bifurcation and meandering of spirals and scroll waves and the   Ginzburg-Landau theory of spatially extended systems will be considered --  - with application to spatially aperiodic solutions in spatially extended   systems.  In addition, part of the effort will be devoted to studying the   dynamics present in ordinary differential equations with symmetry.  Stable   ergodicity of chaotic attractors in problems with continuous symmetry, and   the existence, stability and bifurcations of robust heteroclinic cycles will be   studied.  Some of these ideas are relevant to intermittent magnetic dynamos   in rotating convection.    Patterns appear in physical, chemical, and biological systems and are   characteristically striking and reproducible.  Consequently, scientists and   mathematicians have developed theories to explain the origins of these   patterns.  There are several approaches to the study of pattern; this one is   based on symmetry and bifurcation.  It is proposed to investigate the theory   and application of symmetric dynamical systems and its relation to pattern   formation.  There are fundamental differences in the analyses depending on   whether the patterns being studied fit neatly into a bounded domain or   whether boundaries are unimportant and the equations are posed on infinite   domains. Aspects of both cases will be studied.",
