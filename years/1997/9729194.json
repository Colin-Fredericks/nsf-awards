 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710003  Stixrude    The PIs will address two major geological questions using a  combination of high-pressure experiments (both multi-anvil  devices and laser-heated diamond cells) and first-principles  quantum-mechanical calculations:  1) How does the redox state  affect the relative stability of the major constituents of the  mantle and core? and 2) How does the redox state effect the  partitioning of geophysically and geochemically important  elements among major mantle  and core phases?  Their objective is to develop new avenues of  research regarding the Earth's redox state, ranging from the  practical to the fundamental: for example, from developing means  of characterizing and controlling redox state in experiments at  ultrahigh pressures (P) and  temperatures (T), to understanding the meaning of a component's  fugacity at P-T conditions far above the critical point.  Multi-  institutional collaboration will be an important aspect of this  research both because of the diversity of state-of-the-art  experimental and theoretical methods to be employed (no one or  two groups have sufficient expertise), and because this will  allow significant cross-checks of the results between different  laboratories, between different experimental methods, and between  theory and experiment.  ***",
