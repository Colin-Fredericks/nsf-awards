The goal of the workshop is to introduce a group of mathematical scientists to techniques used for the mining of massive data sets.  Data mining is the automatic extraction and discovery of  patterns, associations, changes, anomalies, and significant structures in large data sets.  Large data sets generated by scientific, engineering, medical and business applications are becoming increasingly common.  Developing algorithms which can uncover patterns in large data sets is an important mathematical challenge.    In the past decade, extremely large sets of data have been generated at an alarming from very diverse areas including scientific, medical, communications, and manufacturing.  These data bases are growing much faster than the speed of computers and thus are outstripping our ability to extract information  with current techniques.  The aim of this workshop is to acquaint mathematical scientists with the issues involved in the mining of massive data sets and to use their ability of abstraction to obtain new approaches to this critical problem.",
