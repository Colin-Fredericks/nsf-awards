 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal continues a program of basic research in  nuclear physics.  It is known that `nucleons` (protons and  neutrons) are composed of subunits called `quarks`.  In low  energy nuclear physics a property called `charge symmetry`  is well preserved.  It is assumed (with little experimental  evidence) to be equally valid at high energies.  This  project investigates whether charge symmetry is broken at  high energies.  We suggest precise experiments to improve  our understanding of charge symmetry.  We also relate charge  symmetry to another property called flavor symmetry, which  states that different `types` of quarks should contribute  equally in protons and neutrons.       We also study the motion of particles in very narrow  two dimensional systems.  All particles possess `wavelike`  properties.  When system dimensions are commensurate with a  particle's wavelength, dramatic results occur.  We were the  first to demonstrate that a particle in a bent tube  possesses bound states.  We study both theory and experiment  for such states, in both tubes and wave guides.  We also  study the onset of `turbulence` when particles move through  bent tubes.",
