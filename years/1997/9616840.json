 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616840  Clark    This five-year project, sponsored by Texas A&M's Engineering  Experiment Station, will carry out a program of teacher enhancement  for physical science teachers, primarily in grade 9.  The project  consists of three components.  One component is to select and  provide 24 physical science teachers a series of two week summer  workshops over a four-year period.  In the summer workshop the  teachers will learn up-to-date strategies for teaching physics and  chemistry content appropriate at that grade level.  The second  component is to carry out follow-up workshops with these lead  teachers at the annual meetings of the Science Teachers'  Association of Texas and the Texas section of the AAPT.  The third  component is to support the lead teachers in the program to carry  out workshops which, over the life of the project, will involve 260  additional teachers in grades 7-9 with over 100 hours of  content/pedagogy instruction.  The program with the second tier  teachers will be supported by project staff and periodically  evaluated in order to maintain high quality and determine impact.    The award is being matched with local funds in an amount equivalent  to about 40% of the NSF award.",
