 "awd_abstract_narration": "Staubli  9727192    Research in molecular biology and genetics has led to the  development of techniques to delete or modify specific  receptors or signaling substances important for nervous  system function. This work has revolutionized the  understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of  physiological processes believed important for the brain's  regulation of memory, perception, and the control of  movement. The development of  methods to test the three-way  links between the genetic changes, physiological mechanisms,  and behavior have lagged behind. This project develops a  method for stimulating and recording physiological activity  in the nervous system in such a way that it can be applied  to the model organisms often used in molecular genetics. The  hardware and procedures developed by the project provide a  way to assess brain function and changes in awake, behaving  organisms and relate them to functions at the molecular  level and at the behavioral level. This work would  contribute to understanding how neural systems at the cell  and molecular level work to mediate learning and memory, and  in a more general way, provides a tool to explore the link  between molecular biology and behavior in many areas.",
