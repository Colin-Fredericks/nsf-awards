 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is being supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and   Organometallic Chemistry Program under the Research in Undergraduate    Institutions (RUI) activity, which is part of the Foundation's effort to   help assure a broad base for scientific research through enhancing the   scientific and technical training of students in undergraduate   institutions by involving them in high quality research.  This project   will involve the synthesis of electronically conducting organometallic   polymers, some of which may change their electrical properties upon   binding small molecules and so serve as sensors for these molecules.     Metallocenes with attached pyrrole groups will be used to form conducting   polymers of varying lengths.  A variety of analytical techniques will be   used to characterize the polymers and molecular modelling methods will be   used to correlate physical and electronic properties.  A particular goal   is to determine whether these polymers can undergo ring slippage to   coordinate small molecules, such as CO, in a reversible fashion that will   cause a change in conductance and so would allow these materials to be   used as sensors.       Undergraduates will perform multidisciplinary research supported   under the RUI activity with the goal of developing new conducting   materials as sensors for small molecules, such as carbon monoxide.                                                     ?%\u00a2 />\u2524 ?\u255d\u00c0/>\u2563\u2502 /\u2502\u2563\u2524\u00a2 ?> \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1\u00a2\u00c1 \u2502/\u00a5/%`\u00a5\u2563\u2502 \u00a2\u2510\u255d\u00c2/\u2502\u00c1\u00a2 />\u2524 / \u2593\u255d?/\u2524  \u255d/>\u00c0\u00c1 ?\u00c2 \u00a2\u2510\u255d\u00c2/\u2502\u00c1 \u00a2\u00c1>\u00a2\u2563\u00a5\u2563\u2514\u00c1 \u2563>\u00a2\u00a5\u255d\u2510_\u00c1>\u00a5/% _\u00c1\u00a5\u00a9?\u2524\u00a2 \u2534\u2563%% \u2593\u00c1 \u2510\u00a2\u00c1\u2524 \u2563>  \u00a5\u00a9\u2563\u00a2 \u2534?\u255d,",
