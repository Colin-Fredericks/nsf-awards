The long term goal of this research is to understand the molecular genetic basis of the signal transduction occurring in Arabidopsis following the perception of gibberellins (GA), a class of phytohormones. Although much progress has been made in elucidating the anabolic and catabolic pathways for active GAs, relatively little is known about GA signal transduction. Arabidopsis is the best system in which to dissect this pathway because the genetic analysis of this species has identified more genes likely to be involved in GA signal transduction than in other plants and because the only cloned GA signal transduction genes, SPINDLY (SPY) and GAI, are from this species. The SPY gene is the focus of this proposal. Genetic analysis suggests that it is a suppressor of GA signal transduction and that a loss-of-function mutations lead to increased signal transduction. spy mutations completely suppress the inhibition of seed germination that results from GA-deficiency and partially suppress the dwarfism and sterility caused by GA-deficiency. In addition, a strong spy allele completely suppresses the effects of a semidominant mutation at the GAI locus, which causes GA responsiveness, suggesting that spy acts downstream of the step that is affected by the gai mutation. The SPY protein contains ten copies of an imperfect 34 amino acid motif known as a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) that is found in a number of diverse proteins including several that play roles in signal transduction. TPRs appear to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Thus SPY is likely to act by interacting with other components of the GA signal transduction pathway. Interestingly, homologous genes, encoding proteins of unknown functions(s), are present in humans and C. elegans suggesting that SPY is the first genetically characterized me mber of a previously unrecognized family of regulatory proteins that are present in eukaryotes. Preliminary results indicate that SPY expression is regulated by both developmental and environmental signals affecting plant growth. The goals of this proposal are to elucidate the role of SPY in GA signal transduction and to use it is to identify additional components of this pathway. Specifically, the developmental expression pattern of SPY mRNA and its possible regulation by signals that may control plant growth and development by affecting GA signal transduction will be characterized. The use of reporter genes in these studies will allow detailed analyses of the effects of many signals. In a complementary approach, the expression of SPY protein will similarly be characterized using polyclonal antisera against SPY protein and creating transgenic plants that express epitope-tagged SPY protein and localizing this recombinant protein using anti-epitope monoclonal antibodies. A range of molecular, biochemical and genetic approaches will be used to identify additional components of the GA signal transduction pathway. Data suggesting that Arabidopsis contains a second SPY gene has been recently obtained. This gene will be cloned and sequenced. If the sequence suggests that the gene is, indeed a SPY gene, its function in GA signal transduction will be determined by knocking out its expression. Because TPR repeats are believed tobe involved in protein-protein interactions, immunoprecipitation in conjunction with biochemical procedures will be used to determine if the SPY protein is a component of a stable multiprotein complex. If such a complex is detected, it will be purified and the protein members of the complex will be partially sequenced in preparation for cloning the corresponding genes. The two hybrid system of yeast will serve as a backup to this approach. To identify additional genes involved in GA signal transduction, genetic screens will be employed to isolate mutations that suppress or enhance  the action of spy alleles.  Non -Technical    The plant hormone gibberellin is central to signaling several essential processes involved in plant growth including seed germination, plant development and reproduction. Synthetic gibberellins have been used for many years to stimulate plant growth in laboratories and horticulture. The mode of action by which gibberellins control plant growth has remained unknown. Understanding how gibberellins exert its effect on plants is central to understanding the process of  plants growth. Dr. Olszewski has identified a protein called SPY that appears to be a central component of the biological system by which exogenous gibberellin signals are transmitted within plant cells to induce specific effects. In this award his group will conduct research to determine the function and interactions of the SPY protein. Diverse organisms including humans possess uncharacterized gene sequences that have homology to the gene encoding SPY indicating that SPY-like protein might be an essential part of signaling pathways in animals as well as plant cells. Dissection of the function of SPY in plants may result in a significant advance in understanding signaling systems by which plant hormones control the growth and morphology of plants.  ***",
