Problems involving electromagnetic immunity and emission are particularly important to automotive engineers, who must deal with complex electronic systems in every part of a vehicle.  The continuing move to higher frequencies is expected to exacerbate the problem.  In this GOALI research, a new senior level EMC course will be developed jointly by Chrysler personnel and the Michigan State University faculty.  The course will be taught as part of the standard electrical engineering curriculum at MSU and, in a modified form, internally to personnel at Chrysler.  An associated laboratory will be developed and taught at the state of the art Chrysler Technical Center.  Graduate students will also be part of this program and will be trained in state of the art EMC testing techniques, and will help in the development of the laboratory and course materials. Usefulness even beyond the important automotive context is apparent, as EMC problems are also a growing concern in wireless communications, and in many other areas. The multidisciplinary and \"hands-on\" nature of the electromagnetics training which this project provides is expected to be an excellent training ground for students.",
