 "awd_abstract_narration": "SEITZ, 9610334    The proposed work concerns a number of problems on the the subgroup  structure and representations of simple algebraic groups and finite groups  of Lie type.  The main problems are to complete the classification of the  maximal subgroups of exceptional algebraic groups, to determine pairs of  maximal subgroups of simple algebraic groups for which there are finitely  many double cosets, and to establish results on lifting representations of  finite groups to representations of corresponding algebraic groups.  Additional problems concern bounds for dimensions of weight spaces in  irreducible modules and a problem concerning finite groups acting  irreducibly on adjoint modules.              Groups are algebraic objects that appear whenever there is symmetry  and it is natural to study general properties of groups as well as their  representations.  Many problems can be reduced to the analysis of subgroups  of simple groups.  However, such an analysis can be extremely difficult and  is ultimately linked to fundamental problems in representation theory.  Seitz has a long standing research program aimed at systematically studying  the subgroups and representations of some of the most interesting families  of simple groups, the simple algebraic groups and their finite analogs.",
