 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705421  Robertson    The Developmental Studies Center is supporting the active involvement of parents in their children's mathematical development, helping parents understand more about how their children learn mathematically and socially, and increasing the likelihood that children will discuss mathematics with an adult who is significant in their lives. The first phase of this project develops, pilot tests, and evaluates a Homeside Math resource book for each grade level, K-2, with activities teachers can send home to foster positive interaction about mathematics between parents and their children.  These activities are related to exemplary school curricula, particularly those developed with NSF support.  The next phase develops a limited number of additional activities to add to the Homeside Math collection to be published as Community Math.   Community Math is a resource book for youth workers with activities that foster mathematical discussions between children ages 5-8 and a significant adult and can be used in a variety of community organization settings and sent home for family use.  Workshops are developed for parents, teachers, and youth workers to strengthen their knowledge of child-centered instructional strategies, meaningful activities, and how children develop mathematically and socially.  And facilitator workshops are developed for parents, teachers, and youth workers to enable them to lead workshops for parents.",
