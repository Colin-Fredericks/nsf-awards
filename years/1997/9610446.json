 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, Mary J. Wirth of the University of Delaware is supported   by a renewal grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  She   will study the adsorption of organic cations to silica-based   chromatographic surfaces in order to understand the physical phenomena   responsible for zone tailing in chromatographic separations which is a   long-standing problem hindering separation of a large number of important   compounds such as proteins and pharmaceuticals.   Atomic force microscopy   will be used to measure surface charge density over a wide pH range.    Single-molecule detection of an organic cation, rhodamine 123, will be   used to probe lateral diffusion and desorption rates as a function of   surface charge density, which is controlled by pH.  Stationary phases   will be synthesized with varying silanol concentration, monolayer   coverage and monolayer hydrophobicity, along with horizontally   polymerized monlayers to reduce surface charge density.  Adsoption   isotherms will be generated from data obtained by elution of rhodamine   123 on nonporous silica gel and tested by performing the single-molecule   and atomic force microscopy experiments on the same material.  In this work, physical and chemical factors responsible for the currently   inefficient chromatography of important classes of compounds such as   pharmaceuticals and proteins will be  investigated.  The experiments to   be done are multidisciplinary in nature, bringing together ideas from   optical spectroscopy, self-assembled monolayer research, scanning probe   microscopy and chemical separations.  The practical impact of the work   will result in faster more complete separations for analysis and   preparative purposes.",
