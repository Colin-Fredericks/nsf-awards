 "awd_abstract_narration": "9722042  Steele    This Americas Program award will fund a joint USA-Argentina  workshop on aspects of  surface science, to be held in La  Plata, Argentina, November, 1997.  Organizers are Dr.  William Steele, Pennsylvania State University, and Dr.  Eduardo Bottani, Instituto de Investigaciones Fisicoquimicas  Teoricas y Applicadas (INIFTA), La Plata.  The workshop will  bring together scientists from US and Argentina to present  and discuss the most recent studies on surface science, and  explore the possibilities of collaboration in future work.  Modern surface science covers a wide variety of topics.  Subfields to be discussed in this workshop include surface  heterogeneity and its influence on the diffusion,  thermodynamics and chemical reactivity of molecules adsorbed  on such surfaces; methods of characterizing surface  heterogeneity, such as fractal dimension or the distance  dependence of the correlation between adsorption sites of a  given energy; and chemisorption and chemical reactivity on  well characterized surfaces.  These topics are at the  forefront of current research involving surfaces.    Surface science is a subject that has seen explosive growth  over the past two decades due to the introduction of  powerful new techniques for visualizing and characterizing  the species that form on the surfaces of chemically active  solids.   It is of enormous importance to catalysis, to  purification procesqes, to corrosion, wear and lubrication,  and to the fabrication of ever-smaller computer chips.  ***",
