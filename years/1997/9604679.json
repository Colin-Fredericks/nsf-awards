 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pierce  9604679        This proposal requests funds to continue a study of the  mechanisms that regulate the concentration of the  intracellular osmolyte, glycine betaine, in response to high  salinity stress. Glycine betaine is an extremely common and  important osmolyte in a wide variety of species ranging from  bacteria to plants and animals. Although a great deal is  known about the salinity-induced regulation of glycine  betaine in bacteria, far less is known about its regulation  in plants, and even less in animals. The PI had found  previously that oysters (Crassostrea virginica) from the  Atlantic coast utilize substantial amounts of glycine betaine  to regulate intracellular osmotic concentrations following  high salinity stress. Conspecific oysters from the Chesapeake  Bay have much smaller levels of glycine betaine that do not  change following salinity stress and the Bay oysters are not  as salinity tolerant. In addition, the PI's previous work has  indicated that the basis of this difference in glycine  betaine accumulation and salinity tolerance lies within  synthetic pathways that reside in the mitochondria.  Furthermore, in bacteria and plants, salinity-induced glycine  betaine accumulation is regulated by a family of genes that  is osmotically-activated. Almost nothing is known about  osmotically activated genes in animals. The experiments  described in this project propose to exploit the differences  between Atlantic and Bay oysters in glycine betaine  metabolism to begin to understand how this important, but  scarcely studied osmolyte is regulated in animals cells.  Further, since all of the Bay oysters are parasitized by the  haplosporidian parasite, Perkinsus marinas, which has  devastated the Bay oyster fishery, the initial experiments  will focus on the possibility that the parasite is causing  the biochemical differences between the two oyster groups.  The results will contribute a great deal to the understanding  of glycine betaine regulation, salinity tolerance mechanis ms,  cellular osmoregulation and, perhaps, uncover some of the  biochemical consequences of that parasite on oyster  metabolism.",
