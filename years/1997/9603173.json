 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603173  Trenary    This award supports a three-year collaborative research  project between Professor Michael Trenary of the University  of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Dr. Takaho Tanaka of the  National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials  (NIRIM) in Tsukuba, Japan.  The researchers will undertake  experimental studies of the structure and chemistry of  single crystal surfaces of metal borides.  An essential  component of the surface science studies of the boron-rich  solids is the use of large single crystals of these  materials.  These crystals were developed at NIRIM and both  researchers are using them in their experiments.    The proposal brings together the efforts of two major  laboratories that have constituted different parts of the  process:  The UIC surface science studies make use of the  techniques of low energy electron diffraction (LEED),  scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy (XPS), and reflection absorption infrared  spectroscopy (RAIRS).  The NIRIM group has provided the cut  and polished single crystal samples of yttrium boride,  hafnium diboride and lanthanum hexaboride.  The researchers  also plan to initiate joint publications and identify  ongoing experiments. Through the exchange of ideas and  technology, this project will broaden our base of basic  knowledge and promote international understanding and  cooperation.  ***",
