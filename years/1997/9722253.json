Undergraduate students, who usually take separate courses in these disciplines, often compartmentalize information to the specific course and do not recognize the interdependence of these cellular processes.  Such fragmentation impedes the recognition of basic biological principles.  This project includes three educational objectives: a three semester course which integrates genetics, molecular and cellular biology and emphasizes cellular interactions; a corresponding two semester laboratory course to reinforce fundamental principles by conducting basic experiments; and exposure of students to the process of discovery through independent research.   The independent research will focus on the study of a polymerase switch in the synthesis of rRNA.  In respiratory deficient strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, rRNA is synthesized by both RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase II.  In these cells, a cryptic pol II rDNA promoter that overlaps the pol I promoter is used to synthesize an equivalent 35S precursor rRNA that can alleviate the requirement for pol I.  This novel finding introduces new questions in the regulation of rRNA synthesis and is particularly well suited to illustrating the role of scientific inquiry in changing perceptions of cellular function.  The objectives of this research are to:  1. Define the sequence signals for pol II transcription of rDNA.  2. Identify regulatory factors required for pol II transcription of rDNA.  3. Investigate the function of pol II rRNA.  Dissecting the role of poll II transcription of rRNA presents an intriguing problem for the introduction of students to the role of scientific discovery in expanding our understanding multiple cellular processes.  The switch in rRNA synthesis from pol I to pol II involves the interactions of multiple cellular processes including :  interorganellar communication, transcriptional activation and silencing, and preferential excision and replication of rDNA episomal copies.  Students will be investigating these interactions by synthesizing the various cellular processes that intertwine to produce pol II synthesis of rRNA.  %%%  As we achieve greater understanding of the molecular basis of cellular structure and function, the distinctions among genetics, molecular biology and cellular biology fade.

Emphasis will be placed on the synthesis rather than compartmentalization of information, and the interactions of cellular processes as a framework for problem solving.  Furthermore, by participation in laboratory exercises and in the pursuit of independent research, students will witness first hand the process of scientific inquiry.
