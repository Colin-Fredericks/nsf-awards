 "awd_abstract_narration": "W. Lester S. Andrews of the University of Virginia is supported by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his matrix-isolation   Fourier Transform Infrared studies of reactive species.  In previous   work, laser ablation was used to generate hot atoms which subsequently   reacted at or near the matrix to form the species of interest.  In this   award, the emphasis is on a) understanding the laser ablation process   itself and b) pursuing new chemical applications.   In the former case,   e.g., the PI will investigate the source for the activation energy of the   reaction in which laser ablated Fe reacts with O2 to form OFeO, a   reaction that does not occur thermally.  Is the activation energy due to   excess kinetic energy, electronic excitation involving metastables or   radiation from the laser plasma?  Additions to the apparatus involving   magnetic or electric fields will allow manipulation of charged species,   which should lead to an understanding of some of the underlying   mechanisms.  Laser ablation experiments with beryllium and oxygen in a   neon matrix will be carried out in an attempt to isolate the first   neutral neon compound NeBeO.  Finally, the isolation of reaction   intermediates in semiconductor growth processes will be attempted.  Given   current interest in pulsed laser ablation to grow semiconductor thin   films, reactions of GaAs, GaP and InSb with H2 will be emphasized.     Density functional theoretical studies will be done in collaboration with   Bauschlicher, although the emphasis in this proposal is on the   experimental aspects.    Pulsed-laser ablation is rapidly becoming an extremely important physical   technique and is currently employed in such diverse areas as plasma   physics, analytical chemistry and the growth of superconductors.  Better   understanding of the laser ablation process would help foster further   applications of this technology.",
