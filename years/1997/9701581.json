 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701581 Suzuki  This CAREER project addresses the role of structural distortions in magnetic properties of ferromagnetic perovskite materials. A major objective is to correlate structural distortions with magnetic properties to shed light on the origin of anomalously large magnetoresistance effects. Effects of lattice strain of cubic perovskite ferromagnets in thin films grown on prudently oriented substrates, in particular piezoelectrics, will be studied. In thin film samples on piezoelectric substrates, strain can be applied to the sample externally by applying a voltage to the substrate. These studies aim to elucidate the effect of structural distortion on the magnetic properties, including magnetoresistive response and Curie temperature, and thus identify appropriate theoretical interpretations. Conversely the effect of varying the strength of the magnetic interactions on the structural and magnetic properties will be studied in related layered ferromagnetic perovskites that have only recently been isolated in bulk and in heterostructures of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic cubic perovskites. This series of thin film samples is expected to uniquely allow systematic tuning of structural and magnetic properties.  An education program in which the magnetics research is integrated into undergraduate and graduate experiences will be developed. This includes a course on magnetics for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, and advanced magnetics lab course and undergraduate internships in the PI's lab. The aim is to provide a firm foundation in materials science, condensed matter physics and solid state chemistry, and especially to develop students' experimental and analytical skills. %%% The project addresses forefront research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of magnetic materials and devices, in general.  Additionally, the fundamenta l knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is the emphasis on education, and on the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant research area. ***",
