The construction of Euclidean  quantum field theory is a closely related problem.  The standard tools  in theoretical physics used for these calculations are the epsilon  expansion and the 1/N expansion, but neither of these are known to be  correct methods of calculation. The epsilon expansion is particularly  perplexing, because it involves analytic continuation in the dimension  of space from 4 to 4 - epsilon.  This continuation is made term by  term in perturbation theory, but it is not known that the resulting  expansion is the perturbation theory of any model.  This proposal  considers a different way to introduce a parameter epsilon, where there  clearly are models for epsilon not = 0, and yet the epsilon parameter  plays the same role of moving four dimensional theories off a  bifurcation. The objective is to study the properties of expansion in  epsilon and also expansion in 1/N. It is believed that methods based  on previous work by the author and his collaborators can be extended  to prove that these expansions are correct for epsilon small and for  1/N small. One possible outcome of this study is the construction of  quantum field theory in three dimensions using the 1/N expansion.  This theory should obey all Wightman axioms, but the perturbation  theory in the coupling constant will be non-renormalizable.      Quantum field theory originated in elementary particle physics, but it  is really a mathematical framework for systems with very large numbers  of degrees of freedom. Important applications include: predicting the  size and shape of polymers, the physics of sound waves and electrons  in crystals, the physics of phase transitions.  When quantum field  theories were first proposed, it was not clear that they were free of  internal contradictions. Examples are now known which are free of  contradiction, but consistent approximations for prediction remain  elusiv e.  The purpose of this grant is to investigate two  approximations proposed by Wilson and Fisher, to show that they are  truly consistent approximations, and to delineate their range of  validity.",
