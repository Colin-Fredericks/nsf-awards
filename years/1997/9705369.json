Organic metal systems for  study  include  a Bechgaard salt alloy system and the blue bronze.  Most  of  the experiments will employ pulsed NMR over a very wide range  of  frequencies  and  up to high pressures.  In  superconductors,  recent  NMR spin-echo field-rocking measurements will be extended  to  anisotropic superconductors to measure the anisotropy of  the  penetration  depth;  and to high field to measure  the  coherence  length. Work is planned to extend the recent observations by  NMR  of  rf-assisted  flux-lattice annealing in anisotropic  Type-  II  superconductors.  Some  very high magnetic  field  work  will  be  performed  at  the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.  This  study of unusual ground states in novel materials will extend the  knowledge base and has potential to generate significant advances  in  basic  solid  state  physics. It also  will  demonstrate  new  methods   for  using   NMR  which  may  be  applicable  in  other  circumstances.  %%%  This  experimental research project uses primarily the  technique  of  Nuclear  Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to probe  basic  electrical  properties of novel organic metal conductors, as well as  aspects  of  the  magnetic behavior in highly anisotropic superconductors.  The organic conductors of interest exhibit nearly one-dimensional  electrical conduction. Their electrical conduction is believed to  occur  by  a  novel mechanism known as a \"sliding charge  density  wave\",  which  involves a highly correlated motion  of  carriers,  unlike  conventional  metals.  The  properties  of  this  unusual  effect,  and  materials that can exhibit  it,  a re  of  interest.  Results  from  this research may include unusual new  effects  or  materials which may find new application in technology. A portion  of  the  work  will be carried out at the National High  Magnetic  Field  Laboratory. This research project is interdisciplinary  in  nature  and involves both graduate and postgraduate students  who  will  be  excellently  trained to enter  positions  in  industry,  government or education.  ***",
