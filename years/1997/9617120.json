 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, Devlin will continue studies on characterizing   the structure of ice surfaces and adsorbates using spectroscopic   techniques in order to provide a detailed picture of the structural and   dynamical interactions between them.  FTIR measurements will be used to   examine the ability to form stable nanoparticle assemblies of crystalline   ice and other molecular solids at cryogenic temperatures.  Another aspect   of the proposal involves theoretical modeling of the properties of ice,   particularly those related to the measurements.  The nature and effect of   hydrogen-bonding molecules such as HCN, NH3, ethylene oxide, HCl, and H2S   with the surface and subsurface will be examined.  A study of the   mobility of water molecules near the surface and an extension of these   studies to other molecular substances, including binary mixtures with   alcohols, acids, and the like, will be undertaken.  This project entails in part a fundamental laboratory study of processes   which take place on ice surfaces, many of which are involved in natural   phenomena of considerable current interest.  Among these are the   environmentally urgent issues of the formation of the ozone hole, acid   rain, and smog.  In addition, these experiments will help elucidate such   areas of astrophysical interest as the mechanism of the formation of   molecules in interstellar space and the composition of cometary tails.",
