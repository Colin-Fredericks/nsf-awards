 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Auchincloss  This grant will support the involvement of undergraduates  nationwide to undertake supervised research projects in the  Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of  Rochester.  Aiming at 50% participation by women and  underrepresented minorities, the project complements other  college-wide and departmental initiatives to more fully  engage these groups in science.  Students may choose from the following experimental and  theoretical research areas: particle and nuclear physics;  quantum optics and laser; astrophysics and infrared  astronomy; condensed matter physics; and biological and  medical physics.  On-site housing is available for all  participants.  The central research experience takes place  during a 2.5-month, full-time work period each summer,  during which time each student works closely with a faculty  advisor to select a research project and pursue it.  Mini-  courses in machining and electronics are also offered, and a  series of participant sessions is organized, including  seminars on varied subjects -- such as applying to graduate  school, ethical and policy issues in physics, and current  topics in physics research -- and tours of research  facilities (the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, the Mees  Observatory, the Laser Cooling and Trapping Lab, and  others).  The summer program ends with a mini-symposium at  which students present their research results.  Students  provide written reports of their research experience, and  faculty advisors are requested to comment on student work.  Each student is strongly encouraged to continue part-time  work with his or her research advisory during the academic  year, with the aim of completing a scientific publication.  ***",
