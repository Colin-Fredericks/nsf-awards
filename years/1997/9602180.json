Kamm, Department  of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  to pursue with Dr. Byoung-Goo Min, Department of Biomedical  Engineering, Seoul National University, for 24 months, a program  of cooperative research for the development of computational  fluid dynamic methods that can be used to assist in the design  and optimization of cardiac assist devices.  The U.S.  investigator brings his experience with use of computational  methods for the analysis of flow in the cardiovascular system,  using methods appropriate both for three-dimensional, unsteady  flows with moving boundaries of the type that occur in the  chambers of the artificial heart or the ventricle.  The Korean  collaborator and his research team bring to the research their  considerable experience in the development of a total artificial  heart, extending from fabrication of the device to implantation  and long-term testing in large animals.  An important component  of this research is the experimental verification and extension  of the numerical simulations using both laser Doppler anemometry  and particle image velocimetry.  The combined expertise of this  group of collaborators will help in the development of techniques  that can be used in the design of the next generation of cardiac  assist devices which can be optimized with regard to the flow  field to reduce the tendencies for thrombus formation and  hemolysis, while minimizing the power requirements of the device.    Previous research on implantable heart assist devices has  produced many successes, but has not yet lead to a reliable total  artificial heart.  This project is based on the premise that the  next generation of heart assist technology will require new tools  that draw upon newly developed capabilities in computational  methods and experimentation.  The collaborators in this project  expect to develop these computational tools.  The project brings  together Korean experts i n biomedical engineering and medicine  and U.S. experts in computational fluid dynamics.  Together they  will attempt to develop a smaller, more reliable, and more  efficient left ventricular assist device.  This project is  relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science  Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between  U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of  scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  This project  provides an international research experience for a U.S. graduate  student.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
