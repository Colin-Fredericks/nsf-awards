 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614738  Gwynne    The Wildlife Conservation Society will develop \"Congo Gorilla  Forest.\"  This will be a 6.5 acre outdoor exhibit that will provide  visitors with a realistic trip through a living Congo Ecosystem,  ending in an arms-length observation of a colony of 30 Lowland  Gorillas living in a natural setting.  The science presented in  this exhibit is based on much of the seminal research that has been  carried out on the Congo Forest environment by scientists at the  Zoo.  During their trip visitors will be able to explore and  develop their own insights into this dynamic ecosystem and at the  end will be drawn into difficult conservation issues.  The exhibit  will include the Rain Forest Trail, Living Treasures of the Congo  Gallery, Conservation Showcase and Theater, Great Apes Gallery, and  the Conservation Choices Pavilion.  In addition there will be a  menu of complementary formal education materials to include parent  workshops, teacher training activities, and instructional  materials.  Linkages have been made with the New York Urban  Systemic Initiative and the formal education programs will  complement the goals of this systemic initiative.  Given the Zoo's  location in the Bronx, given the Zoo's reputation as a leader in  wildlife conservation, and given the Zoo's renewed commitment to  quality visitor experience and learning activities, this exhibit  will break new ground in the exhibition of animals and informal  learning activities of visitors.  It will have an impact on zoos  throughout the world.  They anticipate 750,000 visitors annually  for the Congo Gorilla Forest.",
