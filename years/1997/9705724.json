 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research on electron transfer reactions by Dr. Thomas J.   Meyer of the Chemistry Department, University of North Carolina at Chapel   Hill.  Metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states of   polypyridyl complexes in molecular assemblies will be studied in order to   better understand the general phenomenon of photoinduced electron and   energy transfer.  Chromophore-quencher and ligand-bridged assemblies will   be synthesized.  These new assemblies will be designed for the   investigation of the following:  (a) novel photophysical phenomena   particularly in the Marcus inverted region, including intramolecular   competition, time delays, and multi-photon effects; (b) the role of new   structural motifs, based on cis/trans isomerism at unsymmetrically   substituted bipyridine ligands; (c) long-lived storage of photochemical   redox equivalents through the use of bridging electron transfer ligands;   and (d) photchemical energy conversion.  Spectroscopic parameters will be   used to calculate electron transfer rate constants.  Investigation of the electronic properties of large molecules and   associations of molecules, or assemblies, is ultimately aimed at   development of molecular-level electronic devices.  This research is   relevant to photochemical energy conversion and information storage based   on color changes.  To develop this technology, movement of electrons over   long distances and over long time scales must be better understood.",
