 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Oswalt    The Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy (SARA) wishes to  continue its participation in the NSF Research Experiences for  Undergraduates (REU) program.  The REU program run by SARA is unique in  that the host site is not a single institution, but rather a consortium  of five universities in the southeastern U.S., which operates a one  meter class automated telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory near  Tucson , Arizona.  The preparation of students for careers in science and engineering is  emphasized through one-on-one collaborations with faculty who are  experienced undergraduate student research mentors.  Over a dozen  research projects are offered, ranging from spectroscopic studies of  minor planets, to the determination of the Galactic disk age from  observing white dwarf stars, to target of opportunity observations of  active galactic nuclei.   At least 10 REU students annually will use  the SARA Observatory in Arizona during the course of their summer  research. In addition, multi-day workshops will expose each of them to  astronomy as practiced at two to three SARA institutions during their  summer internships.  At the conclusion of the summer all students will  present a talk and prepare a paper for publication based on their  summer research.  Continuing collaboration with their mentors and the  presentation of papers at national meetings after the summer program is  supported.    The NSF/REU summer intern program is the core of SARA's effort to  become a new center for undergraduate education and research in  astronomy for the southeastern U.S.  Our recruiting effort to attract  undergraduate students will encompass the entire U.S., and will include  a strong commitment to attracting minority applicants, gender equality  and student diversity.",
