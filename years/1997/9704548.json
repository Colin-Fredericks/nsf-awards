 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal #DMS-9704548    Studies in Efficient Design of Experiments    Ching-Shui Cheng  University of California    ABSTRACT      This research involves several problems in experimental design.  Optimal blocking of fractional factorial designs is studied.    Blocking is an effective method for improving the efficiency of  an experiment by grouping the experimental units into more  homogeneous blocks.  How to choose a fractional factorial design  and a blocking scheme simultaneously in an optimal way is of  interest to both theoreticians and practitioners.  A new criterion  for choosing good blocking schemes by examining the alias patterns  of the interactions is formulated.  Methods of constructing optimal  and efficient designs under this criterion are investigated.  Some  unsolved problems in the unblocked case are also studied.  Another  area of research is the projection properties of orthogonal arrays.  In factor screening, often only a few factors among a large pool of  potential factors are active.  Under such assumption of effect  sparsity, it is important to consider projections onto small subsets  of factors.  An extensive study of the projection properties of  orthogonal arrays is carried out.  Connections with search designs  are also explored.  In addition to factorial designs, optimal and  efficient regression designs under random block-effects models are  studied by adopting the approach of approximate theory.    Experimental design is used extensively in a wide range of   scientific and industrial investigations.  In industrial experiments,  often a large number of factors have to be studied, but the  experiments are expensive to conduct.  In this case, the so called  fractional factorial designs in which only a small fraction of all  the possible combinations are observed are particularly useful.  In recent years, factorial designs have received considerable  attention, mainly due to the Japanese success in applying them to  improve quality and productivity in industrial manufa cturing.  One objective of this research is to study the construction of  efficient designs to extract more information, especially when  systematic sources of variation (such as heterogeneity of  experimental material or day-to-day environmental variations)  need to be eliminated to improve the precision.   Since often   only a few of the many potential factors are actually important,  this research also looks into the properties of some commonly  used designs when only a small number of factors are active.  Another research involves a problem arising from a recent   optometry experiment, which also has industrial applications.",
