 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710238  Leon  This project intends to develop experimental data and analytical  tools to better characterize the three-dimensional effects and  steel-concrete interaction in typical composite floor systems.   Such as steel moment frames with composite floors for which very  little is known about the ultimate strength capacity, ductility  and toughness of these systems.  From a fundamental standpoint  research is needed to answer the following questions:    o  Behavior of exterior connections under cyclic load reversals.  o  Behavior of connections framing into the weak axis of columns     when subjected to cyclic loads.  o  Interaction between lateral and gravity actions insofar as          system strength and stiffness are concerned.  o  Effect of the floor slab on the torsional restraint at the end     of composite beams.  o  Influence of the degree of shear connection on the strength         and stiffness of the system under lateral loads.  o  Influence of the slab reinforcement detailing on the force          transfer.  o  Behavior of shear studs under reversed cyclic loading.    Experiments coupled with advanced analysis techniques will be  used to address several of the topics described above.  The  experiments will include some unique bi-directional loading tests  on a new type of partially-restrained composite (PR-CC)  connections utilizing T-stubs and stiffened seats.  Among the key  items to be studies are the connections to the weak axis of the  columns, connections at the edge of the floor slabs, and behavior  of shear studs under reversed cyclic loads.  The analytical  component will develop new elements capable of efficiently  modeling composite action under cyclic load reversals.   Experimental data and simplified models based on the component  method will be developed for T-stubs.  These connection models,  along with the elements developed to take into account composite  action, will be used in parametric studies to define code-type  design rules for structures with a wid e variety of PR-CC  connections.  ***",
