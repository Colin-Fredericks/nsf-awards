 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is studying software development methods to develop  general techniques that can be used to parameterize specific  instances of these methods into general methods. These general  methods will be evaluated in a series of experiments in order to  develop an experience base of such knowledge.  Software  development in the future will be based upon reuse of existing  products in a variety of forms. This work provides insight into  the relationships between reading and writing, analysis and  construction.  The research focuses on:  1. Developing families of techniques based upon understanding the  various documents used in a software development in order to (a)  evaluate the document itself, e.g., to report defects in the  document, and (b) construct other documents using an original  document as a baseline, e.g., to develop a new product based upon  reuse of prior products using the earlier documentation as a  guide to the new development.  2. Developing a set of evaluation methods that can be used to  assess technologies in the laboratory and in industrial settings.  3. Building an Experience Base of technique evaluations that can  be accessed by others, who can append their own experiences with  those techniques.",
