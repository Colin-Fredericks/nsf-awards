 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Abstract  This project examines affirmative action, the racial and gender composition of police forces, and the resulting impact on arrest patterns and crime rates. We focus on three specific questions:  1) How has minority representation with police departments changed over time and to what extent are affirmative action programs responsible? To address this question data on police department minority hiring and retention gathered over a twenty year period by Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), but not previously used in empirical research, are combined with a database on city-level affirmative action litigation and policies.   Findings suggest that, on average, the racial composition of police forces today in large U.S. cities is twice as representative as was the case in the 1970s. Even as early as 1975, however, the flow of new hires by police departments nearly matched the racial composition in large cities. The fraction of female police officers has risen, but remains well below that of the population as a whole. The affirmative action litigation data set helps to distinguish the influences of nationwide legislation from litigation aimed at particular police departments.  2) Does the racial or gender composition of a police force have any impact on the department's ability to fight crime? For instance, do improvements in police-community relations engendered by an increased minority police presence lead to lower crime rates, or a higher fraction of reported crimes cleared by arrest? Using panel data for roughly 100 large U.S. cities, preliminary estimates suggest a strong negative correlation between crime rates and the number of black and female police officers in a city. The relationship between white or male officers is much weaker.   3) Are patterns of arrest affected by the racial composition of the police force, and if so, does this provide evidence of discrimination? Past studies have found evidence of more unfounded arrests of blacks than whites, but have been unable to link this phenomenon to the race of the police officer. Analysis of this question at the individual level, however, is complicated by the non-random assignment of police officers to patrols. The use of aggregated city-level data potentially ameliorates this sample selection problem. This question is assessed empirically using the city-level data.                                             \u00f1\u00ab^\u00ac\u00bc\u00ac+^\u00fa\u00e1\u00bc\u00f1^|<",
