 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614040  Kleinman  This grant supports theoretical work on a variety of  condensed matter systems incorporating both improved  analytical approximations as well better computational  techniques.  The physical phenomena under investigation  include: response of Mg lattice parameters to pressure,  crack propagation as a function of applied strain in Si  using an almost first-principle calculation of internal  forces and electronic energy levels in a ferro-para-ferro  magnetic sandwich using a highly effective pseudopotential  for transition metals developed earlier by the PI.  Finally  there is a project to study magnetism in thin films and at a  surface using sophisticated electronic structure  calculations.  %%%  The research of this senior PI has been  for a long time  geared towards improving both the conceptual and  computational foundations of  electronic structure  calculations.  In the current grant the program continues  with special emphasis on magnetism and on the details of  failure mechanisms in metals.  All of these projects involve  state of the art techniques and attempt to remove the  current disagreements between theory and experiments. How  does one understand the terminal velocity of a crack as it  propagates through a metal?  When is a thin film of a  transition metal, which is magnetic in bulk, remains  magnetic when put on top of a noble metal as a film?  ***",
