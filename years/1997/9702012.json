 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Williams, Brian    The Akron Public Qchools CPMSA project is intended to improve the  achievement  of  all students in mathematics and science  and  to  significantly  increase the number of African  American  students  who  are  prepared for university studies in mathematics, science  and related fields.    Recognizing  that the key to student achievement is an  excellent  teaching  force,  the project will concentrate on  improving  the  instructional strategies of all teachers with emphases on content  training  for  elementary teachers and secondary mathematics  and  science  teachers.  This initiative is based on the understanding  that   systemic  reform-  in  a  large  urban  setting  must   be  accomplished building by building and cannot be superimposed on a  staff.    A  leadership  team  from  each  school,  including  parents  and  administrators, will be trained to conduct action research  aimed  at improving student achievement in mathematics and science.  The  plan  takes  advantage  of  extensive state  and  locally  funded  initiatives to 1  enhance the use of technology to improve teaching and learning.    This  project will attempt to overcome the barriers  to  minority  achievement  and obstacles presented by poverty  by  providing  a  system  of student support including summer institutes and career  exploration,  Saturday  enrichment  programs,  facilitated   peer  support, individual tutoring, exposure to real-world applications  of math and science and increased parental involvement.",
