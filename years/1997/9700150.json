 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: John Goldthwaite      The project will develop resource materials to assist science  teachers provide students with disabilities the ability to  participate in the conduct of science laboratory experiments.  Staff from Georgia Tech's Center for Rehabilitation Technology  will work with the institution's Chemistry and Physics  Departments in setting up twelve computer controlled lab  experiments that are representative of first year chemistry and  physics lab exercises.  Staff will  test the combination of  computer access  and computer controlled laboratory technology  and develop a resource guide that will permit teachers to learn  to operate these technologies independently.  The resource guide  will provide teachers the information they need for modifying  existing labs and for operating computer controlled systems.  It  will also cover use of computers equipped with software needed by  blind, visually impaired and mobility impaired students.  The  project's activities and resulting resource guide  should be  valuable as well to the many schools that do not have modern  science laboratories.  Many teachers are developing simulations  of laboratory experiments to use as supplements to, or  substitutions for, chemistry and physics laboratory experiments.  Although simulations are not a replacement for fully accessible  laboratories, they may be a good alternative in the absence of  well-equipped laboratories, and they should be appropriate for  some students with severe disabilities who would not otherwise be  able to participate in laboratory experiments.  Project staff  will identify and document existing laboratory simulations and  low tech tools and techniques for making laboratory experiments  accessible.  Staff will test a sample of twenty simulation  programs with computer access software to be sure that the  simulations are fully usable by students with disabilities.  The  resource guide will contain a comprehensive list of these  simulations and other low tech tools and techniques  used as  laboratory accommodations.",
