 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704765  Jones       The Borel Conjecture states that any aspherical closed manifold  should be topologically determined by its fundamental group.  This  research project will provide a new geometric tool that will enable  the investigator to verify this conjecture for any aspherical closed  manifold whose fundamental group is isomorphic to the fundamental  group of a non-positively curved Riemannian manifold.  The geometric  tool consists of a generalization of the geometric collapsing theory  developed by the geometers Cheeger-Fukaya-Gromov and others.  In this  project L. E. Jones (in collaboration with F. T. Farrell) will develop  a collapsing theory for foliated Riemannian manifolds.       A \"two-dimensional manifold\" is a \"space\" that looks exactly like  the Euclidean plane to an observer near any point in the space, but  which when observed as a whole may not be Euclidean space at all.  For  example the earth's surface looks like a flat plane if we are actually  on its surface, but when observed from space, it is seen to be a  sphere.  Two-dimensional manifolds were already well understood by  mathematicians of the 19th century.  There are also 3-dimensional  manifolds, 4-dimensional manifolds, etc., manifolds that are less well  understood; in fact, the mathematician's quest to understand higher  dimensional manifolds has motivated much of the topological research  of the 20th century.  One way to investigate the nature of a manifold  is to focus on an associated algebraic object (that is much easier  to understand) called its \"fundamental group.\"  A famous mathematical  conjecture states that for a special class of higher dimensional  manifolds (called \"aspherical manifolds\"), the fundamental group should  act like a genetic code for the manifold, revealing all of its inner  topological secrets.  The aim of this project is to verify this  conjecture.  ***",
