This grant, part of  a collaboration between two groups at the University of New  Mexico and at the University of Missouri-Rolla is  to  support research on this subject.  The primary issues, to be  addressed are the effects of disorder and high electric  fields on carrier motion in polymeric films.  The specific  projects include, inter alia, the identification of the  charge carriers, study of the field induced traps,  determination of the time and length scales for the  equilibration of carriers following photoexcitation and  several other issues necessary to clarify the physical  mechanism behind the phenomena.  %%%  Xerography and electroluminescent display devices use doped  molecular solids (for example polymer films).  The basic  physical phenomena involving photoconduction, i. e. charging  and currents following absorption of light,  contains  several unanswered  questions.  This grant is to support  theoretical  work  to elucidate the fundamental processes  which account for the phenomena,  and possibly to help  design materials which are better photoconductors.  The  grant is being awarded to two groups, one at the University  of New Mexico and another at the University of Missouri-  Rolla for a collaborative enterprise.",
