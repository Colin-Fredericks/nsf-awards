 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    CMS 97-29780    \"Urban Approaches Open Forum\"    Dr. Bernard Ross, American University        This award is made to the Department of Public  Administration at American University to develop, implement  and manage an \"Urban Initiative - Urban Approaches (UA) Open  Forum.\"      The Open Forum will convene both researchers and a wider  spectrum of urban partners - those who educate, implement,  manage, regulate, and support the people and systems which  contribute to the quality of urban life.  The invitees will  include representatives from federal, state and municipal  agencies, public and private sector service providers,  professional organizations and research institutes, and  political and community leaders.  The Open Forum will focus  on current and planned approaches to urban system's  management,, identification of opportunities for research  connections, knowledge mining from existing data resources,  development of a set of research needs, which will evolve  into a long-term UA vision for the 21st century.      The goal of the Open Forum is to achieve a different form of  integration - a vertical integration among the interests of  researchers and the needs of those who look to the  researchers for answers to their problems.  It is  anticipated that the Open Forum will include a dialogue with  concentration on current and planned approaches for  integrated research and education on the urban environment  and providing vision and recommendations for future  research.  Thus, the Open Forum will enhance the design of  efforts to build upon, support, and complement the efforts  of UA stakeholders.      Among UA-related research topics scheduled for discussion  are urban sprawl and sustainability; urban brownfields;  urban infrastructure; regional governance and urban  politics; \"urban\" as a spatial unit of analysis; urban  education and public-private partnerships.  The challenge of  the Open Forum is to provide an open environment in which  researchers and practitioners feel at  ease discussing  research needs which transcend disciplines and sectors.  The  emphasis will be on how the practitioners can inform the  research process, and how some of the nation's best scholars  can respond to a cogent statement of perceived needs as  identified by a cross-section of practitioners.        ***",
