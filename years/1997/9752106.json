The College seeks to attract minorities and women as nontraditional entrants into this skilled technology arena.  Preparation for employment requires adequate teaching/demonstration equipment and materials of a high technological nature.  Also required are students who have preparation in the various fields of mathematics and physical science needed to understand the principals being applied to this highly sophisticated application. Planning activities focus on curriculum needs, project evaluation, setting up industrial partnerships, strategies for encouraging participation by students underrepresented in science, mathematics, and technology, and utilization of extant materials and programs in mechanized agricultural technology.",
