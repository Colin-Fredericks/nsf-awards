 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program supports Professor Yves F. Rubin of the   Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California,   Los Angeles for his studies of novel tetrathiafulvalene-based two- and   three-dimensional charge-transfer materials.  Alkyne groups are used to   link tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives into two- and three-dimensional   arrays in which both increased side-by-side contacts between molecules   and conjugation through the alkyne pi bonds are expected to alter the   charge-transfer properties of the TTF moieties.  The potential   conductivity, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism of these materials   will be examined.  With support from the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Yves F. Rubin   of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of   California, Los Angeles is exploring the synthesis and properties of   molecules designed to display unusual physical properties.  Working from   a basic structural motif in which two adjacent molecules undergo the   partial transfer of charge from one molecule to the other, Professor   Rubin links the two interacting molecules into a variety of two- and   three-dimensional structures.  Use of a carbon-carbon triple bond as the   linking group facilitates the interaction between the two molecules.  The   resulting materials are expected to display unusual electrical   conductivity and/or superconductivity as well as magnetic properties,   offering to shed light on these important phenomena.",
