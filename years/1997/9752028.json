 "awd_abstract_narration": "The MATE Center is coordinating and facilitating the development of a modern, national program for marine technology education and training involving high schools, community colleges, technical schools, and four-year colleges.  The Center, focusing on program development at the community colleges, emphasizes intensive interactions between educational institutions and industry, military, government, and labor organizations. The Center focuses on the areas of marine technology in which the current and future needs of the Nation and employers are unlikely to be met by the existing educational system.    The goals of the Center include : (1) Development of a national consortium of the major stakeholders in marine technology and marine technology education; (2) Development of National standards and an assessment of job and educational needs for major branches of marine technology; (3)Development and distribution of new and existing curricula and instructional materials; (4) Provision of unique educational opportunities for students and technicians; (5) Provision of professional development opportunities for faculty; and (6) development of ongoing funding and in-kind support to sustain the Center beyond the period of NSF funding.    The major products of the MATE Center include: (1) A national MATE Center and regional MATE Centers composed of a consortium of school districts, community colleges and technical schools, universities, and industrial, scientific, and government partners; (2) Curriculum materials for specific marine technician job categories; (3) Assessment of skill requirements and development of standards for specific marine technician categories leading to standardized certificates and degree programs for marine technicians; (4) An accreditation mechanism for marine technology educational programs; (5) Summer institutes and internships in marine technology for students, faculty, and technicians (6) Models for student recruitment and retention; (7) A clearinghouse for dissemination of c urricula and information on certificate and degree programs, faculty development opportunities, and technician job placement; (8) A directory of information about existing marine technology education programs and their articulation strategies with high schools and universities; (9) Newsletters to disseminate MATE Center products and announce MATE Center activities.  The MATE Center is having a major impact on the education of marine technicians in the Unites States.  In doing so, the Center contributes to the nation's national security needs and its economic competitiveness.",
