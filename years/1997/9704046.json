 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Building better speech recognizers requires augmenting n-gram  grammars with sophisticated yet probabilistic linguistic  knowledge.  This project is building probabilistic models of two  important pieces of syntactic/semantic knowledge: verb-argument  constraints and semantic text coherence.(1) Verbs place strong  constraints on the syntax and semantics of their arguments.  This  project is computing probabilities for the different argument  structures that can co-occur with different verbs, and using  these probabilities to augment standard trigram language  models.(2) Texts and discourses tend to be semantically  coherent;in particular the words that occur in a text tend to be  semantically related to each other.  This project is applying a  model of word meaning called Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to  ASR LMs.  In LSA, a word-similarity metric is defined by  computing a large matrix of word co-occurrence probabilities,  which are then smoothed via Singular Value Decomposition,  resulting in a generalized measure of semantic word-similarity.  Trigram models can then increase the probability that similar  words will occur near each other.  Building these two stochastic  models of linguistic knowledge, besides possible application in  speech recognition LMs, word-sense disambiguation, or parsing,  also helps bridge the gap between the structural models used in  linguistics and the statistical models of speech engineering.***",
