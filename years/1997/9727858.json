 "awd_abstract_narration": "The third Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB), will be  held January 4-9, 1998 in Maui, Hawaii.  PSB brings together  top researchers from North America, the Asian Pacific  nations, Europe and around the world to exchange research  results and address open issues in all aspects of  computational biology.  PSB provides a forum for the  presentation of work in databases, algorithms, interfaces,  visualization, modeling and other computational methods, as  applied to biological problems, with emphasis on  applications in data-rich areas of molecular biology.  PSB  attracts a balanced combination of computer scientists and  biologists, presenting significant original research,  demonstrating computer systems, and facilitating formal and  informal discussions on topics of importance to  computational biology.  Papers and presentations are  rigorously peer reviewed and are published in an archival  proceedings volume which will be indexed in Medline by the  National Library of Medicine.    PSB is designed to be maximally responsive to the need for  critical mass in subdisciplines within biocomputing.  For  that reason, it is the only meeting whose sessions are  defined dynamically in response to specific proposals each  year, organized by leaders in emerging subdisciplines and  targeted to provide a forum for publication and discussion  of research in biocomputing's \"hot area\".  This proposal is  to be specifically used for funding participation and to  provide a computing environment an internet connection  locally for the conference.",
