 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703020  Abdullah  The dynamic responses of structures can produce situations that  can range from uncomfortable to unsafe for the building  occupants.  In recent years, control theories and technologies  have been used to reduce the dynamic responses of tall civil  structures.  Most optimal control algorithms involve full state  feedback control.  This type of control requires good estimates  of the velocity and displacement throughout the structure.   However, there are several important advantages of output  feedback control: it requires less computational effort and has  the robustness of a passive system.  In the research conducted  under this CAREER award, control algorithms will be formulated  for the optimization of feedback gains and controller placement  for flexible continuous and discrete structures, such as tall  buildings.  Tall buildings are of particular interest because the  control devices must be placed at floor level.  The fundamental  basis for these algorithms is the calculation of the gradients of  the performance function with respect to the gain and placement  matrices.  For the optimal placement of controllers at discrete  locations in flexible continuous structures, a mixed-integer  method will be used to optimize the placement and gains  simultaneously.  The effectiveness of the algorithm will be  demonstrated for stochastic wind loads in the frequency domain  and for deterministic earthquake loads in the time domain.  The  educational component of this CAREER award will involve creating  Web-based modules for use in graduate and undergraduate courses  to demonstrate the concepts of structural dynamics and civil  engineering control devices.  ***",
