 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past 15 years, there have been several  major conceptual and  practical advances in coding, modulation, and signal processing for digital  data  transmission and storage. These have resulted in the realization of  data rates approaching theoretical limits  for voiceband data modems; areal  densities approaching  one gigabit per square inch in disk-drives for  desk-top computers;  and, most recently,  end-to-end data transfer  reliability  achieved at signal-to-noise ratios only slightly beyond the  Shannon lower bound.  These advances include: the development of  trellis-coded modulation for bandwidth-limited channels;  the application  of  communication theory  to digital recording channels ; the emergence of  a  theory of  code design for input-constrained channels; and the  development of iterative, \"turbo\"- decoding techniques for long \"random\"  codes.  Despite this progress,  there remain many fundamental and practical  problems  that must be addressed, both to better our understanding of  existing approaches and their applicability, as well as to offer new tools  for use in building future data communications and storage and  communication systems.          This project will focus on problems in coding and modulation,  particularly  for application to  high density digital recording and  multi-user wireless communications.  The objective is to develop  coded-modulation techniques for efficient data storage and transmission in  the presence of various channel impairments, including:  input constraints,  inter-symbol interference (ISI), co-channel  interference (CCI),  additive  noise,  and signal fading.  A component of the research will be the  investigation of the complexity of algorithms and  architectures  that implement these techniques.          Another goal of the project  is  to enhance the educational  infrastructure by integrating the research results and relevant background  material  into existing and new  engineering courses at UCSD. Courses  will  be developed  on the topics of 1) Coded-Modulation for Data Transmission and  Storage, and 2) Symbolic Dynamics and Constrained Coding.    --",
