 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9660309  Bonney     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will determine the feasibility of significantly improving the process of validation and verification (V&V) for large-scale, software systems, which has traditionally required excessive amounts of paper documentation for specifications, architectural descriptions, etc. Lead times associated with the distribution of physical documentation results in the review of outdated documents and a longer V&V cycle. There has been a slow trend towards using World Wide Web technology for cataloging system documentation, but Web pages and links are manually generated, which leads to omissions. More importantly, a comprehensive view of the project cannot be gleaned from the Web pages as key elements of the system are not maintained in a Web-usable format.  The objective of the proposed research is the development of a prototype Web-based V&V tool that takes formal system requirements, specifications, and a project-specific intranet, generates a comprehensive Web of project-specific information, and periodically updates the Web to reflect changes. The research focuses on automatic Web generation and the incorporation of systemdesign parameters in the generation process.    The commercial product of the research, a software-based V&V toot would be marketed to corporate and independent V&V groups thorough existing distribution channels.  ***",
