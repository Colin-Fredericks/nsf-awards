The main tool is   simulation in an augmented probability model. For expected utility   maximization the original probability model on parameters and data is   augmented to an artificial probability model on decision variables,   model parameters and data. The augmented probability model is chosen   such that the marginal distribution on the decision parameters is   proportional to expected utility, and thus the mode of this marginal   distribution corresponds to the optimal design.  We develop novel   Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques amenable to simulation from this   auxiliary probability model and investigate algorithms for mode   estimation in a possibly high dimensional distribution based on a   simulated Monte Carlo sample.    The Bayesian framework provides coherent support for decision making   through an iterative cycle of problem structuring, uncertainty   modeling, preference modeling, expected utility maximization and   sensitivity analysis.  Recent computational developments in statistics   (the Gibbs sampler, stochastic substitution sampling) have   significantly widened the range of models used for uncertainty   modeling.  We study the use of these methods in other parts of the   decision making cycle, in particular expected utility maximization and   preference modeling.  The investigated methods are simulation based   and highly computational intensive and require state of the art   computer simulation, relating to the Federal Strategic Area of high   performance computing.  The impact of the research is to widen the   class of problems where expected utility maximization, i.e., formal   solution of decision problems, is practically feasible in a way   similar to how Gibbs sampling and related techniques have made complex   probability models accessible for uncertainty model ing.",
