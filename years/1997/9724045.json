 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724045  Schneider     Large depolarizations of a skeletal muscle fiber produce  high activation of transverse tubule (TT) voltage sensors,  causing massive release of Ca2+ ions via activated  sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release channels and  generating a global rise of cytosolic   Ca2+  or  \"macroscopic\" calcium transient. Using laser scanning  confocal microscopy and the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-  3, we have recently shown that if  the extent of voltage  sensor activation is drastically reduced, the large,  spatially uniform macroscopic calcium transients seen during  high activation decomposes into a stochastic population of  highly localized \"microscopic\" calcium transients.  These  very small amplitude, spatially and temporally discrete  calcium \"sparks\" appear to underlie the macroscopic calcium  transient in skeletal muscle, occurring in large numbers and  at high frequency due to activation of large numbers of TT  voltage sensors during large depolarizations.  We have also  found that similar calcium sparks can be activated at triad  junctions either by the TT voltage sensors or by myoplasmic   Ca2+ .  A fascinating and extremely exciting possibility is  that a calcium spark could be produced by the opening of an  individual SR calcium release channel or by a group of a few  channels that function as an integrated unit.  Thus,  characterization of the properties of individual calcium  sparks may now provide for the first time the possibility of  determining the open time and Ca2+ efflux rate of an SR  channel or of an integrated functional unit of a few  channels under conditions that maintain the normal  physiological control of the SR channels by the TT membrane  voltage sensor in skeletal muscle. The general objective of  the present proposal is to thoroughly characterize the  discrete SR calcium release events in terms of open time and  calcium efflux rate and to determine how these properties  vary with the mechanism and conditions of channel  activation.  The spatio-tem poral spread of fluorescence  within the myofibril-sarcomere during and after individual  calcium release events will be monitored at a higher time  resolution than previously available by using an acousto-  optic laser scanning confocal system.  The resulting high  spatio-temporal resolution calcium spark images will be  analyzed using computer modelling of the calcium binding,  transport and diffusion within the sarcomere to determine  the event open time and calcium efflux rate underlying each  spark.  These release channel properties will then be  characterized as a function of fiber depolarization to  determine possible effects of the level of TT voltage sensor  activation on single SR release event duration and calcium  efflux rates during physiological activation of skeletal  muscle.  We will also carefully test whether fiber  repolarization, which rapidly deactivates the voltage  sensors, can shorten the event open time of channels opened  by the voltage sensor.  The properties of ligand gated  openings will be compared with those of voltage sensor gated  openings in the same fiber to establish whether channel open  time is an intrinsic property of the release channel or is  determined by the mechanism by which the channel was opened.  The rising phase of the calcium sparks will be carefully  examined for possible evidence of secondary opening of  ligand gated channels by calcium ions released by a  neighboring channel directly activated by the voltage  sensors. The proposed studies are highly significant to the  basic understanding of control of calcium release channels  in skeletal muscle since they will provide the first  detailed characterization of the open times and efflux rates  of channels or integrated units of a few channels under  physiological control by the TT voltage sensor.  It is  extremely important to determine the extent to which these  properties of functionally coupled channels correspond to  those of channels studied previously in  reconstituted systems without volt age sensor coupling.  The  proposed characterization of single SR  channel properties in functioning fibers represents a major  technical and conceptual advance in the  understanding of intracellular calcium channels and the  activation of skeletal muscle.    Calcium ions regulate a wide variety of physiological  processes that are at the very basis of how living  systems move, respond to stimuli and regulate growth and  physiology. Rapid release and translocation of  calcium within cells mediates many of the responses  essential to life. This award will support research  that will allow direct visualization of the rapid release of  calcium in muscle fibers. The function of muscle  is dependent on regulation by calcium. The PI will examine  the interrelationship of the function of  membrane channels that conduct ions with the release of a  calcium pulse. In other experiments the  amount of calcium released during an event will be measured  and the distribution of calcium events in  response to intracellular and extracellular stimulation. The  results of this research will provide  fundamental information of a critical regulatory process of  all living cells.  ***",
