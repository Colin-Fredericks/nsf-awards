 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9723572  Willliamson and Schlegel          During the developent of the lymphocytes of the immune  system, some cells are created which are nonfunctional, and  others which react to normal body components.  These lymphocytes  are removed by a process of programmed cell death called  apoptosis, a series of changes which can be triggered by a wide  variety of circumstances, but which finally occurs by a common  pathway using machinery which is ready and waiting to be  activated in virtually all cells.  This pathway includes one step  in which the surface of the apoptotic cell is altered, and after  this surface change has occurred, the cell can be recognized as q  doomed cell by its neighbors.  Their response is to engulf and  consume the apoptotic cell before it has a chance to die and fall  apart (which can result in tissue damage).  The critical step in  the alteration of the apoptotic cell surface is a change in the  membrane which surrounds the cell.  This membrane is a two-  layered structure made up of phospholipids.  One of these,  phosphatidylserine or PS, is normally kept in the inner layer of  the membrane bilayer, facing the interior.  In apoptotic cells,  PS appears in the external layer of the membrane because the  membrane enzyme which normally keeps it inside is turned off, and  a new enzyme is activated which allows it to move to the cell  surface.  This project will study these events in lymphocytes  which grow in culture and in which apoptosis can be triggered.  The object of these studies will be to try to understand how the  changes in the arrangement of PS are induced.  Other studies have  suggested that degradative enzymes (the ICE proteases), changes  in the energy producing organelles (the mitochondria), or changes  in the amount of calcium inside the cell may be necessary for  apoptosis to occur.  These studies will determine whether these  factors must be involved to change the distribution of PS in  apoptotic cells.   In addition, these studies will investigat e  how other kinds of cells recognize the PS on the surface of the  apoptotic cells after it has appeared there.  %%%    This research is looking at changes that occur in the cell  membrane during apoptosis, programmed cell death, and the  mechanisms responsible for these changes.  ***",
