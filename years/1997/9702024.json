 "awd_abstract_narration": "In conventional magnetic and optical recording, data is stored by  saturating the media in one of two states.  In M-ary recording, more than  two recorded signals are used, allowing for larger storage capacity and  higher data transfer rates.  A number of M-ary recording channels are being  developed for optical recording  and a good deal of work has been done by  the PI and others in this area.    The primary objective in the research  plan is to move to the next level in the understanding, modeling and  analysis of channels, codes and signal processing for M-ary recording  channels.  The research plan addresses fundamental limits of M-ary  constrained recording channels and new coding approaches which seek to  achieve them.  The teaching plan seeks to increase the number of trained  engineers in signal processing and communications for recording and  emphasizes close connection with and feedback from industry.     The specific research and educational objectives are:  1) To integrate  communications and optical models to better characterize the fundamental  limits (i.e. channel capacity) associated with optical (both binary and  nonbinary) recording channels.  2) To develop new methodologies for code  design for M-ary channels whose constraints are typically difficult to deal  with.  3) To develop new modulation codes for M-ary recording channels  which exploit their three dimensional nature.  4) To develop new  educational approaches that emphasize the interrelation of system  components and help develop a broader perspective. 5) To emphasize  interaction with industry and to take advantage of undergraduate and PhD  co-op programs.   6) To continue developing outreach programs for  encouraging research careers for undergraduates.     The proposed research and educational activities will:  1) Educate and  train a core group of researchers in the emerging area of M-ary recording  both in fundamental limits and practical systems implementations.  2)  Result in modulation codes that are c onceived and designed from a systems  and practical perspective and achieve the largest known information density.",
