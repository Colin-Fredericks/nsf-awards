 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Smith, Searetha    City Demographics  The  City  of  Richmond, encompassing 62.5 square miles,  is  the  nucleus  of a metropolitan area of approximately 865,000  people.  The  city,  a  blend of the old and historic  with  the  new  and  modern, is the corporate headquarters for nine Fortune 500 firms,  a  sophisticated arts and cultural community, public and  private  institutions of higher education, and a strong sense of community  volunteerism.    Richmond is considered to be at the \"hub of a learning community\"  where  opportunities for mathematics, science, and  technological  development  abound.   There  are  six  institutions  of   higher  learning  located  in  the Metro Richmond area,  along  with  the  Mathematics  and Science Center (MSC), the oldest  example  of  a  regional  partnership.   The MSC is  a  sphere  of  discovery  of  approaches,   abilities  and  interests  that  inspire   lifelong  learning  or  a  career  choice.  \"Alumni\"  include  astronomers,  physicists, pilots, and teachers, many of whom return to teach in  Center programs.    On  a less positive note, Richmond has the highest population  in  the  state  of  youth  living  in poverty  (30  percent  live  in  households  receiving  Aid to Families with Dependent  Children).  This  is four times higher than the state average, over twice  as  high  as  any  other urban area in the state.  The percentage  of  Richmond's youth under 17 in single parent households (43.2%)  is  more than twice as high as the state average, and higher than any  other urban area in the state.  Approximately 13 percent of youth  ages 16 to 19 are not enrolled in school.    The higher skill levels required by many of the jobs available in  Richmond, and a dependence on public transportation by residents,  have contributed to an unemployment rate which is twice that of  the surrounding counties.    School System Demographics  During the Summer of 1996, Richmond City Public Schools completed  Phase I of its curriculum revision in the  areas of mathematics  and science.  Teams of teachers completed a framework that is  aligned to Virginia's Standards of Learning for Mathematics,  Science, and Technology.    Mathematics Curriculum  The elementary mathematics curriculum focuses on Number and  Number Sense; Computation and Estimation; Measurement; Geometry;  Probability and Statistics; and Patterns, Functions and Algebra.  Middle school curricula extend the math strands and students take  pre-algebra and algebra at the 7th or 8th grade level.  High  school courses include Algebra 1, Algebra 11, Geometry, College  Algebra & Trigonometry, AP Calculus, and SAT Mathematics.  Other  courses offered presently include Basic Algebra, Geometry, and  Consumer Mathematics.            Science Curriculum    The science curriculum focuses on Scientific Investigation;    Force; Motion and Energy; Matter; Life Processes; Earth/Space    Systems; and Cycles and Change.  Middle school curricula extend    the science strands and students take General Science, Life    Science and Physical Science as an integrated course.  High    School courses included Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science,    Biochemistry, AP Physics and AP Chemistry.",
