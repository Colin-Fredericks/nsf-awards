 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates computer support for learning, working, and   collaborating.  It focuses on communities of practice (such as local  area network   managers and research teams) as subgroups within and across organizations. It involves   work with specific communities to study their actual and potential learning processes.   Based on the interpretation and assessment of these observations and theories from the   research literature and previous work the project will develop and articulate a new   conceptual framework for computational support of organizational learning. The research   issues to be addressed include (1) how to capture knowledge and integrate the contexts of   work; (2)how to sustain timeliness and utility of evolving information, and (3) how to   deliver relevant information actively and adaptively. To assess and develop this   framework, organizational memories will be created in collaboration with these   communities, that include  (1) mechanisms to capture and represent task specifications,   work artifacts, and group communications;  (2) facilities for practitioners to reorganize   and sustain the usefulness of the memory; and  (3)techniques of access and delivery for   knowledge relevant to current tasks,. The project will extend emerging WWW   technologies with structured web-site interactivity, version control of evolving   information, software critiquing agents, and end-user programmability.  Finally, the   memory and learning prototypes will be assessed in naturalistic settings.",
