 "awd_abstract_narration": "The notion of chaos and its accompanying consequences  have had a profound impact on our view of a number of  phenomena in the macroscopic or classical world.  However,  the extension of these ideas to the microscopic quantum  world largely remains a mystery, especially as a  correspondence between classical and quantum phenomena is  expected to exist.  What is established is that exclusively  quantum effects are seen in classically chaotic systems,  behavior collectively designated as quantum chaology.  Two  broad classes of `local` and `global` distinguish effects  which are, respectively, sensitive and insensitive to  details of the classical description.  In the proposed work,  these issues are considered in the context of a recent atom  optics realization of a simple dynamical paradigm.  Building  on earlier work with these experiments, one objective is to  study `local` mechanisms in this experimental context with  particular emphasis on contrasting quantum coherence in  systems with and without classical chaos.  The possibility  of a direct assessment makes this a novel realization.  This  would then provide a well-characterized system to assess the  interplay of local and global effects which has broader  significance to generic aspects in dynamics and non-  equilibrium phenomena.",
