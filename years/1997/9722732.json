Instead of one-way transformations to find an answer,      mathematical operations are meant to describe logical relations among elements      (quantities or variables). Given the gulf between arithmetic and algebra, it is no      surprise that students have enmrmous difficulties in algebraic problem solving.      Such difficulties seem to justify that instruction on algebra should only start when      children are about 12 years old. Only then are they required to leave aside the      direct arithmetical path and to focus, instead, on the extraction and representation      of relevant mathematical relations.            The contrast between children's difficulties with algebra in high school and      some successful attempts to teach algebra at earlier grades suggest that it is time to      consider deep changes in the elementary mathematics curriculum including the      possibility of having children discussing, understanding, and dealing with      algebraic concepts and relations much earlier than usual. But such changes      demand careful analysis of children's understanding about the logico-      mathematical relations implicit in algebraic rules, of their own ways of      approaching and representing algebra problems in different contexts, and of the      most adequate instructional models for initiating algebra instruction.            This project is a preliminary investigation of seven to eleven year-old      children's understanding of basic relations involved in dealing with equations in      different contexts. A total of 120 upper middle-class 7 to 11 year-old Brazilian      children participated in the study. Each child individually participated  in two of a      total of four tasks, each one containing 16 different items. Each task referred to one      of the four following contexts: (a) equivalence between weights on a two-pan      balance scale, (b) equivalence between quantities of discrete concrete objects, (c)      equivalence between quantities expressed in verbal problems, and (d) equivalence      between the two sides of written equations. For each item an equality was      established and the child was asked whether or not the equality would remain if      similar or dissimilar transformations were to take place on each of the two      compared amounts. They were also asked to justifty their answers and to use      whatever tools and representations they judged necessary to solve the problems.            The analysis of data already collected will provide a starting point for a      future analysis of how American children from different backgrounds understand      and deal with similar problems. With this study we hope raise new questions and      to frame new hypotheses for research concerning the development of algebra      activities in the elementary mathematics curriculum.
