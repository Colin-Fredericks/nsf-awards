 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conceptually, an image recovery problem can be reduced to a constrained  minimization problem.  In practice, however, the efficient implementation of  standard optimization algorithms often encounters serious difficulties due to the  complex nature of recovery problems, which not only involve a sizable amount of  data and unknowns, but also a wide variety of constraints.  The goal of this  research is to develop, analyze, implement, and test a eeneral convex  minimization algorithm that addresses the specific numerical difficulties posed  by image recovery.  The basic principle is to decompose the original problem of  minimizing over a complex feasibility set into a sequence of simpler  minimizations over the intersection of two larger half-spaces.  The bundle of  constraints is disintegrated into elementary components and, at every iteration,  the half-spaces are constructed by activating in parallel a block of approximated  (linearized) constraints.  A wide range of constraints can thus be processed in  a flexible manner and, moreover, fast convergence is achieved thanks to  extrapolated relaxations.    The three major objectives of this research are to study the proposed constrained  image recovery algorithm and rigorously establish its convergence under very  general conditions; to investigate the numerical issues pertaining to its optimal  implementation in the context of high performance computing; to demonstrate  through extensive numerical testing its flexibility and numerical superiority  over existing schemes in a wide range of applied image recovery problems.",
