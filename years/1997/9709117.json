 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  ATM-9709117  Barron, Eric  Pennsylvania State University  Title: Evaluation of the Role of Climate-Vegetation Interaction  During Earth History    Vegetation distribution an d character are largely viewed as a  function of climate in most paleoclimate studies.  For this reason,  vegetation has been specified as \"globally uniform\" in the majority  of paleoclimate model experiments.  However, previous studies  indicate that inclusion of a dynamic surface vegetation is a  critical factor in climate model experiments.  This award supports  a project to utilize the wealth of exiting information and models  on biosphere-atmosphere interaction, modified explicitly to  maximize their application to earth system history, in order to  improve climate model simulations of past climates and to assess  climate sensitivity.  The major components of the study: (1)  evaluation of the climatic significance of vegetation character and  distribution, (2) evaluation and then selection of a vegetation  model, appropriate for paleoclimate study, for coupling to a  General Circulation Model (GCM), (3) development of a dynamic  interaction scheme for the climate-vegetation model, (4) evaluation  of the coupled model for modern climates, and (5) assessment of  model results for a variety of past climates.  This project  focusses on the assessment of three different types of vegetation  models, and will apply them to the Last Glacial Maximum, the  Miocene, the Eocene and the mid-Cretaceous.  This project will  enhance our ability to apply climate models to the study the earth  history, explicitly examine the importance of the terrestrial  system as a factor influencing climate, and contribute to our  knowledge of both past and future climate change.",
