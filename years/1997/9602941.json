 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biochemistry Division in the Department of Chemistry and  Biochemistry at the University of Colorado, Boulder will purchase a  state-of-the-art four channel 600 MHz NMR spectrometer with partial  support from the NSF Multi-User Biological Equipment program. This  instrument is required to perform multi-nuclear multi-dimensional NMR  experiments used in the solution structure determinations of  isotopically labeled proteins and RNAs. Triple-resonance  multi-dimensional NMR techniques now allow complete through bond  resonance assignment of proteins which means that the primary  bottleneck in solution structure determinations of the proteins (the  assignment of the resonances) can now be made much more unambiguously  and in much less time than previous techniques. The modern NM R  solution structure determinations of a protein requires isotopically  labeled protein and access to a triple-resonance instrument that has  pulse shaping and pulse-field gradient capabilities. The multi-nuclear  and multi-dimensional NMR techniques that have proved so successful in  solution structure determinations of proteins can now be applied to  structural studies of RNAs and protein-RNA interactions. This  additional NMR instrumentation is required to meet the demand for NMR  time arising from the recent expansion of the faculty (Dr. Wuttke) in  the Biochemistry Divisimn.     The requested instrumentation will vastly improve the NMR  capabilities and will accelerate research in the following areas:      - Solution Structural Studies of RNA and Protein-RNA Systems (Pardi)    - Development of NMR Techniques for Solution Structure Determinations  of RNA (Pardi)    - NMR Structural Studies of Cardiac Troponin C (Falke)    - Structural Studies of the Active Site of the Group I Ribozyme (Cech)    - Structure and Function of Catalytic RNAs (Uhlenbeck)    - Solution Structural Studies of the trans Acting Viral Proteins Tax,  pX and Their Complexes (Wuttke)",
