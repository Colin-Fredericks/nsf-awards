For this  purpose,  a  two-day  workshop  will  be  conducted at NSF headquarters  with  the  participation  of  about  50  scientists  and  engineers  to  identify important research directions and opportunities  in  interdisciplinary  macromolecular science  and  engineering.  This workshop is organized by a committee of six individuals  representing  academic and industrial  perspectives  on  the  subject,  and  having expertise in areas  such  as  physics,  chemistry, biology, and materials science and engineering of  macromolecules.   The  following  five  topics   have   been  identified  for study and debate among workshop participants  following  input from a broad cross-section of the technical  community: 1) novel macromolecular structures: synthesis and  function, 2) innovation in properties of polymeric materials  through   processing,  3)  the  solution  of   environmental  problems through macromolecular science and engineering,  4)  macromolecular  science  and engineering  at  the  interface  between  biological  and  physical  sciences,  and  5)   the  translation of macromolecular discoveries into technologies.  Additional issues to be studied by the participants  include  mechanisms   that   could  catalyze   the   scientific   and  technological      development     of      interdisciplinary  macromolecular  science and engineering, the industrial  and  international context, and very importantly the  educational  challenges  that must be faced.  In addition  to  five   sub  groups  of  6 to 10 participants to discuss each topic,  the  workshop  would include six plenary speakers on general  and  specific  issues, including P.G. de Gennes, a Nobel laureate  from  France recognized for his seminal theoretical work  in  polymer    science.    Followi ng    the    workshop,     the  organizing  committee  will  report  to  NSF  staff  on  the  recommendations    of   the    entire    group    and   will  subsequently  publish  a  final report.  %%%  This  workshop  is funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities  (OMA)  of the Directorate for  Mathematical  and  Physical  Sciences (MPS) and is also sponsored  by  Programs  and  Divisions  in  the Directorates for Engineering  (ENG),  Biological  Sciences (BIO), and Education & Human  Resources  (EHR).  ***",
