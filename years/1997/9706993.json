 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706993 Hummel  This project addresses spark processing, an exploratory method for producing light emitting porous silicon. Spark processing utilizes a plasma based discharge between electrodes, and represents an alternative technique to the more common anodic etching approach to producing porous silicon. The objective is to increase understanding of the properties of light-emitting, nanostructured materials prepared by spark processing through a study of mechanisms associated with processing parameters. Optimization with respect to key optical and magnetic properties carried out, and the development of relationships between nanostructure, properties, and conditions prevailing in the spark processing environment will be sought. Laser processing will also be employed in parallel with spark processing for comparisons, further property enhancements, and to gain insight into processing/property relationships of nanostructured materials.  %%% The project addresses processing research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge to important aspects of extremely small structured materials with implications for advanced electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry.  Additionally, the fundamental knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing greater understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
