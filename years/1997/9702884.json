 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arruda  9702884       The  research  component of this proposal is  concerned  with experimental testing, characterization and constitutive  modeling  of  polymers.   The strain  rate  and  temperature  dependent behavior of semicrystalline polymers is  not  well  characterized  nor completely understood.   Existing  models  for  semicrystalline  polymers have not  been  developed  in  conjunction  with  a  reasonable range  of  experiments  for  verification of actual material performance.  There are many  technologically important applications for  this  work,  the  relationship between polymer properties and part performance  is  one of today's major engineering challenges.  The PI  of  this  proposal  is experienced in the design, implementation  and   analysis  of  mechanical  tests  and  in   traditional  materials  science  characterization methods  for  polymers.  The  PI  has  also successfully developed internal  variable  based  constitutive models of amorphous (glassy and rubbery)  polymers  that  accurately predict their  three  dimensional  response.   The proposed work involves extensive  mechanical  testing  and  material characterization  of  semicrystalline  polypropylene  to relate the physical mechanisms  associated  with  deformation to experimentally observed results.  Also,  this   research   will  involve  internal   variable   based  constitutive  modeling of the strain  rate  and  temperature  dependent  behavior of semi-crystalline polypropylene.   The  goal  of  this work is a model that accurately predicts  the  experimental data.      The  specific objectives of the proposed study are:  (i)  to  gain  an  understanding of the important  and  prominent  deformation  mechanisms in polypropylene  over  a  range  of  strain rates and temperatures through mechanical testing and  characterization, (ii) to determine the state of deformation  dependence  of  polypropylene  through  tests  on  isotropic  specimens  in uniaxial compression, plane strain compression  and  tens ion, (iii) to study the evolution of structure with  straining and quantifying structural state, (iv) to  develop  an  internal  variable based, three dimensional constitutive  model  of the deformation response and (v) to implement  the  model  into a commercially available finite element  package  via a user defined material option for verification.    The  teaching  component is outreach to middle school  girls  designed  to  foster continued interest in math and  science  based  careers.   The planned activity targets  girls  at  a  critical time in their education process when they begin  to  start believing they no longer are good at math and science.  In  middle school they are surrounded by influences  against  math and ;science careers for women.  Girls fail to continue  to  elect  math  and  science courses in  adolescence  which  quickly  steers  them towards non-technical academic  paths.  To emerge from adolescence with confidence in their math and  science abilities, girls need more encouragement to continue  to  elect advanced math and science courses.  They  need  to  understand the many varied career opportunities that rely on  a solid math and science education.  To become women with an  interest  in  engineering careers, girls need to  see  women  succeeding in their engineering careers.  They need to  hear  from  women engineers about the aspects of engineering  they  found  appealing  when the women made their career  choices.  And they need to learn engineering principles from women who  are  enthusiastic  about  the  subject.   The  PI  plans  to  develop, implement and evaluate an engineering career module  that  engages women faculty and undergraduates  in  teaching  middle  school girls about engineering.  The module involves  the  PI going to middle schools in Washtenaw County,  MI  to  highlight   the  research  work  of  women  at  universities  nationwide.  It will provide opportunities for girls in  the  program  to  interact with these women through the  internet   and  email.   The girls in the program will also  engage  in  design projects utilizing hands-on, team learning strategies  that  are  attractive to girls.  The importance  of  problem  solving  in  society and the usefulness of math and  science  classes  for  future career opportunities will be  stressed.  Dissemination  plans  for  this  outreach  activity  include  enlisting   undergraduate  women   from   the   College   of  Engineering  at  Michigan  to  develop  similar  modules  in  various  engineering disciplines, and sending  the  packaged  modules  to  women  engineering  faculty  at  colleges   and  universities nationwide.",
