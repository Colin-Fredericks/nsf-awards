Better understanding of the low-level jet  could lead to better forecasts of severe weather within the Great Plains.        The Principal Investigator will use a combination of numerical modeling and   observational analysis to quantify the relative contributions of boundary-layer  processes and synoptic dynamical forcing in the formation of the Great Plains low-  level jet.  The effect of divergence induced by the low-level jet on mesoscale rainfall  systems also will be investigated.  The project will use data from recently  implemented observing systems and will adopt new strategies for isolating the  contributions of the various processes that lead to the low-level jet.  Emphasis will  be given to the examination of physical processes that have been indicated in  previous modeling studies as important for the low-level jet and its subsequent  effects on mesoscale precipitation systems, but have not yet been confirmed by  observations.  Accomplishment of the research will provide improvements in our  understanding of the fundamental issues in the dynamics of the low-level jet, and  will support improvements in the prediction of nocturnal rainfall in the Great Plains   region.    ***",
