Dr.  Bower will work with Dr. Yasunori Sakurai, Associate  Professor in the Faculty of Fisheries, on a research project  entitled, \"First Feeding and Nutrient Uptake by Para-Larvae  of the Squid Todarodes Pacificus.\"    The larvae of many soft-bodied marine invertebrates are  apparently capable of absorbing dissolved organic materials  directly from sea water to meet nutritional requirements.  The proposed research will build upon existing research and  examine if hatchling squids of the family Ommastrephidae can  transport amino acids from sea water.  Hatchlings reared  through artificial fertilization will be exposed to radio-  labeled substrates in a sea water medium to determine if an  increase in radioactivity in the sea water medium occurs.  To investigate the relationship between influx and net flux,  the uptake of amino acids will be measured by determining  the rate of removal of amino acids from solution by high-  performance liquid chromatography.  In addition, the  stomachs of field-caught hatchlings will be examined to  identify early prey.  At present, rearing ommastrephidae  young in captivity is the only way to study early stages of  life.  A further goal of this research is to develop a  method to rear ommastrephidae hatchlings for extended  laboratory studies.  If successful rearing methods are  developed, specific aspects of the early life stages of this  commercially important family can then be ascertained.  ***",
