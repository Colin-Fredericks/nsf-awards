 "awd_abstract_narration": "While Stark State College of Technology (SSCT) and many other community and technical colleges in the U.S. address the scientific and public policy dimensions of genetic research and the Human Genome Project in their curricula, it is imperative that we also focus on the technical dimensions.  These are necessary to foster a truly meaningful understanding of this rapidly expanding field of science which will have profound implications on all of our lives in the very near future and for many years to come.    SSCT students currently have no laboratory experiences related to molecular genetics.  Unfortunately, this is a common scenario at many two-year colleges.  With $7,114 of NSF-ILI funds, Stark State will develop the project, Incorporation of Basic DNA Laboratory Techniques into Science Courses at the Two-Year College.  With the purchase of DNA laboratory equipment, several laboratory experiences will be added to reinforce the lectures of two courses:  Principles of Microbiology and Organic & Biological Chemistry.  These courses are taken by students in the College's Nursing, Respiratory Therapy Technology and Medical Laboratory Technology programs -- who will be among the next generation of medical technicians in the U.S.    The primary objective of the project is to develop a greater understanding of molecular genetics, which will enhance students/graduates' ability to perform technician-level functions in science and health care settings, and participate in the discussion of developing issues related to human genetics.  Faculty involved with this project also will share their hands-on expertise with area high school and middle school teachers.  by expanding SSCT's capabilities in this area.  We will be positioned to share project outcomes with faculty at two-year institutions throughout the country.",
