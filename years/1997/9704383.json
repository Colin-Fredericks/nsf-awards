 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hattori  9704383    We discuss the three subjects that are related to materials science. They  are the phase transition problem, magnetostriction, and hydrodynamic models  of semiconductors. The phase transition problems are a fundamental problem  in physics and an important research area in engineering. Some of the  materials undergoing the phase transition are called ``smart materials.''  Typical examples are shape memory alloys. In the phase transition problem we  examine the compatibility of the entropy rate admissibility criterion and  the entropy condition. Then, we discuss the existence of global weak  solutions and numerical analysis. We need a careful analysis of the  interaction between phase boundary and elementary waves (shock waves and  rarefaction waves). I believe that this research will bring a better  understanding of the phase transitions. The magnetostriction is the  combination of wave equations for elasticity and the Landau-Lifshitz  equations for the magnetic moment. We can regard them as nonlinear wave  equations with rate equations, where the rate equations have a special  structure. This gives an interesting dynamics. We consider the traveling  wave solutions, the smooth and weak solutions, numerical analysis, and etc.  We also consider the Ericksen bar. Some magnetic materials undergo phase  transition. This research may bring an insight to it. Also, this research  may be useful to study the hysteretic behavior observed in some magnetic  materials. The semiconductors are important materials or devices in  industry. Recently, the hydrodynamic models are becoming more popular. The  equations we discuss consist of the hydrodynamic equations for electrons and  the Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential. We consider mainly the  stability of steady state solutions. The stability issue is an important  subject especially when there are multiple steady state solutions.    I study mathematical aspects of materials science. One goal is to have  better understanding of t he phase transitions. In phase transition problems  we discuss the change of various properties of materials due to change in  factors such as temperature. A typical example is water which changes to  vapor or ice depending on temperature. The phase transitions take place in  magnetic materials too. The phase transitions in magnetic materials are used  for various switching devices or recording devices. A very good example of  magnetic material is a videorecording tape. It is important to understand  the mechanisms of phase transitions so that we can construct better devices.  In some such materials, it is important to consider both elastic and  magnetic effects as both influence the ways in which the phase transitions  occurs. By elastic effects we mean the effects associated with compressing  or pulling the material. There are mathematical models describing the phase  transitions. I plan to study how various effects such as above influence  each other. I would like to study these mathematical models analytically as  well as numerically. I also study hydrodynamic models of semiconductors. In  these types of models we regard the electric current as ``fluid'' and study  how this ``fluid'' flows in semiconductors. Semiconductors are used in PCs  and other electric devices. To study how the electric current runs in the  semiconductors is very important and interesting. There are a few  hydrodynamic models depending on what kind of effects one wants to consider.  An important effect that has not been considered is temperature. I would  like to consider such effects.",
