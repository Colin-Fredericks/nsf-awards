 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nelson/Abstract  9703123         The goals of this project are:  1) to discover the physical  causes of snow crystal shape by the measurement of key surface  parameters used in crystal growth models, and 2) to improve  instruction in physical meteorology by introducing experiments into  a required undergraduate/graduate lecture course.         A new method of controlled ice crystal growth that was  successfully developed to measure critical supersaturations for  vapor growth on both basal and prism faces of ice above -16 degrees  Celsius.  The improvements are need to extend the range of  conditions measured, but will also increase control over the  crystal environment.  This method can be used for related  fundamental and applied studies in cloud physics with little or no  modification.         Five to six research quality experiments will be added to our  existing physical meteorology course for seniors and first-year  graduate students.  Each student would perform approximately 3  experiments per semester.  Experiments would be 2 hours long or  more and treated like a homework assignment.  The experiments will  be chosen to complement the lectures and faculty research projects  and therefore can be used for additional undergraduate research  with the appropriate professor when the equipment is available.   For example;  a simplified version of our ice crystal growth  apparatus could be used both for a laboratory exercise to  illustrate crystal growth and the different snow crystal shapes,  and for an undergraduate research project to measure the effect of  electric fields on the critical supersaturations for vapor growth  of ice.",
