This attribute, in addition to their  chemical and thermal stability, makes them suitable as catalytic supports,  particulate filters, membranes for micro- and ultrafiltration and as  integrated catalytic reactors.  In such situations, however, the poor  mechanical performance of these materials is likely to be a limiting  factor in the full exploitation and development of these technologies. In  particular, there is concern over the strength, fracture toughness and  thermal shock resistance.  Unfortunately, little is understood about the  factors that control fracture in these porous materials and thus, there is  a need for a scientific study that tackles this area in a fundamental and  generic way.  This is particularly important for the development of  materials with improved mechanical reliability.  In the proposed work, the  objectives are to explore some new techniques for processing porous  materials and to identify the microstructural factors that control the  strength and fracture toughness of these materials.  The technical  approach will involve 1) exploring new processing techniques, 2)  quantifying the microstructure of the resulting porous materials,  particularly contiguity and pore structure, 3) measuring a set of  mechanical properties (elastic constants, fracture toughness and strength)  and 4) evaluating or devising appropriate theoretical models that link the  pore structure to the mechanical behavior.  %%%%  Ceramics with moderate amounts of porosity are an important class of  materials that can make a significant impact in applications in which  their permeability plays a key role.
