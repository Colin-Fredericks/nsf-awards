 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrologic science is emerging as an exciting and crucial dimension of numerous academic disciplines.  It provides unique opportunities for students to discover how geoscience, the other natural sciences, mathematics, and engineering are linked by fundamental principles.  However, the lack of availability of standard hydrologic instrumentation for instruction within traditional geoscience and civil engineering departments constitutes a very real barrier to widespread implementation of active laboratories.  This project creates hands-on hydrology laboratories that enable students to discover fundamental physical and chemical concepts at all levels of geoscience and engineering education.  Problem-based field laboratories can provide a setting for students to integrate quantitative and qualitative knowledge gained from observations and to work together with colleagues across disciplines on dynamic aspects of environmental and geologic systems.  The program is designed to build scientific knowledge and confidence in problem solving over the 4 years of study.  The new equipment provides the critical instrumentation needed for development of these laboratories.  More than 1 ,600 students per year are affected by this project.  The new equipment fulfills an important step toward the larger goal of enhancing quantitative and interdisciplinary environmental education for undergraduates.  Products from research include (1) presentations describing laboratory development and implementation at geology and civil engineering society national meetings and (2) a manuscript describing an introductory-level laboratory using an inexpensive model aquifer. *",
