 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supporting the design and construction of interdisciplinary student projects for the three semester calculus sequence. This builds on Rockhurst's four years of experience as a major implementation site for Project CALC, the calculus reform program from Duke University. The focus of the development efforts is on the creation of well-defined projects which are more authentically connected (through introductory readings and carefully sequenced analytical activities) to their scientific disciplines. Additionally, projects emphasize the collection as well as the analysis of data using  technologies such as computer algebra systems, universal lab interfaces, and the Internet.    Dissemination of the projects and support of instructors using the materials are being accomplished by (1) a three-day summer faculty workshop entitled Interdisciplinary Projects for Calculus, (2) a dissemination network which includes distribution of the projects via FTP and the creation of an Interdisciplinary Student Projects for Calculus Website, (3) commercial publications, and (4) presentations and workshops at regional and national meetings.    These activities add quality interdisciplinary student projects to the collection of materials currently available for revitalized courses in calculus. The projects are distinguished by their careful attention to placing applications of calculus in their scientific context and by encouraging students to become more involved in problem solving through the collection and analysis of data.",
