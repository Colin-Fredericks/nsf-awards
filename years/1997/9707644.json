 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707644  Jackson    Prostaglandins are a family of cyclic fatty acids which are potent mediators of key physiological processes in a large variety of organisms. Prostaglandins are continuously synthesized in cell membranes by the sequential action of the key regulatory enzymes phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and/or phospholipase C (PLAC), and cyclooxygenase (COX).  PLA2 /PLAC mediate the release of arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids.  COX incorporates two molecules of oxygen into arachidonic acid concomitant with the cyclization of the carbon chain to produce prostaglandin.  Two genes are known to encode COX, a constitutive COX1 gene and an inducible, early-response COX2 gene.  This research will determine the molecular mechanisms that regulate prostaglandin synthesis at the level of the COX1 gene promoter and COX1 mRNA.  The education portion of this project includes using this research program to further develop the Biotechnology Program for non-traditional and minority students at Massachusetts Bay Community College, to develop a related Marine Biotechnology Program involving Massachusetts Bay Community College, the New England Aquarium in Boston, and The University of the Amazon in Brazil; and to develop a science enrichment program for primary school students and teachers in the Boston Public School system.  %%%  Prostaglandins are a family of cyclic fatty acids which are potent mediators of key physiological processes in a large variety of  species.
