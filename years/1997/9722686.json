 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major international conference on the study of  complex systems will be organized.  There is a new and  growing effort to understand systems formed out of many  interacting parts that display complex dynamic behaviors.  These include physical, chemical, biological, social and  economic systems as well as artificial (engineered) systems.  Researchers from diverse disciplines and different  perspectives are sharing knowledge, mathematical methods and  insights in order to advance the effort in all areas.       The new scientific effort to understand complex systems  has attracted significant public attention because it  addresses issues that include individual psychology,  dynamics of social and economic change, and ecology that are  of current concern.  Thus it can serve as a vehicle for  public awareness of the importance of science in society.       Various conferences have addressed aspects of these  growing efforts. However, this is the first major  international conference to bring the wide diversity of  researchers together, demonstrating the interdisciplinary  but coherent nature of these efforts.       The conference will be organized under the aegis of the  New England Complex Systems Institute -- a new educational  institution with participation of faculty from major  academic institutions in New England.",
