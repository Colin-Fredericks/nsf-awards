 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705740  FERRIS    The microscopic plant parasitic cyst nematodes are a widespread and important group. Some kinds are destructive pests on important crops such as potatoes, soybeans, and cereal grains, whereas other kinds inhabit natural ecosystems and survive in small numbers on native plants.  Much is known about these nematodes on a global basis, but the information is largely restricted to knowledge about their shape and form and about their plant host preferences.  Because nematodes are an ancient group with a highly conserved morphology, it is suspected that gross similarities may mask important differences among geographical isolates and make it difficult to determine relationships among the different kinds.      In this research, Virginia Ferris will use DNA sequence data from highly conserved nuclear genes, plus data from more rapidly changing mitochondrial genes, to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among plant parasitic cyst nematodes.  Molecular data will be of great help in identifying the different kinds of nematodes found in all countries of the world, including many that cannot easily be separated from each other by microscopy alone yet may have important differences in behavior or ability to parasitize plants.  Moreover, molecular data can help us to establish relationships, and to determine where different kinds originated and how they spread.  This may help us to learn why it is that some cyst nematodes are destructive pests on important groups, whereas others seem to be natural components of undisturbed ecosystems.",
