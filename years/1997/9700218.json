 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700218  Meo  This investigation will test the effectiveness of a modified total physical system, total life-cycle assessment (LCA) framework as a guide to the management of technological innovation of environmentally clean systems through a two-phase study.  The first phase consists of a retrospective analysis of a series of commercially successful gas turbine technologies and the management strategies that guided their development and application in different markets and system configurations.  In cooperation with the General Electric Company (GE), the investigators will construct a set of retrospective tracks that document key developments leading to GE's efficient combined-cycle gas turbine and its systems.  It is hypothesized that the environmental benefits that accrue from innovations in the design, manufacturing, and deployment processes can be adequately accounted for by a series of individual tracks.  The research on units upstream and downstream of the focal combination in any system is extremely important because any configurations that are especially environmentally unclean, costly to erect and/or operate, or profligate in energy consumption can markedly degrade the attractiveness of the focal units.  Transferability of the technologies, including GE's gas turbines and the fuel supply elements developed both privately and with government-sponsored research, represents a tremendous opportunity for generating power and mitigating environmental impacts in developed and less developed countries (LDCs).  In the second phase, the researchers will critically examine typical systems to identify core innovations and resulting configurations with respect to potential use by LDCS.  The studies will be carried out with GE and based on studies currently underway such as those at the Battelle Columbus Laboratory, the Institute of Gas Technology, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  These research findings will improve the understanding and application of an LCA framework to guide improve ments in environmentally friendly technology management, public and private sector R&D partnerships, and the development of innovative clean technology configurations applicable to a broad number of other industries.",
