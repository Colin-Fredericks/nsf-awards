 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9660022  Hodko     This project describes an innovative method for the formation of impermeable and/or reactive barriers in soil with possible applications in geo-engineering and environmental cleanup technologies. The installation of vertical subsurface barriers is standard practice in civil and mining engineering, however, methods for in situ construction of horizontal (bottom) barriers have not yet been satisfactorily developed. The primary weakness in all applications of horizontal barrier emplacement Is the inability of grouting contractors to completely define the extent and nature of the injected materials, i.e., verification of where the barrier material actually went. It is likely that the acceptance of any subsurface barrier technology in soil and groundwater remediation will depend on the ability to verify the barrier continuity. A novel approach for the formation of continuous horizontal and/or vertical subsurface barriers is proposed. An example of the formation of horizontal barrier which will be capable of containing and destruction of organic contaminants in polluted soil will be investigated. The feasibility of formation of cementitious impermeable subsurface barrier and two types of reactive permeable subsurface barriers will be tested.     The developed technology will be of considerable use to the Federal Government, as a cost effective method for the formation of both hydraulically impermeable and permeable reactive horizontal surface barriers for containment and destruction of organic pollutants in soil and groundwater.  Initial markets for the proposed technology could be repair and maintenance of subsurface landfill barriers, and treatment of polluted groundwater and soil at both industrial and military sites.  ***",
