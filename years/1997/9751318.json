 "awd_abstract_narration": "Defining the characteristics of a subsurface profile is a challenge that is unique to geotechnical engineering.  It is important, therefore, that aspiring geotechnical engineers have a knowledge of site exploration strategies and sampling techniques before entering professional practice.  In most geotechnical programs, students are taught these topics using textbooks and videotapes.  This practice is frowned upon by industry professionals since the students are unable to get a true feel for the work and thought involved in a typical site investigation.    A primary goal of the Geotechnical Engineering program is to integrate field testing procedures into the undergraduate curriculum using a hands-on approach.  The faculty believe that students must have a complete understanding of modern geotechnical exploration practices if they are to appreciate the judgment required in geotechnical engineering design.  This project provides a truck-mounted Mobile B-53 Explorer drill rig and accessories.  The drill rig and accessories complement and upgrade the Geotechnical Engineering program's field testing capability (cone penetrometer and flat-plate dilatometer field testing systems have been utilized) and allow the faculty to integrate field testing procedures in many different aspects of the undergraduate geotechnical curriculum.    The value and need of the proposed project have been recognized by the College of Engineering, the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, and the geotechnical engineering community.  All realize that a student with an understanding and appreciation of site exploration strategies is better prepared to effectively solve real-world problems upon graduation.    As part of this project, student preparedness, or the effectiveness of the proposed curricular improvements, can be evaluated by a team of practicing geotechnical engineers.  *",
