The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a nine-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. James C. Baygents of the University of Arizona  to work with Dr. Robert J. Hunter at the University of  Sydney in Australia.  Support for this project will be  provided by the U.S.-Australia Program of the Division of  International Programs.    This project will work to describe the dynamics of colloidal  particles in applied electric fields that vary with position  and time.  Equipped with a proper theoretical description of  the particle dynamics, one can then interpret the results of  experimental measurements on nonlinear electrokinetic  effects.  Electroacoustics is a procedure in which one  applies an alternating electric field to a colloidal  suspension.  Since most colloid particles are electrically  charged, they respond to this field by oscillating backwards  and forwards at the same frequency as the applied field.  This generates a sound wave, and it is by measuring the  properties of the sound wave that it is possible to obtain a  detailed characterization of the colloid particles.  Current  theory assumes that the applied field strengths are so low  that the particle response is linear.  Dr. Baygent's  research will extend the theories of these effects to take  into account the non-linear effects which would result if  the field strength is raised to much higher levels.  Sufficiently high fields should be able to orient the  particles along the direction of the field and this would  cause them to respond differently to an unoriented particle.  This added information could be used to obtain the charge  and size of the particles as well as their aspect ratio  (length to diameter)  if they are non-spherical.      ***",
