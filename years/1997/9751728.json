 "awd_abstract_narration": "This institution owns and operates an 85-foot research vessel, the R/V Vantuna. In addition to meeting the instructional demands of students enrolled in marine science courses, the R/V Vantuna is involved in educating and giving field-based experiences to students in teacher preparation programs.  Extensive educational outreach efforts aimed at K-12 and students in  2- and 4-year college programs in the area are conducted by this program. However, since the boat was initially outfitted 25 years ago, oceanographic sampling gear and methods of data analysis have moved well beyond its original capabilities. This project is augmenting the equipment on the boat with sophisticated electronic sampling and photodocumentation gear that allows students to learn state-of-the-art techniques and collect numerical and visual data to support integrative studies. The uniqueness of this project comes from the extended use of oceanographic data in linking field and classroom activities. Not only are many students, and especially future teachers, being given access to sophisticated equipment to learn modern oceanographic techniques, but the high quality data they collect is being made universally available for analysis through an extensive database. This approach is extending the value of the oceanographic experience beyond those groups traditionally served, and benefiting off-campus groups who can sample the database by searching the Internet.",
