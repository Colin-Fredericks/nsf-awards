 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project of the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in the   Chemistry Division with support for instrumentation from the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities, Prof. L. Ziegler of Boston University will   perform time-domain and spontaneous emission frequency-domain studies on   ultrafast dynamics of solutions and neat liquids.  The spontaneous   resonance emission of short-lived photodissociative molecules in   high-pressure gases (approaching liquid densities), liquids, and   supercritical phases will be analyzed as a probe of time scales of   solvation, optical dephasing and bath-induced nonadiabatic effects.    Classical Molecular Dynamics simulation and instantaneous normal mode   techniques will be used to analyze the experimental observations.  Two   extensions of femtosecond polarization spectroscopy, dispersed optical   heterodyne detected (OHD) birefringence and dichroism of transparent   liquids, will be developed.  The role of two-photon absorption resonances   in femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy will be explored.     Chemical reactions usually require the elevation of molecules to excited   states of energy.  Since the chemistry of molecules under conditions of   high pressure, in solution, or embedded in a solid matrix or in a cluster   is affected by their  environment, it is important to know and understand   these changes in order improve the technology based on chemical    reactions.  The research undertaken in this project will  provide a data   base and theoretical model for the reaction  kinetics and dynamics of   well characterized molecules which are embedded in a condensed phase   medium.  It also helps in the understanding of the outcome of many types   of light-initiated chemical events.",
