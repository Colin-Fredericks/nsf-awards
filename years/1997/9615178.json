 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615178  MEYER    Cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika, the oldest of the great African rift lakes, represent a paradigm example of unprecedented diversity in morphology, behavior, and ecology that occurred over a geologically-short period of time.  Lake Tanganyika cichlids display a complexity of differences in external shape and coloration, breeding systems, parental care patterns, and trophic specializations that are not found elsewhere.  Lake Tanganyika also is pivotal in the geographic history of eastern Africa, and undoubtedly served as the bio-reservoir from which ancestors to species in other African rift lake were derived.    The research to be carried out by Dr. Axel Meyer will employ nucleotide sequences from two different, mitochondrially-encoded genes and from three different, nuclear-encoded genes to investigate genealogical relationships among the twelve tribes (representing 170 species in 50 genera) of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika.  These DNA sequences will be used to generate a molecular scaffold that will provide answers to critical questions regarding the origin and diversification of the morphological, behavioral, and ecological specializations that characterize these fishes.  Answers to these questions have implications to the understanding of east African cichlids fish assemblages, and in a general sense, to understanding of adaptive radiation and biological theory.",
