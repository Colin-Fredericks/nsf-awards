 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT: CMS-9634747, Mishac Yegian, Northeastern U    Under dynamic excitation, slip deformations occur along a  smooth geosynthetic interface, thus reducing the energy  transmitted through the interface. As a result, geosynthetic  liners placed under the foundation of a constructed facility  can absorb seismic energy, and hence transmit smaller ground  motions to the overlying structure. This concept of using  geosynthetics for Foundation Isolation is similar to  mechanical isolators used in structural engineering. In  addition, using geosynthetic liners at different depths  within new slopes, embankments or hydraulic fills -- known  to be extremely vulnerable to liquefaction -- can reduce the  soil amplification effect on the ground motion, and the  liquefaction potential of loose fills. This concept is  referred to as Soil Isolation.    This research program investigates, through experimental and  analytical work, the technical feasibility, practicality,  and limitations of using geosynthetics for foundation and  soil isolation to mitigate earthquake hazard.    The scope of this research includes shaking table tests on  geosynthetics that show the best promise for foundation and  soil isolation. The experimental results are used to develop  and validate constitutive models that describe the dynamic  response of geosynthetic interfaces. Model tests on  buildings, fluid retaining structures and soil profiles are  conducted using a shaking table, and the results used to  develop procedures for the analysis of the dynamic response  of structures and soil profiles that are isolated using  geosynthetic liners.    The results are used to identify areas of need for further  investigation that will help to transfer the research  results to engineering practice.    The innovative concept of using geosynthetics to reduce  earthquake ground motion intensity, and to reduce  liquefaction potential, can be extremely cost effective and  a simpler alternative to conventional earthquake hazard  mitigation me asures.",
