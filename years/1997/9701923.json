 "awd_abstract_narration": "Career:  This research is designed to address two major problem areas in managing infrastructure deterioration, renewal, and rehabilitation.  First, environmental laws are changing faster than we can design and construct infrastructure systems.  Second, because of these rapid changes, there is a critical need for assessment technologies to evaluate economically `smart` infrastructure alternatives that can sustain changes in environmental laws through its life cycle.  The ultimate goal of the research is to use the proposed `sick building` application as a first to develop an innovative methodology that could give engineers and policy makers the support system that will provide infrastructure planners a fundamental assessment technology to quantitatively evaluate current and future infrastructure systems in light of scientific, social political (national versus local), fiscal, and environmental constraints.  The objective of this research is to develop an integrated quantitative and qualitative life cycle cost analysis assessment technology for cost benefit evaluation of `sick building` renewal and rehabilitation within environmental compliance constraints.",
