 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723945  McCarty  In photosynthesis light energy is converted to chemical energy, much of it in the form that can be used as food.  The synthesis of adenosine 5\u0131-triphosphate from adenosine 5\u0131-diphosphate and inorganic phosphate is an essential reaction in photosynthesis.  This energy requiring reaction is catalyzed by a remarkable enzymatic machine, known as the ATP synthase.  This enzyme is an aggregate of nine different proteins and a total of about 20 polypeptide chains.  Using biochemical and biophysical approaches as well as site-directed mutagenesis, the functions of the proteins in the chloroplast ATP synthase will be probed.  For example, the involvement of specific proteins in catalysis and in regulation of activity will be further defined.  Insights into the structure of the ATP synthase will also be obtained.  The ATP synthase is very stable, despite its complexity.  Noncovalent protein-protein interactions are responsible for this stability.  Which interactions among the proteins contribute most to the stabilization of the enzyme will be studied.    The proposed work has significance beyond reaching a further understanding of photosynthesis.  Mitochondria and the plasma membrane of some bacteria contain an ATP synthase that is similar to the chloroplast enzyme.  Thus, studies on the chloroplast ATP synthase are directly relevant to those on oxidative phosphorylation.  The investigation of the stability of the chloroplast ATP synthase also assumes importance in that it is an excellent model system for the study of protein-protein interactions.  Protein-protein interactions are fundamental to all of life\u0131s processes.",
