 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project by a student of cultural anthropology from Emory University will study how tribal communities in northern Mozambique that were displaced during the recent war have reconstructed those aspects of their social organization oriented around political authority.  Through a comparative analysis of two communities differently affected by the war, one having been displaced and then resettled, the other having been relatively unaffected during the violent period, the research will test the hypothesis that the resettled community will demonstrate more `open-endedness` or will reveal a greater range in its political authority.   This research is important because it will advance our understanding of the effects of resettlement.  Existing theories focus on the conservative tendencies of resettled groups.  The hypothesis will be tested through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, involving a household questionnaire, semi-structured elicitation of cultural models, life-history interviews, and an analysis of micro-interaction and conflict situations.  In addition to increasing our  understanding about the effects of resettlement on traditional communities, knowledge which will be important for policy makers, the project adds to the nation's expertise about this important area of the world.",
