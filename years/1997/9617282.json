 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the connections between the intellectual and cultural changes during the Chemical Revolution in France in order to illuminate the cultural and intellectual reasons why certain theoretical conclusions were reached, and conversely, the effect of those theoretical conclusions on the culture of chemistry in France.  The project aims to broaden the evidentiary and interpretive scope of current scholarship by including the host of savants who sought to propel chemistry forward to its revolutionary conclusions as well as those who tried to stem that revolutionary tide.  The study will chart the changes during the Chemical Revolution  along four integrated axes of historical analysis: communities, practices, institutions, and theories.  Thus, examination will be made of the competing groups in the chemical community and how these sub-communities interacted among themselves and with other intellectual and social groupings; the experimental, textual, and social practices that characterized the various chemical factions; the institutions in which chemists learned and practiced their science; and the intellectual agendas and theoretical commitments in play during the episode.",
