 "awd_abstract_narration": "9603860  Boyce    Evergreen conifers, unlike diciduous trees, must keep  their  foliage  alive during the winter.  In addition  to  freezing  stress, they must deal with drought, or desiccation.  A  lot  of  water  is  found in the winter environment,  but  it  is  usually  locked  up  as snow and ice and is  unavailable  to  plants.   Conifer foliage is adapted to minimize water  loss  during the winter; losses are replaced during above-freezing  periods,  when water stored in the wood melts and  can  flow  into   the  foliage.   Shorter  growing  seasons   at   high  elevations decrease foliar resistance to winter water  loss,  while  the  frequency and duration of warm  periods  in  the  winter  also  decreases.  Thus, the  amount  of  water  lost  increases, while the ability to replace it decreases.    Winter desiccation appears to cause alpine treeline in  some  places.   However, its role in setting the upper elevational  limits  of  conifers  that do not  extend  all  the  way  to  treeline  is  poorly  known.  This study  will  examine  the  foliar  winter water relations, or water balance,  of  three  important  New  England  conifers that  differ  in  location  preferences  and  growth strategies:   white  pine,  eastern  hemlock and red pine.  Our preliminary data suggest that the  older foliage in these species may experience damaging water  levels   during  the  winter.   We  will  use  physiological  measurements of trees collected near their upper elevational  limit  to determine desiccation stress.  These data will  be  coupled  with climatic data collected at the research  sites  to  predict water relations.  This approach may be  extended  to  other species and under conditions imposed by a changing  climate.",
