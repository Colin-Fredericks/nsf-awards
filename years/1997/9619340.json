 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619340  George  Nitric Oxide (NO) is a pervasive and physiologically active  molecule in mammalian systems, and has recently been  detected in the exhaled breath of humans.  The concentration  of NO in the exhaled breath changes in the presence of lung  disease.  The shape of the exhalation profile reflects the  underlying exchange dynamics of NO in the lung, and,  therefore, can be used as a tool to improve our  understanding of NO exchange dynamics and physiology in both  normals and those suffering from inflammatory lung diseases.  In addition, inhaled erogenous NO holds promise as a therapy  for diseases such as asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and  Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).  A gas  inhalation strategy can overcome many of the problems  associated with intravenous or aerosol administration of  drugs.  Currently, the limited information available  regarding the basic gas exchange dynamics of NO in the lungs  has been dominated by  experimentation with little attention  paid to modeling as a tool to understand the experimental  results.  Many inflammatory diseases afflict the smaller  airways (bronchioles) and alveoli which are essentially  inaccessible to direct experimental measurement.  Thus,  theoretical modeling provides an important avenue to  understanding the exchange process of gases within the  airway tree,  The goals of the project are to 1) develop a  mathematical of endogenous NO exchange in the lungs, 2)  validate the performance of the model using a series of  exhalation profiles under a range, of breathing conditions,  3) understand the effect of inflammation on the exhalation  profile, and 4) develop therapeutic strategies for using  erogenous NO as a therapy.  The proposal is well-balanced  between theory and experiment, and the results will provide  fundamental information related NO exchange dynamics in the,  lungs that will improve our understanding of both normal and  diseased lungs.  ***",
