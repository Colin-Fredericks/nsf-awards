One of the most  valuable tools used in the study of films and coatings is a  confocal scanning laser microscope (cslm) which provides the  ability to study films at various depths and \"ages\".  The  Center purchased a cslm shortly after the programs  initiation in 1990, and it has been used extensively since  then.  It has been key to over 100 papers during that span,  and has been a part of over 50 theses.  An outreach training  laboratory centered around the cslm is being developed.    The new unit will replace the original unit which is deemed  obsolete.  New features include the ability to use new  probes, 3-dimensional visualization of the data, optical  cross-sectioning and increased resolution and image clarity.  The instrument will be used for programs on bioremediation,  biocide efficiency, microbial-induced corrosion, oral health  care, etc.  ***",
