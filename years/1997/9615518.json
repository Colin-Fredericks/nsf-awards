 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently, Haiti is undergoing vital political, social, and  linguistic reengineering. A new definition of national identity,  one which takes into account the voices --silenced for too long--  of the non-elite strata of the population, is being actively  negotiated. Central to ,the social construction of Haitian  identity is the ongoing debate regarding the status and roles of  Haitian Creole (Kreyol) and French. Placed within this larger  sociopolitical context, this research is ethnographic and  sociolinguistic, designed to examine the social construction of  Haitian identity. Focusing on six Haitian teachers working in a  rural primary school, the use of different registers in Kreyol  both within and outside the formal setting of the classroom will  be studied. Using the language socialization paradigm, studies  will analyze how the language choices and language practices of  teachers interacting both with students and their own children,  and students interacting with peers, are shaped by local  ideologies of linguistic variation and how they intersect with  language ideologies held at the macrosociological level. In  addition to contributing an anthropological perspective on how  individuals assign meaning to their discursive practices, this  research will offer a case study of educational language politics  in a post-colonial nation of the Caribbean. It will also yield  empirical data in the largely unexplored area of register  variation in Kreyol. This project is funded jointly with the  Wenner-Gren Foundation.",
