 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT, WEYMAN      This proposal consists of several parts. They are all connected to   the study of varieties related to algebraic groups and representation theory.  The first part is to study  equivariant modules supported in  varieties related to algebraic groups, like determinantal varieties and  the closures of nilpotent conjugacy classes in simple Lie algebras.  The investigator proposes to investigate the Grothendieck  groups of categories of such modules and to apply these results to study  the coordinate rings of orbit closures by means of degeneration sequences.   The second part is the study of    singularities of generalized discriminants and resultants.   The investigator proposes to extend his classification ( with Zelevinsky )  of irreducible components of hyperdeterminantal varieties  to arbitrary homogeneous spaces for the reductive group.   The third part is concerned with representations of Z_2 graded Lie algebras gl(m,n).  The investigator proposes to study the connection of such representations with syzygies  of equivariant ideals in the polynomial ring of generic $m\\times n$ matrices.      The subject of this proposal is the study of the varieties related to classical groups.  In general terms they can be described as the varieties with a lot of symmetries.  These varieties play an important role in Commutative Algebra, serving  as basic examples and also providing links to other fields, like Combinatorics,  Representation Theory and Singularities. Historically many important  general theorems were proved first for these kinds of varieties.  The investigator proposes to study  the algebraic invariants associated to these varieties, in particular the structure   of equivariant modules supported in them.",
