The initial steps by which plants perceive and  transduce the ethylene signal have begun to be elucidated by  studies in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  From this work  it has been demonstrated that a family of ethylene receptors  exist in plants that are related to bacterial histidine  kinases.  Additional evidence indicates that downstream of  the ethylene receptors lies a MAP kinase pathway.  Thus,  signal transduction elements characteristic of both  prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems have been combined in a  single pathway. The proposed research is designed to  determine how the ethylene signal is transduced through the  receptor and passed to downstream elements in the signaling  pathway.       Ethylene receptors will be characterized in reference  to their bacterial counterparts.  The membrane location of  the ethylene receptors in plants will be determined by  biochemical fractionation methods.  The postulated kinase  activity of the receptors will be examined following  transgenic expression and purification of the protein from  bacteria and yeast. Purification of full-length ethylene  receptors from transgenic yeast will allow analysis as to  how binding of ethylene regulates kinase activity.  In  addition, the mechanism of action of the ethylene receptors  will be examined in detail by transforming mutant versions  back into Arabidopsis and determining how ethylene signal  transduction is affected.  Ethylene receptors are  hypothesized to function through a response regulator  protein that feeds into the MAP kinase pathway, and  potential response regulators have been identified in  Arabidopsis.  Their role in ethylene signal transduction  will be characterized by knock-out mutations and the ability  to interact with known elements in the pathway.  This wo rk  will clarify the early steps in ethylene signal transduction  and provide a framework for engineering modifications into  these steps.  Modifications of ethylene sensitivity will  enhance our ability to regulate such processes as abscission  and fruit-ripening in crops of agronomic importance.  In a  broader context, these studies will also help elucidate how  the bacterial histidine kinases have been adapted to  function in a eukaryotic system.    Nontechnical    The gas ethylene is a plant hormone that both signals and  induces a variety of responses including ripening and  senescence. The efflux of ethylene from some cells  stimulates the response of adjacent cells and plants.  Ethylene is widely used to induce ripening of some fruit  such as tomato and the interruption of ethylene production  has been shown to extend the shelf life of transgenic  tomatoes that are now commercially available. This project  will investigate the fundamental mechanism of how ethylene  is perceived by targeted cells. Ethylene is detected by a  protein on the surface of plant cells and signals the cell  to undertake the stimulation of a number of genes that  mediate the ripening and senesence response. This project  will elucidate the mechanism of signaling that occurs as a  consequence of ethylene detection. The elucidation of the  signaling mechanism for ethylene will be an important  advance in the understanding of the fundamental biology of  plants and it will present the prospect of producing new and  useful changes in food and floral crops to permit controlled  ripening and longer-lived produce and flowers.",
