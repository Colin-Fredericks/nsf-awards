 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723060  Tummala    This award is for partial funding to establish two complete advanced packaging system prototype facilities at the Engineering Research Center for Packaging Research at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  The facilities are being used in research aimed at exploring the limits of packaging technologies in design, test, materials, and processing.  The facility will expose students to product development methodologies.  Undergraduate and graduate students will work in teams with faculty and industry to explore next generation prototypes from concept to design, to development, to testing, to operation of a system.  The cost of the facilities are shared by the State of Georgia and industry.    Engineering Research Centers normally involve studies in research that involves proof-of- concept testbeds.  This facility will be the first of its kind in an Engineering Research Center and in a university where the students will have the potential to go beyond proof-of-concept testbeds, to prototype production through a systems-level engineering project.  This extends their education from study of concepts to include the effects of manufacturing constraints on their results.",
