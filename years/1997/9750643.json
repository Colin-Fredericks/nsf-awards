 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThis project is developing an undergraduate physiology or neurosciences program. Undergraduates are being provided with training in the neurosciences and physiology that is has previously been unavailable due to lack of appropriate instrumentation. Productive research in neurosciences (and animal physiology) requires extensive technical skills and background. Many undergraduates lack the training to even be considered for undergraduate research or participation in summer research and training programs in the neurosciences. Therefore, the project is building three neurosciences workstations and incorporating four neurophysiological exercises into a junior-level course in animal physiology. This plan compliments and improves the course emphasis on neurosciences while enhancing the student skills necessary for advanced study and research. The new instrumentation is stimulating undergraduate research in the neurosciences and physiology. In addition, the project prepares students for productive summer enrichment programs in the neurosciences and increases interest in graduate careers in the neurosciences and animal physiology.",
