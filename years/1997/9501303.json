 "awd_abstract_narration": "9501303  Dwyer  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will significantly improve hyphenated Liquid Chromatography/Infrared (LC/IR) Spectroscopy technology for use in polymer characterization.  This methodology provides a marked advance over conventional chromatography/IR spectroscopic analytic methods.  Phase I research successfully developed a prototype for a wide variety of polymer applications.  The Phase II research plan is divided into four parts: (1) define limits of the system, including quantitative analysis, and examination of artifacts; (2) expand the list of applications: test additional copolymer systems, as well as blends and alloys; (3) modify system design to provide automated multi-sample analysis; and (4) develop 3D/IR software to link with commercial chromatography software packages, and to provide additional modes of data analysis.   The combined capacity of the hardware/software represents a quantum advance in capability for polymer characterization.  The results of this study will expand the commercial market to polymer scientists working on a wide range of applications from research to manufacturing and quality control.",
