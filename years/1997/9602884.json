Austen Angell    \"Transitions in Bulk and Mesoscopic Liquids\"    This award will provide partial support for three months of  a six month visit to the University of Sydney, Australia,  by  Professor C. Austen Angell of the Department of Physics,  Arizona State University.  Professor Angell will conduct  collaborative research with Professors P. Harrowell and G.  Warr on current aspects of the dynamics and thermodynamics  of the glass transition, or polyamorphism glassy and liquid  systems, and of the relation of such polyamorphism to major  structural transitions in mesoscopic systems such as protein  and RNA folding transitions.  Angell's interest in glass  transition phenomenology will be combined with Harrowell's  theoretical expertise in kinetic Ising models, and the  consequent microscopic origins of liquid fragility, and  Warr's experience in microemulsion structure and stability,  to improve current understanding of glasses and  polyamorphism in glasses and biopolymers.  The investigators  will 1) use control of system size at constant chemical  potential to see system size effects, in particular in  systems  with dimensions comparable to those attributed to  microheterogeneities which now seem to appear near the glass  temperature; 2) perform theoretical studies based on a  facilitated spin microheterogeneous model to determine the  conditions necessary to produce the smeared-out, glass-  liquid transformation characteristic of hydrated protein  systems;  3) undertake multi-step calorimetric studies of  protein refolding kinetics to assess the relevance of  nucleation and growth kinetics to the first order complex  systems transition; and 4) utilize microemulsion techniques  to examine effects of confinement on folding kinetics and to  explore single molecule observation strategies.",
