Data however to quantify and chemically  characterize these groundwater fluxes are difficult to obtain and  are lacking in ocean and hydrological sciences.  The lead PI  Moore has already shown that the key to determining the scale of  SGWD are measurements of short-lived radium isotopes, 223Ra and  224Ra, and the longer lived 226Ra.  The association with the  second PI Shaw, adds the important expertise to measure Ba and  stable trace elements, so that the PI's can better evaluate the  influence of these groundwater fluxes on a broad range of trace  elements and nutrients that are of wider interest to the marine  sciences, hyrological sciences and coastal management  communities.       The PI's propose to place bounds on the fluxes and inputs of  groundwaters  using  a  regional sampling approach.   During  the  project, field sampling will be conducted on three major  cruises  in  the  South Atlantic Bight between North Carolina and Florida.  Shorter  cruises  are  proposed to respond to  specific  drought,  storm  or  rainfall events.  Groundwater investigations utilizing  existing   wells  near  these  study  sites  are  also  proposed.  Overall, the combination of their unique tracer measurements  and  ancillary  data  will allow the PI's to evaluate  the  impact  of  goundwater  fluxes  on  the  coastal oceans,  and  the  important  controls on the strengths and composition of these fluxes.",
