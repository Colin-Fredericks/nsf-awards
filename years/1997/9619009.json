 "awd_abstract_narration": "9619009  Lisowski    PLAN-IT EARTH is a partnership between teachers (grades 9-12), and  scientists from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources,  Science Coordinators from the Illinois State Board of Education and  the Illinois Regional Offices of Education, science educators from  the Environmental Education Association of Illinois and the  Illinois Environmental Education Advocacy Consortium.    The design of this project facilitates the development and  strengthening of teachers'/students' background knowledge of basic  science concepts and enhances inquiry pedagogy through  environmental field-based learning experiences.  The teacher  enhancement sessions will provide experiences that will highlight  ecological concepts, processes and related teaching strategies.   Classroom and field instruction will focus on science concepts and  processes associated with prairie, wetland, stream, agro, urban and  forest ecosystems.    Through this program, established teacher leaders will coordinate  and implement a series of field-based environmental monitoring  projects and classroom activities on these six ecosystems.  The  Monitoring of projects is aligned with the efforts of the Illinois  Department of Natural Resources' Critical Trends Assessment Project  (CTAP).  Teachers and students alike, will be involved in  contributing to a systematic base of empirical information.   Validated indicator protocols will allow for data analyses that  identify and describe the contents and conditions of Illinois'  forest, streams, prairies, agro, wetlands, and urban systems.    The intensive residential summer program, offered at three regional  sites (North, Central, Southern Illinois University), will engage  30 participants per site annually.  Each will focus on two Illinois  ecosystems per year.  Participants will focus on science concepts,  instructional strategies, technological applications, and research  techniques.  Eight follow-up sessions will engage participants at  each of the regional sites mo nthly for all 90 participants.   Follow-up sessions will focus on continued enhancement of science  content and science instruction, mentoring strategies, technology  usage and dissemination strategies.  Data submission will occur on  an established basis from all estimated 6,000 participating  students.    Maintenance of a network system for sharing will occur through a  home page on world wide web, newsletters specifically for the  project and special sessions at the anual state science  conventions.",
