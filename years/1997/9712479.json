 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Douglas Parks will purchase computer related equipment which will permit a significant upgrade to his Center for the Documentation of Endangered Languages Sound Laboratory (CDEL).  The goal of this unit is to record Native North American languages which are in imminent danger of extinction and the approach taken permits incorporation of sound and written information in a single format. Therefore researchers, students and native speakers of a language can view a word in written form, hear it spoken at the same time and also obtain supplementary information. This system is currently in the beta testing stage and the NSF-provided equipment will provide a valuable upgrade and addition. The components include a Iomega Jaz drive archiving system which will provide a large storage capacity; a  high performance multimedia-equipped laptop computer, an indispensable tool for linguistic fieldwork; a Marantz CD recorder which allows the creation of Cds for distribution and storage; a DAT recorder system; and desktop PC sound machine system.  During the next ten years the languages of some of the most prominent American Indian tribes - Arikara, Assiniboine, Comanche, Delaware, Mandan, Osage, Pawnee - are going to die out when the last elderly speakers of those languages pass away. For each of them there are fewer than a dozen fluent speakers still living. For many other languages the decline in use of the native language has reached a crisis stage. For young Native Americans who wish to learn their natal languages, suitable examples and instructional materials are not available. To meet both preservation and educational concerns the CDEL has developed a multimedia dictionary format and has begun to enter data from a series of languages. It is also designing teaching modules. Language not only provides a source of identity for cultural groups, but they also offers valuable insights into the functioning of the human mind. This award will help to provide an invaluable data base for future generations.",
