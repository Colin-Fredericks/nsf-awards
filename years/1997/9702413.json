 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  Proposal Number: CTS-9702413  Principal Investigator: van Zanten    This is a CAREER award to study complex fluids such as solutions containing surfactants, polymers, colloids or a combination of these components.  Such fluids are ubiquitous throughout the chemical and materials processing and biotechnology industries. Non-invasive experimental capabilities are necessary for flow studies where the shearing force induced by a mechanical rheometer may lead to gross structural changes.  Optical techniques offer noninvasive, accurate approach to study such materials under biologically and industrially relevant conditions.  The goal of this research program is to develop novel, state-of-the-art optical methods for characterizing complex fluids in their quiescent state.  A key educational component of this research is to train undergraduate and graduate chemical engineering students to use such methods and apply them to solve engineering problems.  This goal will be met through the establishment of a capstone laboratory course for our evolving macromolecular science curriculum in which students will be exposed to a wide array of experimental tools.",
