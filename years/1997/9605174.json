The three year program of joint activities will feature workshops on: 1) applications of the probabilistic method, 2) probabilistic techniques in computational geometry, and 3) complexity of computations and logical deductions.  Coupled with the conduct of each of these workshops will be an extended visit program for selected participants who apply to work on problems central to the workshop themes.  Selections will be made by a DIMACS/DIMATIA steering committee, with some priority given to junior, postdoc and graduate student participants.  Overall, the subsequent linkage of sister centers is expected to yield long-term research interactions and important breakthroughs in combinatorics.         This cooperative project between two centers of excellence fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.    ??",
