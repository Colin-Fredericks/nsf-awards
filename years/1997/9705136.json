Such  modification  is  showing  promise  for  the  development  of  in  a  new  class of   magnetic  materials  with  properties    potentially   suitable   for    permanent    magnet  applications.   In  the  proposed  research,  general   questions  concerning  both  interstitial  R2Fe17(N,C,H)x  (R  =  rare-earth  element) and substitutional Sm2Fe17-yTy (T = Ga, Al, and Si),  as  well as the related R(Fe,T)12, R3(Fe,T)29, and R2Fe14B rare-earth  systems,  will  be addressed.  The local atomic, electronic,  and  magnetic   structures,  and  the  related  macroscopic   magnetic  properties  will  be  explored  by  nuclear  magnetic  resonance,  Mssbauer   effect,  x-ray  absorption  fine  structure,   neutron  diffraction, and muon spin rotation.  The goals are to understand  the  specific  local  aspects  leading  to  changes  in  magnetic  anisotropy and individual sublattice magnetization as well as  to  determine   the   specific  site  moment  dependence   on   local  environment and lattice expansion.  %%%  This  is  a  renewal  project to study the effect  of  gas-phase-  element   interstitial  modification  of  Sm2Fe17   and   related  structures Permanent magnetic magnets are vital for both national  security  as  well  as commercial industries.   For  example,  an  automobile contains more than 100 magnetic components.  The total  market  for permanent magnets is currently more than $10  billion  per   year,  and  growing  rapidly.   This  application  requires  materials  with  high performance, high working temperature,  and  low  cost.   Since  the 1980s, the search for permanent  magnetic  materials  (to  replace  cobalt) has concentrated  on  iron-based  compounds  because  iron  is  abundant,  inexpensive,   and   has  relatively   high  magneti c  moment.   Recently,  it   has   been  discovered  that  when  gaseous elements  such  as  nitrogen  are  diffused  into  selected iron compounds, the magnetic  properties  are  greatly enhanced.  Our research program utilizes microscopic  experimental techniques such as magnetic resonance to  study  the  role  that such inserted elements play in improving not only  the  magnetic  properties,  but  the general  physical  properties  of  materials.  ***",
