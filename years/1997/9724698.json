 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for support of a cooperative project by Dr. Howard Pickering, of the Department of Materials Science & Engineering at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, and Dr. Badr G. Ateya, of the Chemistry Department at Cairo University in Egypt.  The objective of this research is to explore the prevailing mechanisms and to identify and characterize the various rate processes involved in de-alloying, i.e. the selective removal of one component of an alloy under external actions, usually that of the environment.  The de-alloying usually leads to deterioration in the properties of the remaining alloy.  The understanding of the mechanisms is essential to the development of successful methods and techniques to mitigate and control this problem.  Dr. Pickering is currently conducting analytical and experimental research in this area, with funding from DMR, to study the various possible mechanisms and their degree of prevalence in various alloys, in the copper, zinc, and amalgam families.  The participation of the Egyptian scientist adds a particularly proven expertise in the area of physical and mathematical modeling of the various kinetic and transport processes involved.  Scope:  This research project will be useful in improving the scientific knowledge on the mechanisms and processes of de-alloying which are extremely important in modern industrial designs, with heavy emphasis on light weight alloys that have superior properties.  The project involves US and Egyptian scientists with complementary expertise in material sciences, chemistry and physics, as well as  complementary laboratory facilities at the two participating universities.  The project will also involve a US graduate student who will have access to an international experience, by working in Dr. Ateya's laboratory, which should help in his/her career.  The project meets INT objective of increasing U.S.-foreign collaboration in areas that benefit both sides, and of enhancing junior scientists' international experience.  This award includes partial funding by the Division of Materials Research.",
