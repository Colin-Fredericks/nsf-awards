 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"computational geometry to mathematical programming\" (CGtoMP)  reduction strategy has three parts.  1) Formulate a task  involving complex interactions between non-convex geometric  objects as an optimization problem.  2) Develop algorithms of  computational geometry that reduce the geometric problem to a non-  geometric optimization problem.  3) Solve the optimization  problem using techniques from mathematical programming: linear,  quadratic, convex, and integer programming.    Using the CGtoMP strategy, this project will develop theory,  algorithms, and software directed towards several related  application domains: layout and packing on isotropic materials,  glass, metal, etc.; stereo-lithography; molecular modeling,  computer vision, and curve/surface fitting; entertainment and  scientific visualization; robust computational geometry.  Accordingly, the work has the following specific goals.  Packing  and Animation: develop algorithms to pack and animate rotating  and/or three dimensional objects.  Geometric Conditioning: by  solving an optimization problem, \"condition\" coordinates whose  values are causing numerical/geometric inconsistencies and  thereby achieve robust set operations on curved and/or  multidimensional geometric objects.  Realism in  Animation/Visualization: formulate laws of motion as an  optimization problem (such as Hamilton's \"principle of least  action\") in a way that can be solved rapidly by a CGtoMP  algorithm.  Theory and Experiment: examine both theoretical  complexity and practically achievable running times of packing  and animation algorithms.  Service to Research Community:  organize available packing problems, make new industrial  contacts, gather new data, and obtain the necessary permissions  to make this set of problems available to the research community.  Industry Involvement: attract money from industry to help fund  application of algorithms to specific domains.",
