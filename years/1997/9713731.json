 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9713731  Hemker       Fully  lamellar  two  phase  TiAl  based  intermetallic  alloys  offer a very attractive mix of mechanical properties  and are  considered to be strong candidates for replacing  nickel base  superalloys in several structural applications  involving temperatures  of up to 900' C. At these  temperatures, the creep performance of these  alloys is of  primary concern. Unfortunately, our understanding of the  processes that control high temperature deformation in  many  advanced  materials, including TiAl, is currently rather  limited.   The underlying creep mechanisms in these advanced  alloys are often quite different from that in pure metals;  the influence of steady-state creep is much smaller than it  is in pure metals, and transient deformation processes  (i.e..  primary and tertiary creep) have been found to  dominate the creep  behavior. In these cases, the Dorn  description of power-law creep is no  longer valid and  attempts to characterize the creep behavior with activation  energies and stress exponents, derived from minimum creep  rates, have met with very limited success.       This has  profound consequences for the prediction of  creep  performance, because the FEM codes used for creep  analysis require the input of creep laws that  characterize  the creep behavior of the material. Wherever possible it is  desirable to have these laws based on  the physical  deformation mechanisms. The widely referenced Dorn  description  of  power-law  creep  is  based on diffusion  assisted  climb in recovery processes that lead to steady  state creep. However, as is shown in the PI's RIA  related  research, in most intermetallic alloys, including TiAl , the  diffusion-assisted recovery processes which lead to  steady  state creep in pure metals are replaced by a gradual  evolution of the deformation microstructure. For this  reason, the Dorn equation cannot be used to model creep in  this set of alloys and it is necessary to develop an  alternative set of mechanism-based  creep relations for  TiAl  based lamellar alloys.       The  primary  goal of this work will be to derive a  fundamental set of creep laws that are based on observations  of microstructural evolution as a function of creep strain.  This  will require  a close integration  of mechanics and  materials and will involve work at three  specific  length  scales: i) the microscopic deformation mechanisms  will  be  identified  and characterized by TEM observations of fully  lamellar  polycrystalline specimens that have been crept to  various  amounts of creep strain, ii) the mesoscopic effects  of grain size, lamellar spacing, and lamellar orientation  will be separated and characterized with single crystal and  microsample creep tests, and iii)  the  macroscopic  creep  behavior of these alloys will be modeled with constitutive  relations that are based on the micro-and mesoscopic  measurements. The PI's experience with creep testing, TEM,  and TiAl has  been teamed with the co-PI's expertise in  developing continuum models of multiphase materials in order  to assure a bridge between the mechanics  and materials  issues in this study.***",
