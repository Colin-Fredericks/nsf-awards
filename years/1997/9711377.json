This is a  Phase II grant for technical support under the IF/EAR program  Continued support of a highly qualified scientist, Dr. Sonia  Esperanca, in this technical position is fully warranted and her  added expertise provides this group with a great deal of added  scientific motivation for further development of difficult  chemical separation and mass spectrometric techniques for the  analysis of lithium isotopes and osmium isotopes in the Re/Os  system.  The development of techniques in the Re/Os system has  already brought significant contributions to our understanding of  the early geochemical differentiation of the Earth and new  developments in the use of lithium isotopes as tracers of fluid  flow in magmatic, hydrothermal and groundwater systems holds  future promise.  Lastly, the addition of a new faculty member  this summer, Dr Christina Gallup, brings new expertise in uranium  series dating and trace element analyses in coral skeletons as  paleoclimatic indicators.  ***",
