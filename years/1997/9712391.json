 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712391  Marston  This young theorist is making a transition from an NYI award  to the regular program.  He is proposing work on a variety  of aspects of the strongly correlated electron problem.  In  theme, the chosen topics involve the role of quantum  coherence in a quantum many body problem.  For example,  during the scattering of an atom from a surface, charge  transfer takes place by tunneling, leading to a distribution  of charge species in the final product.  The PI has  successfully treated the interplay between the loss of  coherence and the strong Coulomb repulsion using a 1/N  expansion (N is the degeneracy of electrons in surface  states), finding good agreement with the experiments.  He is  planning an extension to higher orders, to improve the  understanding of experiments. Other topics in this project  include coherence and enlarged symmetries in quantum  nanostructures,  exact solutions of plateau problem in  integer quantum Hall effect and bosonization approaches to  the strongly correlated electron problem in 2 dimensions.  %%%  This young PI has been supported to work on two different  problems.  As an NYI, he has been studying the many body  problem of strongly interacting electrons, including the  properties under strong magnetic fields.  In a separate  grant, he has been studying the many body aspects of the  production of ions in an atom-surface collision.  In this  new grant, which combines his diverse research program in a  single grant, he is proposing to begin study in some new  areas such as quantum dots.  ***",
