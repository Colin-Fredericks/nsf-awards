 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic   Synthesis Program supports Professor Thomas Shawe's studies in the   Department of Chemistry at Bucknell University of the asymmetric   synthesis of cycloalkenones.  Alkylation of chiral enaminones followed by   Grignard reagent addition affords access to cycloalkenones with good   stereocontrol.  The role of chiral auxiliaries in the transfer of   chirality is assessed through modification of the chelate ring size and   number of chelate sites provided by the chiral auxiliary, alteration of   the nature of the chiral auxiliary, and examination of additive effects.    Addition of other organometallic nucleophiles in place of Grignard   reagents permits further synthetic generality, while the use of metal   hydrides offers promise for the formation of cycloalkenones unsubstituted   in the 3-position.  The products of these reactions are elaborated   synthetically, both to permit unambiguous assignment of stereochemistry   and to generate intermediates for further synthetic applications.  Preparation of molecules of demonstrated or potential biological activity   often requires control over the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms or   groups of atoms in the target molecules.  In particular, one often   desires a molecule which differs from another only in the manner by which   a right hand differs from a left hand, namely as non-superimposable   mirror images.  Professor Shawe develops new chemical approaches for the   selective synthesis of such molecules through the use of sequential   addition of reagents to precursor molecules bearing chemically-attached   `auxiliaries` which direct incoming reagents to the desired position for   reaction.  The resulting compounds offer promise as synthetic building   blocks for further elaboration into molecules displaying important   biological activity, such as the prostaglandins.",
