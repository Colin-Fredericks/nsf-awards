 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the need for silicon carbide (SiC) in power semiconductor and short wavelength optoelectronics.  The availability and quality of SiC substrates, the underpinning of any semiconductor technology, has not kept pace with either technical or commercial requirements.  In particular, the quality of the substrates is degraded by the presence of lattice distortion and `micropipes`.  In the Phase I program it was shown that Synchrotron White Beam X-ray Topography (SWBXT), a non-destructive characterization technique, is highly sensitive to strain in both horizontal and vertical cross-sections of the boule and resolves screw dislocations of all sizes.  In addition, it was shown that the majority of the lattice distortion in the seed crystal propagates through the growing bole, but that the micropipes can be reduced, using a proprietary growth process. In the next phase, characterization techniques will be expanded in order to reduce the dislocation density in our boules, and to progress from 1` to 2` diameter ingots.  To achieve this, SWBXT will be complemented with a potassium hydroxide (KOH) etching technique.  KOH etching has the advantage that it has a quick turnaround relative to SWBXT, and is much less expensive.  Although KOH has been used qualitatively on SiC, the quantitative identification of defects that exists for chemical etches of silicon and GaAs does not yet exist for SiC.  The first part of this program will use SWBXT to quantitatively identify the etch pit features. All of these techniques will be used to evaluate the value of different seed orientations, new seed preparation techniques, and n-type doping to reduce the dislocation density in the boules.       Development of a commercially viable SiC substrate, with low defect density, large area and acceptable cost, is required to achieve significant use of SiC electronics.  SiC substrates also present a potential substrate for III-V nitride optoelectronics.  These technologies will proliferate into many commercial electronics and sensor markets, including automotive, industrial power, communications and displays.",
