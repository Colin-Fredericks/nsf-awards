 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sarah C. Rutan is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry   Program in the Chemistry Division to perform studies aimed at developing   a better understanding of solvation in condensed phases through the use   of spectroscopic measurements and chemometrics.  She and her group at   Virginia Commonwealth University will use solvent sensitive dye probes to   investigate the solvation of bonded alkyl silica phases used in reverse   phase liquid chromatography.  Other studies will involve solvation of   probe molecules in non-ideal binary solvent mixtures and characterization   of the solvation of alkyl phases based on variations in light   transmittance caused by changes in refractive index.  Linear and   non-linear chemometric treatments of the data will be performed to   develop models which can be used to predict retention behavior.  The process of removing one solute from among others dissolved in a   liquid phase involves transfering that solute into another phase.  This   is the process of chemical separations and is important from a practical   viewpoint for pollution control, production of pure pharmaceuticals and   other chemicals, and many other applications.  This work involves a   fundamental study of the solvation process to enable a better   understanding of the chemistry involved. This could lead to significant   improvements in these practical applications.",
