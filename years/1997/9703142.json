 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported  in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, aims to develop  capillary electrophoresis as a method for characterizing  noncovalent interactions such as host-guest complexation  reactions.  Professor Gomez and his undergraduate and master's  level students at California State University at Los Angeles will  develop metal ion affinity chromatographic supports, immobilize  beta-cyclodextrin dimers and small ligands on the surfaces of  capillary electrophoresis columns, and prepare capillary coatings  with terminal ligands on their surfaces.  Nonaqueous and mixed  solvent capillary electrophoresis will be examined to determine  the analytical utility of such systems.  This CAREER project will  introduce students to a number of important contemporary areas  including surface chemistry, capillary electrophoresis, host-  guest complexation reactions, and protein and peptide  separations.  A further educational aim will be to raise the  awareness of minority students at the middle and high school  levels regarding career opportunities in science.   Capillary electrophoresis is being developed as a method to  characterize important noncovalent intermolecular interactions  with the support of this CAREER research project.  Professor  Gomez is introducing this emerging area of separation science to  undergraduate and master's level graduate students with emphasis  on practical problem solving applications.  Considerable effort  will be invested in the synthesis of molecular structures that  exhibit intermolecular interactions of interest when used in  conjunction with capillary electrophoresis.  New laboratory and  course experience will be provided to these students in this  area.  Efforts will be made to involve middle and high school  minority students in activities that encourage their interest in  science.",
