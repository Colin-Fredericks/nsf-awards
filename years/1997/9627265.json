 "awd_abstract_narration": "967265  Euler  This research project is concerned with the development of new  thin film strain gages.  Three approaches will be used.  The  first employs wide band gap semiconductors as the active sensing  element in a strain gage where both resistivity and absorption  spectroscopy can be used to monitor the strain.  These materials  are attractive because they have good reproductivity, long term  environmental and sensor stability, and large gage factors.  The  second approach will use polymers as the sensing element.  The  optical response of these materials is also sensitive to strain  with the potential to lead to inexpensive, commodity level active  strain elements.  Finally, new polymers will be developed that  store the integrated strain over time and can be used to measure  accumulated damage to the substrate.  The development of this  aspect of the research relies on the ability to monitor the  strain response conveniently such as during earthquake, wind, or  vehicle induced structural vibrations using the optical  methodology developed in the initial stages of the project.  A  successful outcome to the research will lead to cheaper strain  gages that, because of the thin film nature, can be applied to  buildings and infrastructure materials to monitor the strain and  to assess the damage during a catastrophic event such as an  earthquake.  ***",
