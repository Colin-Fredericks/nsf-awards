 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gardner  9706792       The propagation of electrons in quantum semiconductor  devices (e.g. resonant tunneling diodes, superlattices, and HEMT  and MODFET transistors) can be modeled as the flow of a  continuous charged quantum gas in a potential that has  discontinuous jumps at heterojunction barriers.  Quantum fluid  dynamical equations can be derived by assuming the gas is near  thermal equilibrium, but are expected to be more generally valid.  The investigator and his colleague focus on theoretical  modeling, simulation, and analysis of the flow of electrons in  one and two spatial dimensions in quantum semiconductor devices  based on the ``smooth'' quantum hydrodynamic model and quantum  kinetic equations (including the Bloch equation and the  Wigner-Boltzmann equation).  The development of modern upwind  numerical methods for simulating these equations on high  performance computers is emphasized.       Semiconductor devices --- like resonant tunneling diodes and  transistors --- that rely on quantum tunneling are playing an  increasingly important role in advanced microelectronic  applications, including multiple-state logic and memory devices  and high frequency oscillators.  The investigators model the  behavior of quantum semiconductor devices by treating electron  flow by means of quantum hydrodynamic and quantum kinetic  equations.  The models and numerical methods are implemented in a  high-performance industrial computer program that can be used by  the semiconductor manufacturing industry.  In this way,  semiconductor design engineers can efficiently explore the  behavior of various device materials and structures on the  computer before actually fabricating the semiconductor device.",
