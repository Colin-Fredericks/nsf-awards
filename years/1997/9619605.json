 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mullineaux       9619605                     The dynamic habitats at deep-sea hydrothermal vents are  temporally ephemeral and often separated from the nearest  comparable habitats by hundreds-to-thousands of kilometers.  Nevertheless, the physiologically unique organisms that  depend on active vents not only maintain stable populations,  but also colonize new vent sites within months after they  appear. This paradox raises two major unanswered questions  about the biology of vent animals: 1) Do larvae of vent  animals disperse between distant vent sites? and 2) If so,  how do they do it? These questions are central to  understanding how vent populations and communities persist  over ecological time and how vent species persist over  evolutionary time. Presently, we know virtually nothing about  how long larvae of vent species live in the plankton, how far  they disperse, or what biological and physical parameters  influence their dispersal ability.       The three Principal Investigators will combine their  expertise in cold-water larval physiology (Manahan), deep-sea  larval ecology (Young) and larval dispersal models near  hydrothermal vents (Mullineaux) to investigate the biological  and physical factors that influence dispersal of vent larvae.  This interdisciplinary study will: 1) develop methods and  high-pressure equipment for rearing vent larvae at in situ  pressures and temperatures; 2) measure the metabolic  requirements and changes in energy content during larval  development in order to estimate larval lifespans; 3)  characterize the roles of vertical swimming and buoyancy in  determining how larvae position themselves vertically in the  field; 4) determine if the physiological tolerances for  pressure and temperature change during larval development; 5)  determine the distribution and abundance of larvae in the  water column above vent sites; and 6) incorporate larval  attributes (distributions, vertical motions, physiological  tolerances, metabolic requirements and ene rgy stores) into  hydrodynamic models developed by collaborating physical  oceanographers to investigate the retention times,  trajectories and fluxes of dispersing larvae.  The  studies  will be the first comprehensive investigations of the larval  biology of the unique hydrothermal vent fauna and will be  conducted near 9N on the East Pacific Rise. This information  will significantly increase our understanding of larvae in  deep-sea environments, while providing data sets for  comparison to larval biology in polar and temperate oceanic  regions.",
