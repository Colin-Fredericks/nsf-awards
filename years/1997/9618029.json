 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618029  Heid    Pennsylvania State University is developing, field testing, and revising a modular secondary school mathematics curriculum for use by students who have regular access to: calculator or computer technology that includes a linked computer algebra system (CAS) and dynamic geometry tool;  calculator-based data-gathering tools; and electronic  data bases.  The materials are developed in strands of content that are expected to consume six-to-nine weeks of class time; the strands could be put together sequentially to form a year-long course and several strands would be developed as stand-alone units usable in conjunction with some of the emerging NSF-funded, comprehensive curricula. Considerable attention is paid to preparing the pilot- and field-test teachers to handle the material and these experiences are used to develop materials to help other teachers use the instructional materials.  A comprehensive study is being made that will include an evaluation of the instructional materials and research into the level of students' understanding of the mathematics topics studied.",
