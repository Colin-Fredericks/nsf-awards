 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feasibility analysis of a real-time system is the process of  determining whether the system can be scheduled to meet its  temporal requirements.  In order to be able to build better  automated tools for constructing complex real-time  application systems, we must first clearly understand what  factors are responsible for rendering certain systems  feasible and others infeasible.  This research proposes to  enhance our understanding of the phenomenon of feasibility  in real-time systems, and to obtain new tools, techniques,  and methodologies for feasibility analysis in such systems.  This will be done by providing a firm theoretical foundation  to the analysis of feasibility in real-time systems.  More  specifically, questions relating to the following topics  will be addressed: (i) Obtaining a generic framework for  feasibility-analysis of a system, through the identification  of its ``worst-case behavior\". (ii) Designing new abstract  models of real-time tasks to accurately capture salient  features of real-life application systems, and identifying  rules for mapping application systems onto the most  appropriate models. (iii) Analyzing various task models in  order to enhance our understanding of what intrinsic  properties render a model intractable from a feasibility  analysis point of view, and to identify very general classes  of tractable models. (iv) Determining alternate methods of  analysis for task models for which feasibility-analysis is  provably intractable. (v)Constructing ``proof-of-concept''  software that validates the usefulness of the theoretical  results obtained during the course of this research.",
