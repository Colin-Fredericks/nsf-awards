 "awd_abstract_narration": "SECME, Inc., formerly the Southeastern Consortium for Minorities in  Engineering, has been in existence since 1975 and is structured to  impact the educational pursuits of K-12 students and influence  their selection of science, engineering and mathematics careers.   SECME programs are now established in 12 states.  The organization  provides year-long support for a large number of K-12 students.   Since 1980, more than 49,000 SECME participants have graduated from  high school.  The partnership brings together students, teachers  and administrators and influences SEM career selection through a   variety of institutes, workshops, conferences and competitions.  In  addition to educational support from more than 65 corporations  and/or government agencies.  This program appears to be an  excellent feeder toward SEM careers.  The strengths of the nominee  include:        .  Since 1980, SECME has coordinated programs which have           mentored an impressive number (49,475) of K-12 students, who       have enrolled in post-secondary institutions.    .  Documentation indicates that more than 50 percent of the SECME       alumni have enrolled in SEM.    .  Data indicate that a large number of SECME students enroll in       college.  Currently, five SECME alumni are pursuing the Ph.D.       degree.    .  SECME has imparted the educational exposure of minorities by       influencing enhancement of both teaching and learning at the       K-12 level.    .  In 1996, SECME received the National Action Council for       Minorities in Engineering (NACME) Reginald H. Jones Award for       its influence on the education of minority groups.    .  As a model SECME involves students, teachers, faculty and       administrators through a team approach.    .  Linkages with several K-16 systems have already been           established.    .  The SECME network demonstrates collaboration among businesses,        governmental agencies, foundations, universities, school       systems, students and parents.    .  SECME's  impact on the K-12 system has been documented and is        significant.    .  SECME, as an enhancement program, has the potential for          improving K-16 education and impacting the SEM careers.    In summary, this nomination for the Presidential Awards for  Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring is a  great one.  The organization has been in existence since 1975 and  has reached over 50,000 students.  The impact on enhancing the  number of students pursuing science careers has been excellent.   The organization has had steady success with its impact on  students.",
