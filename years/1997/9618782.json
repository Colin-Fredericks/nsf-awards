 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618782 Pachavis  A symposium will be held March 31 - April 4, 1997 on Epitaxial Oxide Thin Films covering the understanding and control of epitaxial synthesis, processing, and characterization with respect to fundamental issues such as microstructural evolution in epitaxy, physical properties of epitaxial oxide thin films, and how these issues relate to device applications.. The aim of the symposium is to provide a vehicle through which groups of scientists working on a set of diverse materials science phenomena can discuss and interact on common scientific themes involving similar materials. NSF funds will be used to support participation by graduate students and young faculty.  There will be an opportunity to assess the field, and to establish ties between universities, research institutions, and industry.  It is expected that top scientists in the field will attend, and that the symposium will provide an effective forum to discuss and delineate critical scientific issues in the rapidly developing research areas involving colossal magneto-resistive(CMR) materials, especially in epitaxial form, the relationships between CMR and defect structure, and  similar relationships in other materials/device areas such as ferroelectric memories, nonlinear optical waveguides, microwave electronics, and magnetic oxide thin films. %%%  An evaluation of the progress and status of Epitaxial Oxide Thin Films and related materials processing and characterization issues, especially critical materials and device related research areas, and the relationship of materials research to device fabrication along with current assessments of the most important developments in this field will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of materials in computing, data processing, and communications.    ***",
