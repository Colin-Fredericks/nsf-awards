 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue the development of \"Flybrain,\" an  interactive database of the central nervous system of Drosophila and  describes specific aims for both levels of database construction. At  the deep, infrastructural level (level one), the specific aims of the  project include increased automation of data integration and transfer;  optimization of interactive viewing and virtual dissection programs;  creation of programs to display physiological records; and design and  implementation of a concept-based search engine. Level two specific  aims focus on the addition of a second core Arias of the thoracic and  abdominal central nervous system of Drosophila and the implementation  of parallel databases, two devoted to the brains of neurobiologically  important insect groups, the other focusing on the evolution of  arthropod brains. These developments will provide topical and much  needed access to detailed graphical data on the organization of brains  and nervous systems of the dominant metazoan Phylum, to the benefit of  a wide international community of neuroscientists and evolutionary  biologists, as well as new tools for database management and  manipulation of three-dimensional data.    The implementation of professionally managed neuroscience databases on  the World Wide Web provides immediate and extremely efficient access to  graphic data on the structure and function of central nervous systems  that are particularly relevant to modern research. These databases  range from interactive atlases of human brains, through databases on  the nervous systems of zebra fish, Aplysia, nematodes, and fruit flies  (this project). Three mirror sites in the United States, Germany, and  Japan have collaborated in the design and implementation of the project  which has made unexpectedly rapid progress in the first 16 months of  its National Science Foundation funding.    Major advances were achieved in the first funding phase at two levels  of database development: 1) the design and implementation  of a stable  framework and robust mechanisms to acquire, organize, manage, search,  and mirror large amounts of image data with minimum maintenance and 2)  the installation of comprehensive, annotated searchable atlases of wild-  type Drosophila brain with links to allied data such as reconstructed  single neurons, pathways, and schematics, as well as homologous  structures of other insects. New methods have been implemented for  retrieving information from a highly linked network of data modules.  Novel graphical representations reveal new ways to view and manipulate  two- and three-dimensional structure.",
