 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705081  Marks    This grant aims at a fundamental understanding of the growth  of metal films on semiconductors, with a view towards  developing phase-diagrams which include finite size effects  such as the depression of the eutectic temperature.  Understanding the processes taking place at small sizes when  the metal reacts with the substrate is almost virgin  territory, even for as simple a system as Stranski-Krastanov  (layer plus island) growth in a binary-eutectic.  The  research approach combines transmission electron microscopy  under ultra-high vacuum conditions with more classic surface  characterization techniques, exploiting a new experimental  system at Northwestern University with some new techniques  for obtaining atomic scale surface information.  The primary  questions to be answered are:  (1) What are the atomic scale  surface structures?  (2) What is the atomic scale detail of  surface defects such as domain and heterophase boundaries,  not just at the outermost atomic layer?  (3)  Can we build  phase diagrams of the monolayer and monolayer plus small  particle regimes (l-10nm)?  (4) How do we combine these with  particle-size effects, Ostwald ripening and kinetic  phenomena? Metals on semiconductors have been of substantial  interest both scientifically and technologically for many  years.  %%%  As the size of the metal film regions decrease (due to both  the drive to achieve higher densities and for novel  applications such as quantum devices), it is no longer  possible to ignore finite size effects.  This program  explores the growth phenomena associated with such films.  ***",
