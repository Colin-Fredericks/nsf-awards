 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cronmiller  IBN-9723350        During reproduction in most animals, oogenesis is a multicellular process that appears to require complex patterns of intercellular communication to promote the growth and differentiation of the mature egg. Basic follicular form in a wide diversity of animals consists of a germlinederived oocyte surrounded by a somatically-derived epithelium. The actual assembly of these sometimes complicated multicellular configurations is not at all understood; however, it is likely that processes such as intercellular communication, cell migration, differential cell/tissue adhesion and regulation of cell proliferation play important roles, and that the study of such cellular mechanisms of morphogenesis during gonadogenesis, and especially the genetic networks that direct them, will lead to new insights into similar events in other tissues and at other stages of development.    Oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster provides an ideal system for elucidating basic cell biological and genetic regulatory mechanisms that mediate the derivation, assembly and function of multicellular follicles. Indeed, functional roles in follicle formation have been described for a number of genes that also have essential roles in developmental processes outside of oogenesis, including neurogenesis and sex determination. The goal of this project is to discover how one of these genes, daughterless, functions during ovarian follicle formation and maturation.    This project includes three specific aims. First, to test whether daughterless protein function during ovarian follicle morphogenesis is regulated by phosphorylation via the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Second, to test whether daughterless gene function regulates somatic cell proliferation and/or the maintenance of multicellular organization during ovarian follicle formation and maturation. And third, to define the roles of new genes that participate with daughterless in its somatic ovary function.",
