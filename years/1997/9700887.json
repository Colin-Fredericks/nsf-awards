 "awd_abstract_narration": "9700887  Marquis   The PIs' research will explore how two forces, food quality and parasite attack, act as selective forces influencing the pattern of variation in development time in a population of oak-feeding caterpillars.  As such, this study contributes to a basic goal of population biology, elucidating the ecological and selective forces that shape patterns of variation within populations of organisms.  The PIs' research is important because few studies have examined how multiple forces interact to produce such patterns in natural population.  Within our study population, caterpillars vary considerable in when they begin feeding and how long it takes them to complete development.  Caterpillars that feed on low quality leaves may take longer to complete development, increasing their risk of being attacked by their natural enemies, parasitic wasps whose offspring feed on the body of the caterpillar, eventually killing it.  Additionally, a caterpillar's risk of being attacked depends on the time during the season during which it develops.  By manipulating these two factors (the timing of feeding and the quality of leaves caterpillars feed on), the relationship between each of these factors and the rate of parasitism will be determined.   The results of this study will contribute to our understanding of how ecological forces interact to influence timing in the life cycle of insect herbivores.  By documenting the consequences associated with feeding at different times or for different durations, this study will provide important evidence regarding the relative importance of plant quality and parasitism as two biological forces impacting natural herbivore populations.  In particular, this study will be one of the first to demonstrate that parasitic wasps represent an important selective force influencing the timing of life cycle events of caterpillar populations.  Additionally, since these parasitic wasps represent an important selective force for economically important pests, this study will pr ovide data relevant to the success of long-term biological control programs.  Such programs have been developed to control outbreaks of economically important pest insects which feed on agricultural products.  In contrast to the relatively simple agricultural systems, natural systems are highly complex, often involving multiple parasite species attacking a single herbivore resulting in a decreased likelihood of outbreak.  Understanding how natural populations of herbivores are effectively regulated by their parasites is thus critical to control efforts in highly managed agricultural ecosystems.",
