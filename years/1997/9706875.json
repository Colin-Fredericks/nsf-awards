 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT DMS-9706875    Smirnov      Smirnov will work on harmonic measure and distortion properties of   conformal mappings. Harmonic measure is a  fundamental object in   complex analysis, providing a good description  of the geometry of   sets in the complex plane.  This project will focus on the   investigations into the fine (local)  structure of   harmonic measure, related properties of Green's functions, and   possible applications to holomorphic dynamical systems. It seems   that extremal behavior of harmonic measure occurs for   fractal examples arising from complex dynamics and self-similar   constructions. Therefore, powerful machinery, developed for   investigations of dynamical systems (ergodic theory, thermodynamical  formalism, holomorphic motions) might be useful (and perhaps necessary)   for solving some problems in classical complex analysis.     This project emphasizes research in, and interaction between two   important areas of mathematics: classical complex analysis and   dynamical systems. Dynamical systems is one of the more active areas  of modern mathematics with applications to biology, engineering  and physics. Classically,  the analytical approach helped to   solve many hard problems in dynamical systems. Recently it has  become apparent, that answers to many classical analytical   problems have a deep,  dynamical origin.",
