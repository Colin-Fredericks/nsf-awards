 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the development and exploitation of a simple   technique for preparation of combinatorial libraries of compounds whose   synthetic histories are encoded by position along a one-dimensional solid   support.  This approach combines the attractive statistical control,   simplicity, and flexibility of the split-mix synthetic procedure with the   full library analysis of a spatial encoding approach.  Equipment   requirements are simpler than those for other spatial-encoding   techniques, and Fourier transformation of the signal output will lead   directly to structure-activity relationships. With the support of a Small   Grant for Exploratory Research from the Organic Synthesis Program,   Professor Alan W. Schwabacher, of the Department of Chemistry at the   University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, is developing an approach for the   generation and analysis of combinatorial libraries.  By adapting known   methods for the preparation of such `libraries` (groups of related   compounds) to incorporate the libraries along a one-dimensional solid   support, these studies may lead to the development of techniques   requiring only simple equipment and permitting rapid analysis of   structure-activity relationships.",
