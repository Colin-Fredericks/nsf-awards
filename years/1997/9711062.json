 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research involves the development of second generation   fluorophosphonate synthons. To this end, the synthesis of fluorinated   gamma-silyl-alpha-fluoroalkyne phosphonates in conjunction with solid   phase fluorination studies, the use of phosphonate as a leaving group and   the synthesis of cyclic alpha-fluoro- and alpha, alpha-difluoroalkyne   phosphonates  will be carried out.  The long-term goals of the research   include solid phase fluorine incorporation of a gem-difluoropropargyl   unit, synthesis of fluorinated phosphonic analogs of nucleotides,   synthesis of heterocyclic alpha-fluoro phosphonates and transmission of   chirality at the fluoromethylene carbon in alpha-fluorpropargyl   phosphonates.  With this renewal Research in Undergraduate Institutions   (RUI) award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of   Dr. Gerald B. Hammond of the Department of Chemistry at the University of   Massachusetts, Dartmouth.  Professor Hammond will focus his work on   developing a group of reagents known as fluorophosphonate synthons.    These molecules are versatile synthetic intermediates as precursors to   fluorophosphonates , an important group of biological phosphate mimics,   and as fluorine containing synthons for the preparation of organofluoro   compounds.  The proposed research will be carried out, in the main, by   undergraduate students.",
