 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the proper matching between social and technical systems within high-technology manufacturing industries.  A central theme of the research concerns employee teams:  their design, implementation, and management.  Of special concern are the infrastructural requirements necessary to facilitate the successful integration of an organization's production, engineering, marketing, and research and development departments via cross-functional teams.  The project is broken down into three interrelated areas, each addressing a unique set of research questions: (1) How will prior models of work team effectiveness (developed in low-technology and service industries) be transformed in higher technology workplaces?  (2)  What is the long-term interaction between autonomy and communication on white-collar or `knowledge worker` project teams?  (3)  What advanced communication technologies can aid virtual teams in overcoming the handicap of distance?  The objectives of the proposed research are to develop and test, via extensive field investigation and experimental work, models of team performance for both white-collar and shop-floor employees.  The proposed research will contribute significantly to the understanding of work organization within high-technology manufacturing industries.  The creation of predictive models for both shop-floor work teams and white-collar project teams will add to our knowledge of team effectiveness while providing the basis for the creation of design principles.  These principles, in part pertaining to the integration of production, engineering, marketing, and research and development departments and in total addressing questions of team design, implementation, and management, will be of considerable benefit to manufacturers as they seek to improve organizational performance.  The translation of research results into case studies for classroom teaching will enhance engineering education by guiding students in solution approaches to complex, unstructured problems involving the union of social and technical manufacturing systems in dynamic high-technology industries.",
