 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this proposal is to acquire major instrumentation for research and training in the analyses of complex plant, fungal and insect genomes. The instrumentation includes: 5 automated DNA sequencers, a robot for preparing DNA sequencing templates, 9 computer workstations for processing sequence and physical mapping data, a robotics system for the development of semi-automated procedures for high through-put screening of thousands of DNA samples for library screening and plant breeding applications, 12 ultra-low freezers for maintenance of large insert B AC libraries, a bank of 6 hybridization incubators and a versatile imaging system for rapid screening and analysis of BAC libraries.    The requested instrumentation will be integrated with existing robotics equipment, and ongoing research, service and teaching programs to establish a state-of-the-art Genome Center at Clemson University (CU). The functions of this new CU Genome Center are: 1 ) construction and maintenance of high quality BAC libraries; 2) production and distribution of high-density hybridization filters and DNA pools for library screening and distribution of BAC libraries and clones; 3) positional cloning of agriculturally important genes; 4) physical mapping of whole chromosomes and targeted genomic regions with BAC clones; 5) genome sequencing of important BAC contigs and genomes; 6) application development; and 7) undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training.    There are three primary activities that would be greatly enhanced by funding this proposal. First, MRI funding would ensure that the CU Genome Center will be capable of serving as a public resource for the construction, maintenance and distribution of large insert BAC libraries of important plant, fungal and insect genomes. Such a centralized resource would provide the research community convenient access to a major tool that is used for positional cloning, physical mapping and genome sequencing. Secondly, MRI funding would allow us to perf orm pilot projects aimed at physical mapping and sequencing of specific genomic regions of genomes that are being targeted for intensive investigation. Successful completion of these projects will put the CU Genome Center in a position to compete effectively for substantial federal support to sequence major portions of genomes such as Arabidopsis, Rice and Neurospora crassa. Lastly, MRI funding will substantially support and enhance undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral training in genomics. With access to state-of-the-art instrumentation, the CU-Genome Center will attract students and scholars of high caliber propelling several life sciences programs to national ranking, such as the interdisciplinary program in Genetics.    The CU Genome Center, as envisioned above, will be an internationally recognized facility that in turn will produce world class science serving the agricultural genome community at large.",
