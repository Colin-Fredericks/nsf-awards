 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Cellular and Biosurface Engineering at Duke University  requests funding to purchase atomic force microscopy (AFM)  instrumentation for the shared use of faculty within the Center. No  such instrumentation currently exists within the Center for shared use.  A significant number of the core investigators have used atomic force  microscopes at other institutions. The requested Digital Instruments  MultiMode/BioscopeTM AFM allows simultaneous optical microscopy and AFM  imaging. We propose to further extend the capabilities of the  BioscopeTM AFM by incorporating total internal reflection fluorescence  microscopy (TIRFM) into its optics. This instrument will enhance the  research of six members in the interdisciplinary Center for Cellular  and Biosurface Engineering (from four departments) in the following  research projects: (1) characterization of crystalline, two-dimensional  bacterial s-layer protein arrays and nanopatterned protein arrays  directed by the s-layer nanotemplates; (2) elucidation of the mechanism  of mechanical signal transduction in musculoskeletal cells; (3)  characterization of photopatterned antibody arrays designed for a  multianalyte integrated optical waveguide sensor; (4) quantitative  imaging of endothelial cell attachment and spreading processes on  novel, micropatterned cell-adhesive ligand substrates; (5)  characterization of a DNA chip: multiplexed, spatially-localized  oligonucleotide arrays on silicon substrates; (6) analysis of motor  proteins by AFM; and (7) development of a biophysical model to relate  protein-ligand recognition energetics to AFM-measured intermolecular  forces. The acquisition of an AFM will also significantly enhance the  educational mission of the Center for Cellular and Biosurface  Engineering at Duke University. The Center was the recent recipient of  a special opportunity award from the Whitaker Foundation for  educational enhancements to the program at both the undergraduate and  graduate levels. The Center is committed to  developing innovative  laboratory classes that utilize contemporary experimental techniques to  understand, quantify, and visualize the fundamental forces, stresses,  and recognition processes at the molecular and cellular levels that are  central to biological phenomena. The ability of the atomic force  microscope to investigate these phenomena in a biologically-relevant  milieu in real time combined with its relative ease of use makes it an  ideal experimental technique for a number of the laboratory components  of a new graduate course under development.",
