 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9712964       The language of science is difficult to learn for many  children - but much more difficult for children who cannot hear.   This project is designed to bring new technology into the  classroom that can help deaf children to succeed in science by  making both the language and the methods of science more  accessible and engaging to them.  Project objectives are:    o To develop and implement strategies using video captioning  technology to enhance student achievement in science at three  schools for the deaf in New England.    o To replicate the initial implementation in a school educating  both deaf and hearing students.  o To disseminate the findings of the research as well as the  enhanced curriculum and strategies for its effective  implementation.         The project will integrate three building blocks: A  successful science curriculum that is already sold nationally, a  pedagogical collaboration with teachers of deaf students that has  already extended over three years, and a new enabling technology  that has been developed and evaluated specifically for children  who are deaf.  The project will bring these three components  together creating a science curriculum that offers new  opportunities to actively engage deaf children in doing and  understanding science by reducing the pervasive barriers of time,  motivation, and instructional methods that presently impede their  progress.  The curriculum will be elaborated and evaluated in  classroom tests, modified as necessary, and then replicated and  disseminated.         The research design includes approximately 50 upper-school  students in four schools for the deaf.  Acknowledging the  impossibility of adequate matching of control and experimental  subjects, a full reversal (ABABAB) design will allow evaluation  of whether the intervention condition is associated with enhanced  learning.  Both quantitative and qualitative methods will be used  to maximize the generalizability of the results and to capture  valuable informati on obtainable only from individuals.  The four  different pedagogical approaches of the participating schools in  the study ensures broad applicability to educational settings for  children who are deaf.         The science curricula and methods developed in this study  will have an immediate impact in the four schools within the  study and on all schools that already use this science  curriculum.  Beyond these schools and this specific curriculum,  however, the tools and methods developed in this project should  have wide general applicability.",
