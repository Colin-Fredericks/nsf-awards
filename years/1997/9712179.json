The beneficial effects of ultrasound can often be  increased when microbubbles are present; these may either be  produced by the sound field itself or injected into the  patient.  Hence, the nonlinear dynamics and control of  volume oscillations of microbubbles is of great importance  in a variety of medical applications of ultrasound.  In  medical imaging, microbubbles are valuable as contrast  agents.  Owing to their compressibility relative to  surrounding tissue, bubbles return a stronger echo from an  incident sound field that can be used to construct an image  useful to physicians.  The echo from bubbles can be enhanced  by exploiting the nonlinear oscillations of bubbles which  return an echo at a simple fraction or multiple of the  incident frequency, further differentiating the bubbles from  the surrounding tissue.  In a second application known as  sonodynamic therapy, ultrasound interacting with  microbubbles drives chemical reactions that release radicals  from injected reagents to destroy  tumor tissue.  The rate-limiting step is the slow growth of  microbubbles to useful size by uptake of dissolved gases  from the surrounding liquid.  When the slowly growing  bubbles become large enough, violent collapses initiate the  therapeutic effect.  The importance of nonlinear dynamics to  these developing applications is clear, yet much is unknown  about the physics of bubbles undergoing nonlinear  oscillations at medically-relevant conditions.  Therefore,  research is proposed into nonlinear dynamics of resonances,  damping, ultrasound-induced bubble growth, effects of  encapsulation, and control of bubble oscillations.  New  control capabilities are under development that involve a  novel technique for optimizing bubble dynamics by alteration  of the driving acoustic waveform from a simple sine wave.  The optimization can be constructed so a s to increase the  echo from microbubbles used in imaging, or to increase the  rate of ultrasound-induced growth of bubbles used in  sonodynamic therapy.  These enhancements do not require  more intense ultrasound, but rather alterations in the  acoustic waveform, and so can be obtained without additional  risk to the patient.  ***",
