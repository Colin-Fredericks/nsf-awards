 "awd_abstract_narration": "As scientific efforts continue to become more global in character, it is increasingly important that U.S. scientists at early stages of their professional careers be given the opportunity to participate in and contribute to major international cooperative activities.  For similar reasons, U.S. scientists should be assisted when they assume leadership positions in the organizations that facilitate such activities.  This award will provide support to assist early-career scientists to participate in assemblies of six unions of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), and it will support the work of a U.S. scientists serving as a senior official in the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS).  The six IUGG-related meeting for which support will provided to assist in the participation of early-career U.S. scientists are:  a Scientific Assembly of the International Association of Geodesy (IAG); the 8th Scientific Assembly of the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA); the 5th Scientific Assembly of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS); a Joint Assembly of the International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences (IAMAS) and the International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Ocean (IAPSO); the 29th General Assembly of the International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth's Interior (IASPEI); and a General Assembly of the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI).  Thoughtful scientific agendas have been developed for all six of these assemblies, and a selection process has been developed that should permit an open competition among eligible early-career scientists as well as fair and timely selection of funding recipients.  Through their participation in these meetings, U.S. scientists will have the opportunity to more effectively link themselves and their institutions in major international collaborative activities.  Furthermore, U.S. leadership in IUGS activities will be maintained through the provision of support for some IUGS-related international travel for Dr. Robin Brett, a senior official of that important international organization.",
