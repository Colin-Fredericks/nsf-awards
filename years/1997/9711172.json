 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses one of the most abiding and important topics in science and technology studies - the historical relations of science, technology and industry.  Its purpose is to show that a definable and critical phase in these relations was marked by the emergence of scientific consulting - a new and hitherto unexamined scientific practice of the mid-nineteenth century.  The project focuses on the careers of the most prominent consultants of the time, geologists and chemists, and their interactions with the development of the coal and petroleum industries.  It discusses the scientific and commercial contributions of these consultants as well as the ethical and legal consequences of this new professional scientific practice.  The results of the project will contribute to several areas of scholarship.  In the history of geology and chemistry, the project highlights theoretical and empirical contributions by American scientists to the studies of coal and petroleum which will provide a balance to predominantly European accounts of these sciences.  In scientific ethics, the project shows how the norms of professional conduct for American scientists were shaped by the commercial practices of consultants.  In the relations of science and the law, the project outlines the emergence of scientific expert witnessing and the changes in the legal code that allowed for the patenting of scientific research.  And finally, by systematically investigating this new practice of consulting the project explains how science became an essential component of technological and industrial development.",
