 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will address current problems in quark  models of strongly interacting particles and a related topic  in exotic atoms.  One problem concerns the production of  strange particles (sigma and lambda hyperons) and their  antiparticles from collisions of protons and antiprotons.  We will calculate in a quark model the cross-sections and  spin observables for these reactions, and compare them to  experiment and to meson-exchange calculations.  Our goal is  to determine the reaction mechanism and the unknown hyperon-  antihyperon interaction. Another problem of contemporary  interest is the contribution of strange quarks and  antiquarks to the spin of the proton.  We have proposed a  model of polarized, intrinsic strangeness in the proton  which we will further develop in order to test it against  spin transfer data from the hyperon production experiments.  A third problem is the asymmetry of different quark flavors  (up, down, and strange) in the sigma hyperon, which we will  calculate in a model in which mesons are coupled to quarks.  Finally, we will calculate energy level shifts and widths in  exotic atoms in order to learn about nucleon wave functions  and elementary hadron-nucleon interactions.  Research  assistantships will be provided so that undergraduate  students can collaborate in this program.",
