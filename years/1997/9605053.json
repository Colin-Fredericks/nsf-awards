 "awd_abstract_narration": "9605053  Callard         While estrogen is generally regarded as a circulating  steroid hormone derived from ovaries, testes, and placenta,  it is well-established that this hormone is also produced in  the brain, pituitary, and retina.  Indeed estrogen is  synthesized in these neural tissues from circulating gonadal  androgen through a process referred to as aromatization.  Estrogen production is controlled by an enzyme catalyst  termed aromatase, which is the product of the CYP19 gene.  Dr. Callard is interested in understanding how brain  production of estrogen and consequent estrogen-dependent  neural processes are controlled.  Towards this aim, she has  identified a model system in which aromatase and androgen  receptors are extremely high in the brain.  In examining the  molecular mechanisms operating on CYP19 gene expression in  this model,  Dr. Callard recently found, for the first time,  the presence of two functional CYP19 genes.  One is  expressed at high levels in brain and other neural tissues  exclusively, and the second is expressed at much lower  levels in both brain and ovary.  Using innovative molecular  technology, she will now characterize the molecular  mechanisms unique to each of the two CYP19 genes.  Since  brain-formed estrogens have a critical role in neural  development during fetal and newborn stages and have been  implicated in the maintenance of brain function throughout  life, Dr. Callard will use this information to examine who  estrogen production is optimized for timing, location in  different cell-types and neural circuits, and functional  condition such as age, gender and hormonal status.  This new  knowledge will not only increase our understanding of the  basic mechanism by which estrogen becomes available to act  within brain cells but also places this process into a  functional and evolutionary perspective.",
