 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important optical network architecture is the wavelength division  multiplexed (WDM) network that supports lightpaths.  WDM is basically  frequency division multiplexing in the optical frequency range, where  carrier frequencies are referred to as wavelengths.  Lightpaths are end-to  end connections made up of connected WDM channels.  A network node is said  to have wavelength conversion capability if it can shift the wavelengths of  optical signals.  The advantage of wavelength conversion is that it allows  networks to support more ligthpaths, but its disadvantage is that it can be  expensive and/or difficult to implement.  This research will investigate  limited wavelength conversion that allows network nodes to perform some but  not all wavelength shifts.  Limited conversion means less complex and costly  hardware than full conversion, yet better channel utilization than no  conversion.  Network architectures and algorithms will be studied by  initially focusing on special and important network topologies such as the  star and ring, and then eventually covering general network topologies.  These will be analytically evaluated by worst case analysis that leads to  guaranteed performance results, and also by probabilistic methods. More  information on the project can be found at     http://spectra.eng.hawaii.edu/~sasaki/NSF/limited.html",
