 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Wendy Ashmore, MS Angela Keller will collect data for her doctoral  dissertation. For the last several years she has participated in the survey and excavation of Xunantunich, a Mayan site located in lowland Belize. It consists primarily of a core cluster of monumental architecture with walkways, roads, public plazas and terraces as well as larger more impressive temple mounds. The site is particularly interesting for several reasons. First, it dates to relatively late in the Maya sequence with only Late Postclassic and Terminal Classic components. This means that the architectural layout can be viewed as essentially synchronous and minimal segregation of features by time period is necessary. Secondly, a curious disjunction exists between the site itself and the surrounding hinterland which maintained a large and prosperous population both before the site was occupied and after its abandonment. This is unusual in a Mayan context. Ashmore, Keller and other team members have examined the spatial organization of the Xunantunich core and compared it to ethnohistoric documents which describe how Mayan villages, when first described by the Spanish, were arranged. They believe that major buildings and causeways were organized along ritual lines and that the arrangement in space reflected Mayan beliefs about cosmic order. Only portions of the site have been excavated and detailed mapping has not been completed. During one season of NSF supported fieldwork MS Keller will do both. She has determined what configuration of data is necessary to support a `cosmic` model and will collect the necessary information to test this idea.  Archaeologists wish to understand how the Mayan civilization arose and was maintained by people who lived in an extremely harsh environment and who possessed a simple level of technology. How was it possible to integrate large numbers of people into widespread social and economic systems? Many archaeologists have postulated that political and ritual power were essentially synonymous and through control of important rituals rulers were able to exercise considerable power. Were Xunantunich spatially organized along ritual lines, this fact would strongly support this hypothesis. This research is also important because it will assist in training a promising young scientist.",
