 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research program is centered around the design and  analysis of algorithms in combinatorial optimization, with  an emphasis in two major directions: the development of  efficient approximation algorithms to provide near-optimal  solutions to intractable problems in combinatorial  optimization; and the use of these techniques in the design  of algorithms for large-scale networks. A fundamental goal  is the development of general methods for approximating the  optimal solutions to intractable optimization problems. The  study of linear programming methods has proved to be a  valuable way to gain insight into the structure of such  problems. The approach in this work involves the development  of techniques based on linear programming and some of its  generalizations, in conjunction with probabilistic methods  and randomized algorithms. A related issue is the behavior  of local-search methods for optimization, as a means of  understanding the ``landscape'' of feasible solutions on  which they operate; there are close connections between this  issue at a general level and some concrete optimization  questions in the area of biomolecular structure. A rich  application area for these algorithmic techniques, and the  focus of much of this research, is in the area of network  optimization problems.  One basic issue is the problem of  routing traffic streams so as to minimize congestion in  communication networks. This involves techniques from  network flows, adapted to the framework of virtual circuit  routing. Another on-going issue in this research is the  development of tools to analyze network traffic as a dynamic  phenomenon, which arrives continuously over time. Some  fundamental issues here are {\\em stability} --- determining  whether delays in the network remain bounded over long  durations --- and the probabilistic analysis of traffic  whose rate can fluctuate greatly over time. The education  component of the program is focused on the planned  development of a course designed to link curren t  developments in algorithms with work in the biological  sciences.  In particular, there is an emerging opportunity  here to bring together students from computer science, and  those in biology and chemistry, around the set of  fundamental computational problems that have arisen in  molecular biology.  Related to this is a plan for increased  coverage of certain topics in the core undergraduate  algorithms course: in particular, the general area of  heuristic and local-search methods in optimization, which  has figured prominently in much of the computational work  currently being done in molecular biology and related  areas.***",
