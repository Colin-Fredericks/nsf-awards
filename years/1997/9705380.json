One area is the mathematical analysis of nonlinear  waves and fronts, particularly multidimensional shocks.  Another area  is control of systems governed by hyperbolic partial differential equations  (wave propagation equations) and discrete ``lumped parameter'' approximations  to them that would be used in numerical computation of optimal controls.  Two main computational areas are: 1: anisotropic adaptive refinement  methods for multidimensional approximation and finite element computation, and  2: Monte Carlo methods for computing quantum mechanical properties  of systems of interacting electrons.  Several other areas, including  the research of graduate students under my supervision are discussed.    There are several projects described here, most involving collaborations  with colleagues, postdoctoral trainees, or graduate students.  The project  on control of systems governed by hyperbolic differential equations   is about methods for removing acoustic noise from structures.  This has  applications in aircraft and submarine technology and in other places.  It fits in with a larger effort to design \"smart materials\" and \"smart  structures\".  Modern sensors, actuators, and computers are fast enough  to react to individual sound waves.  The mathematical problem is to design   good computational \"control strategies\" that use this ability effectively.    The existing mathematical theory of control was developed with smaller,   simpler systems in mind and does not apply directly to control of systems   where acoustic waves (sound waves) are propagating.  We hope that our theory   of control will apply to such problems.  A more computational project is the  attempt to compute the \"electronic structure\" of molecules from quantum   mechanics.  The equation to be solved (the Schrodin ger equation) has been   known since 1926.  Still in 1997, there is no reliable way to solve the  Schrodinger equation for systems involving more than one electron (an oxygen  atom has 8).  The ability to do this would have enormous scientific and   technological impact, with applications ranging from superconductivity  to drug design.",
