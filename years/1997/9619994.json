 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for an REU Site in program in Psychology to be coordinated by Saint Louis University.  The aim of the project is to provide research experience opportunities for selected African-American undergraduate students in five participating institutions (including Clark-Atlanta, Morehouse, Morris Brown, and Spelman.  The program involves identification of students in the sophomore year, preparation of research plans during the junior year, an intensive research experience during the following summer, and completion of program activities in the senior year.  Research will be supervised electronically and through faculty exchanges that typically will involve visits of 3-4 days to plan cooperative research projects and help students prepare for their summer activities.  In addition to involvement in research during the summer, students also will take a one-credit ethics course, present their research at a local conference, and participate in two workshops, one on the Graduate Record Exam and the other on careers in psychological science.  In the senior year, projects will be submitted for presentation and publication, and students will be assisted with their graduate school applications.  This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.",
