Statistical wavelet modeling and computational research have,   in recent years, become burgeoning areas in both theoretical   and applied statistics, and are beginning to impact developments   in statistical methodology and in various applied scientific fields.  Wavelet ideas are developing in statistics in areas such as   regression, density and function estimation, factor analysis,   modeling and forecasting in time series analysis, spatial statistics,   with ranges of application areas in science and engineering.  The emerging interests in Bayesian statistical modeling and wavelets   is generating exciting new directions for the interface of two research areas, with significant potential for future impact on applied work.    This international research workshop, focused on the interface of  wavelets and statistical science, is held in recognition of the recent   growth and current vibrancy of research at the interface of the   disciplines.  The meeting will provide an opportunity to summarize   the current status of research on wavelets in statistics, to explore   the applied impact that statistical wavelet modeling and wavelet in   statistics are having, and to suggest and stimulate novel theoretical,   methodological and computational research directions.  The workshop is   planned at an opportune time to assess and address the dual question   of the future prospects: for significant contributions of wavelet   ideas to statistical science and application, and for furthering   watelet-based technology through the use of statistical concepts and   models.",
