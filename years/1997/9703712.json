In this research, several   questions are studied in connection with strongly mixing random sequences, and   connections with random fields are discussed briefly.  Question 1 deals with a possible   ``trichotomy'' for the asymptotic behavior of the partial sums from a strictly stationary,   strongly mixing sequence of random variables taking their values in a Banach space.    Question 2 deals with the exact location of a part of the ``borderline'' of the central limit   theorem under the (Rosenblatt) strong mixing condition.  Question 3 deals with the   spectral density of random sequences under a certain strong mixing condition.  Question 4   deals with a possible connection (or lack of one) between two strong mixing conditions;   the relevance of this question to an old conjecture of I.A. Ibragimov is discussed.   In the real world, there are many phenomena which appear to be ``weakly   dependent,'' in the sense that observations that are ``close'' in time or location may have   considerable influence on each other, while observations that are ``far apart'' in time or   location have only slight influence on each other.  For example, the annual unemployment   rate for the year 1998 may have considerable influence on the unemployment rates for the   years 1999 and 2000, but will presumably have almost no influence on the employment   rate in, say, the year 2050. Similarly, the fluctuations in the wind currents at a given   location may be highly correlated with the (wind current) fluctuations ten miles away, but   perhaps have no discernible correlation with the fluctuations 3000 miles away.  For the   modeling of such phenomena, much attention has been devoted in probability theory to a   broad type of weak dependence known under the name ``stron g mixing conditions.'' An   understanding of ``structural'' properties of strong mixing conditions can help in assessing   their appropriateness for the modeling of a given real world phenomenon, and ``laws of   averages'' connected with such conditions can provide the foundation for the statistical   inference for the given phenomenon.  This research deals with several questions   concerning both ``structural'' properties and ``laws of averages'' in connection with various   strong mixing conditions.",
