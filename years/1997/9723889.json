 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chuong  9723889      The long term objective of this laboratory is to understand the molecular mechanism of pattern formation in embryonic development.  Along these lines, Dr. Chuong has been using feather morphogenesis as a model and studying its molecular mechanism.  In this pilot proposal,  he will focus on signals involved in periodic patterning of feather primordia.  He suggests that initial cell aggregates form randomly and are unstable.  Through a reaction diffusion mechanism, only some aggregates survive to become feather primordia.  The final number, size, and inter primordia space reaches an equilibrium regulated by positive and negative signals.  Preliminary data suggest that FGFs may be candidates of positive signals, while BMPs may be candidates  of negative signals.  Candidate molecules for these events will be tested using novel feather reconstitution procedures and retroviral infection.  The role of cell density on feather bud density, size and interbud spacing will be analyzed.  The corollary of the reaction diffusion mechanism is that the primary row and sequential propagation of feather primordia is not essential.  This will be tested using DiI labeling of feather primordia followed by dissociation and reconstitution.  The work will shed new light on the molecular basis and modeling of periodic pattern formation for feathers and other organs.",
