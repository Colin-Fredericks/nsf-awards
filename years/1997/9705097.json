The goal of this project is to  provide an opportunity for U.S. students to be exposed to the  most recent developments in operation, construction, and research  in the power engineering field.  This is a particularly critical  time for power engineering as the industry undergoes significant  change due to the restructuring of the traditional utility  structure.  The career opportunities for students interested in  power engineering are many and varied; opportunities exist within  utilities, vendors, manufacturers, and consulting firms.    The impact of this program is significant and far reaching.  This  is an exciting time to be involved in power engineering.  The  power industry is currently undergoing major changes, and young  engineers entering the marketplace to be exposed to the  challenges an issues these changes are causing.  This program  will allow students the opportunities to experience first-hand  the energy and vitality of the power area.  This will hopefully  encourage students to pursue a life-long career in the power  engineering field.  ***",
