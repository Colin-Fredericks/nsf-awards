 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project applies socio-historical techniques to a 19th century evangelical missionary organization, the Norwegian Missionary Society, to understand how those men and women who traveled to Madagascar in the second half of the century perceived and understood relations among themselves, and relations between themselves and their potential converts.  Of particular concern are patterns of ideology and power that divide along lines of religion, gender, race and class.  When the historical record permits, the effects of changes introduced by missionaries on the indigenous culture are discussed.  But the main emphasis is on how the ideological and cultural models borne by the missionaries reveal their cultural and national identities and characterize their society of origin.",
