The controlled topology objective is  to understand better the failure of approximate fibrations to form a  bundle theory because the formation of pullbacks is obstructed.  Hughes and others have made precise the sense in which approximate  fibrations are the normal structure in homotopically stratified sets.  This makes the pullback problem central in the study of these sets.  Much is already known through the work of Hughes, Williams, Taylor,  Weinberger and others, but a more satisfactory version may be  possible.  The other topic concerns machine computation in topological  field theories defined on 2-complexes, 3-manifolds, and smooth  4-manifolds.  The 2-complex case is completely implemented, and  explorations are well along for field theories coming from mod p  representations of Lie algebras, for p up to 13.  The representation  theory of quantum groups needed for 3-manifolds has been implemented,  but exploration of the field theories waits on a more complete  understanding of the 2-complex case.  Both 2-complexes and 3-manifolds  are considered test cases for the primary goal of the project, field  theories on 4-manifolds.  This, however, is still some years off.  Some work is also being done on topological questions on which field  theories might shed light: the \"Andrews-Curtis\" conjecture for  2-complexes, handlebody structures on 4-manifolds, and topological  isotopy of 4-manifolds.       The context for the first topic is the study of stratified sets.  Most of the geometric objects occurring in nature are stratified: built  up of layers that are manifolds.  The biggest challenge is to understand  how the strata fit together.  For most types of stratified sets  (smooth, piecewise-linear, analytic) this fitting-together is  described using a bundle theory.  It is complex and hard to use  because the objects are complicated, but is effective and  well-understood.  Top ological stratified objects took longer to  describe, because it turns out the fitting-together cannot be given in  terms of a bundle theory.  This has been extensively studied, but we  do not yet have a fully satisfactory understanding.  The field  theories in the second part of the project are also referred to as  \"topological quantum field theories.\"  They are rather idiosyncratic  theories specialized to low dimensions.  The ones under study are  algebraic (as opposed to analytic) and are constructed using  representations of groups or Lie algebras, or their deformations.  These, particularly the 3-manifold versions, became popular about a  decade ago.  At the time, we seemed not to know enough either about  deformations of Lie algebras or about 3-manifolds to get significant  new information from one about the other.  A particular obstacle was  the inability to compute \"random\" invariants.  This project, now in  its eighth year, has numerical computation as a first goal.  This is  going well, but the raw output is not very revealing.  The principal  activity at present is finding ways to use numerical data to obtain a  global qualitative understanding of a theory.  ***",
