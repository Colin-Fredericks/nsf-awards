Complex  cobordism occupies a central place in stable homotopy theory, in part  due to the Nilpotence and Periodicity theorems of Hopkins, Devinatz  and Smith.  Quillen's theorem is of fundamental use, as it allows one  to use techniques from the study of formal groups to produce, and  calculate with, various cohomology theories based on complex  cobordism.  A problem of longstanding importance in equivariant theory  is to understand complex cobordism classes of G-manifolds (where G is  some Lie group).  This research will explore this question from the  point of view of formal group laws.  The goal is to use the methods  from Quillen's paper in the Advances to get a handle on equivariant  complex cobordism, and to link this with the notion of equivariant  formal group laws, preliminaries of which are set forth in Mike Cole's  University of Chicago thesis.       When is the set of positions of some mechanical system the  boundary of the set of positions of some other mechanical system?  As  a simple example, think of the circle around some point in the plane  as being the set of positions of a pendulum.  This is the boundary of  the set of positions of a pendulum of the same length, but with a  joint halfway along the rod joining the bob to the center (said joint  able to bend from 0 to 180 degrees).  This set of positions describes  a disk.  This question has a very beautiful and elegant answer in  terms of the algebraic topology of the manifold, given by the Fields  medal winning work of Rene Thom in the 1950s.  In certain cases, the  answer to this question turns out to be related to \"formal group  laws,\" a class of algebraic rules for adding two quantities, with  properties similar to, but not identicial to ordinary add ition.  This  research is directed at answering our original question when, in  addition, it is required that the set of positions of the mechanical  system be the boundary of the set of positions of some other  mechanical system in a way that respects some symmetries of the  original system.  Some of this is already known in principle in simple  cases, but formal group laws with additional symmetries will provide a  framework for the answer and may allow extensions beyond special  cases.  ***",
