Dr. Lim will work with Dr. Toshio  Matsumoto, Professor of Galactic Evolution, Division of  Astrophysics, on a research project entitled, \"A Search for  the Cosmic Infrared Background with the Near Infrared  Spectrometer.\"    The Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) is a diffuse space  background composed of the light from unresolved primeval  galaxies.  Current theoretical work addressing the CIB  describes a picture of starlight emitted from the first  galaxies forming a near infrared (NIR) component brightest  at a wavelength of a few microns.  Some of this starlight  may be absorbed and reemitted by dust and seen as a far  infrared component.  The proposed research consists of a  complete analysis of NIR data using the Near Infrared  Spectrometer (NIRS), which is mounted on the Infrared  Telescope in Space (IRTS) satellite.  NIRS is a grating  spectrometer with wavelength coverage of 1.2 to 4.2  \\micron~with a resolution of 0.12 \\micron.  The primary  scientific goal of the research would be to detect or  constrain the amplitude of the CIB using competing systems  of analysis in an effort to obtain the most reliable data.  Results of the research will assist in the characterization  of the CIB and interstellar chemistry and will aid in the  development of future U.S. and Japanese space missions.  ***",
