 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research studies how emerging broadband networks can   efficiently deliver video on demand. The research assumes that   video is variable-bit-rate (VBR) encoded. Particular emphasis   will be placed on a design which the P.I.s have recently devised,   Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) Prefetching. Not only does this   exciting design give constant-quality playback and almost 100%   link utilization, but it also allows for immediate commencement   of the video upon user request and near instantaneous response   to  interactive actions (pause/resume and temporal jumps). This   research will examine two distinct end-to-end architectures for   video on demand. In the first architecture, there is one video server  from which all the videos emanate; the video server is attached to  a cable headend or to an ADSL switch. In the second architecture,  there are multiple video servers and there is a complex, multi-link  network which separates the servers from the clients. The research  will study JSQ prefetching for the first architecture; it will study  a priority-based scheme which mimics JSQ prefetching for the second  architecture. This research shall also develop analytically   based call-admission rules for our JSQ prefetching design. It shall   investigate how the special structure of MPEG-1 and MPEG-2   encoding can be exploited for designing call admission schemes   and selective packet discard schemes at the server.   It shall develop an auxiliary payload specification for transporting  MPEG 1 and 2 video on demand over real-time protocol (RTP).  Finally, an implementation of the JSQ prefetching scheme, which will  stream several simultaneous videos to clients, will be developed.    The research is described at http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ross/jsq.html .",
