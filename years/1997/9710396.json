The increasing penetration of the cash economy and state law into indigenous communities  has been rapid.  The research builds on the investigator's work done in the same region in the 1960s that analyzed \"Zinacanteco law.\"  The current exploration of ongoing economic and political changes in Zinacantan focuses on how people in Tzotzil Maya township are revising and reimagining their dispute management procedures in response to the apparently contradictory forces of economic modernization and political pressure to emphasize  ethnic distinctiveness.  By focusing on the concept of \"reconciliation,\" she investigates how women and men of various ages and economic conditions are invoking notions of \"indigenous\" and \"human\" rights to argue over the meaning and enforcement of traditional customs.  The research uses established anthropological methods of interviewing, case record analysis, and participant observation.. Three kinds of changes in the legal system will be analyzed: dispute management procedures, who initiates settlements, and the discourse of indigenous custom. The project extends theoretical developments in anthropological analyses and applications of dispute resolution.    %%%    This research explores the intersections and conflicts among legal orders in Chiapas, Mexico where active debate over how to create a multi-cultural democracy is ongoing.
