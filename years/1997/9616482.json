 "awd_abstract_narration": "This international conference brings together expert scholars to  investigate a set of language structures referred to as External  Possession and certain Noun Incorporation phenomena found around  the world. These constructions have been largely relegated to  \"esoteric idiosyncrasies\" of particular languages, but they in  fact challenge most proposed theories of syntax. This is because  features of the sentences involved fail to correspond with  supposed features of the verbs involved in those very sentences.  Thus, these constructions constitute limiting cases for any  adequate theory of syntax and natural language.     The conference will include expert scholars in syntax, lexicon,  verb structure, semantics, and psycholinguistics, in an effort to  get as holistic and comprehensive a view of the phenomena as  possible. Scholars have been explicitly chosen who we believe can  talk and listen well together across the major theoretical  divides in the field. Additionally, scholars who have explored  these constructions in a wide range of languages (Native North,  Central, South American; IndoEuropean including Romance,  Germanic, and Slavic; African including Nilotic, Bantu;  Australian; Cinitic among others), and who can talc about  particular data in depth, will be included.     The conference will be held at the University of Oregon from  September 7 through 10, 1997. Following the conference, an edited  volume will disseminate significant findings. This will be the  first volume on external possession phenomena, and will contain  substantive articles bearing on theoretical advances in the  understanding of verbal argument structure, syntax, typology,  language processing, and cognition.     In bringing together field data on the one hand, with theoretical  and psychological models which do not yet account for them on the  other, the project will help set the stage for new research  agendas in both psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics.",
