The chamber will be a mobile self-contained  system that will be located at the Synchrotron Radiation  Center, University of Wisconsin.  It will be coupled to one  of three existing chambers built specifically for measuring  magnetic circular dichroism, spin-resolved photoelectron  spectroscopy, and x-ray resonant magnetic scattering.  These  methods provide element resolved magnetic moments, spin-  split energy bands, and magnetic roughness, respectively.  The proposed growth chamber will provide a wide variety of  magnetic nanostructures with well characterized morphologies  for these magnetic measurements.  Special emphasis will be  placed on sputter deposited magnetic nanostructures and  comparisons between sputter deposited and evaporated  nanostructures.  %%%%  This award is for the partial support of a new ultra-high  vacuum chamber for the investigation of nanostructure  magnetism.
