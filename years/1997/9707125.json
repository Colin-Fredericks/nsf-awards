 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is experimenting with languages, compilers, and architectures for  large-scale multiprocessors based on functional programming and single assignment  data structures.  The project includes work at USC on translators for functional  languages, and work at the University of Delaware on architectures and  simulations.  The key insight motivating the work is that functional programming  can increase performance of multithreaded systems.  One increase of performance  comes from the ability to move threads among processors.  Another is the  possibility that single assignment data structures can be cached with no need for  coherence traffic, potentially increasing performance of parallel systems.   Research will include development of a program execution model and memory model,  design of a cache management protocol for single-assignment data structures,  translation of benchmarks such as SPLASH 2 into a functional language, and  simulation of the benchmarks running on the new execution model with cache  protocol.  The goal is to measure the extent to which the new models and cache  protocols provide a performance advantage over execution models that permit  multiple assignments.
