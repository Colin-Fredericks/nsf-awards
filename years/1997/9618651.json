 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reinitz  9618651       The investigator with Yuefan Deng of SUNY Stony Brook and  their colleagues study large scale optimization methods applied  to problems concerning gene networks and pattern formation in the  fruit fly Drosophila.  These optimization problems arise in a  method known as \"gene circuits\", which was developed by one of  the principal investigators and his coworkers.  The essence of  this method is the numerical inversion of a set of nonlinear  ordinary differential equations by least squares fits of the  trajectories of the equations to gene expression data obtained by  fluorescence microscopy.  In the past, these fits were performed  by simulated annealing on serial computers using the Metropolis  algorithm under the control of the Lam cooling schedule.  They are  computationally intensive, and the range of problems that can be  considered was limited by the speed of available serial  processors.  The investigators are developing new computational  methods for the solution of these problems on parallel  processors.  Importance sampling is the most efficient, or the  most important, ingredient of an algorithm in treating complex  continuum optimization problems such as the pattern formation  analysis undertaken here.  Simulated annealing is one method for  importance sampling; the investigators are developing a general  method for parallel simulated annealing on nonseparable problems.  Other importance sampling methods are derived from methods that  make use of the continuum properties of the problem at hand, such  as Newton's method.  The investigators develop a family of  parallel importance sampling methods and then synergistically  combine them.  This family of methods includes genetic  algorithms, continuum methods, a Lagrangian reformulation of the  fitting problem, and simulated annealing.       Networks of interacting genes lie at the heart of the  problems that will face biologists and biotechnologists in the  twenty first century.  Processes ranging from embryonic  d evelopment to cell division and cell death are controlled by  networks of genes.  In order to understand how these networks  work, it is necessary to understand their internal \"wiring  diagrams\".  In particular, it is important to know how genes turn  each other on and off.  Modern molecular biology allows  investigators to see which genes are on or off at a given moment,  but in order to understand the \"wiring\" between genes, it is  necessary to analyze changes in gene activity over time and  analyze them by computer.  The method of analysis can be reduced  to an \"optimization\" problem, in which the smallest value of a  complicated function is sought.  In this project, the  investigators are finding new ways to solve optimization problems  on large scale parallel high-performance computers.  Particular  emphasis is placed on parallel methods for simulated annealing,  an exceptionally powerful optimization method.  This research is  important to many areas beyond gene networks.  Simulated annealing  and related methods are used in structural biology and other  biotechnology areas related to drug discovery.  It is also used in  the design of integrated circuits.  These and other areas are  likely to benefit from this work.  Funding for the project is  provided by the program of Computational Mathematics and the  Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS and by the  Developmental Biology program in BIO.",
