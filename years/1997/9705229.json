 "awd_abstract_narration": "Temam  9705229       The understanding of the equations of fluid mechanics and  turbulence as well as the development of efficient numerical  codes for the solution of these equations are challenging  problems of considerable importance, in particular in industry or  for studies in meteorology or global climate change.  The aims  for this project are to explore what can be learned about these  problems from the theoretical and computational viewpoints, using  the dynamical systems approach to turbulence.  More specifically  the investigators and their colleagues intend: (i)  to develop  new efficient computational algorithms taking into account the  physics of turbulence and well adapted to the current evolution  of large scale computing towards parallel computing; (ii)  to  devote special attention to the problems related to the study of  the climate and global changes.  For (i), new multilevel  algorithms related to the concept of attractor and approximate  inertial manifolds have been introduced during the past years.  The analysis of these algorithms is developed, their performances  improved, and their range of application extended, in particular  towards problems of practical relevance.  During the period of  this grant a book will be published on this subject, describing  the state of the art on the theoretical side, and including many  aspects of their actual implementation on parallel computers.  For  (ii), a significant part of this project is devoted to the study  of models for the atmosphere, the ocean and their coupling.  Involved models based on the primitive equations are considered,  as well as simpler models such as multilayer or quasi-geostrophic  models.  The study includes the development of the models and the  mathematical and numerical problems that they raise.       The interaction of meteorology and mathematics has very long  traditions going back to such famous names as Leonard da Vinci,  Pierre Simon Laplace or, in this century, after WWII, John Von  Neumann.  At a more  modest level, the investigators pursue a  program of research initiated a few years ago and aimed at  developing interactions between geosciences and mathematics.  These interactions can be mutually beneficial.  Meteorology and  oceanography raise very challenging mathematical problems very  useful for mathematicians and other scientists (for example  scientists have learned much from the experience of E.  Lorenz in  chaos).  Conversely, mathematicians might help scientists of the  geoscience communities in choosing their models by determining if  they are well posed.  In the long range they might help also  develop new efficient numerical procedures; although the codes  (programs) used in meteorology and oceanography are very involved  codes written over a long period of time, eventually new codes  will be written responding to new needs or new opportunities, and  new insights could become useful; it is hoped to contribute to  this daunting task.",
