The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the  use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month postdoctoral research visit  by Dr. Michael E. McClain of the University of Miami to work with Dr.  Carlos A. Llerena at the Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina in Lima,  Peru.  Dr. McClain will initiate a regional analysis of hydrological and  biogeochemical processes operating at the terrestrial-aquatic interface  of rivers in the eastern Andean cordillera of Peru.  This project will  link with another NSF sponsored program, the Carbon in the Amazon River  Experiment (CAMREX).  This research indicates that riparian zones are  particularly active environments of chemical change and transport.  It  is critical that a baseline of chemical and dynamic data be collected  now, for comparison to physical basin characteristics before extensive  development of the often targeted riparian zones. It is an important  idea to calibrate these processes chemically and relate them to broad  catchment properties that can be remotely sensed on a large scale and  interpreted within the context of a GIS model.  This work will also  provide the nucleus of another research initiative, the Andean Amazon  Rivers Analysis and Monitoring (AARAM) Project, which is being funded  initially by the Inter American Institute for Global Change Researah.  It will link scientists from Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil,  France and the U.S.          ***",
