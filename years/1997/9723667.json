 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lindsay   9723667    Following fertilization, the egg extracellular matrix is modified to prevent further sperm contact with the egg, thus maintaining the diploid state of the zygote. Using Xenopus laevis as a model system a block to polyspermy mechanism has been identified which involves the limited proteolysis of extracellular matrix (egg envelope) glycoproteins by proteases released from the activated egg. The known molecules involved are: 1) an envelope glycoprotein component which undergoes limited proteolysis at fertilization (gp69); 2) a chymotrypsin-like protease (ovochymase), which is localized to extracellular matrix fibers within the perivitelline space of the egg (the space between the plasma membrane and the overlying envelope); and 3) a trypsin-like protease released from the egg which activates ovochymase. In the last grant period, ovochymase and gp69 were cloned, the trypsin-like protease was purified, and it was revealed that ovochymase is not directly responsible for gp69 hydrolysis as originally hypothesized. Specific objectives for the proposed research are to: (1) Purify and characterize the egg protease directly responsible for gp69 hydrolysis; (2) Determine the role of ovochymase in the protease cascade; (3) Clone the trypsin-like protease for structure/function studies; (4) Immunolocalize the trypsin-like protease within the inactivated egg; and (5) Determine the function of gp69 hydrolysis in sperm binding and/or envelope hardening. The results of this study will provide an increased understanding of the regulation of sperm-egg interactions through proteolytic processing of the extracellular matrix, a mechanism which is fundamental to animal development.",
