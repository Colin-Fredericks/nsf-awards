 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9603784  Chiles         The goal of the proposed research is to understand how B  lymphocytes grow and divide.  B lymphocytes are cellular  components of the animal immune system and their major function  is to produce antibodies or immunoglobulins.  Antibodies are  proteins that bind foreign substances and aid in their  elimination  from the body.  When the immune system detects  foreign substance, B cells initially respond by growing and then  producing antibodies.  Proliferation of B cells is controlled by  both extracellular growth stimulatory and inhibitory signals  acting principally in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.  The  intracellular mechanisms by which these different signals produce  changes in the growth response of B lymphocytes are unknown.  The  present work focuses on the regulation of a protein kinase,  cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdck4).  It is proposed that  Cdk4 is a necessary component in B cells which functions to  mediate the action of extracellular growth signals.  Cdk4 has  been shown to activate cellular proteins involved in promoting  cell division and maturation in many non-lymphoid cell types.  Therefore, the mechanisms underlying the activation of Cdk4 by  growth promoting and growth inhibitory signals in primary B cell  is the major focus of this study.  A comprehensive analysis will  be made of the regulation of intracellular proteins that control  the activity of Cdk4, including G1 cyclin and Cdk inhibitor  proteins (Cdk-1s).  Studies will also focus on ascertaining  whether Cdk4 is required for cell cycle division by blocking the  expression of Cdk4 in B cells  The results of these studies will  define the regulation of key cell cycle regulatory components  which directly control the clonal expansion of primary B  lymphocytes.   These studies will be done in normal B cells,  whereas most studies are done on  cell lines.      These studies are aimed at determining the regulation of the cell  cycle in response to growth stimulatory and inhibitory signals   which control the expansion of mature normal B cells.        ***",
