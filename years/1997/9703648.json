 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703648  Kotelenez   The investigator will work on the derivation of physically meaningful stochastic   partial differential equations (SPDEs) from systems of diffusing and interacting particles.   The main difference from the traditional approach for N diffusing particles is that the   fluctuations will be represented by \"correlated\" Brownian motions (representing the   fluctuation forces), where the strength of the correlations depends on the distance of  two   given particles and a parameter, the so-called correlation length. Consequently, the SPDEs   will depend on the correlation length as a parameter. Macroscopic and central limit   theorems are expected, as the correlation length tends to zero. Further, the investigator   will study the qualitative properties of the SPDEs. Homogeneous, isotropic and stationary   random fields shall be derived as solutions of the SPDEs, and the spectral analysis of the   random fields in terms of the coefficients of the SPDEs shall be conducted.   Mathematically, the proposed work will build a bridge between 4 different areas of   mathematics, namely particle systems, SPDEs, random fields and partial differential   equations.   Many physical, biological and economic phenomena consist of a large number of   components. The large number and the rapid changes of the components make an exact   description of the time evolution of all components very difficult , if not impossible.   Examples are turbulence, chemical reactions, diffusion, spreading of diseases (viruses,   bacteria), population growth, environmental pollution, climate, weather, financial markets   etc. To build a mathematical model of those phenomena, the real world systems of atoms,   molecules, viruses etc. are replaced by random particle systems whose time evolution can   serve as a good predictor for  the real world systems. A more traditional model for the   same phenomena are macroscopic (deterministic) partial differential equations, many of   which, more than  a century ago, became the ma in theoretical tools in different areas of   physics and engineering and also, more recently, in some areas of the biosciences and   economics. Such an equation typically describes \"how much mass (of some matter) is at a   given place at a given time.\" Mathematically, most of those macroscopic equations can be   derived from particle systems by a limit procedure, assuming that the number of particles   becomes infinite and their respective masses become very small, and that the motion of   particles is always statistically uncorrelated. This derivation also explains why the   macroscopic equations often do not correctly predict the time evolution of the real world   systems, but that in the long run they appear to be an average of many observations.   Macroscopic equations, however,  are easier to compute than particle systems. The   investigator will extend the model of macroscopic partial differential equations to a model   of  mezoscopic (stochastic) partial differential equations. The mezoscopic equations shall   be derived from particle systems in the same way as the macroscopic equations, but under   more realistic assumptions on the particle systems, namely that the motion of particles is   statistically correlated, when they are close to one another.  As a result the mezoscopic   equations should be in better agreement with observations than the macroscopic   equations, while preserving the computational simplicity of the latter ones. Moreover, the   macroscopic equations will appear as the  limiting case of the mezoscopic equations.   Mezoscopic equations will have diverse applications in physical chemistry, the biosciences,   fluid mechanics and financial markets.",
