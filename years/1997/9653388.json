 "awd_abstract_narration": "New faculty at research intensive universities as well as new and more senior faculty at universities which emphasize teaching are under increasing pressure to broaden their skills and expertise to equally encompass research and teaching. Additionally, new faculty at a variety of institutions are facing increased personal stress as they attempt to balance a variety of personal and professional obligations.  This project's vision is to create self-supporting networks among Minority Institution (MI) faculty and between MI faculty and faculty at research-intensive institutions by bringing together current and near-term faculty from these institutions to learn from and instruct each other. Senior faculty will provide guidance to new faculty, those trained in the latest research techniques will teach those less practiced or whose specialties are no longer current. Particular emphasis is placed on involving current doctoral students interested in pursuing faculty careers. In all cases, those willing to invest the time and energy to expand their skills will have the opportunity to network with others of similar interests.  During the next 3 years, 90 faculty and senior graduate students selected from among applicants at MI's and research intensive institutions will participate in an intensive 5-day workshop held at the University of Notre Dame. This workshop will emphasize a review of best pedagogic practices, strategies for initiating or revitalizing a research program, and instruction on effective mentoring practices for undergraduate students.  This project builds on existing collaborations which the GEM Consortium has with faculty at a variety of institutions. This project promises to leverage the resources and expertise of new and senior faculty at a variety of institutions to build collaborative networks to improve teaching, research, and mentoring.",
