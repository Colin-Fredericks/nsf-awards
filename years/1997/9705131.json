These  compounds exhibit correlated electron behavior, and in particular  antiferromagnetism. In the superconducting phases,  the  residual  antiferromagnetism  is  poorly  understood.   This   experimental  project   will   clarify   the  residual  antiferromagnetism   by  scattering  experiments  using  visible,  ultraviolet,  or  x-ray  photons,  to  study  excitations  wherein  an  electron  from  an  occupied initial state makes a transition to an unoccupied  final  state,  accompanied by a redistribution of charge. The objectives  are (1) to understand how electronic charge excitations couple to  electronic  spin  excitations  (magnons)  and  to  lower   energy  electronic  charge excitations, which may include superconducting  gap  excitations;  (2)  to  validate inelastic  x-ray  scattering  techniques for studying electronic charge excitations  at  finite  momentum   transfer;   (3)   to  better   understand   electronic  excitations in conventional metals and semiconductors through use  of  inelastic  x-ray scattering techniques. The experiments  will  employ a combination of low energy and high energy photon probes.  These  include  low  energy optical absorption;  resonance  Raman  scattering, especially resonant two-magnon scattering; UV excited  Raman   scattering,  and  two  new  techniques,  inelastic  s-ray  scattering  spectroscopy  (IXSS)  and  resonant  inelastic  x-ray  scattering  spectroscopy (RIXSS), which provide  data  at  finite  momentum  transfer. The work is expected to advance knowledge  of  both  strongly-correlated electronic systems and of inelastic  x-  ray scattering.  %%%  This research project experimentally studies the unusual behavior  of   the  cuprate  compounds  which  when  \"dop ed\"  become   high  temperature  superconductors. These  \"parent  compounds\"  exhibit  unusual behavior, including antiferromagnetism, which is to  some  extent  retained in the superconducting phases.  It  is  believed  that  a  better understanding of the normal and parent phases  of  these  materials is necessary for understanding of the  unusually  strong   superconductivity  when  suitably  doped.  The   present  experimental   project  will  address  the  important   questions  concerning  the  antiferromagnetic behavior, by a combination  of  measurements  of the scattering of photons (visible, ultraviolet,  and x-ray) by these compounds. A portion of the work will utilize  the Raman effect, and another portion will utilize a new advanced  experimental technique, inelastic x-ray scattering, which is  now  available   at   the  Advanced  Photon  Source,   a   world-class  synchrotron  light  source  which is  located  near  the  Argonne  National  Laboratory.  The work will advance  knowledge  of  both  strongly-correlated electronic systems and also of the  inelastic  x-ray  scattering process. The study of these materials and their  unusual magnetism is valuable as a testing ground for theories of  magnetic,  optical,  and electrical properties of  the  cuprates,  which can then be more confidently applied to other systems;  and  in  the  search for novel properties and new compounds which  may  find  new  application in technology. This  research  project  is  interdisciplinary  in  nature  and  involves  both  graduate  and  postdoctoral  students who will be excellently trained  to  enter  positions in industry, government or education.  ***",
