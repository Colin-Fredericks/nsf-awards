 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708561  Mish  The  goal  of  this workshop is to develop a format  for  an  Internet-based    environment    to    foster     productive  collaborations  among  geographically-distributed  teams  of  researchers,  especially  among  researchers  in  earthquake  engineering applications, focusing on applications in siting  and geotechnical systems.  It will be held during the summer  of  1997 on the campus of the California State University at  Chico.    The workshop consists of three components:    Phase 1 consists of the preparation for the actual workshop,  utilizing    the   capabilities   of   the   Internet    for  communications.   As  such,  it  is  a  \"virtual   workshop\"  intended  to  demonstrate  the key  characteristics  of  the  desired    electronic    collaborative    framework.     Key  technologies  will  be made available in a  simplified  form  appropriate for demonstration purposes.  Each  demonstration  will  be accompanied  by  collaborative  correspondence among members of the target audience, so that  the  full  impact  of  the technology can  be  detailed  and  clarified.    In  phase 2, the \"physical workshop\", the results from Phase  1 will be discussed to provide a more detailed assessment of  the requisite computer technology needed.  The workshop will  summarize  and  extend an understanding of the  technologies  demonstrated  in  Phase  1, in order  to  provide  necessary  detail   for   the  needs  of  the  earthquake   engineering  community.    Phase  3, the documentation phase, will prepare and  publish  the  proceedings  of  the workshop.   The  proceedings  will  include a formal specification for the implementation of the  Internet collaborative framework.  The lessons learned  from  the  workshop  will  be encapsulated in a  functional  needs  document.  This functional assessment will be circulated for  approval  by the earthquake engineering community, following  which  it  will be translated into a technical specification  to  serve  as a blueprint  for future implementation  of  the  virtual collaborative environment.    The   dissemination  and  implementation  of  the   workshop  proceedings  will  yield an important demonstration  of  new  technologies  for fostering productive collaborations  among  geographically    distributed  teams  of  researchers.    In  addition  to  providing obvious standards  of  practice  for  engineers in the earthquake engineering community (for  such  basic  topics  as  report preparation and dissemination  via  electronic  means), it will deliver concrete  demonstrations  of  modern  Internet technologies, along with  the  type  of  \"hands-on\"  documentation that will be  required  to  permit  others  to implement the results developed via the  \"virtual  workshop\" and the actual workshop.",
