Photo-induced-fluorescence measurements  and  mass  spectroscopy will be used to determine  the  time  evolution  and spatial distribution of the carbon precursors  responsible for buckytube and nanowire formation.   A  model  will be developed to explain the observed physical phenomena  of buckytube formation.  %%%  Several  areas of application are being explored  for  these  materials.   The  emission of electrons due to  high  fields  applied to the buckytube tips are being studied for possible  application to flat panel displays.  The electron  transport  properties  of  copper  nanowires  are  being  studied   for  possible   application   as  interconnects   in   integrated  circuits.   This is a well integrated research and education  project  that  has  involved  graduate  students,  postdocs,  undergraduates, college teachers and high school teachers.  ***",
