 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will expand the evidentiary base for our understanding of the relationship between science and the concept of gender before they are their relationship were transformed during the nineteenth century.   By doing this the project will also reevaluate the emergence of science as a significant source of cultural and social authority.  Much of the existing historical literature attributes to the fields of anatomy, physiology, and psychology in the years before 1800 a cultural power that only developed by fits and starts during the nineteenth century.  Research materials for this project include lecture notes, correspondence, early printed materials, and municipal records that will be obtained from university, professional and public archives in Britain and the Netherlands.  Publications likely to result from this project include a monograph and a sourcebook for university students, which will provide them access to rare research materials.",
