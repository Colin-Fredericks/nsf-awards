 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9604589  Miller      This research is  concerned with the B-G family of highly  polymorphic genes which are located in the major  histocompatibility complex, and which may represent one of the  elements in vertebrate immune defense particularly subject to  specialization and evolutionary change. B-G genes have been  detected in only a few species, and have been examined in the  chicken.  This gene family encodes surface molecules that have a  structures suggesting a receptor/signaling function.  B-G gene  expression in the chicken indicates that some of the genes of  this group are expressed together in a tissue specific manner.  The experiments here will look at the patterns of expression of  the B-G molecules in the chicken, the sequence differences  in  the intracellular and extracellular portions of the molecules,  and the ability of these molecules to enhance the immune  response. These experiments will provide information about  another poorly studied component of the immune system and its  function in the chicken.  %%%  These experiments are dealing with a group of genes which are  present within the major histocompatibility complex of some  species, and which are important in the immune response. This  work will be done in chickens and will provide information about  the immune system of other species.                      ***",
