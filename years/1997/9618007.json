 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cary      9618007                  Almost 20 years ago researchers discovered unique communities of  organisms inhabiting deep-sea hydrothermal vents located along the Eastern  Pacific mid-ocean spreading centers. The question of how these species  disperse and maintain their populations in these patchy, ephemeral habitats  has remained one of the most interesting and unanswered problems in vent  ecology. This study will be part of the Larvae-at-Ridge-Vents Project  (LARVE), which is a component of the ongoing Ridge Inter-Disciplinary Global  Experiments (RIDGE) program.  Central to the success of LARVE is  understanding the way in which hydrothermal-vent species maintain  populations. Results of earlier work suggest that vent species produce  pelagic larvae that are responsible for colonization of new vent sites and  for maintaining populations at established sites. However, available  evidence is almost entirely circumstantial. The patchiness of vent fields  (in time and space) compounds the problem and demands innovative solutions  that use the most tractable species as models for dispersal and recruitment.  The focus of the research will be the vent crab, Bythograea thermydron. This  crab shares the life-history characteristics that have made decapod  crustaceans the taxon-ofchoice for a great many shallow-water studies of  dispersal and recruitment.      The central hypothesis of the study maintains that Bythograea  thermydron disperses among vent sites via demersal larvae that take  advantage of both subtidal bottom currents and the well developed swimming  ability of the larvae.  Understanding the life histories and the biological  and physical constraints on dispersal of crabs from vents sites is critical  to establishing credible models of how these communities are established and  maintained along mid-ocean ridges.",
