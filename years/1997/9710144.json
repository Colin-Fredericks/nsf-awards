 "awd_abstract_narration": "In September 1996, under the auspices of the Commission on Social and Behavioral Sciences, NAS, and the National Science Foundation, a two-day workshop was held in Washington, DC, to bring together researchers and scholars to discuss on-going and key research on current efforts to enhance quality in US organizations.  Several researchers reported on work-in-progress, and the assembled scholars considered ways in which quality research could both better inform and be improved by closer linkages to the organizations research community.  This workshop was stimulating and useful to the research of the participants and observers.  This project is for a follow-on workshop to reassemble many of the participants from the first workshop, as well as some additional scholars.  The overall aim of this workshop will be to improve the papers initiated at the first workshop with an eye toward creating an edited volume, as well as to continue to strengthen the conceptual links between TQO topics and core topics from disciplines such as organization theory, sociology, and psychology.",
