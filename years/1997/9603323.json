 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is a collaboration between Donald Janssen of the University of   Washington and Jochen Stark of the University of Weimar.  The purpose of the research is   to study the response of aggregate concretes to freeze-thaw cycles in order to understand   why they fail and to identify aggregates that are susceptible to damage.  The collaboration draws on the complementary expertise of the foreign and domestic   research groups, and the different testing methods make comparison testing possible.  The   German group has considerable experience in testing concrete for resistance to salt scaling   and the microstructural evaluation.  The U.S. group has 10 years of experience   investigating D-cracking mechanisms and susceptibility.  Results of the collaboration are   expected to include development of improved identification of frost-susceptible   aggregates, improved understanding of the frost damage mechanism in aggregates, and the   development of U.S. experience in the use of alternate testing procedures.",
