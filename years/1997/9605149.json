 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will continue its Research Experiences for Undergraduates site.  Academically successful students will be chosen from a national applicant pool to participate in research projects of UNC faculty.  Faculty will be investigators using molecular-biological approaches, but research will not be limited to a single field.  Emphasis will be placed on recruiting students from schools with limited research opportunities, students without prior independent research experience, and students from groups historically underrespresented in the sciences.  The primary focus of the training program will be encouraging and facilitating pursuit of research careers and, secondarily, assisting students with interests in other science-based careers to appreciate the nature of research.  Other goals include introducing students to a diversity of biological research areas and technology, teaching the process of independent  research and conducting controlled experiments, fostering self-confidence and team-working ability, promoting development of skills in observation, recording, and interpreting data, providing opportunities for oral and written communication of research findings, and providing career guidance and information about scientific professions in academia, government, and industry.  Program activities will include (1) 10 weeks of independent research during the summer, (2) weekly meetings with invited speakers from academic, government, and private research institutions, (3) field trips to major research pharmaceutical companies, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the UNC Institute of Marine Sciences, (4) a graduate-student roundtable to discuss the nature of postgraduate training and (5) a symposium in which all participants will present oral  reports of their work.  The University will defray part of the cost of sending up to 10 program participants a year to scientific meetings.  Program effectiveness will be assessed from exit surveys and long-term tracking; the Office of Educational Development will provide consultation in design of evaluation tools.",
