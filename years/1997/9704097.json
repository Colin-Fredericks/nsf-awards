The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research  visit by Dr. John E. Layne to work with Dr. William J. P.  Barnes at the University of Glasgow in Scotland.    Dr. Layne will examine the physiological mechanisms that  underlie the course control during locomotion in the Blue  Land Crab, Cardisoma guanhumi.  This will by a lab study in  which extracellular recordings from visual and statocyst  interneurons, eyecup motoneurones and muscles will be  correlated with measurements of the eye and leg movements  induced by rotation of the visual field and of the body.  A  related field study will be done to observe how crabs make  use of visual information during locomotion in their natural  environment, by disrupting their sensory guidance systems  (vision, statocyst organ), and observing its affect on basic  locomotion and oriented behavior (escape, homing).  This  study will provide an understanding of the process of visual  flow analysis.  The host lab is part of the Division of  Environmental and Evolutionary Biology, which contains  several behavioral scientists.  It will also provide close  links with neuroscientists in other divisions of the  Institute of Biomedical and Life Sciences.  The host, Dr.  Barnes, has studied eye movements at a behavioral level for  many years, and has established the current behavioral  models fmr flow field analysis in invertebrates.      ***",
