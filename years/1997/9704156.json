 "awd_abstract_narration": "Baker/Abstract  9704156         The PI plans to use a single crystal evolution model developed  in collaboration with Dr. J. Nelson to investigate the vapor growth  and sublimation of individual ice crystals in realistic  atmospheres.  This model produces steady state growth shapes and  predicts the conditions under which the crystals are hollow.  The  model will be run with SO2 as well as water vapor in the particle  environment to study the simultaneous takeup of the two gases.  The  chemical composition of the ensuing particles will be examined as  a function of assumed ice nucleus content as well as environmental  gas concentrations, temperature and pressure.         After the single study is completed, the results will be used  in a Lagrangian parcel study of the evolving characteristics (size  and chemical composition distributions) of ice particle populations  in realistic atmospheres          This work will be carried out in informal collaboration with  Dr. Nelson (U. Arizona), with Dr. T. Peter and his colleagues at  the MPI fur Chemie in Mainz, who are studying takeup of SO2 on  single crystals in the laboratory, and with Dr. Noone and his  collaborators rom Stockholm University, who will be collecting in  situ data on microphysical evolution in cirrus clouds.         These studies will be useful in providing a self-consistent  picture of cirrus particles, and will add physical realism to the  models now used, which are based largely on spherical particle  analogues and do not incorporate modern ideas on the crystal/vapor  interface.  The final stage of the study will be the comparison of  the new models with the parameterizations used in GCM's to assess  the usefulness of the parameterizations.",
