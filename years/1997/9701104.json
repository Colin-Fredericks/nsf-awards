While some anatomical regions  undergo major evolutionary transformations, others are  resistant to change.  The relations among structures in one  part of the vertebrae head, the sphenoid region, have  remained constant during five hundred million years of  evolution despite numerous modifications in other parts of  the skull.       Classical comparative anatomy and contemporary  molecular and cellular approaches are combined to  investigate morphogenetic processes involved in pattering  the sphenoid skeleton and t characterize developmental  properties that may enable evolutionary conservation of this  region across vertebrates.  Two complementary studies are  proposed.  The first identifies specific elements that are  important in pattering the sphenoid skeleton.  Previously  performed experiments such as gene knockouts, surgical  manipulations, and teratogen treatments are analyzed to  generate data on how perturbations to the neural tube,  notochord, trigeminal nerve, and pituitary gland affect the  sphenoid skeleton possess intrinsic patterning information.  This involves new experimental transplantations of neural  crest and mesodermal cells.       This investigation 1) provides and understanding of how  morphogenetic events affect skeletal patterning, 2) gives  new insights on the integration of complex cranial  structures, and 3) contributes important examples to the  study of developmental interactions in morphological  evolution.",
