Dr.  Holroyd will work with Dr. Tsunehiro Takeda, director of the  BCL, on a research project entitled, \"Non-invasive  Measurement of the Dynamic Nature of Human Brain Functions.\"    The proposed research will investigate the way that  different brain areas interact during perceptual and  behavioral tasks by measuring the magnetic field of the  brain.  The techniques used are completely non-invasive: the  tissues of the head are transparent to magnetic fields,  allowing relatively accurate mapping of the magnetic field  produced by electrical activity in the brain, with  millisecond time resolution.  The research focuses on the  reorganization of brain processes, and is motivated by  theoretical work on pattern formation and change in complex  systems.  Changes in a subject's perceptions or behavioral  patterns will be experimentally induced, and observations  will be made of corresponding reorganization of the magnetic  field.  By combining these observations with spatial  information from control conditions, researchers will be  able to determine the dynamics of different brain areas  during the perceptual or behavioral reorganization.  Reproducible dynamic relations among interacting brain areas  will provide insight into how the brain organizes and  reorganizes itself during typical cognitive functions.  ***",
