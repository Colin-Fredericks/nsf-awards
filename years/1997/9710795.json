 "awd_abstract_narration": "9710795    The organization of the enzymes that work at biological  membrane surfaces will be studied by combining expertise in  chemistry, physics and biology.  Indirect measurements  suggest that their activity may be determined by their  arrangement (single, dimeric or aggregated) and by the  length of time they spend at the surface.  In turn, the  organization and dwell time of the enzyme is altered by the  lipid composition of the membrane.  The goal is to directly  observe the state of these enzymes under a variety of  conditions using scanning probe microscopy (SPM), and to  correlate these results with their catalytic properties  measured under similar conditions.  Robust models of  biological membranes suitable for examination by SPM will be  developed.   Then these model  systems will be adapted for measuring enzyme activities and  the membrane state using optical spectroscopy and  electrochemical techniques. Preliminary experiments  conducted by undergraduate students and faculty show that  the methods proposed are feasible and the information  obtained will address a fundamental question about how cell  activities are controlled.  Over the life of this project,  twenty  or more undergraduate students will experience  collaborative, interdisciplinary research with sophisticated  equipment, addressing problems that could not be solved by a  single researcher or discipline alone.     Nontechnical Abstract    This project focuses on cell membranes, thin layers of  proteins and lipids that are crucial structures within and  bordering the cells of all living organisms. Cell membranes  have many functions including  providing a means of  organizing other components of the cell and regulating  traffic and information flow between the inside and outside  of the cell. One can describe the cell membrane in terms of  its average composition, but this is not sufficient to tell  us how the membrane functions.  The tools are just being  developed to describe the cell membrane at the level of  detai l needed to understand its function. One new technique,  scanning probe microscopy (SPM),  measures the physical  features of the membrane at a molecular scale by probing in  a manner analogous to the way the needle of a record player  systematically touches the record and converts the small  changes in the vinyl to an electrical signal and then to  music.  This type of probing  will allow the description of  the membrane at the level of detail necessary to explain at  least one of its functions, the control of an important  signaling pathway that requires special interactions between  a protein and the membrane lipids.",
