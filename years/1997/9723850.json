 "awd_abstract_narration": "9723850  Stanley  The XIV International Symposium on Glycoconjugates will be held in Zurich, Switzerland, September 7-12, 1997. The Symposium, which is sponsored by the International Glycoconjugate Organization, is the major international meeting of scientists in glycoconjugate research. In order for junior scientists to attend and present their data and further exchange on the international level, it is necessary to obtain travel funds for them. A review of submitted requests by a panel consisting of members of the Board of Directors of the Society of Glycobiology will be used to rank the applicants. This ranking will be based on individual accomplishments and quality and impact of the research to be presented at the meeting.    Scientific progress proceeds as the result of exchange of ideas among investigators at conferences.  It is important that junior scientists be exposed to national and international conferences where the exchange of ideas will have great impact on their career development. This award will supply funds to support the travel of junior scientists to an international conference.  The award of funds to this conference is particularly appropriate because the Society of Glycobiology has chosen to make the awards to junior investigators in a competition. This will not only raise the quality of the work presented and supported by the travel award but it will assure that the awards will go to junior investigators who are the most competitive within their field and who will later become prominent scientists.   ***",
