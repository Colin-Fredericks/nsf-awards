 "awd_abstract_narration": "In  many  robotic manipulation tasks, especially assembly  tasks,  motion of objects in contact is common and even desired in  order  to reduce uncertainties. An important tool in dealing with motion  in  contact is reasoning about contact states, which is the focus  of this project. Specifically, this research has two major goals:  (1)  to  investigate  proper representation of  discrete  contact  states and state transitions, and (2) to investigate criteria and  techniques for automatic planning of contact motions in terms  of  contact  state  transitions.   The  first  major  research   goal  responds  to  the fact that although various ways of representing  discrete  contact  states for polyhedra  have  been  proposed  in  related  research,  there  is a lack of  general  and  systematic  investigation on the best way(s) of defining/representing contact  states and state transitions based on certain important criteria,  such   as  (i)  how  easy  it  is  to  describe/represent   state  transitions,  and  (ii)  how easy it is to  distinguish  adjacent  states.  The  first  criterion is  important  from  the  need  of  automatic   generation  of  contact  state  space.   The   second  criterion,  addressing  the  granularity  of  representation,  is  particularly  important from the need of automatic identification  of  contact  states in the presence of uncertainties. The  second  major  research goal is closely related to the first one  and  is  particularly  aimed at flexible assembly tasks. In pursuing  both  goals,  theoretical  concepts will be validated  by  experimental  implementations and executions. This will result in a fundamental  understanding  of the physics of the most common  assembly  tasks  and   relate  this  knowledge  quantitatively  to  the   planning  processes  which  can  perform them in flexible  assembly.   This  collaborative  effort is expected to lead to  results  that  will  significantly  impact  the  design,  evaluation,  generation  and  execution  of  conta ct-motion plans  for  automatic  assembly  in  general.",
