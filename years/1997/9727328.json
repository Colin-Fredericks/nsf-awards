 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727328  Charlie  This action is to support the participation of Prof. Wayne  Charlie, Colorado State University, in CANLEX -- the  Canadian Liquefaction Experiment.    Many large structures, such as hydroelectric dams and  tailings dams, are either built on sand deposits, or are  partially constructed with sand. If the sand is loose and is  loaded rapidly, then the structure of the sand can collapse,  the soil can liquefy and a large amount of strength can be  lost. A major research effort is underway to study the  behavior of loose cohesionless soils. Much of this research  is part of a large collaborative research project called the  Canadian Liquefaction Experiment (CANLEX). This project is  controlled and managed at the University of Alberta in  collaboration with the Universities of Laval, Carleton and  British Columbia and with industrial support from Syncrude,  Suncor, B.C. Hydro, Quebec Hydro, Kennecott and Highland  Valley Copper.    Current research includes the study of the mechanical and  geophysical properties of loose sands and the development of  appropriate constitutive models. Research also includes the  study of mine waste materials found in large waste dumps.    Prof. Charlie is assisting in the current phase of this  project, namely to subject the Syncrude site in Alberta to  blast loading in an attempt to simulate earthquake cycling  loading.  The objective is to generate pore pressures in the  deposit of saturated loose sand sufficient to cause the site  to liquefy.  This is an area in which Prof. Charlie has had  considerable experience.",
