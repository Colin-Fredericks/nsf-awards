 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Majewski  The research to be carried out involves the creation of the deepest survey  of positions, absolute proper motions, multi-color charged-coupled-device  (CCD) photometry, and spectroscopy for a complete, magnitude limited survey  of Galactic stars. The study builds upon the results from earlier work in a  single field at the North Galactic Pole (NGP) to assemble high quality  proper motions, photometric parallaxes, photometric abundances and radical  velocities as a means to explore the combined dimensional phase space and  metallicity distribution of stars in the Galactic halo, disk, and  Intermediate Population II thick disk. Among the discoveries of this  earlier, high precision proper motion survey at the NGP were: (1), the  large scale height and local normalization of the ubiquitous Intermediate  Population II (IPII) thick disk stars; (2), an apparently smooth  kinematical gradient between the population I disk and IPII field stars;  and (3), a retrograde rotation for the Galactic halo stars. The addition of  spectroscopy  data to the deep proper motions has confirmed the additional  discovery of a retrograde moving group of halo stars 4.5 kpc above the  Galactic plane, and this result has allowed the elucidation of this  kinematical structure as just one of several large scale, stellar streams  in this part of the sky. The implications of these findings are: (1) the  halo is not a dynamically relaxed system, but rather seems to contain  streams of coherently moving debris from the break-up of stellar  agglomerations, (2) differences among halo survey results might be  attributable to differences in lines of sight, each characterized by local  streaming motions rather than by global descriptions, and (3) the bulk of  the halo field star population appears to be derived from the accretion of  stellar systems, most likely Galactic satellites. This conclusion has  apparently been confirmed with the discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf  spheroidal galaxy, a Galactic satellit e in the process of tidal disruption  by the Milky Way.  The aim is to carry out similar astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic  analyses in nine other fields that lie along two orthogonal, meridional  planes of the Galaxy.  Photographic plates from the Kitt Peak 4-m telescope  will be scanned with the University of Virginia PDS microdensitometer to  construct stellar catalogues and for the measurement of proper motions.  Multifiber spectroscopy with the HYDRA system on the WIYN 3.5-m telescope  will provide the third dimension of velocity as well as spectroscopic  abundances. This survey, the deepest in situ study of field dwarf stars  ever carried out, will allow systematic probing of the thin disk,  Intermediate population II and halo without the selection biases that  affect other types of Galactic structure surveys.  By mapping the halo  phase space distribution along the two meridional planes, it will be  possible to (a) constrain the halo stream angular correlation scale, by  looking for similar structures in adjacent fields, (b) measure the volume  overfilling factor of streams (found to be ~3 in the NGP field) in the  halo, and c look for correlations between the field star streams and  Galactic satellites, globular clusters, and the alignment planes of these  objects.  The research program involves extensive involvement of both undergraduate  and graduate students, who are involved, indeed critical, to all phases of  the astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic analysis. To increase  understanding  Galactic structure and astrometric research that has been  conducted at the University of Virginia throughout its long history in  these endeavors, three additional efforts of educational outreach will be  initiated for the benefit of both University students and the general  public. Each effort centers on conversion of the McCormick Observatory to a  unique, first class educational facility: (1) New instrumentation for the  historic 26\" Clark refractor telescope will provide a quick c onversion from  eyepiece to CCD observation, as a means to broaden the scope of both course-  related and \"Open to the Public\" night instruction with the astrometric  telescope. The CCD will increase the efficiency of telescope viewing by  large groups of visitors, provide the basis for new kinds of undergraduate  laboratory exercises, demonstrate modern methods in astronomy, allow  classroom instruction via computer display of live telescope images, and  provide easier access to telescope viewing for elderly, disabled or very  young visitors. (2) The addition of a teaching spectrograph will fill an  important gap in the present astronomy majors program. (3) Finally, we will  take advantage of McCormick's long tradition of astrometry to create a one  of a kind museum of astronomical measuring devices. On the order of 5,000  people per year will take advantage of these improvements to the McCormick  Observatory.",
