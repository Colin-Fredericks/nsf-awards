The overall goal of the field program is to obtain  detailed structural, petrographic, isotopic, and geochronological  information that bears on the history of early Paleozoic  magmatism in northern Victoria Land (NVL), and to relate this  information to plate convergence during the Ross Orogeny.  The  group will test the hypothesis that high temperature-low pressure  metamorphism in NVL occurred within the regional contact  metamorphic aureole of fundamentally arc-related plutons, within  a structural regime related to convergence. Detailed structural  studies by the PI are expected to help characterize the dynamic  setting in which the plutons were emplaced and correlate  structural fabrics in host rock with changes in pressure-  temperature conditions of metamorphic recrystallization in host  rocks.  The work will be used to verify the polarity of the  magmatic arc during plutonism and establish the relationships  with early Paleozoic plutons to the south.  The  results of this  work will be used to infer the configuration of AntarcticaOs  early Paleozoic active margin in NVL, for comparison with models  developed in other parts of the Transantarctic Mountains.  Interpretations developed in the course of this work will be  integrated with tectonic and structural interpretations for other  parts of the proto-Pacific margin of Gondwana.    Methods used in the study will include structural mapping,  structural and metamorphic petrology, and fluid inclusion  analysis.  The field program in \\centered on the Deep Freeze  Range, with an additional possibility of examining sites in the  vicinity of the Lanterman Range.  The specific contribution  supported by this award will be study and interpretation of the  relations between deformation, magmatic pulses, and high  temperature-low pressure metamorphic recrystallization.",
