 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT-DMS 9701307    Semmes         This project is largely concerned with notions of  \"complexity\", i.e., concrete measurements of how complicated a given  object is.  Finite and combinatorial notions of complexity play a  basic role in computer science, but one can also see analogous ideas  at play in traditional areas of mathematics, in connection with  analysis, geometry, and topology, for instance.  In the present  project we take much of our inspiration from the ideas and methods of  real-variable harmonic analysis, but the structures that we consider  will be predominantly geometric in nature.     In asking what is \"complexity\" one should also ask what is  \"simplicity\".  Traditional mathematics offers a rich variety of  answers to both questions, and these answers are often connected to  various forms of computational efficiency.  In this proposal we shall  mostly be concerned with notions of geometric or combinatorial  structure in which there are some nontrivial rules or patterns but  perhaps also moderate amounts of bending, breaking, or other  disturbances.  In particular, we would like to develop new methods for  identifying, measuring, and comparing forms of structure in ways that  are flexible enough to accommodate substantial distortion.",
