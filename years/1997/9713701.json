 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with the development of an integrated  methodology for modeling, design and control of electromagnetic  systems. An approach to developing this integrated methodology  consist of two basic components: Development of a modeling and  design strategy for the electromagnet actuation scheme using  Permanent-ElectroMagnet (PEM) combinations that support the large  travel and the high stiffness performance requirements, and the  formulation of a discrete time, robust nonlinear control  architecture that guarantees ultra precision tracking performance  under external disturbances and plant variations. This tight  coupling between the design of the electromagnetic actuation  scheme and that of the control architecture ensures that the  entire system responds at the stringent performance levels  demanded of it. Results from this project provide a clear  methodology for designing electromagnetic actuation schemes given  a set of performance requirements; improve the understanding of  nonlinear, discrete time control in the context of high  performance electromechanical systems; and enable technology that  is essential for the development of magnetic suspension  actuators. By adding PEM combination, the research project  enhances the capabilities of the large travel Magnetic Suspension  Actuator currently under development at the Coordinate Metrology  and Measurement Laboratory at Ohio State University. It leads to  a system that addresses the high performance actuation  requirements of the precision engineering industry for a range of  applications such as photolithography, semiconductor wafer  inspection, free-form precision machining and non-circular  turning.",
