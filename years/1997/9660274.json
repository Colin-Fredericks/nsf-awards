 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  96-60274  Lyon    This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore the fire   extinguishing properties of particles smaller than 100 microns.  Larger particles that are   commonly used in dry powder extinguishers absorb relatively little heat as they pass   through a flame, and they extinguish fires chiefly by absorbing heat from the   surroundings.  Small particles, however, can come to flame temperature and thus   remove heat directly from the flame by vaporizing and/or by acting as radiators.  They   can inhibit flame propagation by providing surface area for free radical recombination.    Small particles of calcium bromide may be particularly effective since they will oxidize to   calcium oxide and bromine.  Calcium oxide will cool the flame by acting as a radiator,   and the bromine will inhibit free radical reactions via the same mechanism which makes   halons effective fire extinguishing agents.  Phase I will address the problem of imparting   sufficient momentum to carry small particles to the flame and demonstrate a solution to   this problem.    With the banning of halons, polar operations and many other activities face severe fire   protection problems.  Commercial applications are anticipated in these and many other   fire suppression situations.  ***",
