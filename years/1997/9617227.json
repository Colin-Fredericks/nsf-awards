In the recent  years,  metalworked  products  are being increasingly used to make a  variety  of  products  ranging  from food containers to  automobile  body  panels.  The metalworking processes have a big impact on the  performance  and  reliability  of  these  products  because,  microstructural    effects    (such    as    evolution    of  crystallographic   texture,   dislocation   structures   and  precipitates) and residual stresses which are induced during  the  metalworking process play a vital role  in  determining  their mechanical properties.       The  goal  of this proposal is to examine the evolution  of  the  mechanical  properties of  metals  with  a  special  emphasis  on  the  prediction of evolving anisotropy  during  sheet   rolling  and  forming  processes.   This   will   be  accomplished  by first developing a constitutive  theory  to  model the effect of rolling and sheet forming on the salient  mechanical  properties  (such  as  the  yield  surface)  the  material.   The  principal idea of the theory  is  that  the  response  of  the  material depends upon  the  evolution  of  multiple   structures  (such  as  the   lattice   structure,  dislocation  networks etc.) These are  modeled  by  assuming  that  the material possesses more than one evolving  natural  configuration.  As far as the elastic response and the yield  function  are concerned, the evolving natural configurations  are  the  stress-free configurations of the material.   This  notion allows for a detailed discussion of the evolution  of  the anisotropy of the elastic  response and the yield surface.         The  yield  behavior is the most significant aspect  mf  the   mechanical  behavior  of  the  material   -.3ince   it  determines  the formability, necking behavior etc.,  of  the  material.  Even a slight error in the modeling of the   yield  behavior  significantly  degrades the  prediction  of  these  vital parameters.  For the past three years, there has  been  a  collaboration  between Scientists at the Alcoa  Technical  Center   and   the  University  of  Pittsburgh  to   develop  comprehensive  constitutive assumptions to accurately  model  the  changing anisotropy.  The current proposal builds  upon  this  effort and takes it to the next stage, namely detailed  experimentation and validation of the constitutive theory.         The  predictive capabilities of the theory are expected  to  provide researchers with some of the tools necessary  to  make  reliable  estimates of mechanical  properties  of  the  sheet   metal   product  from  information   regarding   the  manufacturing  processes  that it  has  undergone.   In  the  process,  it  will  help  graduate  students  to  gain  both  industrial and academic training.",
