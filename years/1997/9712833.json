 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continued reductions in the prices of mass storage and widespread  access to computer networks, especially the Internet, have given  a large number of users access to vast amounts of information.  Much of this information is pictorial, often ordinary images  stored in digital form. Yet the tools available for organizing,  browsing, and interrogating such image data have not kept pace  with the volume of information made available.  This research  develops a novel way of summarizing and indexing images and other  pictorial data based on their appearance, and more specifically  on their color, shape, and texture content. These descriptors,  called image signatures, are uniform, compact, flexible, robust,  and intuitive. The notion of the Earth-Mover's Distance between  signatures is introduced and used to give a metric structure to  the image space. This metric structure, together with additional  geometric information, is then exploited to provide efficient  nearest-neighbor search algorithms, as well as to compute  distance-preserving embeddings of the image space, or portions  thereof, into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Such embeddings,  obtained using multi-dimensional scaling, allow the user to  visualize intuitively both local image neighborhoods of interest,  or the entire image space at once. The user is able to navigate  around the image space intuitively, with a sense of continuity  and comprehensiveness, unlike current systems which typically  present fragments of the data-base in a disconnected fashion.  These tools then enable a novel metaphor for exploring image data-  bases, making it more akin to the familiar browsing of a library  or a bookstore.",
