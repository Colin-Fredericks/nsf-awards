 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past 25 years, video microscopy and digital imaging have revolutionized light microscopy, and personal computers have changed how classes are taught.  Until now, the Biology Department has lacked the resources to make digital image acquisition and analysis an integral part of its curriculum.  The department is now acquiring light microscope and computer resources to make this integration possible.  Using a variety of devices light microscopes coupled, through video cameras, to Macintosh computers with video frame-grabber boards; a video camera in a gel documentation system; a digitizing tablet; and a scanner students are digitizing images and then processing and analyzing them.  Some of the processed images are being used as the basis of electronic laboratory reports and serving as references for other students.  Faculty, with the help of undergraduate Macintosh experts, are initiating the use of the instruments in two of the department's four core courses and two upper-level elective courses, helping other faculty in the core courses learn how to use the instruments, and supervising the use of the instruments by students doing independent research.  The project involves all biology majors, all of the college's pre-healing arts students, and many students majoring in other science departments.  It is equipping students and faculty with powerful new skills and helping others expand their uses of this technology.  Students often work in groups at the workstations, so the project also encourages collaborative learning.  *",
