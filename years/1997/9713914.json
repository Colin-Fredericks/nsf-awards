 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GOALI/IUCP (Industry-University Collaboration Project)  is a joint research program between the New Venture Gear  Inc. (Troy, MI). It develops modeling, analysis and design  techniques for the reduction of torsional vibration and the  elimination of gear rattles in manual transmissions of  passenger cars and light trucks. Gear rattle is produced by  the impacting of gear teeth through their unloaded mesh  backlash as a response to engine torque fluctuations. The  complexity of torsional vibrations and various  nonlinearities (e.g., backlash, friction hysteresis, and  multi-stage stiffness) of manual transmission present many  challenges for the analysis of torsional vibration  characteristics and gear rattle behavior. This GOALI/IUCP  investigation focuses on a comprehensive understanding of  the torsional vibration and gear rattle characteristics.  Through the development of a new and powerful numerical  analysis technique, finite elements in the time domain (FET)  an efficient modeling and simulation capability is attained  for performance assessments and parametric studies of the  strongly nonlinear system. This modeling capability is  utilized to develop computer tools to be used by the design  engineers to discover; feasible conventional improvements  and to optimize powertrain configuration. Furthermore, the  computer analysis tools are integrated within Chrysler's  vehicle powertrain technologies such as the automated clutch  with controlled slip. This project provides a unique  opportunity to combine the strong expertise in basic  research available in academic settings and the Chrysler's  extensive experimentation and product development. With  Chrysler's support of research funds and the participation  of a 8-member team, this collaboration further strengthens  an established partnership with expanded industry-university  interactions through mutual visits, student summer  internships, and collaborative experiments, allowing the  university researchers to sharpen their research focus while  tackling a serious real-world application problem.",
