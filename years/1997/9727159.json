 "awd_abstract_narration": "Curtis  9727159    Integrative reviews of published research have become increasingly  important in uncovering general classes of plant and ecosystem  response to rising atmospheric CO2 and in estimating the size of  those responses. Meta-analysis is an objective and statistically  rigorous approach to integrating primary research results where  the goal is to estimate the overall magnitude of an experimental  treatment across many independent studies. It is important from a  scientific as well as a policy perspective that results from  elevated CO2 research be integrated using these tools.    I have three primary objectives:  1. The establishment of a comprehensive, digital data base of all  vegetation CO2 response results  published to date.  2. Integration and synthesis of these results using meta-analytic  methods.  3. Distribution of this database via a server at the Carbon  Dioxide Information Analysis Center  of Oak Ridge National Laboratory.    The combined results of my meta-analytic work and the improved  access of other researchers to this large database will lead to  substantial improvement in our understanding of the likely  magnitude of vegetation carbon gain in a future, higher CO2 world,  and of the biotic and abiotic interactions affecting that carbon  gain. This will be of importance to basic researchers and modelers  working from the whole plant to the ecosystem level.",
