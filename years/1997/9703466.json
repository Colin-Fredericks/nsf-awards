 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Rotello's research focuses on three objectives: (1)   incorporating flavin derivatives into transparent, silica-based, sol-gel   matrices; (2) exploiting the electronic spectroscopy of flavins to probe   sol-gel microenvironments; and (3) exploring the thermal redox and   photocatalytic chemistry of bound flavins.  Spectral properties of the   incorporated flavins are correlated with viscoelastic measurements of the   gel to identify changes in the flavin microenvironment during gelation   and drying.   The electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical behavior of   the flavin incorporated in the matrix is compared with that in fluid   solution to ascertain matrix induced changes in redox potential, while   medium effects on redox activity are explored through stoichiometric   oxidations of representative thiols and other biologically important   functional groups.  Educational activities include developing a molecular   modeling component for large organic chemistry courses, continuing an   outreach program designed to enhance high school students' interest in   pursuing undergraduate degrees in the physical sciences, and mentoring   undergraduate physical science majors in an integrated program designed   to sustain and promote their interest in the physical sciences.  With this CAREER award, the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   research and educational activities of Professor Vincent Rotello of the   Chemistry Department at the University of Massachusetts.   Professor   Rotello explores the incorporation of reactive molecules into glass-like   environments, essentially forming artificial enzymes wherein the matrix   plays the role ordinarily taken on by the amino acid backbone of a   natural enzyme and the reactive molecule serves as the active site of the   enzyme.  These artificial enzyme systems offer the opportunity to probe   various features of the processes effected by the natural enzymes and may   also lead to the discovery of unique reaction chemistry distinct from   that of the enzymes.  Professor Rotello's educational activities include   the development and integration into undergraduate organic chemistry   courses of computer-assisted investigations of molecular structure.    Through outreach programs, Professor Rotello encourages high school   students to major in the physical sciences, and, once they are in   college, he enhances and sustains the interest of undergraduate physical   science majors through an integrated program of faculty seminars, field   trips and interactive laboratory experiences.",
