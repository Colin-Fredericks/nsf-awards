 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705241  Grubin     David Grubin Production, Inc., in conjunction with Thirteen/WNET, is producing a multimedia project entitled, The Secret Life of the Brain.  The project will examine new understandings into the processes of the human brain that have developed over the last decade.  Through an exploration of the brain's normal development from conception through old age, the project conveys the most recent knowledge available.  The series will enable audiences to appreciate the current revolution in neuroscience, understand how new technologies have enabled scientists to unearth a wealth of information, and learn how neuroscience research impacts the health and future well-being of the average person.  The five one-hour programs in the series will explore the brain from conception through age two, childhood from age two through puberty, adolescence, adulthood, and normal aging process in older age.       Educational outreach materials for use in informal and formal setting will include two separate sets of printed materials, one for adolescents and one for adults.  A Secret Life of the Brain Web Site will include Brain Games, the Brain Quiz, and the Live Brain that present learning opportunities for adults and teens.       The project Principal Investigator will be David Grubin who will serve as Executive Producer.  Grubin previously was the producer of Healing and the Mind with Bill Moyers and the critically acclaimed biographies of Lyndon Johnson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Theodore Roosevelt.  June Kinoshita, an internationally recognized science reporter and editor, will serve as the Series Science Editor.  Lead advisors for each program will be Bruce McEwen, President-elect of the Society for Neuroscience and Professor at Rockefeller University (Program 1); Steve Petersen, Director, Division of Neuropsychology, Dept. of Neurology and Neurological Surgery at the Washington University School of Medicine (Program 2); Steven Hyman, Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (Programs 3  & 4); and Carl Cotman, Director for the Institute for Brain Aging and Dementia at the University of California, Irvine (Program 5).  Robert Miller of WNET will be responsible for the educational materials to accompany The Secret Life of the Brain.",
