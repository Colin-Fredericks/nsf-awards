The program targets minority students, faculty, and  professionals interested in aquatic sciences, as well as  majority faculty working at Historically Minority Colleges  and Universities (HMCU's). The program is run in conjunction  with the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography  (ASLO)which provides program participants with free  membership to the society including a subscription to the  societies Journal, \"Limnology and Oceanography\".  Participants apply through a formal process for  participation in the program and those selected are provided  with travel and per diem support to participate in the  Annual ASLO meeting and to attend special pre-planning  workshops. Participants are strongly encouraged to present  the results of any  research programs they are involved with  both in the regular sessions and sessions specifically  organized for them. The present program will cultivate the  further development of past participants and incorporate new  cohorts of students into the process. Since the programs  beginnings in 1990, it has supported 222 students and 16  faculty mentors. Through both proven and some novel  approaches this project will strengthen and expand the  linkages between minority students and the aquatic science  community.  ***",
