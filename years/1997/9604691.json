 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT 9604691  Weiss      This U.S.-Slovak research project between Dr. Richard Weiss of Georgetown University and Dr. Pavol Hrdlovic of the Slovak Academy of Sciences' Polymer Institute will feature development of methodologies for studying light-induced dynamic processes within polymeric systems.  Specifically, the researchers intend to: 1) synthesis cross-linked interpenetrating network (IPN) polymers with luminescing reporter groups covalently attached at selected sites; 2) form copolymers containing groups capable of enhancing or inhibiting direct and molecular oxygen-mediated photodegradation; and 3) measure diffusion rates of small guest molecules within these polymers.  This cooperative effort builds upon the expertise of Dr. Weiss in photochemistry and the Slovak institute's capacity for polymer synthesis and is expected to yield new information on polymer photodegradation with potential application in industrial materials.    This joint project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe  to combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.    ??",
