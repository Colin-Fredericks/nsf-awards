 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612303  Pickering    Alloy dissolution involves the selective removal of one  component of the alloy under the action of a corrosive  medium in a particular service environment.  As the alloy  leaching occurs, the mechanical properties of the alloy  deteriorate significantly.  The mechanisms of dealloying in  metal alloys are under study in this grant.  Several  research thrusts are underway, including (1) the effects of  lattice strain on the electrochemical behavior and surface  morphology of alloys undergoing selective dissolution; (2)  characterization of surface morphology, chemical composition  and correlation with current at early transient stages of  dealloying, below and above the critical potential; (3)  evaluation of the effects of key inhibitors and surfactants  on the dealloying behavior; (4) the significance of  underpotential deposition with regards to the dissolution-  redeposition mechanism; (5) evaluation of the magnitude and  consequences of ohmic potential drop within the electrolyte  that fills the pits that form upon dealloying above the  critical potential; (6) application of scanning tunneling  microscopy to study dealloying with increased spatial  resolution.  The research covers a variety of alloys in the  copper, zinc, and amalgam families.  %%%  This grant addresses a serious problem in industry and civil  infrastructure, dealloying and its degrading effects on  metal alloys.  The problem affects a wide variety of alloys  and components,  high strength steels, superalloys, machine  parts, faucets and water pipes, and even dental fillings.  ***",
