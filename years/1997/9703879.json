The investigator will try to pursue the   development of the underlying theories, and will also try to find new applications, in   particular to the geometry of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces. He will also try to use   abstract methods to achieve progress on the understanding of mean field models for spin   glasses, a subject where rigorous results are very hard to obtain. A separate project   consists in the study of the subsets of the discrete cube of large dimension, and of their   extremal properties.        Real life phenomenon are usually affected by random events outside our control.   Random variables that depend on many independent influences are therefore a good model   for the outcome of complicated real procedures. Surprisingly general tools have recently   been developed to rigorously control the fluctuations of these random variables in a wide   variety of situations, and they demonstrate the power and the relevance of abstract   methods to concrete situations. The development of these methods and the research of   new applications will be continued. A particular effort will be made to use these methods   to obtain rigorous results for spin glass models. These are mathematical models for some   very intriguing states of condensed matter, that are of considerable interest in the physics   community.",
