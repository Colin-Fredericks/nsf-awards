 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, addresses the thermodynamics of adsorption on  well characterized surfaces in a unique way.  A direct adsorption  single crystal microcalorimeter has been developed by Professor  Campbell and his students at the University of Washington which  has the sensitivity to directly determine the enthalpy of  adsorption of a range of metal on oxide and metal on  semiconductor systems.  In addition, the adsorption of metals on  polymers, and hydrocarbons on platinum are being investigated  using this new instrument.  This unique information is crucial to  the understanding of a variety of important surface processes,  ranging from electronic device fabrication to heterogeneous  catalysis.  In order to understand surface reaction chemistry, which forms  the basis of many important interfacial technologies, the basic  thermodynamic information about the heats of adsorption of atoms  and molecules on surfaces must be known.  This basic research  effort addresses this question through a unique experimental  approach to the direct measurement of these quantities.  The  results of these investigations will find wide application in  technologies including semiconductor processing and catalytic  chemistry.",
