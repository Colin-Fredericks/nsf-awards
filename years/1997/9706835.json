 "awd_abstract_narration": "9706835    Rudelson    Probabilistic methods constitute a very rapidly developing field of  Convex Geometry and Local Theory of Banach spaces. Recent results  in this area are connected in particular to the majorizing measure  approach, introduced by Talagrand. This method enabled the solution  of several deep problems in Combinatorics, Harmonic Analysis, and  Convex Geometry. This work will continue investigation of constructions  of majorizing measures as well as study possible applications of this  method to concrete problems of Local Theory and Harmonic Analysis.  Another direction is related to the study of convex bodies which are  not necessary symmetric. This is a new project inspired by recent  progress in generalization of the results of the Local Theory to   star-shaped bodies. It turned out to be possible to prove the most  important results of the Local Theory, including inverse Santalo and   Brunn-Minkowski inequalities, for p-convex bodies. Unlike p-convex  symmetric bodies, in the case of general convex bodies almost  nothing is known. The basic technical tools, which work for convex  and p-convex symmetric bodies, do not work any more if general   convex bodies are considered. Moreover, the known facts about  non-symmetric convex bodies suggest that there might be a significant  difference between their properties and the properties of symmetric  bodies.The aim of the project is to construct a theory of general  convex bodies which is parallel to the existing theory of convex  symmetric bodies.    Convex Geometry is a field of Mathematics which studies the properties  of convex bodies of high dimension. This includes finding sections of  a given body with certain nice properties, computing the volume of a  body, approximating a convex body by another one having a better  structure, etc. While these problems cannot be solved in general by  an explicit construction, it is often possible to show that a randomly  chosen section or a random modification of a body has the desired  prop erties. This approach enables the reduction of the analytic and  geometric problems to the investigation of the behavior of a certain  random process. The project will concentrate on developing a method  to analyze such processes and on the investigation of the structure  of general convex bodies. The results obtained in this direction are  applicable to various problems in Harmonic Analysis and Banach   Space theory as well as in Computer Science, like construction of   effective optimization algorithms and fast computation of the volumes of   convex bodies.",
