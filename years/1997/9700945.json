CF's, which are electrons with two magnetic  flulx   quanta   attached,   have  provided   a   framework   for  understanding  the diversity of fractional quantum  Hall  states.  QHF,  on  the  other hand, offers a beautiful and useful  analogy  between  quantized Hall states in systems with discrete  internal  degrees  of  freedom  (like  spin or layer  index)  and  ordinary  magnetic materials. Remarkable new phenomena, like textural phase  transitions  and  skyrmionic topological excitations,  have  been  discovered  in  QHF's. In double layer 2D electron gases,  simply  changing   the   thickness  of  the  separating  barrier   allows  interpolation  between  a  system best described  as  two  weakly  coupled  composite  fermion liquids  to  a  single  quantum  Hall  ferromagnet. In addition to conventional magneto-transport, novel  experimental probes requiring separate electrical contact to  the  individual  layers  (e.g., Coulomb drag, tunneling  spectroscopy,  and  counterflow transport) will be employed to uncover important  new  information in both the CF and QHF limits and, uniquely,  on  the transition between them.  %%%%  This experimental research project is devoted to basic properties  of  two  conducting electron systems, each confined into  a  two-  dimensional planar region, when the two systems are parallel  and  in  close  proximity  separated only  by  a  thin  planar  tunnel  barrier.  Such coupled parallel sets of two-dimensional electrons  at low temperatures and with high magnetic fields exhibit unusual  characteristics. In each layer the effective charge carriers  are  \"composite Fermions\", which are electrons with two magnetic  flux  quanta  attached.  As  the   spacing between  the  two  layers  is  reduced, which increases the interaction, a crossover in behavior  is  expected from a case of weakly interacting composite  Fermion  systems  to  a state called a single quantum Hall ferromagnet.  A  ferromagnet  is a system in which electron magnetic  moments  are  aligned  parallel, as in a bar magnet or compass needle.  On  the  one hand the experiments will provide new basic information about  electron systems when they are in interaction in confined  layers  at low temperatures. For example, one experiment will measure the  degree to which motion (electrical current) in one system \"drags\"  the  second system. On the other hand the device structures which  are  used in these experiments are similar to those used  in  the  most advanced microelectronic devices in the GaAs technology, and  indeed  fabricating these devices may lead to innovation  in  the  GaAs technology. This research will involve students who will  be  well   trained  in  the  area  of  physics  and  will  also  gain  familiarity with semiconductor device technology, and who will be  excellently  trained for employment in industry,  government,  or  education.  ***",
