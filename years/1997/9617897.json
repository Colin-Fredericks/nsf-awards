 "awd_abstract_narration": "9617897  Channell    This grant provides $161,248 as one-half support of the costs of  acquiring a high resolution cryogenic magnetometer for marine and  lacustrine paleomagnetic investigations of regional and global  climate change and studies of the secular variation of the  relative paleointensity of the Earth's geomagnetic field.  Specifically, the University of Florida will acquire a new  generation 2-G Enterprises model 755 u-channel cryogenic  magnetometer.  This instrument provides the capability to rapidly  measure the magnetic properties of 1.5 m sections of u-channels  taken from piston or gravity cores with high-resolution and high  sensitivity using sophisticated DC SQUIDS that afford over an  order of magnitude greater sensitivity than the last generation  of machines equipped with radio frequency (Rf) SQUIDS.  In  addition, the Model 755 is equipped with in-line alternating  field demagnetization coils and a pulse magnetizer such that  measurement of several magnetic properties of the core can be  conducted in a single operation, eliminating possible positioning  errors during sample transfer to different instruments and  allowing long periods of unattended operation.  Paleomagnetic  analyses of long records of sediment cores collected during ODP  cruises to the North and South Atlantic will be conducted in an  attempt to better correlate the paleoclimatic signals recorded in  these sediments through both grain size, textural and lithologic  variations and to better understand the secular variability in  the Earth's geomagnetic field as recorded by the relative  paleointensity of magnetic minerals within these cores.  The  recent decision of ODP to allow u-channel sampling of the archive  half of piston and gravity cores represents a veritable flood of  marine sediment samples waiting to be analyzed and is sure to  keep the paleomagnetic community busy for the foreseeable future.  Acquisition of a 2-G Model 755 u-channel magnetometer by the  University of Florida will be only the  second of its kind within  the United States (the other is at UC-Davis under the direction  of Dr. Ken Verosub) and thus will represent a valuable regional  and national facility for the study of environmental  paleomagnetism.  ***",
