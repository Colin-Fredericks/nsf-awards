 "awd_abstract_narration": "9705068  Gupta    The objectives of this work are to establish experimental  procedures for in-situ measurements of mechanical properties  at interfaces under elevated temperatures, to develop a  basic understanding of strength-structure-chemistry  relationships for interfaces, and to generate data for  elevated temperature interfacial strengths of several  engineering systems.  Because coated components used in  machinery and device applications often undergo local  temperature excursions during performance, the mechanical  properties of the material interfaces and their  relationships to interfacial structure and chemistry at  elevated temperatures is important.  An earlier one year  grant permitted the development of a laser-generated, stress-  pulse system that induces decohesion at the interface of  dissimilar materials under elevated temperatures.  In this  renewal grant the tensile strengths of such interfaces are  measured up to 1300 C in 1 to 3 micron thick coatings of Nb  on substrates of sapphire.  Interface chemistry and atomic  structure are determined by using high resolution  transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology.  TEM at ambient temperature allows  a determination of the influence of interface  interdiffusion, void formation, coating grain size, new  phases, and  thickness of the amorphous layer on the  measured interface strength at elevated temperatures.  Once  the strength-structure-chemistry relationships are developed  at elevated temperatures for the Nb/sapphire interface, the  tensile strengths of other representative systems chosen  from applications in tribology (TiC coatings on Inconel  substrates), thermal barriers (zirconia coatings on Inconel  substrates), and microelectronics (Cu and Al coatings on  nitrided surfaces of Si) will be determined up to 1300 C.  %%%  The grant is not only interdisciplinary in its approach, but  also in its impact, as it serves particular needs in the  composites, tribology, thermal spray, mi croelectronics, and  other thin film industries.  ***",
