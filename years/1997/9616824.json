 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT   D. ELMEGREEN    This Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award is for support  of two distinct but logistically and scientifically related projects in  observational astronomy.    The first project concerns starbursts in circumnuclear rings. Spiral  galaxies with starburst activity are often barred with nuclear rings  located near the inner Lindblad resonances (ILR's). The theory of gas  flow indicates that an ILR tends to trap gas that is flowing in because  of bar torques. The collected gas forms stars if a critical density is  exceeded. The project will compare bar properties (bar luminosity  fraction, radial profile, arm/interarm contrast) in bursting and non-  bursting galaxies. The star-forming properties of nuclear rings will  also be studied by monitoring 45 barred galaxies for ILR ring variation  due to supernovae or other events. Spectacular star formation rates in  ILR ring bursts suggest at least 0.5 ILR supernova per year in the  sample of 45 galaxies. For various reasons, previous ILR supernovae are  likely to have been missed by existing search programs.    Data for the project will consist of data from our existing Kitt Peak  National Observatory (KPNO) 2.1m observations of several starburst  galaxies with high angular resolution in J and K bands, which reveal  ring structure that is described in published carbon monoxide (CO),  Hydrogen-alpha and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. The  results from the analysis of the photometry of these rings will enable  one to estimate ages and stellar densities for comparison with  theoretical stability thresholds.   Existing and planned observations  on the Burrell-Schmidt 0.6 meter telescope in the B and I band will  supplement planned BVRI 0.8 meter Vassar Observatory observations to  assess the bar properties of each galaxy, and 0.8 meter observations  will be used for the variability search.    The second project is to monitor extragalactic supernovae discovered by  others. Broadband (BVRI) light curves are a n important component in  understanding the nature of supernova explosions, serving as a  constraint on explosion and precursor models, a test of the homogeneity  of spectroscopic classification, a possible basis for the calibration  of type Ia distance indicators, a classification criterion for some  type II events, as well as important data for the determination of some  astrophysical parameters (such as distance, age at time of discovery,  explosion energy) for individual events. Unlike spectroscopic studies,  light curve monitoring requires a modest aperture, but a sizable time  commitment.    Searches typically find at least a half-dozen outbursts that will  remain within the photometric reach of the 0.8 meter telescope for  weeks or months each year. This project, which would build upon our  present collaboration with our colleagues in the Keck Northeast  Astronomy Consortium, would monitor each light curve on every clear  night until reaching signal-to-noise limits.    The new 0.8m telescope and CCD camera at the Vassar College Observatory  is expected to achieve first light in March 1997. This telescope will  be dedicated to the light curve project as well as to appropriate  segments of the barred spiral project, especially the search for  variability. Both projects will also make use of facilities at the  national astronomy observatories, and will involve undergraduate  students at every stage.",
