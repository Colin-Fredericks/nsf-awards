Upgrades  to the single crystal instrument would include a new precession  camera, automation software and a new workstation to process X-  ray images.  Upgrades to the powder XRD instrument would include  automation software which requires a PC platform, a thin film  attachment, a new camera and a water recirculator and new X-ray  tube.  Upgrades to these instrument were well justified and will  allow continued productive research on phyllosilicate mineralogy  and crystallography over a wide range of temperatures and  pressures, studies of the adsorption/desorption reactions between  organic molecules and clay minerals, experimental petrology of  carbonate-aqueous fluid interactions, studies of the kinetics of  manganese oxide dissolution as a result of interactions with  organic compounds in waste waters, characterization of  semiconductor surfaces and characterization of catalysts.  These upgrades will therefore benefit a wide range of research  conducted both by departmental faculty and by faculty from the  Departments of Physics, Chemistry, and Chemical Engineering as  well as by regional users.  ***",
