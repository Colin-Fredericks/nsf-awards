Several principal  tasks will be carried out related to mitigation and response and  recovery including: (a) evaluating the effectiveness of pre-  earthquake housing damage mitigation programs already in  existence, (b) examining the various factors motivating housing  owners to retrofit, (c) modeling the expected demands for post-  earthquake emergency assistance, and (d) examining the relative  time periods involved for the repair or replacement of  uninhabitable units.  The effort will include workshops, issuing  reports and articles, as well as posting summary information on  the organization's Internet site.",
