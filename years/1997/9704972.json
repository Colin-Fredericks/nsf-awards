Continuing the PI's work on  supercondictivity of heavy fermions, the first project  contains a study of the expected effects in neutron  scattering from a flux lattice.  In the second project based  on the properties high Tc superconductors, there are two sub-  projects:  (1) Properties of a twin boundary junction and a  proximity effect junction and (2) a variational study of  disorder on a \"d-wave\"superconductor.  Finally, there are  plans to study the properties of a liquid crystal like state  in quantum Hall effect.  %%%  This grant to mid-career theorist supports work in several  projects related to the properties of some curious  superconductors, all discovered during the Eighties.  They  include alloys of Uranium and Platinum, where the PI  pioneered with some early work on the unconventional  superconducting properties.  They also include the better  known high Tc materials where again the PI made some early  conjectures about some special effects and which survive a  closer scrutiny in more recent years.  Much of the work  proposed here builds on this very creative and original PI's  earlier successes.  ***",
