Lodge, of  the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of  Notre Dame, to travel to Kenya to meet with Dr. Kenneth M.  Mavuti, of the Department of Zoology at the University of  Nairobi, and Dr. Gerald M. Mkoji, of the Biomedical Sciences  Research Centre at the Kenya Medical Research Institute.  The purpose of the visit is to develop a cooperative  research activity to evaluate the impact of the North  American crayfish Procambarus  clarkii on the biota of  Kenya's freshwater lakes and wetlands.  This species of  crayfish was introduced for aquaculture, but is now being  considered as a biological control agent for freshwater  snails that are vectors for schistosomiasis (a major cause  of disease in Africa).  This study should add significant  new knowledge about the impact an exotic species of crayfish  has had on the local ecosystems in the lakes and wetlands of  Kenya.    Funding for this project is being provided jointly by the  Division of International Programs and the Division of  Environmental Biology.  ***",
