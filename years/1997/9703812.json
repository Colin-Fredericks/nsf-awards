Katehakis and Herbert Robbins    Rutgers University    Abstract    This research involves work on adaptive control of dynamic systems.   The basic dynamic model is known as the \"Markov decision process with   incomplete information\" (MDP) problem,  where the transition law   and/or the expected one-period rewards may depend on unknown   parameters.  The most notable results in this area are based on ideas   utilizing either a separation principle and the related   certainty-equivalence rule, or uniformly efficient rules for the   model of  sequential allocation known as the multi-armed bandit   (MAB) problem.  Limitations of the certainty-equivalence rule are:   i)  there is no claim on the rate of convergence, and    ii)  there are cases  for which, with positive probability, this   rule can prematurely converge to a wrong parameter value so that   it eventually uses only a non-optimal policy. The  typical approach  in the latter studies  has been to  fit  the larger MDP model into  the smaller MAB one by considering each deterministic policy as a   reward-generating population (bandit).  A consequence of this is   that the resulting statistically  efficient procedures  involve   sampling from all deterministic policies and do not otherwise   utilize the optimization aspect of the problem. Thus, they become   limited in scope by data collection complexity.  The reason is   that in practice the state spaces of  MDP models tend  to be very  large and the set of deterministic policies is   immense.  In recent work the investigators have obtained adaptive   procedures with data collection requirements that are  proportional   to the number of state - action pairs of the MDP, under a minimal   irreducibility condition. A major direction of the proposed research   involves  the development of solutions for important more general   problems  such as  i) multi-chain MDPs,  ii) the case in which there   a re side constraints, and  iii) discounted streams of rewards.  A   second  important goal is the development of  new adaptive   statistical methods  that possess practically useful implementation   and optimality  properties for the related problems of detection of    total error and change points.      The main idea of adaptive control is to compute strategies (policies,   or control rules) for the operation of  a system that estimate the   unknown parameters of the system, and in doing so converge to a   strategy that is optimal for the true values of the unknown   parameters.  Applications arise in many  areas of  modern engineering,   finance, and operations research, such as reliability, maintenance,  quality control,  scheduling,  inventory, and  production planning.   Consequently, this type of problem has been widely studied in the   literature. However,  effective procedures that take into account and   optimize  the speed of  convergence  have been obtained only recently   for specific models, often, with prohibitive data collection   complexity.  A primary objective of the proposed research is the   development of relatively simple adaptive control procedures with   reasonable computational and memory  requirements for on-line   implementation, for a wide class of problems, utilizing ideas from   recent work of the investigators. Another  important goal is the   development of  new methods for specific models useful in such areas   as software reliability (error detection)  and  quality control   (change points).  This research relates to the following strategic  areas of national concern: high performance computing, communications,  and manufacturing.",
