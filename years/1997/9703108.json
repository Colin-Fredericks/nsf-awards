 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703108  Useful software evolves: It is corrected, enhanced, and adapted  to new platforms. The cost of such software is dominated by the  costs of testing and maintenance; the long-term quality of such  software is dependent on the effectiveness of testing and  maintenance. The overall goal of this project is to improve the  state of the art and the state of the practice in software  testing and maintenance. The research component of this work  addresses regression testing: the testing of modified software.  This effort has two primary objectives: (1) to develop efficient,  effective, and practical techniques for selectively retesting  modified software; (2) to analytically and empirically  investigate factors in software and test design that affect the  regression testability of software, and develop techniques for  measuring and improving regression testability. The educational  component of this work investigates a maintenance-and-testing-  first software engineering curriculum, in which students  experience the problems of maintaining and testing an existing  software system and specify and design enhancements to the  system. The objectives of this effort are: (1) to provide  practical experience with testing and maintenance, and (2) to  encourage future software engineers to proactively evaluate the  impact of their actions on testability and maintainability.  ***",
