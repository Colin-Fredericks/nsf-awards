The two centers are the Center for Process Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) at the University of  Washington (UW) and the Center for the Design of Analog/Digital Integrated Circuits (CDADIC), a multi-site center, headquartered at the Washington State University (WSU) in Pullman, Washington.  Four additional universities are involved in CDADIC as satellite research centers. These additional CDADIC sites are located at: the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, Washington, Opegon State University (OSU) in Corvallis, Oregon-, The State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook, New York, and, a probable additional site to be affiliated in 1997  it has 1996-97 planning grant  is Tuskegee University (TU) in Tuskegee, Alabama.    The evaluator will continue to be responsible for implementation of the I/UCRC Center Assessment Program at both centers.  This is a series of three related studies designed to identify the factors that have been shown to contribute to and/or inhibit attainment of each center's goals and outcomes. Included among the three basic studies are: a) developing comparative descriptions and conducting analyses of each center's developmental history in the form of annual historical profile updates; b) conducting intermediate and long-term studies of each center's organizational effectiveness using faculty and sponsor outcome instruments, and; c) conducting exit interviews of industrial sponsors that terminate their affiliation with either center.",
