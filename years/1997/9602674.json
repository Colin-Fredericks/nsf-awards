 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southern University, a Historically Black College and University, is the recipient of ARI funds to renovate physics research and research training facilities.  The institution is the largest of the HBCU system and is composed of three campuses, including Baton Rouge, the main campus, and the site of the renovation project.   Presently, research faculty and  students engage in research activities that include: nuclear, particle and astro-particle physics, experimental solid state physics, theoretical solid state physics, and material science.  However, existing conditions in James Hall, the home of the Physics Department, are inadequate for research and training programs.  Renovations to the 1972 structure will encompass: upgrading HVAC, plumbing and electrical systems, installing new fume hoods, and ensuring that laboratories comply with ADA and state health and fire codes.  A clean room will be created as well as rooms to house a cosmic-ray test stand, and a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device magnetometer.  The renovations are essential to the growth of the department and will enhance research and training capabilities of undergraduate and graduate students. The project will be instrumental in the creation of a Ph.D. program in material science by providing modernized space and facilitating collaboration between physics and engineering.  Because of the University's historical mission, many African American scholars will enter the pipeline contributing to the nation's scientific infrastructure.",
