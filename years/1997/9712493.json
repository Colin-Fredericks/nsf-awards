 "awd_abstract_narration": "Worldwide electronic product revenues were $791 billion in 1995 and are forecast to reach $1.2 trillion by the year 2000.  A number of technological breakthroughs must take place in order to sustain the rapid increase in the functionality of electronic systems, while maintaining their reliable operation and reducing size and cost.  Manufacturing of electronic systems is a hierarchical series of processes which can be grouped into semiconductor chip manufacturing, electronic package assembly, and board and system assembly.  Although the chip-level manufacturing challenges are being adequately addressed, the electronic package-level and board-level manufacturing remain relatively unexplored.  This workshop is for assessing the research needs in electronics manufacturing in the twenty-first century.  It will focus on identifying research needs in the development of innovative manufacturing processes; the design of next-generation; precision electromechanical systems; and, the development of virtual manufacturing tools for package and board level manufacturing.   The workshop brings together experts from academia, industry and government to discuss future research needs in electronics manufacturing and to identify the electronics manufacturing barriers for the next decade that can be addressed by universities in collaboration with industry and government laboratories.  The communications between the workshop participants are also helpful in building partnerships and minimizing duplicative efforts.",
