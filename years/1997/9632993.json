 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    9632993          Wright      This research is concerned with understanding the relationship between the different kinds of  fullerenes, their nonlinear properties, and their electronic structure. The proposed work will  involve creating examples of the new derivatives and materials that can be probed to  understand how the interaction with other moieties changes the electronic and optical  properties. It is clear that the neutral fullerenes do not have interesting nonlinearities and that  the most interesting members of the fullerene and fullerene derivatives family are the charged  ions, charge transfer complexes, and the endohedral metallofullerenes. The proposed research  will continue to have two important parts: synthesis, purification, preparation, and  characterization of new fullerene-based materials and measurement of the novel optical  properties of these materials. The heart of the optical measurements will concentrate on using  the capabilities of multi-resonant four wave mixing spectroscopy to identify the states that are  responsible for the nonlinearities, to probe the transitions and coupling between electronic  states, and to determine the character and usefulness of the new states that are caused by  having endohedral metals or external moieties that allow charge transfer transitions.  %%%  There is great interest in the optical properties of materials that are based on fullerenes and  metallofullerenes because of their stability, nonlinear properties, charge transfer  characteristics and the ability to manipulate their properties through changes in the valence  state, the size of the cage, the number and type of endohedral ions. the derivatization, and  the linking with other fullerenes. The possible materials include charge transfer salts,  nano-scale surface structures and films, zeolytes, and polymeric materials. Development of  new optical materials requires an understanding of how changes in the nature of the fullerene  affect the material's optical and electr on transfer properties. Work during a prior grant  period has made it clear that the neutral fullerenes will not be the magic nonlinear material  that will make the field of photonics competitive. Their nonlinearities are much smaller than  the workers in the field had hoped for and measured. Nevertheless, the nonlinearities of the  anions are substantial and they may be improved considerably by the ideas presented here  and by forming derivatives that accentuate the polarizability.  The fullerenes are also unusual  and intriguing materials because of the ability to engineer their electronic structures by  manipulating the number of carbons in the cage, the valence state, the endohedral metal ion  and by forming fullerene derivatives. In addition to their promise for nonlinear materials, the  normal electronic and charge transfer states of fullerenes are central to many interesting  potential uses including photorefractive, photoconductive, photovoltaic, hole burning storage,  and laser materials. The program during this grant period will focus on the electronic  structures characteristic of the different valence states of the charged fullerenes and the  endohedral metallofullerenes.",
