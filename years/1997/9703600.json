 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9703600  Parker    The New York City Alliance for Minority Participation will consist  of seventeen campuses within The City University of New York  (CUNY), comprising both two-year and four-year colleges, and a  university graduate school, working together with private colleges,  members of the business community and national laboratories.  The  principal NYC AMP activities will involve undergraduate and  graduate science, mathematics, engineering, technology,  social/behavioral science, and educational initiatives that focus  on points in students; undergraduate and graduate experiences which  are most likely, without intervention, to precipitate a decision to  drop out of the SMET pipeline.  Transitions from high school to  college, from two-year college to four-year college and into  graduate school, as well as from graduate school into research,  teaching and industry will be addressed.  Alliance activities will  include the initiation of new programs; institutionalization and  expansion of Phase I programs proven effective in one or more units  of the university; collaboration with related activities funded by  state, private and other federal sources; a significantly greater  degree of coordination among the CUNY partners; and greater  involvement of outside partners.  As a direct consequence of the  NYC AMP we expect to double the number of underrepresented students  successfully completing baccalaureate and graduate degrees in SMET,  teacher preparation, and social/behavioral science; conducting  undergraduate and graduate research; as well as obtaining positions  in SMET K-12 and college teaching, research institutions, and  industry.    The four main areas that will influence the increase of  underrepresented students through all points of the NYC AMP Network  Pipeline (se Appendix A) are TRANSITIONS, TEACHING, RESEARCH, and  INTERDISCIPLINARY.  Broad and permanent institutional change is  expected to come about as a result of the focus on these four  areas.    The minority SMET e nrollment and degree numbers reached at the end  of Phase I of the New York City Alliance will serve as the baseline  figures for Phase II.  Items listed in CUNY AMP's (Phase I)  Institutionalization Policy (see pages 2-3) will be adhered to.   Furthermore, the CUNY AMP (Phase II) budget will include the funds  for a project administrator, a senior administrative assistant, an  administrative assistant, a student office assistant, a newsletter  editor, and an evaluation coordinator, as well as seventeen CUNY  graduate students who will serve as individual campus activity  coordinators.  Approximately 74% of the NSF funds for NYC AMP  (Phase II) will be used for participant support costs.",
