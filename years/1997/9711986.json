Four of the most  important are temperature, pressure, molecular weight and chain  microstructure.  The long term objective of the research is to  understand the ways in which all four of these variables interact  in determining the details of the basic physics of the  crystallization process in polymers of commercial importance.  The  synergistic effects of these variables will be investigated for  several carefully chosen systems and in doing so will contribute to  the education of undergraduate and graduate students.  Whereas past  work has concentrated on cis-polyisoprene, polyethylene,  polypropylene and PET, and their copolymers with comonomers that  are rejected from the crystals, recent research has added  copolymers of nylon 6,6.  This latter group includes a copolymer in  which the comonomer is incorporated into the unit cell of the  homopolymer.  Preliminary results show the behavior of this  copolymer to be quite unexpected and different from all others.  Research already begun on the very important new copolymers of  ethylene and octene made using metallocene catalysts is definitive  and shows them to be very different from matched fractions of  similar copolymers made using traditional Zeigler Natta type  catalysts.  For the first time, this research has demonstrated the  importance of yet another variable on crystallization behavior, the  comonomer sequence length distribution.  It is proposed to expand  our studies of the random ethylene-octene copolymers and to study  them at elevated pressures.  In addition studies of the formation  of the fascinating Y phase in polypropylene at elevated pressures  will be continued and extended to copolymers already studied at  atmospheric pressure.  Copolymers show this phase at atmospheric  pressure despite the fact that it should not be there according to   the phase diagram of the homopolymer.  It therefore appears that  the energetics of its formation are strongly perturbed by the  presence of an excludable comonomer.  %%%  This research will contribute to the understanding of the  crystallization behavior of different classes of commercially  significant copolymers under conditions of temperature and pressure  normally encountered in the molding operations of the plastics  industry, whilst at the same time providing both undergraduate and  graduate students with valuable laboratory experience.  ***",
