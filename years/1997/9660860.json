 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9660860  Seitz              This project will evaluate the feasibility of using toughened polystyrene to prepare high efficiency stationary phases for planar chromatography. It is based on technology that Fenris Technology Research, Inc., has developed to toughen porous polystyrene and control its morphology. It is anticipated that these materials will lead to planar chromatography phases that yield both-rapid and highly efficient separations. Furthermore, these materials can be used over a much wider range of conditions than currently available reversed phase materials for chromatography, e.g. high pH. The objectives of Phase I are: (1) to prepare a large number of stationary phases using a variety of polymer formulations and (2) to characterize the chromatographic properties of these phases including efficiency, retardation factor, rate of mobile phase transport and loading capacity. The company will prepare and characterize both free standing phases and phases covalently bonded to glass substrates. Phase I feasibility will be established if the company succeeds in preparing stationary phases that measurably improve on currently available commercial reversed phase materials for planar chromatography.                  By improving on current technology with respect to speed, efficiency and range of possible chromatographic conditions, these materials will be able to capture a substantial part of the market place that currently belongs to reversed materials prepared by bonding alkyl groups to silica. This technology opens up the possibility for a stationary phase material that can be used for both high efficiency planer and high performance liquid chromatography.   ***",
