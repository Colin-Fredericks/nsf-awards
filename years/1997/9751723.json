 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human physiology is a fundamental course in the biology major of particular interest to future teachers, health professionals and researchers. The teaching of human physiology is traditionally done through the use of animal models, although the relevancy and excitement of the subject is best conveyed to the greatest number of students by using the students themselves as experimental subjects. New experimental approaches using the human model need to be designed which maintain an emphasis on \"integrative function\" which is inherent in the physiology discipline, and at the same time build upon a knowledge base rich in cell and molecular sciences.       Students in the laboratory can learn human physiology while also acquiring many necessary skills, such as computerized data acquisition, cooperative learning, and experimental design. Recent advances in available data acquisition software make this possible, and presents an exciting opportunity to make fundamental changes in the undergraduate human physiology curriculum. Students can focus more on integrative concepts and design experiments. Students can also work in small groups on problem-based learning assignments. They can achieve more than just an understanding of resting conditions by focusing on the acute and chronic acclimatizations of the body to changes in the environment.       To implement these ideas, we propose to establish 8 computerized physiology workstations to measure human physiological parameters and institute a problem-based learning curriculum involving physiological responses to environmental stress. Students will also participate in a formal outreach program to local middle schools and be encouraged to carry out research projects in physiology.",
