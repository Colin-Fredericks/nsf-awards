 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Bao Qin   Li    Li will study necessary and sufficient geometric conditions  for an analytic variety to be an interpolating variety for weighted   spaces of entire functions. In a second direction,  he will use  results and methods of interpolation to study exponential polynomials   and obtain Lojasiewicz type inequalities, which  are tied to some   important conjectures in complex and harmonic analysis.  In a third  direction, he plans to find estimates on the volume of zero  varieties for entire holomorphic maps, which are closely related  to geometric aspects of interpolating varieties. He will also study   the \"refined\" Nevanlinna second fundamental theorem for moving targets,    with special attention given to uniqueness problems of meromorphic   functions and meromorphic solutions of (partial) differential equations.    Many important problems like finding all distribution solutions (or   finding out whether there are any) to systems of convolution equations    arising in signal processing, image compression, and other   applications  can be translated to interpolation  problems for entire functions with growth conditions.  The topic itself is one of the major problems in several  complex   variables. The proposed research has as its goal to enrich and  advance the above areas in several complex variables and their   applications.",
