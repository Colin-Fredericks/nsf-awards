 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615499  Meserve  This project now in its eighth year is a long-term, large-scale experimental manipulation examining the importance of biotic interactions including predation, interspecific competition and herbivory in a Chilean semiarid community. At the same time, responses of plants and animals to abiotic factors related to climatic events are being quantified. Results thus far have documented that vertebrate predators had major effects on numbers and survival of two core small mammal species, and relatively minor effects on opportunistic ones. Significant time by competitor interactions on numbers and survival of some species suggests interference effects. Heterogeneous effects of predator/herbivore exclusions were detected on plant cover of perennials and ephemerals. Seeds of several ephemeral species decreased on plots where small mammals were excluded suggesting positive effects of herbivory on plant species diversity. These biotic responses have been superimposed on strong demographic responses of small mammals and plants to El Nino events. During prevailing drought periods, biotic interactions appear less important due to extreme resource and water limitation. Consequently, it is vital to continue to monitor the biotic dynamics in response to periodic abiotic forces that vary over long time scales. This study is currently the longest large-scale experimental study of the role of biotic and abiotic factors in the temperate Neotropics.",
