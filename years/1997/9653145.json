 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    The Problem:  The ineffectiveness of lecture instruction in helping students acquire conceptual knowledge and real world skills in complex problem solving, collaboration, and communication.  This problem exists at the introductory level as well as in the upper level courses for physics majors.  Objectives:  Implement group-based active learning instructional systems at the introductory, and sophomore levels.  Methods:  Using an active group learning format, we will build a conceptual foundation leading to the solution of complex problems with interesting context.  The instruction will involve tools such as:  interactive computer simulation questions and problems; computer visualization, modeling and problem solving; and conceptual and more complex experiment problems.  Special audiences:  Engineering students, undergraduate physics majors, and underrepresented groups in physics, including women and domestic minorities.  Collaborations:  Through participation in a restructuring program in the College of Engineering, faculty in engineering, math and chemistry.  Significance/impact:  The project will develop a teaching approach, complete with teaching kits and materials, whose full implementation will result in a major modification of first and second-year instruction for students in physics, chemistry and engineering.  Through participation in restructuring in the introductory engineering curriculum, the pedagogy will be disseminated beyond physics.  Dissemination of the materials nationally will help promote active learning nationally.  Completion rates for groups traditionally underrepresented in physics will improve with no sacrifice in learning.  The means for achieving these goals and impacts are described in greater detail in the full proposal.",
