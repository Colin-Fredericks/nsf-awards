 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704794  Friedlander       Eric M. Friedlander will study algebraic cycles from two points  of view: the first is more topological and differential-geometric in  nature, whereas the second is more algebraic and is allied with the study  of motivic cohomology.  Particular attention will be given to relationships  with algebraic K-theory, long-standing problems in algebraic geometry, and  the challenge of producing concrete examples.  Moreover, the study of  representations of various Hopf algebras associated to algebraic groups  will continue.  Of special interest are the representations of infinitesimal  group schemes.  Stewart B. Priddy will study connections between stable  homotopy theory and the cohomology and representation theory of groups.  The goal is to develop a global point of view by working at the interface  of these fields, using insights from the stable homotopy theory of  classifying spaces.  One avenue of research is the study of the stable  type of classifying spaces of products of groups.  Another is the study  of the representation theory conjectures of Alperin and Broue', which  may be amenable to equivariant topological methods.  One of the principal  techniques is the use of stable decompositions of classifying spaces to  suggest concepts in cohomology of groups, as was the case with Swan groups.       Aspects of Friedlander's research relate to fundamental problems in  mathematics whose history can be traced back to the previous century.  Many central problems of algebraic geometry, especially those involving  algebraic cycles, have challenged generations of mathematicians.  New  techniques from topology and formal algebraic geometry hold promise of at  least partial solutions.  In a different mathematical arena, the classical  representation theory of algebraic groups is reflected by the representations  of related algebraic structures.  The interplay between the classical theory  and the latest techniques involving categorical constructions presents  opportunities for i mportant developments.  In contrast with Priddy's  emphasis, the field of algebraic topology has long sought, with much success,  to apply algebraic methods to the solution of geometric or topological  problems.  By reformulating topological problems in algebraic terms, one  is often able to answer a more tractable question.  In general, however,  there are many connections between these areas, which enables one to  reverse this procedure and bring topological methods to bear in algebra.  Priddy's project studies the interaction between topology and group theory,  with the aim of uncovering fundamental algebraic structures.  Powerful  symbolic manipulation techniques using high speed computers comprise part  of the project.  ***",
