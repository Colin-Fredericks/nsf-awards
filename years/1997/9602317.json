 "awd_abstract_narration": "Founded in 1887, Florida A&M University (FAMU), a Historically Black University, is one of the three oldest institutions of higher education in the State of Florida.  FAMU has been successful in producing minority students interested in pursuing advance degrees in scientific and engineering disciplines, including computer science.  Faculty and students of the Department of Computer and Information Science are currently engaged in basic research involving software engineering, real-time systems, parallel computing, artificial intelligence, object-oriented databases, computer architecture, data encryption and stimulation.  Research and training activities are performed in  the Benjamin Banneker Building Unit A, a facility that was constructed in 1966.  Present conditions, such as the lack of required communication and utility infrastructure impedes progress in conducting state of the art research in computer science.  Inadequate ventilation, and air conditioning often results in equipment failure and poor network connectivity does not facilitate access to computer equipment. To rectify these problems, the National Science Foundation and FAMU will establish a partnership to renovate research and research training laboratories in the Banneker Building. Renovations will  not only consist of remodeling lab space, upgrading the electrical and telecommunications infrastructure, and improving the HVAC and lighting systems, but will provide the necessary modifications to ensure the facility is compliant with ADA regulations.  Upon completion,  the project will enhance the ability of faculty to compete for extramural funding, continue to attract outstanding student scholars and faculty, and facilitate in the increase of the nation's minority doctorates in the sciences, engineering, and mathematics.",
