 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  goal  of  this research project is to develop algorithms  to  solve  dual problem of structure and motion recovery of  nonrigid  objects from multiple 2D views. Previously, algorithms have  been  developed  that  can  recover point correspondences  in  nonrigid  motion   from  range  data  sequences.  If  only  2D  projections  (perspective  or  scaled orthographic) are  available,  not  only  motion  but  also structure (i.e. 3D coordinates) of the  surface  points  need  to  be  determined.   There  are  several  research  questions related to nonrigid motion and structure recovery which  are  being addressed.  .First, depending on the observed  motion,  which  of  the various nonrigid motion models should be  utilized  (that  include determination  of the number of parameters  to  be  estimated)?  Second, once the motion model is decided,  how  many  feature  points, over how many frames are required  in  order  to  estimate   the   motion  and  structure  of  the   points   under  consideration? Further, the derived solutions need to be extended  to  line  (and  other)  features.   This  local  motion  modeling  approach  is often noise sensitive and may have problems handling  large   deformations.    Those  drawbacks   will   be   addressed  bycombining  local techniques with global models.  Global  models  under   investigation  include  time-varying  superquadrics   and  hyperquadrics, spherical harmonics as well as FEM models.",
