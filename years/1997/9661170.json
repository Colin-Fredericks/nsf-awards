 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a new instrument for the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of high-temperature superconducting (HTS) wires.  A major obstacle to commercial development of HTS applications is the inability to manufacture long lengths of wire reliably.  One conventional method to test long lengths of wire is to cut pieces from their ends and perform critical current measurements.  This leaves most of the wire untested.  The four-point resistivity method requires the attachment and subsequent removal of contacts, which risks damaging the wire and provides poor spatial resolution of defects.  This project will develop the Scanning WIre Magnetometer (SWIM) to scan the entire wire length's ac magnetic susceptibility continuously, measuring critical current density noninvasively and with high spatial resolution.  Operated as an eddy current instrument above the superconducting transition temperature, SWIM also evaluates the physical integrity of the wire's silver cladding. In Phase I, the project will demonstrate feasibility of scanning wire magnetometry using HTS wire samples provided by two project collaborators, Intermagnetics General Corp. and the State University of New York at Buffalo.  In Phase II,  an automated prototype will be fabricated for testing at an HTS wire fabrication facility.       This specific NDE market aims primarily to facilitate the cost-effective production of HTS wire, tape and thin film materials, with a secondary application to low-temperature superconducting wire production.  A direct commercial market for the SWIM of the order of several million dollars per year is expected, but has the potential to greatly accelerate the commercial development of HTS devices and thus indirectly to generate much larger markets.",
