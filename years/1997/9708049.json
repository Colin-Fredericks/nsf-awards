 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and computational Chemistry Program is supporting   Professor Sinnott at the University of Kentucky.  This work is also   cofunded by funds from the Division of Materials Research.  This research   will investigate the mechanical and chemical processes which occur when   organic molecular clusters impact surfaces at hyperthermal (about 5-80   eV/molecule) and keV incident energies.  The approach will be molecular   dynamics simulations where the forces on the individual atoms in the   clusters and surfaces are obtained from many-body empirical potentials.    These results will be checked by repeating the smaller simulations using   tight-binding approximation methods and comparing to experiment.  This   study will provide information about the types of chemical reactions that   occur under the high pressure conditions of cluster-solid- surface   impacts, detail the mechanisms of these reactions, reveal the types and   yields of chemical products, and document any structural changes to the   surface.  They will also reveal how the chemical reactions depend on a   number of factors including surface reactivity and cluster molecular   species, size and incident kinetic energy.  Cluster-solid-surface collisions are one of the most interesting topics   in the area of particle-surface interactions.  Some of the possible   outcomes include chemical reactions within the cluster to make new   chemical products and the growth of thin coatings of the cluster material   on the surface.   However, there is much that is not known about the   chemistry that occurs during such collisions, especially those that   involve clusters of carbon and hydrogen, despite the scientific and   technological importance of hydrocarbon materials (such as petroleum   products and diamond).  This research will use computational simulations   to investigate the mechanical and chemical processes which occur when   these molecular clusters impact surfaces at speeds comparable to those   that occur during explosions and in interstellar space.  The results will   provide information about the types of chemical reactions that occur   under the high pressure conditions of cluster-solid-surface impacts and   reveal the variety and yields of chemical products.  They will also show   how the chemical reactions that take place vary with changes in the   reaction conditions.",
