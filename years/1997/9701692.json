 "awd_abstract_narration": "The application of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) has been driven by the rapid  growth of digital computing power and the need for fast, reliable computer  processing techniques for communication, biomedical, manufacturing, seismic,  radar, and a wide variety of other signals for commercial and scientific  interest.  Despite the great success of traditional DSP techniques, many real-  world problems remain unsolved due to the nonlinearities and non-Gaussian noises  often encountered in these applications.  Solving these more complex problems  requires the development of new, more flexible, nonlinear DSP theory and tools.   The objectives of this project are to develop these new tools and theory, and to  transfer them directly into practice and into the engineering classroom.    A new framework for nonlinear DSP based on the wavelet transform is currently  under study.  The desirable properties of the wavelet transform, such as time-  frequency localization and signal compression, are being exploited to develop  sophisticated, yet tractable, nonlinear processing techniques.  Key elements of  the work include the development of statistical re-sampling methods and data-  adaptive wavelet analyses for nonlinear DSP.  Applications of the new framework  to cross-disciplinary problems in imaging and communications are being  investigated.  The principal investigator is concurrently developing innovative  approaches to engineering education including Internet-based tutorials and  documentation of new research, cross-disciplinary student design projects, and  tools for curriculum assessment.",
