The  results  to  be obtained  are  of  interest  in  the  formulation and confirmation of advanced theory, which itself may  apply    to    other   phenomena   such   as   high   temperature  superconductivity,   which   remain   poorly   understood.   More  specifically, the properties of the collective ground  states  of  two-dimensional and size-quantized systems of few   and  strongly  correlated  electrons will be studied. Particular topics  include  integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, the associated  one-  dimensional edge states, Wigner crystallization and single-charge  carrier   tunneling  phenomena.  Experimental   methods   include  magnetotransport,  thermal activation, nonlinear  transport,  and  resonant   and  single-particle  tunneling,  performed   at   low  temperature and high magnetic field.  %%%  This  experimental research project is concerned  with  the  most  fundamental  quantum  mechanical properties of  condensed  matter  probed in an elegant fashion at low temperature and high magnetic  field.
