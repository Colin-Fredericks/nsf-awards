 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703930  Kramer    This award provides support for the acquisition of a dynamic  secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) based on a quadrupole mass  analyzer for materials research.  It will be installed in the  Electron Microscope and Microanalytical Facility of the  University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) Materials Research  Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) and will be open to use by  all qualified users at UCSB and the nationwide MRSEC system.  The  instrument selected is optimized for depth profiling insulating  samples such as polymers and ceramics but will also serve the  most of the depth profiling needs for semiconductors.  It is  equipped with a rotation attachment, for improving depth  resolution at interfaces well below the surface, as well as a  liquid nitrogen cooled sample stage accessory, which will make it  possible to depth profile polymers that are molten at room  temperature.  In addition to the standard duoplasmatron ion  source (for oxygen or argon ions), a cesium ion source will be  acquired.  While an O2+ or AR+ beam is ideal for polymer depth  profiling, a Cs+ beam is optimum for depth profiling many  elements in semiconductors.  The acquisition of this instrument  will provide important new capabilities for investigating phase  separation in polymer thin films, short range diffusion in  ordered block copolymer systems, the grafting of polymer chains  to polymer/polymer interfaces by chemical reaction, the structure  of surfaces of semifluorinated side group block copolymer  surfaces that resist reconstruction in water and of antifouling  coatings made of copolymer consisting of water soluble blocks and  non-water soluble glassy blocks and for monitoring the formation  of molecular bridges between surfaces in hot melt adhesives.  %%%  While this instrument will have an exceptional impact on research  on polymer surfaces and interfaces, it will also be of great  value to researchers investigating impurity levels in epitaxial  thin films of oxides and diffusion i n ceramics.  Moreover the  dynamic SIMS will enable much improved characterization of  nitrides grown by both metal organic chemical vapor deposition  (MOCVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), as well as multiple  quantum well structures in these systems for optoelectronic  devices.  SIMS depth profiling of Mn in Mn ion implanted GaAs  magnetic semiconductors will provide crucial information on the  nanostructure of these exciting materials.  SIMS determinations  will provide key information on vertical cavity semiconductor  laser structure grown by MBE, on non-stoichiometry in compound  semiconductor layers and on oxide distribution in AlAs layers.  In addition the dynamic SIMS capability will provide fundamental  understanding of the non-equilibrium diffusion, trapping, and  activation of impurities during silicon processing.  The high  interest shown in this instrument by materials researchers at  UCSB and elsewhere is a strong indication that it will be fully  utilized to do exciting materials science.  ***",
