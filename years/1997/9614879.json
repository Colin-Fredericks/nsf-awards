Specifically, the  equipment to be purchased will include a system upgrade for their  2-G enterprises Model 760 superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM)  with DC SQUIDS and a rebuilt cryocooler and new compressor,  degaussing system electronics and coils and an ARM magnetizer for  alternating field experiments, and an automatic sample handler.  Additional equipment to be purchased and/or fabricated \"in-house\"  includes a low temperature cryostat for their Micromag  alternating field gradient magnetometer (AFGM), a furnace for  thermal demagnetization studies, a Kappabridge and other  ancillary laboratory equipment.  This equipment will allow  paleomagnetists at SIO to conduct further research on the  relative paleointensity recorded in very weakly magnetized marine  sediments from the Ontong-Java Plateau and from sections of the  Cretaceous Normal Superchron, Umbria Italy.  Additional studies  that will be enhanced by the capabilities of the new equipment  will include but are not limited to, records of the global  paleointensity of the Earth's magnetic field from submarine  basaltic glass collected from DSDP/ODP drill sites into basement,  analyses of the physical properties of geologic materials from  examination of hysteresis loop behavior over a wide range of  temperatures, thermal demagnetization studies of lava flows from  the Azores and the Canary Islands to determine paleosecular  variation of the geomagnetic field since the early Pliocene and  rock magnetic characterization of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB)  from the southern East Pacific Mid-Ocean Ridge (EPR) to aid in  explanation of a widespread occurrence of a short-wavelength high  in sea-surface magnetic anomalies over ridge axes, termed the  Central Anomaly Magnetic High (CAMH).  ***",
