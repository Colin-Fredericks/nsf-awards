 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially fund a workshop to be held at The  Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, on April 30 through  May 3, 1997 on the topic of reconciling existing systems of  gene nomenclature.  Rapid comparative, multi-species genome  mapping and the integration of genetic data derived from  various model organisms have become powerful tools in  understanding the structure and function of the human  genome.  These various model organism communities until now  have developed independent systems for naming genes which  has resulted in an abundance of duplicate names and various  other nomenclatural inconsistencies which are especially  problematic when genes are compared among species. Accurate  gene names are essential for effective communication both  in the literature and in online database cross-linking.    This workshop will serve as a forum for discussing current  nomenclature issues and for the coordination of this  information among nomenclature groups for different  species.  Although the mouse and human nomenclature  committees have met formally in the past, this will be the  first multi-organism genetic nomenclature workshop.  It  will bring together approximately 40 scientists  representing various species (vertebrates, invertebrates,  yeast, and plants), and databases (MGD, GDB, GSDB, EMBL,  NCBI) to discuss issues such as 1) developing systematic  approaches to nomenclature and symbol assignment across  species, 2) improving links between databases, 3)  organizing genes into gene families and retrieving family  information from databases, 4) fostering working  relationships among those involved in nomenclature, and 5)  encouraging community curation of gene family designations  across species. A summary manuscript will be prepared and  submitted for publication in the journal Genomics and for  on-line access.",
