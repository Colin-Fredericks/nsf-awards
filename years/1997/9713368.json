 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  EEC-9713368  MAHAJAN    It is potentially feasible to use MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) technology to produce a device for trimming and providing the fine RF tuning adjustments needed in microwave/millimeter-wave integrated circuits.  However, to date there has not been a reported demonstration of this technique in a MEMS device.  This award supports a tie project between two Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers, Berkeley Sensors and Actuators Center (BSAC) at the University of California at Berkeley, and the Center for Advanced Manufacturing and Packaging of Microwave, Optical and Digital Electronics (CAMPmode) at the University of Colorado at Boulder, to develop a complete numerical/experimental characterization at microwave/millimeter-wave frequencies to derive an RF network model for MEMS.  The methodology developed will be illustrated by implementation of the technique in a high-efficiency, switched mode microwave/millimeter-wave power amplifier for mobile and portable systems.  CAMPmode is one of the leading university research centers in millimeter microwave packaging technologies, and BSAC is one of the leading research facilities in the development of MEMS technology.  Together, these two Centers are well qualified to perform the proposed research, which is a project that neither Center has the capability to perform on its own.",
