 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, focusses on the study of the role of electronic  conjugation in promoting long-range electron transfer between a  metal electrode and redox site located at a known distance from the  electrode surface.  Key to this work will be the use of alkyl  thiols with pendant ferrocene groups to form self assembled  monolayers on metal electrode surfaces.  Phenylene and naphthalene  moieties will be substituted at various known positions along the  alkyl chain to vary the position of electronic conjugation.  During  this three year continuing grant Professor Creager and his research  students at Clemson University will synthesize these compounds,  characterize their structure upon formation of self assembled  monolayers, and study their electron transfer properties using  ellipsometry, reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy,  potential step chronoamperometry, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, and  fast electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.  This project will  contribute to the understanding of the function of biological  electron transfer reactions, test the theory and experimental  probes of fast electron transfer reactions that occur over long  distances, and determine the relative contributions of electronic  coupling and nuclear dynamics in controlling the kinetics of these  processes.  Many biological processes, electronic materials, and nanoscale  catalytic structures require electron transfer reactions that occur  in short periods of time over long distances.  The trapping,  conversion, and subsequent efficient use of energy can become  practical when long range electron transfer processes are fast.   This project will involve research students at Clemson University  in the determination of the molecular level requirements for fast  electron transfer reactions.  Very fast electrochemical and  spectroscopic measurements will be used to test and further develop  modern theories on the dependence of electron transfer rates on  distance.",
