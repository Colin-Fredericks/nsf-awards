Little research has heretofore focused on local legal practices of the citizens in post-colonial states and the role these legal negotiations play in question of national  identity.  By studying contemporary and historical land cases, the investigators explore change in the legal and social definitions of custom over time.  The project explores the differing ways the indigenous population and the legal system use and define customs.  This work evaluates the theory that evolving definitions of custom are directly related to processes at the state level in defining national identity.  Interviews with local people, judges, and attorneys involved in land cases in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Micronesia,  and archival records will provide data to address these questions.  This work contributes to our basic understanding of the development of legal rules.",
