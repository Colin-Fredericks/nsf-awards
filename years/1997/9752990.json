 "awd_abstract_narration": "9752990       Interactivity has been introduced to introductory physics  courses with dramatic success.  Instead of just reinforcing the  students' preconceived ideas about motion, an interactive physics  classroom gives students a deeper and more conceptual understanding  of technical material.  This project will introduce interactivity  through real-life case studies in an advanced materials science  laboratory offered through the Mechanical Engineering Department.   In addition to the interactive activities, however, students will  also get the opportunity to develop important job skills such as  writing, oral presentation, working on teams and open-ended problem  solving.  Specifically, case studies based on real-life situations  will be introduced to the students in an interactive computer  program.  After learning about the problem and what is at stake,  students will be asked to place themselves in the case study as  engineers or consultants in industry given the task of resolving a  problem.  They will collect data using actual materials testing  equipment and interpret the data for the rest of the class in the  form of a written and oral presentation.  Pre- and post-tests are  suggested to assess the success of this new format.  The new case  studies that are proposed are all fictional, but efforts will be  made to find actual case studies from industry to incorporate into  the laboratory exercises.       The goals of this project are two-fold:  to design laboratory  exercises with case studies so students can associate laboratory  activities with real-world problems and to develop important job  skills in the process of participating in the laboratory.  Students  should finish the course with a better appreciation for materials  testing methods and what they mean and improved job skills, which  ultimately makes them more employable and better engineers.",
