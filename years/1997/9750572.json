 "awd_abstract_narration": "An improved educational model for preparing graduates to enter the engineering profession addresses the problem that past graduates had been inadequately prepared to enter the engineering workplace.  The project objectives are to instill the attributes of professional design engineers into engineering seniors.  These attributes include team skills, interpersonal communication skills, leadership abilities, and an appreciation of diversity.  A systems perspective; a commitment to quality, to timeliness, and to continuous improvement; and sound technical knowledge are also sought.  Specifically, a Professional Design Laboratory specializing in communication systems and modeled after the industrial work setting is being established in the Electrical Engineering Department.  The key attribute of this unique facility is the establishment of a new environment of expectations and performance for the students.  The laboratory provides a rich complement of resources to support open-ended design projects proposed by industrial partners.  Collaborative learning, practice with interpersonal communication skills, and hands-on learning are key features of the student experience.  Students spend 2 full days per week in the laboratory modeled after the industry work setting.  Besides a new model for engineering laboratory education, several video-taped instructional modules are being prepared, including those on written and oral presentations, and digital communication systems.  Each module consists of video, notes, references to literature, problems, and laboratory exercises.  The modules can be made available to educators at other universities.    *",
