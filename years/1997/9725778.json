 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose an integrated approach to minimizing power consumption of high-performance wireless communication systems.  Our interdisciplinary approach will simultaneously address key levels of system design:  minimum-energy communication techniques, energy-efficient signal processing electronics, high efficiency RF front-ends, and concurrent optimization methods. Our objective will be reached by developing design methodologies in the following research areas: (a) Modulation, detection, equalization, diversity, and resource allocation techniques for time and code-division multiple-access channels, which instead of concentrating on achieving channel capacity without regard to complexity, focus on minimum-energy communications while accounting for energy consumption for their implementation (b) Low-energy mixed-signal electronics to perform baseband functions such as data processing, coding, equalization etc. Our approach includes two components: digital logic with energy recovery using switch-mode RF circuits, and very low-power analog neural hardware. (c) High-efficiency integrated active antenna arrays, with a potential for manifold increase in overall DC to radiated carrier power efficiency.  Our approach saves space and power by integrating high-efficiency switch-mode RF circuits with compact antenna arrays, allowing added functionality such as beam forming and (d) Concurrent design optimization over stochastic parameters, which can yield significantly lower power consumption in existing designs, and can take further advantage of the above methodologies.    These savings will yield smaller, lighter, more reliable, and more capable wireless, hand-held, lap-top, and vehicular communication devices.  The developed technologies and design methodologies will apply to mobile communication systems for the more than 25 million U.S. cellular subscribers as well as the millions of PCS subscribers over the horizon.",
