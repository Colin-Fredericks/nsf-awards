Since  many  of  these  compounds  exhibit  interesting  physical  properties such as superconductivity, unusual magnetic  behavior,  valence  fluctuations and heavy fermion phenomena, and since  the  structure  of  these  compounds often strongly  influences  these  physical    properties,    studying   their    structure-property  relationships  will  also be emphasized.  Theoretical  electronic  structure calculations and computer simulations of the structural  changes will be carried out.  %%%  Understanding  the chemistry and physics of this class  of  solid  state  compounds  has  relevance for device  fabrication  at  the  molecular  level,  and investigating the degree  to  which  solid  state  chemical  synthesis can be applied to the  fabrication  of  molecular  electronic devices is of high technological  interest.  Some   of  these  compounds  have  the  capability  of  confining  electrons  in  two-dimensional  layers,  similar  to  that  of  a  superlattice.     Others   show   the    tendency    of    charge  disproportionation, a mechanism being explored for the occurrence  of superconductivity in the cuprate materials.  Investigating the  chemical and physical properties of these compounds is crucial to  exploring new routes to material processing and fabrication,  and  new  device applications. This focused research group project  is  funded  by  the  Office of Multidisciplinary  Activities  of  the  Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the  Solid  State Chemistry and Polymers Program of the Division of Materials  Research.  ***",
