 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to gather, organize and analyze  data from the Northwestern Tungusic languages:  Oroqen,  Evenki, Negidal, and Solon.  The languages, which are spoken  in northern China and Siberian Russia, are not well-  documented and all are seriously endangered.  Therefore, a  primary goal of the project is to collect information about  the structure of the languages while they are still spoken.   This information will be derived through recordings of the  languages and elicitation sessions with native speakers.   The geographic distribution of the Northwestern Tungusic  languages has hampered comparative work on them in the past.   Russian linguists and Chinese linguists who have engaged in  fieldwork on these languages have had little scholarly  dialogue.  An important aspect of our research involves  bringing together the work of our Russian and Chinese  colleagues.  The actual genetic relationships among these  four languages and their relationships to other Tungusic  languages are unclear.             On the basis of the data we collect, we can provide a  more accurate assessment of the genetic affiliations within  the language family.  We will also conduct tests of mutual  intelligibility using recordings of narrative texts. The  Northwestern Tungusic languages are being replaced by  Russian, Chinese, and Yakut, all of which are genetically  and typologically distinct. We aim at determining the kinds  of structural changes the Tungusic languages are undergoing  as they become obsolescent, with specific attention to the  role of the three contact languages.",
