 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of a student from the University of California-Los Angeles.  The student will study the illness management practices of a tribal society in the Peruvian Amazon area, to investigate how people choose between medical alternatives.  The student will get information on how illnesses interrupt the daily routines of patients and their families, how people perceive their experiences  when ill and how their cognitions change over time, and the effects of cultural knowledge, interruptions of daily routine and social-economic conditions on medical treatment choice.     This research is important because it will advance our knowledge about the micro-processes of change in people's beliefs as they undergo medical treatment.  By focusing on health seeking behaviors, the project will advance our understanding of key indicators and priorities that determine the initiation of health action as well as factors affecting treatment choice.  In addition the research will add to our information about this important area of the continent.                                                       \u00e1(",
