The student participants will be involved in research in Land and Water Engineering and Biological Engineering.  The program is structured to create an environment for guided independent discovery and maturation of self-expression by the students.  The students will work in teams including faculty, graduate students and staff conducting research on current problems being investigated in biological systems engineering using state of-the-art facilities, equipment and instrumentation.    The goal of the program is to provide an active, rich, comprehensive research experience which will excite and motivate the students toward a research career in engineering for biological systems.  Students will practice the scientific method, enhance their thinking and reasoning abilities, sharpen their communication skills, gain further appreciation of the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of problems.  They will also gain hands-on experience in laboratory and field research methods, and learn how to be an active team member a focused and motivated group of individuals with diverse backgrounds.    Student participants will be involved in two overlapping research programs in Biological Systems Engineering - Land and Water Engineering and Biological Engineering.  Diverse research problem areas include a) environmental activities focused on determining the effects of land use and best management practices in water quality, and b) bioprocessing problems aimed at the development and production of industrial products from biological feedstocks.  Both areas of research seek to provide more sustainable crop and animal production and processing systems while protecting our soil, water, air and other natural resources.  ***",
