 "awd_abstract_narration": "9615305  Miller   Competition is well known to affect growth and reproduction in plants.  Plants are thought to compete for a number of resources, including water, nitrogen, and light.  Such competition frequently suppresses plants to less than 5% of their maximum possible growth, but exactly how plants compete is relatively unknown.  We therefore have even less idea of how important competition has been in plant evolution and how we might expect plants to evolve when in competition.  This study directly follows the evolution of plants grown under competition for different resources.  Populations of wild mustard, Brassica rapa, will be grown in competition with another species, Raphanus raphanistrum, for three generations.  Each generation, the plants that are \"better\" competitors will be chosen to pass on a greater genetic contribution to the next generation through both seeds and pollen.  In this way, lines of plants will be bred to be better competitors under specific environmental conditions.  At the end of the breeding, the selected lines will be tested to determine whether their competitive ability did increase and to determine what characteristics of the plants evolved.   Determining how plants evolve in response to a major component of their environment (competition) is scientifically important in providing insight into both the evolutionary past and future  plants.  The results could be used not only to explain why plants have their present characteristics, but also to explain aspects of biodiversity by suggesting how groups of plants evolve.  Such information could be of great use to conservation biologists interested in explaining or predicting where plants may or may not be successful.  It also has agronomic value:  virtually all crop plants are grown under significant competition, and this study could help reveal how crop productivity is related to the evolution of competitive ability.",
