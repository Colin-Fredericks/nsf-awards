 "awd_abstract_narration": "The instrumentation and measurement of systems is  vital for them to be understood, debugged, tuned,  refined, tested, validated, or made reliable.  This project will investigate the principles and  practice of program instrumentation. Principles  include a theoretical understanding of the  dynamic measurement and observation of various  structures in parallel, distributed, and  sequential systems, such as acyclic or cyclic  graphs for representing parallel executions and  families of finite automata for tracking  information about variable accesses. The  complexity of computing and analyzing such  structures will be explored, including tradeoffs  between time, space, accuracy, and completeness.  The practice of instrumentation implements  measurement techniques at a cost acceptable to  users, using on-line algorithms to dynamically  decide what to do and when it is best done and by  fully exploiting the semantics of the problem at  hand. Techniques will be developed, especially  for debugging and programming tools, for problems  whose best-known solutions are currently  prohibitive because of instrumentation costs. An  arsenal of practical techniques usable in many  areas, all of which are based on theoretical  underpinnings, will also be developed. This  research will result in a deeper understanding of  the cost of solving various types of  instrumentation problems and an array  of techniques for their solution.  This project  will introduce undergraduates to research by  involving  them  in independent study seminars together with  \"project sets\" partially specified mini-research  problems which require as much work in problem  formulation as solution. This project will  escalate the undergraduate-outreach effort  at  Brown. The tools  this  project will produce  will be suitable for use by students in their  research projects.***",
