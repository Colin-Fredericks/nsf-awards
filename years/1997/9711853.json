 "awd_abstract_narration": "A  critical  issue in recognizing 3D objects and  in  registering  surfaces  is  the  definition  of a ound  measure  of  similarity  between  3D shapes. Although shape similarity metrics  have  been  proposed in the case of 2D shapes, only partial results have been  obtained  for  3D  shapes. Part of the  problem  is  that  it  is  difficult  to  define  the  necessary pose-independent  reference  frame    on   a   3D   surface.    This   research   investigates  representations of 3D shapes that lead to a natural definition of  shape  similarity  that  can be built directly  from  point  sets  without  requiring feature extraction, segmentation,  or  surface  fitting.  These representations may be adjusted to  be  either  a  global representation of a surface (e.g., for object recognition)  or  a  more  local  representation (e.g., for tracking  of  local  surface  patches.)  They  lead naturally  to  3D  shape  matching  algorithms  directly  applicable to object recognition  problems.  Beyond   their  application  to  3D  object  recognition,   these  representations will provide a framework for the analysis  of  3D  shapes. Of particular interest is the study of shape classes  and  generic  object recognition.  The shape representations  and  the  associated  matching algorithms are validated  through  scenarios  motivated  by  real  applications.  In  one  application,  object  recognition is used for building and identifying geometric models  of   industrial  parts.  In  a  second  application,  the   shape  similarity technique is used for registering views of terrain and  landmark  surfaces  in  a natural environment  for  mobile  robot  navigation and mapping.",
