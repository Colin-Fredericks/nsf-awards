Gowayed, Department of  Textile  Engineering at Auburn University in Alabama, and Dr. Faissal  Abdel-Hady, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Ain Shams  University, in Cairo, Egypt.  The objective of this joint  research is to study the feasibility of manufacturing fiber  reinforced composites using computer-aided design and  computer-aided manufacturing methods.  Specifically the goal  of the two sides is to design and manufacture a compressed  natural gas pressure vessel from composite materials to be  used in dual fuel passenger cars.  The two sides plan to:  connect novel compost design techniques, developed by Dr.  Gowayed, based on Non-linear Programming (NLP), to machine  control operators, developed by Dr. Abdel-Hady; construct a  computer-aided Manufacturing system for filament winding at  Ain Shams University; and manufacture a prototype for a  compressed natural gas pressure vessel for dual fuel  passenger cars.    Scope:  This research project will bring together the  expertise of two scientists from two countries towards  accomplishing an objective with potential benefits to the  United States and to Egypt, as well as to the global  environmental picture.  The purpose is to develop a light  weight vessel that can be used to store liquefied natural  gas for use as a fuel in dual fuel passenger cars, thus  reducing the adverse emissions that result from burning  petroleum products, especially in congested cities around  the world.  The project can lead to establishing a new  research capability in Egypt for the manufacture of fiber  composites using advanced computer-aided techniques.  An  important feature of this project is the participation of  two private-sector industrial concerns in Egypt in the  research and testing.  This proposal meets the INT objective  of increasing US-foreign collaboration in areas that benefit  both sides.  This project is being supported under the U S-  Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to  scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out  these cooperative activities.  ***",
