 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704549  Forest    Modulation theory and rigorous analysis of the small dispersion limit of   scalar and vector nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations are fundamental to   data transmission in nonlinear fiber optics.  For pulses in use today, so-  called \"non-return-to-zero\" or NRZ pulses, fundamental issues consist of:    how do the pulses degrade?, and, what combination of fiber properties and   pulse features determine how much and where the pulse degrades?  The   principal investigator and Ken McLaughlin have studied these questions for   two particular transoceanic fibers in use today, with answers provided to the   above questions.  Proposed new research involves the description of pulse   propagation once degradation has begun; mathematically, these results   require generalization of integrable PDE methods in two fundamental ways.    First, one must provide detailed behavior of the solution after shock   formation, including how fast the ripples spread and evolve with the main   pulse; and second, there are no results to date for weak dispersive behavior   of the coupled NLS equations which apply when there are birefringent   effects, and there is no systematic construction of oscillatory solutions for   coupled NLS pdes.    Current data transmission questions in nonlinear fiber optics have to be   answered in order to achieve a robust, faithful communication link for the   various planned applications.  These questions relate to:  the type of fiber   one uses; for a given fiber, the type of data one sends as carriers of   information bits; for given fiber and data, how long can the transmission   line be before unacceptable errors occur as bits become distorted.    Remarkably for the applied mathematical community, each of these issues   can be framed in terms of cutting-edge questions in special nonlinear partial   differential equations called nearly integrable.  The pulse propagation in   modern nonlinear fibers is well-known to be approximated by the solution   of perturbed nonlinear  Schrodinger equations, special equations studied in   great detail by the principal investigator for twenty years.  The material   properties of the fiber give coefficients in the equations, the length of the   fiber dictates how long one must construct the solution, and the shape of the   data that is sent  along the fibers is the input for the solution.  The modeling   of pulse propagation and degradation involves two phases:  the   mathematical understanding and description of the solutions of these   equations for these special types of input data; and the transfer of the   mathematical insights and tools to practical understanding, identification of   problems, and suggestions for remedies.  The issues of how pulses degrade   and how to shape pulses to minimize degradation are fundamental   mathematical issues which form the core of the proposed research.  The P.I.   has and will continue to communicate with the technological community,   consisting thus far of visits and conversations with staff scientists at Lucent   Technologies and Corning,  Inc.",
