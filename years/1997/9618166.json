 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618166  Moore         Fluid-rock  interactions  and  associated   tectonic-  hydrologic  processes exert fundamental controls on  crustal  evolution.   Accretionary  prisms   incorporate   fluid-rich  sediments   at   high   strain  rates,   providing   natural  laboratories  where  tectonic and hydrologic  processes  are  accessible   to  drilling,  quality  seismic   imaging   and  monitoring. Evaluation of tectonic and hydrologic  processes  here  provides  models for deeper level  phenomena  in  both  active tectonic belts and more quiescent sedimentary basins.        Faults are conspicuous fluid migration conduits of the  northern Barbados accretionary prism. Fluids migrating along  faults  are  deeply  sourced,  alter  sediments  that   they  contact,   and  mediate  structural  processes.  A  recently  collected 3D seismic data volume in this area clearly images  the  plate  boundary  detachment or  decollement  fault  and  related  thrust splays.  As a follow-on effort  to  previous  work   on  this  Barbados  3D  seismic  volume,  we  propose  application  of seismic coherency analysis to  the  data,  a  revolutionary post-stack processing technique.   We  propose  to  investigate  the coherency signature of the  decollement  surface, the boundaries between reflection polarities  along  this  surface  and any coherency anomalies within  areas  of  like  reflection polarity.  These analyses will  be  carried  out  at  AmocoOs Technology Center in Tulsa Oklahoma,  where  this processing technique was developed.  ***",
