These dyesuperconductor systems  are sensitive to the influence of light, making cryogenic optical  switching processes possible. Initial work has shown that  molecular dyes can be used to sensitize superconductor junctions  to specific wavelengths of light. Optically sensitive assemblies  which display rapid response time, high sensitivity and selective  wavelength response characteristics have been prepared. The  spectral response behavior of such systems correlate well with  the absorbance properties exhibited by the dye layer. Since a  large number of dyes with different spectral and photophysical  properties can be incorporated into such systems, it is possible  to prepare a plethora of structures which are tailored from the  molecular level so as to suit a variety of different  applications. Depending on the photophysical properties of the  dye, systems which foster rapid and direct energy transfer  between the dye and the superconductor can be fashioned. Other  systems can be prepared which function through the propagation of  thermal waves from the dye to the superconductor. Moreover,  injection of \"hot\" (i.e. nonequilibrium) electrons can also be  envisioned as an alternative method to induce a measurable  electrical response in the superconductor. Interesting issues  related to the efficiency of energy and electron transfer  phenomena between excited dyes and superconducting interfaces can  be explored for the first time with the use of highly oriented  thin film structures. Important information related to the  chemical compatibility between the molecular dye components and  the cuprate compounds can be acquired through an evaluation of  the superconductor interfacial properties before and after dye  deposition. From the proposed studies, the following information  is anticipated: 1.) Reliable methods to construct  dye-superconductor assemblies will be identified. 2.) Che mical  compatibility of molecular layers and high-Tc superconductors  will be explored. This information will be useful not only for  the development of the optical devices, but also will contribute  to the more rapid development of traditional high-Tc thin film  devices. 3.) The initial information related to  dye-superconductor energy transfer processes will be obtained.  4.) The efficiencies of thermal wave, hot electron injection and  direct dipole coupling energy transfer processes will evaluated.  5.) Systems which incorporate luminescent (fluorescent and  phosphorescent), nonluminescent, photoconductive, electrochromic  and photochromic dye structures will be evaluated to identify and  to explore the various molecule/superconductor communication  channels. 6.) This highly interdisciplinary program will not only  target the development of a knowledge base in a novel new field  of science, but will also serve as an excellent training grounds  for future scientists in a strategically important area.  %%%  A broad program which targets the design, fabrication and  characterization of dye/superconductor assemblies is described.  Work completed in the Investigator's laboratory has already  demonstrated that a number of dye systems can be used in  combination with superconductor thin film elements to produce a  variety of optically sensitive assemblies that respond  selectively to different wavelengths of light. The utilization of  the superconductors yield structures where very efficient energy  transfer between the light harvesting dye layer and the  superconductor occurs. The use of various molecular systems  affords the opportunity to prepare a plethora of optical!y  sensitive structures that can be tailored from the molecular  level for a variety of applications. Studies of the  dye/superconductor assemblies will yield useful information  related to more effective processing methods that can be used for  the more rapid commercialization of high-Tc devices.  Moreover,  the dye/superconductor  platform should provide a convenient means  to explore dye/dye and dye/superconductor energy and electron  transfer phenomena. The ability of a hybrid superconducting  assembly to sense different wavelengths of light in a  controllable fashion may have important consequences for future  application of superconducting sensors and devices.",
