 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are (a) to enhance the information content of current geometric models to convey information necessary for machining, and (b) to develop an integrated, automated method for manufacturing data generation that interacts with all phases of die and mold manufacturing. The enhancement of information content of geometric models will focus on methods for representing incremental changes in topology and geometry as a result of machining operations (surface roughness levels of detail will be considered). The geometry of the manufactured surface will be generated by considering the interactions between the tool and workpiece. Specifically, the information of excess material left behind as a result of the previous pass will be used to generate paths for various activities (e.g., milling, grinding, measuring, etc.) thereby integrating these activities.      This research, if successful, will result in improvements in the process of manufacturing data generation for dies and molds leading to savings in time and improved accuracy. In addition, a new framework for representing manufactured surfaces (in the context of dies and molds) will result, providing a seamless flow of information across activities that are currently independent thereby reducing the product development cycle.",
