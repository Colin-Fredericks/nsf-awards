 "awd_abstract_narration": "9605227  Tau`    This Americas Program award  will support a  collaborative research project between Dr. Haskell  Taub, University of Missouri, Columbia, and Dr. Ulrich  Volkmann, Pontificia Universidad Catolica, Santiago,  Chile, to conduct ellipsometric studies of alkane  selective adsorption. A fundamental problem in polymer  science concerns how a polymer species adsorbs from a  multicomponent fluid mixture onto a solid surface.  The  goal of the research is to use model systems to  elucidate the mechanism of selective adsorption in  which one molecular species preferentially adsorbs from  solution at a solid interface. Recent scanning  tunneling microscopy (STM) studies have revealed  crystalline structures for long-alkane monolayers on  the graphite basal-plane surface as well as qualitative  features of the molecular packing.  They have not,  however, answered basic structural and dynamical  questions related to their selective adsorption.  The  proposed research will address these questions. A  microscopic understanding of this selective adsorption  could impact greatly on technologies related to  coatings, adhesion, and lubrication.    The collaboration between the two researchers will  provide a unique opportunity to apply complementary  experimental techniques to the studies.  Professor  Volkmann is one of the world's experts in the use of  ellipsometric techniques to investigate the structure  and growth of physisorbed films, while Dr. Taub brings  his expertise in the application of neutron scattering  techniques.  ***",
