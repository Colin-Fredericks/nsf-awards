Temperature dependent NMR frequency shifts in the normal state will be  investigated as a function of magnetic field in order to identify their  origin which appears to be of fundamental significance.  High resolution  NMR experiments and heat capacity measurements will be performed on  superfluid helium 3 aerogels to understand the effects of impurities  introduced by the aerogel into this important superfluid system.  Close  interaction with theoretical work should allow us to establish the extent  to which anisotropic scattering models can account for our observations.  The basic tools that we propose to use are low temperature nuclear  demagnetization techniques to prepare samples of helium 3 imbibed into  highly porous silica aerogel.  The transition to superfluidity and the  strength of the order parameter and energy gap will be determined mainly  by nuclear magnetic resoncnce methods, complemented by acoustic  excitation of order parameter collective modes, thermal conductivity, and  heat capacity measurements.  %%%  The proposed work will further our understanding of a broad class of  materials of considerable interest in condensed matter physics and of  importance to a wide range of applications involving superconductivity.  The study of impurity  effects on the suppression of the transition  temperature for superfluidity in helium 3 will give important insight  into the unusual superfluid behavior in helium 3 as well as for other  similar Superconducting systems.  New phases and unusual properties  concerning the impurity helium 3 problem have recently  been discovered  by several groups including our own at Northwestern.  The impurities can  be introduced in the helium 3 using very dilute aerogel.  The aerogel  consists of tenuous strands of silica polymer of very high porosity.  The  helium 3 impurity problem is a model for un derstanding the limitations  and basic properties of new classes of superconducting materials  including high temperature superconductors.  The proposed work is also  relevant to the behavior of neutron matter in the cores of neutron stars.  These systems all have the common  important  characteristic of  spontaneously broken symmetries beyond gauge symmetry which is itself  responsible for the superfluid behavior.  As such they are all extremely  sensitive to impurity effects which must be investigated if the basic  behavior of these systems is to be understood and if the potential for  their application is to be realized.  This situation is particularly  relevant to the case of the high temperature superconductors for which  the proposed work can be viewed as a paradigm.  ***",
