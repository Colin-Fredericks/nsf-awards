The proposed NMR techniques for  characterizing segmental conformations in unoriented polymers, such as  amorphous polymers and polypeptides, are based on measuring the relative  orientations of adjacent segments by correlating anisotropic NMR couplings  (dipolar and chemical-shift anisotropies). The torsion-angle informatiol is  extracted from characteristic intensity patterns in the resulting 2D or 3D  spectra.  Eventually, in a 3D spectrum, 2D chemical-shift correlation  patterns will be separated by dipolar couplings.  The torsion-angle  distributions in various PET samples, polystyrenes, and other polymers will  be characterized.  Double-quantum NMR techniques for measuring the torsion  angles and in peptides have been demonstrated and will be applied to solid  polypeptide materials. Structure and mobility on a larger scale, e.g. in  phase-separating polymer blends or at the crystalline-amorphous interface,  will be investigated by  spin-diffusion NMR.  In the area of molecular dynamics of solid polymers, multidimensional  exchange NMR methods that were introduced in part by this PI have elucidated  relaxations in polymers, which influence many macroscopic materials  properties. New exchange NMR techniques will be developed, aiming, for  instance, at detecting small-amplitude or localized motions. Motional  processes, such as helical jumps, will be exploited for obtaining structural  information, e.g. to characterize polymer chain folds. The length scale of  motional heterogeneities in polymers above the glass transition will be  determined based on spatial information from spin diffusion.  %%%%  In this research program, solid polymers such as engineering  plastics and advanced biomaterials are investigated on a mole cular  level by novel nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. The  insight into molecular structures and motions, which are related  to mechanical properties such as toughness or creep, will  ultimately help industry in the development of improved polymer  materials. Students from three departments will be instructed  about modern NMR in theory and practice, while several graduate  students will be trained to use the latest multidimensional NMR  techniques in polymer research.  ***",
