 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program is supporting Prof.  Mark Gordon of Iowa State University.  The research to be performed will  be a combination of theory and code development in quantum chemistry and  related areas and applications of modern quantum chemistry to problems in  main group organometallic chemistry.  The new developments in theory will  focus on two areas: (1) an extension of the effective fragment method for  solvation to any solvent, to excited states, and to include higher-order  intermolecular interactions, and (2) to extend the interface between  quantum chemistry and dynamics to facilitate the study of dynamics of  liquids and solvation dynamics.  One of the key applications areas  interfaces with these new theory developments, namely the study of the  influence of solvation on mechanisms in organometallic chemistry.  Among  the many mechanisms of interest are the nature of the ring opening in  cyclic organosilicon compounds, the effect of catalysts on reactions such  as the hydrosilation and bis-silylation reactions, and the nature of the  organometallic coupling reaction.  Other applications include a   broad-based  study of the chemistry of titanium and other Group IVB elements, and  quantitative studies of the thermochemistry of main group- transition   metal  bonding.  Although most chemical reactions occur in the presence of a solvent,   until very  recently, the vast majority of theoretical studies have been carried out   on  isolated molecules.  Even now, most current models that include the   effects  of solvents do not explicitly treat the individual solvent molecules and  therefore cannot determine the nature of the interactions between the  chemical system of interest and the solvent.  The Gordon group has  developed a new solvent model, the effective fragment potential model,   that  is designed to treat the solvent molecules explicitly.  Currently, this  model is limited to the most ubiquitous solvent, water.  This model will  now be extended so that any solvent of interest in organometallic   chemistry  will be accessible.  The new method will be applied to study the effects   of  solvation on several important chemical reactions.  It is anticipated   that  these studies will provide some fundamental understanding of how these  reactions occur and ultimately provide some guidance on the design of new  products.",
