 "awd_abstract_narration": "The department is developing a networked scanning probe microscope (SPM) core facility to serve students and faculty throughout the state. Access for students from large introductory laboratories is being provided through a computer workstation facility. Students from smaller advanced classes, and other campuses, can access the SPM directly through onsite visitations. Remote access is being provided through the existing Integrated Services Digital Network and can also be provided through a new broad bandwidth network.    On campus, the new facility is anchoring general and advanced microscopy courses, supporting interdisaiplinary science instruction in introductory and advanced science laboratories, and facilitating interdisciplinary research projects. The campus is acting as a hub for SPM activity and as a gateway to other remote-access core microscopy facilities being developed. Specially developed mini-courses (e.g., nanotechnology or cell biology), using SPM technology, are being provided for science teachers on a regular basis.",
