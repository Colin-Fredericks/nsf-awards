Support from NSF will  be  used  to  cover  travel  expenses for  the  members  of  the  planning  committee,  and to provide for  meeting  space  at  O'Hare Airport in Chicago on Saturday, January 25, 1996.  %%%  An  ad  hoc group participating in the 1996 Gordon  Research  Conference  on Solid State Chemistry met in July to  discuss  organizing a Workshop in Solid State Chemistry and Materials  (SSCM).  A planning committee was formed which then  met  at  the  Materials  Research Society Symposium  on  Solid  State  Chemistry of Inorganic Materials in Boston in December, 1996  at   which  time  the  Proposal  for  Convening  a  Planning  Committee  to Institute a Workshop on Solid State  Chemistry  and  Materials  was  discussed and finalized.  The  Planning  Committee  meeting will be held on Saturday, January  25  at  Chicago's  O'Hare  Airport.   A follow-up  session  is  then  planned  which  will involve the Planning Committee  members  who  will  attend  the European Gordon Conference  on  Solid  State  Chemistry  in Oxford in the Fall  of  1997  with  the  objective  of  finalizing  participation  in  the  NSF  SSCM  Workshop by the international community working in areas  of  solid state chemistry and materials.  ***",
