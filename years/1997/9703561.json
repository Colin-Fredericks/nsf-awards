This approach has been shown  to result in a significant enhancement of the fracture  toughness of silicon nitride and silicon carbide ceramics.  However, it has not been applied in any systematic manner to  the toughening of oxide ceramics.  Mullite is an ideal  material for this type of toughening, as it is a single phase  oxide that is prone to the growth of elongated grains.  The  controlled heat treatment will allow the development of a  microstructure of elongated, plate-like grains and control of  the grain boundary chemistry.   Dense, single phase mullite,  fabricated by hot pressing below ~1600  C, will be heated  above 1700  C, which is in the two phase region (mullite and  liquid), where elongated grain growth is promoted.  The grain  growth kinetics will be measured at diffepent temperatures to  achieve an understanding of the microstructure evolution.  Oxide additives such as yttria, added to the mullite powder  prior to densification, will be used to control the chemistry  of the grain boundary phase.  The microstructure and  microchemistry of the fabricated materials will be  characterized by a variety of optical, diffraction,  microscopy, and spectrographic techniques. The modulus of  rupture and fracture toughness of the mullite will be  measured at room temperature by four-point bending of beams  sectioned from the hot pressed discs.  The effects of the  microstructure and the grain boundary chemistry on the these  mechanical properties will be determined. The data will be  used to determine the processing conditions to produce a  microstructure with optimum modulus of rupture and fracture  toughness at room temperature.  %%%  The ability to significantly improve the toughness of mullite  will enhance it s reliability in current applications in the  ceramics industry and its attractiveness for future  applications in the advanced structural ceramics sector.  Furthermore, because of the relative simplicity of the system  (e.g., mullite is a single phase oxide with no known phase  transformations), mullite can provide a model oxide system  for understanding the microstructure evolution and property  optimization by the in situ toughening approach.  In this  way, it can form a model system for future application of the  in situ approach to other oxide ceramics.  ***",
