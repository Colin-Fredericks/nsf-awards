 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most existing models of mobile computing systems assume the  presence of stationary base stations connected by a high  bandwidth wireline network backbone. Such systems are not  suitable for digital battlefield situations and emergency  response operations. Hence, there is a need for mobile  computing systems with mobile base stations. The flexibility  and robustness of such systems is at the cost of  increased complexity. Some of the problems that arise are:  (i) Difficulty in providing cellular coverage to the entire  service area all the time. (ii) Changing configuration of  cells complicates wireless channel allocation. Also, some  wireless channels are needed for communication links  between the mobile base stations. (iii) Mobile base stations  and the backbone links between them are resource poor  compared to their static counterparts. (iv) Changing  cellular configuration makes location management and  communication handoffs between cells more complicated.  In order to solve some of the problems mentioned above, a  five step approach will be adopted: (i) Formalization of a  taxonomy of mobile computing systems based on the mobility  pattern of base stations. (ii) Development of stochastic  models with different base station mobility characteristics.  (iii) Employment of analytical results in the development  ofdistributed algorithms for cell planning, channel  allocation, location management, and handoff management.  (iv) Simulation experiments to measure the performance of  these algorithms. (v) Software implementations of the  algorithms. Time and resource permitting, the software  solutions will be ported to off-the-shelf computation and  wireless communication devices.***",
