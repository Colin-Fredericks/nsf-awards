 "awd_abstract_narration": "Louisiana State University at Shreveport (LSUS) is the recipient of funds for the renovation of the Science Building.  Constructed in 1967, the building houses the Departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, and Physics.  All faculty in biology are involved in research that concentrates on utilizing molecular approaches to solve systematic and other biological problems.  Research interests in the biology include: genetics, cell biology, animal and plant physiology, microbiology and molecular biology.  Senior faculty in the Department of Chemistry and Physics maintain research specialties in biochemistry, organic chemical ecology, radio-organic and polymer chemistry, environmental chemistry, isotopic kinetics, and computation physics.  Recent additions of programs in biochemical science and environmental science, shared masters programs in molecular biology with LSU Medical Center, and a new graduate course in Environmental Science have exacerbated research and training facility needs.  In conjunction, when the research facilities were designed, LSUS was only a two year institution.  Renovations will encompass: the provision of adequate electrical outlets, vacuum, and water to all labs and instrument rooms, the installation of an autoclave system, and the upgrade of the air-handling system.  Several new fume hoods will be installed; existing fume hoods will be modified to improve efficiency of operation and safety.  The project will bring facilities into compliance with ADA requirements and State building standards.  Renovations will accelerate new directions for faculty research programs as well as significantly enhance multidisciplinary, research opportunities.  Renovation of the targeted facilities will insure greater capacity and safety for student research and encourage more students to consider science careers.",
