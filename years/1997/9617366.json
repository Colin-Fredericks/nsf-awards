 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algorithms for progressive image compression seek to represent an image in such  a way that a small fraction of the data file can allow a displayed image to be  recognizable, and a larger portion of the data allows improved image quality.   The main applications of progressive image compression are for browsing of remote  databases, Internet image hopping, and fast remote decision-making tasks where  many images must be scanned.  The goal is to compress images to rates so low as  to yield \"just-recognizable\" quality.  The user can then exploit just-  recognizable images while progressively scanning an image database by \"quitting\"  each image as soon as it is determined not to be the one sought.  This research  involves theoretical understanding of ultra-low rate progressive image coding  both with and without channel noise, as well as the development and evaluation  of practical algorithms for applications such as low-bandwidth video compression  and packet network image transmission.    One portion of this research focuses on algorithm development, including  optimization of wavelet zerotree coding for ultra-low rates, and coding using  regions or line caricatures.  The investigators are studying the effect of  channel noise on progressive coding systems, and are developing both grayscale  and color bit progressive image coding algorithms that do not exhibit  catastrophic breakdown in the presence of channel noise.  One promising approach  uses rate compatible punctured convolution codes applied to images compressed  with a wavelet zerotree method.  Experimental studies of response times for human  observers of progressive image coders will allow the researchers to  quantitatively compare one progressive image coder against another, and yield  insight into human perceptual responses to just-recognizable imagery.",
