 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research in programming   languages between Benjamin C. Pierce of Indiana University and Davide Sangiorgi of   INRIA (French National Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics)   at Sophia Antipolis, France.  The objective of their research is to study the use of static   type information for reasoning about concurrent systems through applications of process   calculi.  Previous work in this area has shown that systems with subtyping and linearity   can be `transplanted` from sequential programming languages to a pure calculus of   message-passing concurrency.  These refinements have benefits in flexibility and detection   of programming errors and can be used to justify useful program equivalences.  This work   will be extended to investigations on the role of parametric polymorphism and various   forms of noninterference between concurrent activities.    The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in design and implementation of   concurrent object-oriented languages and in theoretical studies of type systems.  This is   complemented by the French investigator's experience in concurrency theory and process   calculi.",
