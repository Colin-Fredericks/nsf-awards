 "awd_abstract_narration": "9618091  Lapp    The National Science Resource Center (NSRC) of the Smithsonian Institution will develop eight instructional modules, two professional development modules for teachers, and an implementation guide for science in grades seven and eight. When combined with Science and Technology for Children (instructional materials for grades 1-6 developed with support from the National Science Foundation), the NSRC will offer a comprehensive program in science and technology for grades 1-8 designed to enable all students to achieve the national and state standards for science education. The instructional modules will be balanced among life science, earth science, physical science, and design technology and can be sequenced as either a two-year course in general science or as separate courses for earth, life, physical science, and technology. The modules will include materials for assessing student learning, as well as information processing tools and other educational technology materials to enrich student learning. All modules will be developed by science teachers, in collaboration with scientists, engineers, science and technology educators, and a publications team, and will be published, marketed, and supported by a commercial publisher.",
