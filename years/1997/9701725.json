 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701725 Levy  This CAREER project aims to develop high resolution spatially and temporally resolved near-field optical techniques to investigate nanometer-scale phenomena in two materials systems: (1) ferroelectrics, quantum paraelectrics, and (2) ultrathin magnetic films. The broad aim of this research is to probe dynamical processes at the short length and time scales, and to relate these observations to macroscopic properties. For ferroelectric thin films, domain reversal and domain wall dynamics will be imaged stroboscopically at MHz-THz frequencies, with the goal of understanding fundamental mechanisms for microwave dissipation and dielectric dispersion. Nonlinear interactions between impulsively generated coherent phonons, domain walls, charged impurities and grain boundaries will be studied with anticipated near-atomic spatial resolution, and time resolution below the phonon period. Time-resolved techniques will be used to probe order parameter fluctuations in order-disorder ferroelectrics, and to search for signatures of a macroscopically coherent ground state in quantum paraelectrics at low temperatures. For magnetic films, a newly proposed Kerr-effect near-field microscopy will be developed for the purpose of studying magnetization dynamics on fundamental length scales and time scales. The nature of biquadratic exchange in coupled ferromagnetic layers, and the role of dynamic versus thermodynamic fluctuations at the reorientation phase transition of ultrathin magnetic epilayers will also be addressed. %%% The project addresses forefront research issues in materials science.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental atomic level to important aspects of ferroelectric and magnetic materials, in general.  An important feature of the program is a special emphasis on education, and on the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant research area.  ***",
