 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  96-61449  Rossin     This project investigates the development of a novel catalyst to control the emissions of volatile nitrogen-containing compounds (VNC's) without the generation of chemical NOx. VNC's are both hazardous and odorous, and therefore, their emissions must be controlled. Current technologies used to control VNC emissions result in the generation of significant amounts of NOx due to the atomic nitrogen associated with the VNC. The release of NOx into the atmosphere is a significant problem, since it has been linked to both smog and acid rain. Catalytic oxidation is a technology well suited for controlling vapor phase emissions. However, no catalyst is commercially available which is capable of destroying VNC's without the formation of NOx. A novel catalyst was recently identified which has demonstrated the ability to destroy hydrogen cyanide without forming NOx over a wide range of process conditions. The objective of this Phase I proposal is to modify this novel catalyst in order to enhance its reactivity and minimize its N20 selectivity. To meet this objective, developmental catalysts will be evaluated for nitrogen-product selectivity and performance stability over a range of process conditions.     Technologies capable of economically controlling the release of VNC's without the formation of NOx are currently unavailable.  Should the novel catalyst prove successful, economical pollution abatement systems may be designed around the catalyst to meet the needs of a wide variety of applications which include controlling plant fugitive emissions and fume abatement.  ***",
