 "awd_abstract_narration": "9701418  Partial evaluation is an automatic tool for program  specialization, customization, and optimization.  The goal  of this project is to establish partial evaluation  technology as the key component of a new methodology for  constructing and customizing adaptable software written in  modern imperative programming languages.  Despite successful  applications, current partial evaluation technology is  unable to satisfactorily treat modern imperative languages  that include object-oriented, multitasking, and exception-  handling features.  Moreover, partial-evaluator construction  does not begin to approach the maturity of compiler  construction where well-organized tools sets dramatically  ease the burden of designing, building, and modifying  systems.  The project focuses on the construction of a  language-independent tool set for building partial  evaluation systems that can handle features found in modern  imperative languages.  This tool set will be built on top of  the IRIS language processing facilities developed in the  Arcadia project. The core of the tool set will be a general-  purpose specialization environment for Ada 95.  The tool set  philosophy will be validated by reusing artifacts in  (a)  the construction of a special-purpose specializer for one or  more application domains, and  (b) the construction of a  second general-purpose specializer for a minimal core of a  second language supported by the IRIS tools.  ***",
