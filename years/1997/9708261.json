 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708261  Chen    This award will provide partial support for the  1997-98 Emphasis Year in   Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations and Their Applications at   Northwestern University. The goal of this special year is to develop some of   the new connections between nonlinear partial differential equations and   such diverse areas as fluid mechanics, phase transitions, free boundary   problems, materials science, and mean curvature flow. The focus of this   emphasis year will be an International Conference on Nonlinear Partial   Differential Equations and Applications in the Spring of 1998. During the   year, a series of visits of experts and junior researchers in the indicated   areas is planned.    Nonlinear partial differential equations arise in almost all areas of science   and engineering. In particular, they arise in materials science, biophysics,   environmental and global change processes, and industrial manufacturing   processes.  These equations are predominant in such areas as elasticity,   plasticity, semiconductors, biological transport of ions, phase transitions,   multi-phase processes, combustion, and etching and deposition  processes.   Understanding solutions of such nonlinear equations enables one to gain   new physical insights, to discover the intrinsic laws, and, in turn, to solve   some challenging problems in these areas.  The proposed project is intended   to bring together a diverse group of applied mathematicians and theoretical   analysts in partial differential equations and their applications who are able   to explore connections between their fields.  Individuals will be selected   who can share expertise with an eye toward applications in the indicated   areas in applied sciences and other mathematical areas represented by the   Northwestern faculty.  Researchers with such diverse expertise have often   unexplored common interests which, by means of fruitful exchanges, can   lead to novel results and discoveries.  Particular attention will be focused on   the p articipation of recent doctoral recipients and/or graduate students in   order to foster their interests in nonlinear partial differential equations and   applications in science and engineering.",
