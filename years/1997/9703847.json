Hamiltonian systems of infinite dimension:  The analysis of   the symplectic structure of the phase space of completely integrable   Hamiltonian systems of (in)finite dimension is very useful in the study of   Hamiltonian perturbations.   The investigator plans to apply prior work on action-angle variables for the  Korteweg-deVries equation (KdV) to contribute to the investigation of the  problem of the existence of analytic, quasiperiodic (in time) solutions  of Hamiltonian perturbations of KdV or of any of the equations in the   KdV hierarchy (KAM type theorem) and to study longtime stability of solutions   of perturbed KdV equations (Nekhoroshev-type estimates).     Further, the investigator plans to prove, in a generic situation, local    existence of (generalized) action-angle variables for a large class of   completely integrable Hamiltonian systems of infinite dimension.  2. Regularized determinants of elliptic operators:  They appear in modern   physics (functional integrals) as well as in geometry and topology (torsion,   eta-invariant). The investigator plans to continue his work on techniques for   analyzing regularized determinants and their applications to geometry and   topology: Torsions for bordism and relative torsion (in the usual and the   L2-setting); numerical computations of regularized determinants via a   deformation; manifolds of determinant class and representation of the   L2-torsion of a closed manifold M as a limit of a sequence of appropriately   normalized torsions associated to a sequence of finite covers of M.   3. Smoothing of dispersive waves:  Dispersive waves appear in many instances,   e.g. in the study of water waves.  The investigator plans to analyze   microlocal smoothing properties for a large class of linear and nonlinear   systems of dispersive evolution equations of Schroedinger type.      In many different applications, such as propagation of signals along   optical fibers (telecommunication), analysis of water waves  and currents, and  theoretical physics (celestial mechanics, quantum field theory), the basic   underlying ideal models turn out to be integrable systems of finite or   infinite dimension. To be useful for applications, perturbations of these   ideal models have to be studied. Whereas integrable systems of finite   dimension and their perturbations are relatively well understood, much  remains to be done in the infinite dimensional case.",
