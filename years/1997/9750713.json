 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is the improvement of networking programs by providing hands-on training in router installation and configuration, router operations support, network router security, and remote access communications, as well as web server deployment, operations, and management.  This approach is giving graduates the ability to manage Internet/Intranet and internetworking services within today's highly diverse business environments and giving the college the ability to respond to curriculum deficiencies and industry demands.  Specific project objectives include (1) providing students with the equipment to apply the Internet/Intranet and internetwork theory and concepts currently taught in the program; (2) exposing students to a variety of Internet/Intranet and internetwork service design options, resulting in increased critical-thinking and problem-solving skills; and (3) expanding the current networking curriculum by introducing four new courses and the accompanying laboratory experiments addressing Internet/Intranet and internetwork services.  The laboratory equipment is designed to build a wide variety of Internet/Intranet and internetworking scenarios that mimic real-world operation.  With the addition of new courses and the complementary laboratory exercises, students are being provided a responsive, well-rounded, hands-on educational experience in information technology.",
