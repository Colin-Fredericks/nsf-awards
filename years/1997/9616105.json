 "awd_abstract_narration": "9616105 McNeil  This research project aims to gain fundamental understanding of an unusual physical transformation in Ge. At very high Kr ion irradiation doses, Ge converts from an amorphous to a highly networked spongy structure. A similar transformation is not observed in Si, or most other materials. The approach is to investigate the transformation phenomena in a Si(1-x)Gex alloy series with x spanning the range of 1 to 0, and also to investigate and characterize the optical properties of the irradiated materials. The project is collaborative between UNC and Argonne National Laboratory, and the research is expected to provide new fundamental information and insights into radiation effects and optical properties of semiconductor materials. %%% The project is multidisciplinary combining materials physics and processing studies with advanced characterization tools and analysis methods to address forefront research issues in a topical area of technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of processing and fabricating electronic/photonic devices and integrated circuitry.  Additionally, the knowledge and understanding gained from this research project is expected to contribute in a general way to improving the performance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. ***",
