 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project  proposes  a multi-level process  of  summarization  featuring: (1) integration of knowledge about a document  derived  with  both  statistical and symbolic techniques; (2) the  use  of  language generation for reformulating this information into  both  indicative  and  informative summaries; (3) summarization  across  sets  of related articles; and (4) development of techniques  for  domain   independent   summarization.   The   proposed   research  comprises   both   document  analysis  and  summary   generation.  Document  analysis  involves segmenting a document  into  topics,  using statistical techniques to identify key content within  each  section,  and constructing a lexical semantic representation  for  use  by  the summary generator. Generation focuses on integration  of   relevant   information  from  several   data   sources,   on  presentation of contrasting information from the input  articles,  and  on the use of planning operators to combine information from  the  separate  representations into a single  concise  text.  The  research  includes  evaluation  techniques  for  measuring   both  coverage  and robustness of the analyzer and generator, including  conceptual and linguistic knowledge.  Through collaboration  with  Columbia's  Center  for  Research  on  Information  Access,   the  proposed    research    on   dynamically   generated,    coherent  summarization across domains will ultimately be part of a digital  library  interface that filters documents according to  a  user's  interests and needs.",
