This symposium is being held for the first time  outside  of US. This symposium is well recognized as the  premier conference for the leading-edge research in the field.  In the past it has been attended by a large number of US  students, as it has served in broadening the experience of  promising young researchers and enriching their careers. The  students will be selected through an open competition based on  their research performance, potential to enrich the symposium,  and diversity considerations.***",
