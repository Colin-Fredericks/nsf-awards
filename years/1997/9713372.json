 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research has the long term objective of establishing  the  structure-process-property relationships in both high  density  polyethylene (HDPE) and low  density  polyethylene  (LDPE)  blown  films. Crystallization kinetics and film  morphology as a function of both molecular architecture and  processing parameters will be investigated using physical  models and numerical simulation of the  process. The research  will include the development of suitable constitutive models  for the theology and crystallinity of the  polymer being blown.  Experiments based on commercial scale film  blowing apparatus  will be used to evaluate Constitutive  models and determine  appropriate boundary and initial conditions for the numerical  simulation of the film blowing process. A transient, non-  axisymmetric, and nonlinear finite element model of the process  will be developed. The computational model will also be used to  study collapse and instability in a non-axisymmetric setting.  The three principal investigators are uniquely qualified,  because of their background in theoretical and computational  mechanics,polymer structure and mechanical property  characterizations, and polymer processing and theology, to  successfully carry out the  research.                                      A stable film blowing process requires a delicate balance  between the excess pressure inside the bubble, the resin  extrusion rate, the film wind-up speed, and the cooling rate.  These parameters vary considerably from polymer to polymer due  to slight differences in  melt  strength and crystallinity. In  practice, the best combinations of process variables required  to produce good quality film is achieved through a series of  trial-and-error steps that results in large-scale wastage of  polymer resin and person hours. Computer simulations of film  blowing process offers an attractive alternative for at least  three reasons. First, computer simulations can help answer  basic questions about how  specific process variables influence  bubble stability. Second, simulations will help identify which  resin Properties are most important in determining performance  in film blowing processes. Third, if the constitutive  relationship between molecular orientation  and polymer  crystallinity is properly formulated, the connection between  the ultimate film properties and process conditions can be  identified.  Together-, these three factors should  significantly reduce the number of experiments needed to  optimize commercial film blowing processes for new polymer  resins.       The research investigates phenomena that are  interdisciplinary  in nature. Phase change, crystallization and surface flow  phenomena are of interest to various manufacturing processes  and scientific problems. The research will be carried with the  help of students, who will be trained to develop theoretical  formulations, finite element model, and interpretation and  correlation of the numerical results, and the students will  also be trained  to run  the film blowing equipment and collect  data to assist and  correlate numerical simulations. This  training of students to think and understand the fundamental,  as well practical aspects, is considered as important  contribution as the results of the  research.",
