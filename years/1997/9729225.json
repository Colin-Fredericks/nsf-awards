 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the social consequences of economic reforms in Russia.  The systemic transformations of state socialist economies have no peacetime parallel in their scope and impact on the populations involved.  The rapid transitions from state socialism pose critical theoretical issues for sociologists: How do labor markets respond to institutional change directed by state policy makers?  How does market transition in former state socialist societies alter patterns of socio-economic stratification?  What factors shape economic and political attitudes in the context of rapid institutional change?  To answer these questions this project will study Russia, state socialism's birthplace and paradigmatic incarnation.     To address the important theoretical issues, this research will collect the following data (and usual demographic indicators) combined in one survey: 1) employment histories since 1987, to trace job shift and labor force participation patterns since the onset of economic reforms; 2) social origins and background characteristics from the pre-reform era, including respondents' and parents' involvement in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to determine how one's standing in the previous social order shapes life chances in the new institutional context; 3) longitudinal data on current employment, household structure, and material standing, to illuminate what shapes individual-level success and failure as institutional change proceeds; and 4) longitudinal data on economic and political attitudes, to reveal the dynamic interplay of attitudes, employment, and income, and to assess the reliability of attitude measures in Russia.  The Survey of Employment, Income, and Attitudes in Russia (SEIAR) will provide the first wave of what will eventually be a panel study of employment, income and attitude dynamics.     SEIAR will be fielded in two stages, one in November 1997, one in January 1998.  A supplemental battery of 35 questions will be added to the bi-monthly \"Omnibus\" surveys con ducted by the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion and Market Research (VCIOM). Since the Omnibus surveys already contain some of the necessary information, 35 items will suffice to provide the full content described above.  The two data sets will be pooled (anticipated N=4800).  Moreover, to determine the feasibility of an eventual panel survey, respondents will be asked if they are willing to be re-interviewed and the appropriate records will be kept.     The unique timing and content of the survey will permit qualitative leaps in our knowledge regarding employment, stratification, and attitudes in Russia.  In particular, the data will facilitate studies of how the Russian labor market has evolved over the course of the reform period, what shapes material success and failure in the post-Soviet era, how status in the Soviet period influences post-Soviet material situation, and what determines Russians' economic views.  The data will be especially useful should a panel study eventuate from this initial round.  However, the initial round will yield important insights by itself, and it is necessary in order to determine whether a longitudinal study on these topics is viable.",
