 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704906  Jones    Dynamical systems offers a body of modern mathematical techniques with   the potential for application to a number of problems in current science and   technology.  The principal investigator plans to develop techniques that are   specifically geared to solving important problems in optical pulse   propagation and mixing attendant to mesoscale ocean structures. In optical    communications, lasers, and fiber couplers a key issue is the support of   multiple pulses. These pulses may be separated in time, by polarization,   frequency or live on distinct but coupled fibers. Based on needed extensions   of the current mathematical technology,  techniques will be developed that   promise a major contribution to these issues through stability calculations of   pulses found by homoclinic bifurcation theory and other related methods.   For mixing in ocean structures, perturbations of the quasigeostrophic   models will be used to assess the efficacy of the added mechanisms to   promoting Lagrangian transport. This has already been successful in   studying the effects of viscosity and, using this analysis as a starting point,   the plan is to incorporate other effects and ascertain their role in what is   now known to be a significant phenomenon in ocean  transport, namely the   advection of fluid particles due to the splitting of separatrices.    The importance of the work in this project lies both in the significance of   the applications and the promise of building a body of techniques that can   be used in other areas. The capacity of optical communication systems is   limited by the ability of the fiber to carry, simultaneously, multiple pieces of   information. Many scenarios have been proposed but most require the   resolution of difficult mathematical problems concerning the stability of   these pulses and assessment of their interactions. Envisioned in the work of   this project is  the development of techniques for addressing these difficult   questions. The second application  to be considered is quite different. To    understand the distribution of fluid properties, such as salinity and   temperature, in regions of the ocean governed by well-known currents, such   as the Gulf Stream, is central in understanding, for instance, the origin and   progress of weather patterns. The key to determining these distributions are   the transport mechanisms associated with well-defined structures within   these currents. The flows are, however, so complex that the elucidation of   these transport scenarios remains a formidable challenge. The work under   this project will be to implement analytic approaches aimed at isolating the   underlying physical mechanisms responsible for certain observed types of   transport and thus lead to more effective predictability of fluid   redistribution near such currents and other ocean structures.",
