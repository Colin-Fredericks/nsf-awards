 "awd_abstract_narration": "Swartz  9723736     The origin and elaboration of evolutionary novelty comprise  one of the most fundamental areas of evolutionary inquiry. In  this light, the structure of vertebrate wings, their derivation,  and their function during flight have attracted the attention of  biologists and engineers for many years. However, the accurate  estimation of the forces developed within the structural  components of the wing, and the full understanding of the  mechanical, aerodynamic, and energetic significance of the wing  form and wing movement patterns have been neglected. As a  consequence, knowledge of the evolutionary origins and history  of diversification of flight apparatus remains primitive     In this study, we will model the flight of a large bat to  analyze aerodynamics, mechanics, and energetics. A bat has been  selected as our study organism because bats are characterized by  an anatomical organization (rigid bony elements interconnected  by an elastic wing membrane) that is relatively simple to model  in a biologically realistic fashion. The PI will the use our  computer simulation to ask: 1) what are the magnitudes of the  joint forces and moments in the wing during flight? how large  are the skin and bone stresses developed within the wing?; 2)  how do small-scale variations in wing morphology and kinematics  affect the joint forces and moments and the skin and bone  stresses developed within the wing? 3) what features of wing  morphology and kinematics affect the maneuverability, structural  stability and aerodynamic performance of the wing, and the  mechanical power of flight?     These questions will be answered by accomplishing a series of  interrelated objectives. A mechanically and biologically  realistic computer model of a flying bat will be developed,  based on Pteropus poliocephalus, the gray-headed flying fox, a  species from which a great deal of functional and anatomical  information has already been obtained. Inputs into the model  will include anatomical information, dat a concerning the  mechanical properties of wing tissues, and three-dimensional  descriptions of the movement patterns of the wing. A detailed  computer model will be constructed, and then used to generate  information about the forces developed at the wing joints, the  stresses in the wing bones and skin, the mechanical power of  flight, the ability of the bones to withstand buckling, and the  stability and maneuverability of the wing. Sensitivity analyses  will be carried out to determine the relative influence of body  size, wing shape, flight speed, and biomechanical properties on  the model outputs. The results of this study will be able to  serve as the foundation for future studies concerning the  origin, diversity, and adaptation of flight among bats.",
