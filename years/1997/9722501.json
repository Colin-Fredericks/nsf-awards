The BELLE and BABAR experiments under  construction in Japan and the United States will explore CP  violating asymmetries in the decays of select B mesons and  will test theories of why those mesons and their  antiparticles have slight differences in behavior.  A new  computer language is being developed and applied to the  management and interpretation of data from high energy  physics experiments.  The goal of this project is to  implement a BELLE simulation using the new language.    Recording, reconstructing and extracting physics from  increasingly large data samples is a formidable challenge.  Particle physicists from the United States, Japan and around  the world are reinventing the computing environment of their  experiments.  This collaborative research project will  provide information on software and design strategies that  will benefit high energy physics experiments now under  development in both the United States and Japan.  The  project is supported under the Science Fellowship Program  between the National Science Foundation and the Japan  Foundation Center for Global Partnership.  ***",
