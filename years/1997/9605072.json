Agrawal.  The subject  of the research is Quantum and Nonlinear Optics of Strongly  Interacting Systems and Effects of Atomic Coherences.  Professor  Agrawal, the newly appointed Director of the PRL, is leading a  buildup of activities in quantum and nonlinear optics which  provides the opportunity for Indian scientists to initiate  research collaborations with U.S. scientists having similar  interests.  The topics of research are: Atomic Coherence-  Controlled Optical Physics; Quantum Theory of Phase Conjugation  and Phase Conjugate Lasers; Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics;  Methods for Reconstruction of States of the Field, Radiance  Functions--Generalized Tomography.    Scope:  The PIs are highly accomplished physicists who have made  many important contributions to the field.  Under their  direction, this initiative linking their institutions should lead  to new and interesting discoveries in all the proposed research  topics.  Students and post-docs at both institutions will be  involved in the opportunities afforded by this new initiative.    ***",
