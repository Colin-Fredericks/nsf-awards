 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729087  Bierly    Several research studies by governmental and private groups have addressed the changing research climate in the U.S. and also the changing education environment at all levels,   K-12 through post-graduate.  These documents all describe an academic environment in rapid transition with an emerging common theme, the need for a closer integration of research and education.  Opportunities exist for restructuring or redirecting these programs in Earth and Space Sciences.    The American Geophysical Union proposes to convene a meeting of the Heads and Chairs of Earth and Space Science Departments on \"Support for Education and Research in the Earth and Space Sciences\" on November 7-9, 1997 at the AGU building, 2000 Florida Ave., N.W., Washington, D. C.  This meeting will provide a forum for exchange of information and recommendations for the future of these sciences.  It will be the first such meeting of Heads and Chairs.  AGU anticipates convening these meetings on a biennial basis.    Heads and Chairs of academic programs offering undergraduate degrees in the Earth and space sciences will be invited to participate.  Earth and space science is broadly defined to include atmospheric sciences, geochemistry, geology, geophysics, earth sciences, hydrology, oceanography, aeronomy and space physics, and closely allied disciplines.    Goals include:  1) addressing the \"integration of research and undergraduate education\" in the context of the Earth and Space Sciences, especially as reflected in two recent reports of the Directorate of Geosciences, National Science Foundation;  2) responding to observations and recommendations regarding undergraduate education as detailed in the recent AGU May 1997 report on the NSF funded workshop at AGU, November, 1996; and 3) recommending priorities in undergraduate education to the AGU and other scientific and science education societies in the Earth and Space Sciences and to federal, state and local funding agencies.",
