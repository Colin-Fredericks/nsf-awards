 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maine  9723454    This proposal aims to understand the molecular basis of inductive cell-signalling during developmental and how the cell-signalling process elicits a specific cellular response.  In particular, the proposal investigates the mechanism responsible for promoting mitosis in the C.elegans germ line.  Currently, it is understood that the somatic distal tip cell (DTC) signals the distal germ line, promoting mitosis and/or preventing meiosis.  Three components of the signalling pathway are known:  LAG-2, a ligand produced by the DTC; GLP-1, a germline transmembrane receptor; LAG-1, a germline transcription factor.  This evolutionarily conserved signalling pathway plays a general role in development and growth control of metazoans.  Many questions remain to be answered about the nature of intercellular signalling mediated by GLP-1.  Additional pathway components need to be identified as do targets of pathway activity.  To address these questions, genes that interact genetically with glp-1 have been identified and studied.  Sog mutations suppress and ego mutations enhance the glp-1 mutant phenotype components (e.g., lag-1) and/or with each other (e.g., ego-1 and ego-6).  This proposal focuses on three genes that promote GLP-1 mediated signalling in the germ line, ego-1, ego-3, and ego-6.  Each gene has a pleiotropic mutant phenotype consistent with activity in more than one aspect of development.  These gene products also may function in GLP-1 mediated signalling in the embryo.  The proposed experiments will investigate the specific role of each gene in development.  Genetic studies will determine the requirement for each gene during development, whether aspects of the phenotype are interdependent, and when each gene product is active.  To obtain a broader understanding of ego gene activity in signal transduction, tests for genetic interactions with other known or suspected signalling pathway components will be performed.  Molecular studies will determine the nature of each ego gene produ ct and confirm the time and place of gene product activity during development.  Time permitting, possible physical interactions between the products of genetically interacting genes (e.g., ego-1 and ego-6) will be investigated.",
