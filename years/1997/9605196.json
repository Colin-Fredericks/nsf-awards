The specific objectives of IMBC'97 follow:            a.  Present the latest discoveries and applications of marine science with an    emphasis on biotechnology.   b.  Familiarize industrial and academic scientists and biotechnology policymakers with advances in all aspects of marine biotechnology.  c.  Bring together colleagues from all over the world so that the latest science can be critically evaluated.   d.   Facilitate the development of joint ventures and research partnerships by providing opportunities for making contacts through scientific discussions and informal social gatherings.   e.  Assemble a volume of extended abstracts so that the science presented at                                          this conference will be readily available.   f.  Provide material that will lead to creative new ideas and applications for products and profits.    This innovative conference has been designed to develop a multidisciplinary, highly interactive program.  The topics chosen for the conference reflect the great interest among scientists in exploring the nature of biological interactions between organisms living in the diverse and often extreme habitats of the marine world. Basic research on biological mechanisms and molecular interactions related to a life in aquatic systems continues to yield valuable information about fundamental biological principles. Such studies on the processes and products of marine organisms have led to new and sometimes unexpected applications in many fields - including medicine, production of marine food and chemicals, and sequestration of mineral resources. The emerging science of marine biotechnology is being applied to the management of marine biological resources and to the monitoring and cleaning up of the marine environment.",
