 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organizational Learning and Knowledge Management Practices for Improving Business Processes  Abstract  The focus of this research is to study factors that enhance organizational learning.  Specifically, the broad objectives are to investigate the following:  What are the key drivers of learning?  What are the mechanisms that organizations use to acquire, process, create, and disseminate knowledge?  How do organizations monitor and manage the learning process, and how do they measure the effectiveness of the learning process?  What impact does a well functioning learning and knowledge management process have on business process capabilities and business performance?  These research objectives are an outcome of extensive interactions and discussions over the past 12 months among the five partnering organizations and the research team.  The interdisciplinary research team consists of four faculty members from the School of Psychology and the School of Management from the Georgia Institute of Technology.  This research will focus on the study of organizational learning within the context of the integrated product development process.  Qualitative information about the different mechanisms that organizations use to learn and share knowledge, and the impact these mechanism have on business process capabilities and business performance will be gathered.  The methods use to gather information will include in-depth case studies at various sites of the partner organizations, panel discussion, and focus groups.  Analyses of this information will result in preliminary findings on the type of mechanism used, and their impact on performance.    These findings will be used to create a standardized, psychometrically sound research instrument to quantify the degree to which various learning mechanisms are used.  The instrument will measure such things as the existence of a specific learning mechanism at different levels of the organization, the perceived impact of the mechanism on learning at each level, and the perceived ease of use of the mechanism.  Statistical methodologies will be used to analyze the survey responses received from the partnering organizations and linked to performance.  The significance of this research is that it will provide new insights on how to effectively manage the learning and knowledge creation processes in organizations.",
