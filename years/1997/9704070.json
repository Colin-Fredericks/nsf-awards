 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704070  Weimer    This award provides partial support for the acquisition of a thermogravimetric/  differential analyzer to be used for fundamental materials synthesis reaction  kinetic studies of nitrides at high temperatures.  The basic kinetic studies  will be on the synthesis of nitrides, carbides, borides, and other bulk powders  as well as nitride films deposited on substrates.  The system will be capable of  measuring powder, granular and solid materials in alumina, graphite, and platinum  crucibles.  Synthesis studies will include carbothermal reduction, direct  nitridation, and gas phase reactions.  The combination of high temperature  synthesis studies to be carried out on large samples to allow for sufficient  sampling of the materials for analysis. This capability is important for advancing  our knowledge of nitrides, which have higher thermal capacities than silicon based  materials, and have optical-photonic importance for communications.  %%%  This equipment award will support the research program for the investigation of  the mechanism and kinetics for the synthesis of nitride, carbide, boride, and other  non-oxide materials using high temperature thermogravimetric/differential analyzer.  The instrument will provide a combination of high temperature with large loading  capacity which is unique compared with conventional equipment, and will allow  fundamental high temperature synthesis studies to be carried out on large samples,  allowing for sufficient sampling of the material for analysis.  The production of  nitride powders is currently limited.  There is considerable technological interest  in producing structures with nitrides, and some recent examples of success.  This  capability is important for advancing our knowledge of nitrides, which have higher  thermal capacities than silicon based materials, and have optical-photonic importance  for communications.  ***",
