 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clusters of workstations are increasingly being used as a  platform for parallel computing. Parallel applications  executing on workstation clusters must be fault-tolerant in  order to survive network and workstation failures, and must  have the ability to withdraw from a workstation on detecting  owner activity.  Malleable parallel applications also have  the ability to dynamically shrink or expand their degree of  parallelism. Preliminary research indicates that this  property leads to significant performance advantages in  cluster environments because of the transient nature of the  underlying resources. The proposed research involves the  design and implementation of an execution environment that  supports malleable parallel applications on clusters of  workstations. Domain-specific reconfiguration mechanisms  that enable changes in the degree of parallelism of a  program will be designed and implemented for three  important classes of parallel applications, specifically  loosely synchronous structured grid-oriented applications,  loosely synchronous unstructured grid-oriented applications,  and a class of asynchronous irregular applications from the  domain of operations research.  These mechanisms will be  integrated into specialized run-time libraries that support  these applications. Finally, algorithms and techniques for  minimizing the overhead of dynamic reconfiguration will be  developed.",
