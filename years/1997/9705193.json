 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graduate research assistants in industrial mathematics are placed  at Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI),  and at Penta Technologies.  These collaborations strengthen the Marquette's educational and  research missions in faculty research in industrial mathematics,  industrial partnerships, and research training, and deliver  business-critical industrial mathematics solutions to JCI and  Penta.    At JCI, a manufacturer of automotive seats and batteries and HVAC  controls, the student will investigate chaos theory models of the  enterprise and measures of enterprise agility with validation  using real data and will explore scoping/targeting systems  analysis.  We will develop simple mathematical models and  business gaming simulations of the problem and then use  traditional operations research tools such as econometric models  and computer simulations.  JCI's work on biological and  ecological paradigms of the enterprise are complemented and  enriched by the technical expertise and resources of Marquette  University.    At Penta, a business solutions provider for the engineering and  construction industry, the student will use mathematical modeling  and nonlinear global optimization techniques to develop a  software distribution system aimed at providing maximum  flexibility in the delivery of real-time updates.  Penta is  actively exploring on-line software distribution and product  update systems  to deliver software to clients in a timely  manner.  The review, design, development, and implementation  of the SDS will be coupled with a mathematical analysis of SDS  optimization for a heterogeneous environment of customer sites.   We will determine components causing the greatest constraints to  SDS on-time delivery.  The data will include load-balancing,  internet transport rates, real-time computational time, and  human-interaction delays.  This data will be used to develop an  optimization model that will be solved to address the most  critical bottlenecks in the system.    This GOALI project is jo intly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
