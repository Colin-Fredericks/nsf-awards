Lee, Intelligent Distributed Controls  Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer  Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, for collaboration  with Dr. Takashi Hiyama, Department of Electrical and  Computer Engineering, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.  Their research is concerned with the development of power  system intelligent coordinated control.  The purpose of  intelligent coordinated control is to improve power  generation reliability, economy, and safety through the  implementation of modern control technologies and artificial  intelligence.    The research will be conducted primarily in the Kumamoto  Electric Power Systems Laboratory at Kumamoto University.  During the visit, Dr. Lee also will be working with the  Kyushu Electric Power Company in experimenting with the power  system intelligent coordinated control concepts in its Power  System Analysis Simulator.  The U.S. and Japanese  collaborators have been engaged independently in parallel  research in this area and share a common interest in training  students and other researchers in the required skills to  develop, test, and implement advanced control techniques in  actual power plants and power systems.  The collaborators  expect the present collaboration to allow them to expand  their current research from the power plant to the power  system level and integrate their various capabilities for  mutual benefit.  This project is supported under the Science  Fellowship Program between the National Science Foundation  and the Japan Foundation Center for Global Partnership.  ***",
