 "awd_abstract_narration": "American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES)  has    mentored and offered support to students since 1979  through    its first student chapter.  As the proposal indicates, the    number of student chapters has grown to 147.  The proposal    indicates that AISES has empowered students with  leadership    skills, and information to better prepare students in  science    and engineering fields.  In addition, AISES has provided    scholarships to enable students to continue their  education    and attend AISES conferences by offering opportunities for    students to connect with each other and with faculty who  are    role models at conferences.  By offering information  through    the Internet students are easily able to connect with each    other and with the organization.  AISES also conducts    precollege activities such as science fairs and    pre-college math and science camps.  Through these  activities,    AISES has created an environment that nurtures and  encourages    pre-college and college students to pursue the sciences.    According to the proposal, there is a 65 percent college    retention rate for AISES members.  Materials such as the    unique Winds of Change and American Indian College Guide  have    empowered students' education, contacts, and career.  The    strengths of the nominee include:              Prepares students for careers in science both  intellectually         and culturally.       Provides scholarships and leadership training.       Participants give back to the community.       Pre-college program including science camps.            Growing network of professional scientists and  engineers         serve as role models for the American Indian youth.       Publication of \"Winds of Change\" is a major outreach  mechanism; another way to engage students and role models.            Internship program with the Department of  Transportation.       Web page idea is good.       Replications in Canada and New Zealand are underway.      In summary, AISES has dem onstrated that it is a unique    organization with connections to open doors in many  schools    and colleges.  For all that is stated in the nomination,    including its impressive graduation numbers in the  sciences,    it can be said that AISES has an outstanding record in    mentoring Native American youth in the sciences.",
