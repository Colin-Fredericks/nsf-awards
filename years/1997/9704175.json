 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704175  Martin    This award provides support for the acquisition of a Gatan  Imaging Filter (GIF) accessory for the JEOL 4000 EX High  Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HREM) located in the  University of Michigan Electron Microbeam Analysis Laboratory  (EMAL).  The GIF consists of a curved magnetic sector lens that  acts as a prism to disperse the transmitted electron beam as a  function of energy.  The dispersed beam can then be filtered to  create images or diffraction patterns from selected portions of  the electron energy loss spectra.  This instrument would  significantly enhance the microanalytical capabilities of the  electron optics instrumentation at EMAL.  Additional  functionality provided by the GIF which is not presently  available includes:  (1) high resolution elemental and electronic  state mapping of low atomic number elements, (2) improved  contrast of polymer and organic thin films on substrates, (3)  improved electron diffraction analysis by removal of  inelastically scattered radiation, and (4) improved contrast in  convergent beam electron diffraction patterns.  Research underway  in our laboratory which wi11 directly benefit from this  acquisition includes the construction and characterization of  grain boundary defects in optoelectronically active ordered  polymers; the synthesis, and processing and characterization of  thermally reactive benzocyclobutene functionalized polymers; the  processing and microstructure of genetically engineered  polypeptides for biocompatibility of micromachined silicon  sensors for neural prosthetics, and the microstructure of  polymers and polymer composites near surfaces.  The instrument  will also provide useful capabilities for other research projects  in Materials Science and Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and  Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences departments, as  detailed in the text of the proposal.  %%%  The GIF will provide an enhancement of the electron optics  facility at EMAL, directly influencing the re search opportunities  available for students, staff, and faculty who use these  instruments.  It will also be used in the curriculum as part of  the laboratory sessions for graduate and undergraduate courses in  Microstructure of Materials (MSE 460, MSE 560, and MSE 662).  The  GIF will also be used in summer short courses on Polymer  Microscopy offered through the University of Michigan Continuing  Engineering Education program.  ***",
