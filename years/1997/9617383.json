Aazhang, Behnaam  Rice University    CISE Research Instrumentation: Design and Evaluation of Architectures, Programming Environments, and Applications for Shared-Memory Systems    This research instrumentation grant facilitates acquiring a shared-memory multiprocessor to support the following research projects:  -Design and Evaluation of ILP-Based Shared-Memory Multiprocessors -Parallelizing Compilers for Shared-Memory Systems- Interactive and Adaptive Techniques for Tuning the Performance of Shared-Memory Parallel Programs -Parallel Algorithms for Communications Systems -Signal and Image Processing.  The following research is thus enabled:- Architectural techniques to exploit instruction-level-parallelism in  shared-memory multiprocessors:  Fast simulation methods are the key enabling technology for this research.  The proposed multiprocessor enables the development and use of high-performance parallel simulators. - Compilation techniques for High Performance Fortran (HPF): The proposed  multiprocessor is a cost-effective platform for HPF compiler development  and an important target for evaluating the compiler-generated parallel code. - Runtime techniques to identify and remedy performance bottlenecks in  shared-memory programs: The multiprocessor is the desired platform to  develop and evaluate the techniques. - Algorithms for wireless and network communication systems: Most such algorithms must meet stringent real-time constraints. The multiprocessor  enables the development of parallel algorithms to meet these constraints.- Algorithms for signal and image processing for applications including geophysics, radar, and medical imaging diagnostics:  The multiprocessor  is needed to test and develop parallel and resource-intensive sequential  algorithms on real data sets. Overall, the proposed system enables the above research in three critical ways: enables parallelization of applications that cannot be run sequentially, provides a testbed for compiler and tools research, and provides cost-effective resources for sequential but resource-intensive tasks.",
