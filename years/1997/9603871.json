 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9603871  Ota    MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways regulate growth and  development in vertebrates, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila  and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Mechanism regulating  MAPK pathways are the subject of intensive research, however the  inactivation of these pathways is poorly understood.  Protein  tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are negative regulators of these  pathways.  By genetic techniques this investigator has isolated 2  PTPs that inactivate a stress response MAPK pathway in the yeast  S. Cerevesiae.  This pathway, known as HOG for high osmolarity  glycerol, regulates the response to osmotic stress.  One of the  aims of this research is to establish the specificity of action  of these enzymes for Hog 1.   This is important because the  identity of protein phosphatases that inactivate MAPKs remains  unclear.  Another goal of these studies is to identify the  mechanisms by which specificity of the phosphatases for MAPKs is  achieved. Since multiple MAPK cascades operate in yeast and  mammalian cells, mechanisms to ensure signaling specificity must  exist.  The genes encoding these enzymes will be systematically  mutagenized and the effects of these mutants examined in vivo and  in vitro.  The regulation of these genes will also be studied.  These studies will provide a greater understanding of the roles  of PTPs in regulating MAPK signaling, and thereby the  regulation  of growth and development in yeast and mammals.      The research of this grant is to study the enzymes that  inactivate one of the major signaling pathways in eukaryotic  cells. This signaling path involves a series of protein kinases,  and these are inactivated by protein phosphatases, the subject of  this grant.  These studies will provide a better understanding of  the regulation of these signaling pathways which are important in  growth, development and many other cellular processes.        ***",
