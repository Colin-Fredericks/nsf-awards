 "awd_abstract_narration": "9610545    In the U. S. and world-wide, there are many existing dams  that need to be  inspected for potential deterioration of materials, to  verify compliance  with upgraded design requirements, or to respond to long  term loss in  performance or safety.  In response to the increasing demand  for  electricity, new dams will be needed around the world.    The foundations of large dams are key to the performance of  the overall  structure.  Changes in stress levels (e.g. from changes in  reservoir levels  or temperature) can be responsible for changes in  permeability due to joint  opening and closure.  Joint and rock mass permeability  affects the  magnitude and distribution of the uplift pressure at the  foundation, as  well as the efficiency of grout and drainage curtains.  The  uplift  pressure, in turn, determines the stability of the dam  against sliding.  Thus, development of a realistic uplift pressure  distribution is a  significant consideration in the design of new dams and/or  in the  evaluation of existing dams to satisfy higher seismic or  hydraulic design  requirements.    The research includes:  1) case studies of joint opening and  closure under  foundations of dams; 2) development of realistic uplift  pressure  distributions under flood conditions; 3) improvements in  monitoring plans  for dam foundations; 4) determinations of field-scale  hydromechanical  properties for the foundation rock mass and the dam/rock  interface; 5)  investigate the influence of factors such as dam geometry on  dam  performance and effectiveness of various remedial measures;  and 6) improve  understanding on the nature and basic characteristics of  flow through  jointed rock.  ***",
