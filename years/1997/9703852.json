 "awd_abstract_narration": "9703852  Bell    The investigator will continue his collaborative work with Salah Mohammed on   the study of degenerate stochastic differential equations and related problems in linear and   quasilinear second-order partial differential equations. The proposed research falls into   three parts. Part I deals with degenerate diffusions and their impact on linear partial   differential equations. In their recent work, the investigators have proved a very general   Hormander-type hypoellipticity theorem for second-order linear partial differential   operators. The hypotheses of this theorem allow Hormander's general Lie algebra   condition to fail at an optimal exponential rate on smooth hypersurfaces in Euclidean   space. Such operators have been termed superdegenerate. The investigators will establish   the existence of smooth solutions to the Dirichlet and Neumann problems associated with   superdegenerate operators. In Part II, the investigators will study the existence of smooth   densities for a wide class of degenerate stochastic hereditary equations. They will seek to   use their methods to establish hypoellipticity of the corresponding operators. In addition   to solving an infinite-dimensional hypoellipticity problem (apparently the first of its kind),   the estimates obtained here should lead to the  existence of a Lyapunov spectrum in   probability for singular hereditary systems. In Part III, they will use their methods to study   quasilinear second-order partial differential operators with superdegenerate principal parts.   These operators are closely related to superdiffusions. The objective of this part of the   research is to seek classical smooth positive solutions of the quasilinear Cauchy, Dirichlet,   and Neumann problems associated with such operators.   This research deals with two important problem areas that arise in physics and   engineering. The first area concerns an important class of mathematical models, called   partial differential equations, that are fundamental obje cts in modern day pure and applied   mathematics. These equations arose from the study of heat conduction, electrical   potential, and fluid flow. Partial differential equations have important connections with   several areas of mathematics, in particular probability theory and geometry. The second   area is devoted to a class of models that are used in physics, engineering and biology in   order to analyze dynamical systems whose evolution is influenced by random fluctuations   and past history. These models are very important in a variety of diverse areas ranging   from signal processing, stock market fluctuations, economic and labor models, aircraft   dynamics, materials with memory, and population dynamics. The investigators will use the   most current probabilistic techniques in order to develop a deeper understanding of these   models.",
