 "awd_abstract_narration": "***    Graber    9721630        In  this  study  we  propose to augment the  on-going  biological  and  physical  sampling phase of Cowen, Lwiza and Schultz (NSF  OCE:-9521104)  on  the  west coast of the oceanic island Barbados with surface  current  measurements using HF remote sensing technology. The measurements  would  provide maps of the evolution of the spatial and temporal variability in  the  regional circulation and the interactions of local flow with eddies  generated  at the retroflection of the North Brazil Current.  The  radar  would operate in HF mode which would provide a spatial resolution  of  1  km  and  would coincide with the shipboard biological/physical  sampling  scheme.  The  radar  currents would provide crucial information  on  the  dominant  flow components such as tides, wind-driven, mean and  residual  circulation in this region. The HF radar measurements would be  used  to  characterize  the  time  space  scales of  the  hydrographic  signatures  associated  with  eddies  generated by the retroflection  of  the  North  Brazil  Current.  The addition of the remotely sensed  currents  to  the  shipboard sampling will provide direct measurements of the surface flow.  Such  information  is  crucial  to  interpreting  the  distribution   of  late-stage  larvae  that occupy this upper layer of  the  water  column.  Decomposing the current into components would be used to examine how the  flow  is  influenced  by  such  forcing agents  as  the  wind.  This  is  particularly  valuable in the lee of the island where  the  wind  stress  will  vary  both  spatially and temporally. Combining  the  surface  and  subsurface current measurements with the biological sampling would allow  us  to  examine the linkages between reef fish larval distributions  and  island flow patterns.    Specifically  our  study  could  assess  the   impact   of  offshore  mesoscale events disturbing the local  now  regime  and  the  fate  of  larval  retention.  Such  knowledge   is  essential to  understand the translocation patterns of  coral  reef fish larvae in an island wake environment.  ***",
