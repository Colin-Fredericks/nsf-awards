 "awd_abstract_narration": "Controllability of a Fluid-Structure Interaction Arising in  Chemical Vapor Deposition    In this project, we spell out an infinite dimensional control  problem arising from the use of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)  in the manufacture of this films on the surface of a substrate;  this CVD is used in a host of technological applications,  including the construction of microelectric circuitry, compound  semiconductor devices and high-performance cutting and grinding  tools.  Mathematically, one has a version of the Navier-Stokes  equations coupled to a semilinear heat equation, with the control  (temperature) implemented on a wall of the boundary.  With a view  towards determining the physical feasibility of improving the  quality of the film growth by controlling the wall temperature,  we aim to study the controllability of the associated system of  coupled partial differential equations, controllability in a  sense to be made precise below.  The approach to be taken in  addressing our control theoretic question will be that adopted  for other coupled partial differential equations seen in the  analysis of \"smart material\" technology.  Both continuous and  approximation theory will be considered in this work.",
