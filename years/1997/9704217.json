 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704217  Hufnagel    Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) is one of the foremost  techniques for studying the structure of materials on a scale of  1-100 nm.  The ability to study materials on this scale is  important both in understanding the development of the  microstructure of metallic alloys, as well as for investigating  the structure and dynamics of polymer solutions.  The SAXS  instrument is critically important to several research projects  on metallic glasses, complex fluids, and polymer solutions at  Johns Hopkins.       Two of the primary research projects that will benefit from  the SAXS instrument concern bulk metallic glasses.  One of these  projects seeks to develop new bulk metallic glass materials and  processes through an improved understanding of the kinetics of  phase separation and crystallization.  The other project probes  structure-property relationships in nanocrystalline composite  materials, which consist of a dispersion of nanometer-scale  metallic crystals in an amorphous metallic matrix.  The SAXS  equipment will contribute to this research by providing a means  to study the nanometer-scale structure of metallic glasses, which  is a critical regime in both phase transformations and  micromechanical behavior.  %%%       Another class of materials to be examined with the SAXS  instrument are soft materials such as complex fluids and  polymers.  Complex fluids are solutions containing surfactants,  polymers, colloids or a combination of these components.  The  focus of this research is on the structure and dynamics of these  systems.  SAXS capabilities are crucial to this research program,  especially for highly concentrated systems where light scattering  is not applicable,  The SAXS equipment will provide a means for  investigating and ultimately understanding the coupling between  structure and dynamics.  Another area of active research is  supercritical fluid-polymer solutions, where a particular  interest is the conformation of polymers in such systems.  Supercrit ical solvents are capable of dissolving a whole host of  polymers such as fluoropolymers, random copolymers and block  copolymers.  The emphasis of this program will be on the  structure of the polymers or supramolecular assemblies in these  supercritical solvent systems.       The SAXS instrument will be a powerful tool for  investigating the structure of metallic alloys and polymer  solutions.  It will also provide a necessary adjunct to current  small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and anomalous small-angle x-  ray scattering (ASAXS) investigations, which, while crucial to  these programs, are limited in terms of instrument availability.  ***",
