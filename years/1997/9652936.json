 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will produce a greatly needed, major revision of the first sequence in Computer Science. Business and industry are not satisfied with the current graduates of Computer Science Programs. They need graduates who are 1) fully capable of working in teams, 2) understand problem solving and how the solution fits into the environment of the organization, and 3) possess a thorough understanding of object-oriented analysis, design and implementation. In order to prepare students to meet these requirements we propose to have them begin in the very first course to work together in teams, to look at realistic problems, and develop top-down problem solutions.     To implement this solution the current bottom-up orientation of the beginning sequence will be replaced by a top-down approach. Students will be introduced to problem solving with objects which are available to them. Only later will they learn to modify and still later to create their own objects. Currently students spend most of their initial course on the syntax and semantics of the language they are using to implement the solutions to algorithms they develop. Most of their time is consumed in developing a fluency in a particular language.  We propose a true top down, object-oriented, collaborative approach for students in the first course. We will develop a library of objects, detailed notes for students, and laboratory exercises to support this top down, active, collaborative learning.",
