 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and construct sets of large  outdoor mesocosms which will be used by resident and  visiting investigators to conduct manipulative experimental  research. The facility represents the next phase in the  development of field laboratory infrastructure designed to  expand the usefulness of the seawater, stimulate new  research directions and collaborations, and provide student  training and public opportunities at the Baruch Marine Field  Laboratory.  New administrative, faculty, and staff  appointments coupled with record levels of research and  educational use of the field station have resulted in plans  for the future growth and enhanced productivity of the  Baruch Institute. The mesocosm facility represents  a major new initiative designed to promote the testing of  hypotheses regarding salt marsh structure and function.  Comprehensive long-term datasets based on up to 25 years of  regular measurements in the North Inlet Estuary have  provided insights into the role of abiotic and biotic  factors in long-term change, but opportunities for  researchers to conduct large scale manipulative experiments  in the tidally dominated natural system are limited.  A  group of engineers and scientists will design a set of eight  replicate 3.5m by 13m units which can be planted, flooded,  and drained in such a way as to simulate conditions in the  adjacent tidal marsh.  Associated infrastructure and  controls will allow for future manipulations using  hydroperiod, salinity, and/or temperature as test factors. A  set of smaller mesosms will be established to provide  research opportunities for addressing questions which  require different spatial scales or time frames.  Together,  the array of units for ecological studies will advance the  research and educational goals of the facility, perhaps more  than any other improvement that can be made at this point.",
