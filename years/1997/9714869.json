By enabling faculty at an early career stage to make connections with the present generation of leaders and engage in productive dialogue and meaningful activity directed toward transforming the undergraduate natural science community, PKAL will help build a foundation for the future of education and science in this country.  As the PKAL F21 Network grows, it is imperative to develop and expand opportunities for connections and professional growth available to F21 members.  Through a rigorous application process, the PI will identify approximately fifteen F21 members each for a series of Summer Institutes during the next three years.  F21 participants will reflect the diversity in higher education in this country; they will also represent the various scientific disciplines.  Selected participants will spend five days with a small group of national leaders in education, public policy, and research who will serve as mentors to Institute participants.  The F21 Summer Institutes will offer a carefully-orchestrated and coordinated set of activities, providing:  opportunity for serious dialogue about the future of science and technology in a changing world and about the capacity of undergraduate SME&T programs-now and in the future-to serve the national purpose, time to reflect on personal and professional goals, templates for outlining an agenda for action in coming months and years that enables them to achieve their goals and support as they move toward implementing their agenda for action.  Assessment will be a key part of the PKAL F21 Summer Institute program.  The PI will seek to determine the increased leadership involvement at both the local and the national level in the continued effort to transform the learning environment for undergraduates in SME&T.",
