 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kammeyer will study finite extensions of multi-                  dimensional Bernoulli shifts. (Multidimensional here refers to                  the action of several commuting transformations on a probability                space, as opposed to the action of a single transformation. A                   finite extension of the base process is a skew product of it with               an action of a finite permutation group.) In particular, she will               seek to determine when such an extension is itself a Bernoulli                  process. Her conjecture is that this occurs if the extension is                 weakly mixing, and that otherwise the possibilities are finite in               number and explicitly identifiable. The one-dimensional case of                 all this is well-understood and has found applications to flows                 that arise naturally in differential geometry. Similar appli-                   cations are envisioned for multidimensional results.                                 The mathematical research to be undertaken by Professor                    Kammeyer falls under the heading of ergodic theory. The basic                   concern of this subject is what happens on the average, over the                long run, when a transformation of a space (say for concreteness                a geometric object) is iterated many times. Useful results in                   this area tell one that if fine structure of the underlying space               is ignored, and if the transformation mixes things up thoroughly,               then only a manageable number of distinct situations can occur.                 There is now considerable interest, as exemplified in Professor                 Kammeyer's project, in extending such results to the case of                    several transformations acting simultaneously and interchange-                  ably. This project is supported under the Research Opportunities                for Women initiative.",
