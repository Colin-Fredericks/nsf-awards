 "awd_abstract_narration": "Olfactory communication plays a major role in the social systems                of most mammals, yet the complex functional nature of mammalian                 pheromones is not well understood.  Pheromones are chemicals                    vented by an individual of a species which when encountered by                  another individual of the same species results in behavioral                    and/or physiological changes.  Although major economic advantages               have been realized through research on insect pheromonal systems,               further understanding of the communication mechanisms are                       necessary to provide the basis for practical applications in                    mammals.                                                                                                                                                        Indeed Dr. Muller-Schwarze will use wild species that are                       considered as pests in North America as his experimental animals                to examine the function of pheromone secretions in the complexity               of their natural environment.  Along with Dr. Webster, he will                  isolate and identify the major constituents of the  \"territorial\"               pheromone.  Changes in the chemical compositions of these                       pheromones will be tracked by season and for individuals of                     different sexes and ages.  Dr. Muller-Schwarze will analyze the                 behavior of these free-living mammals exposed to various mixtures               of components.  The goal is to elucidate how chemical signals                   modulate mammalian behavior and which chemicals are responsible                 for what response.  These studies will not only contribute to a                 general functional understanding of mammalian pheromonal systems                but the specific knowledge gained can be applied as a management                tool with mammalian species considered as pests.",
