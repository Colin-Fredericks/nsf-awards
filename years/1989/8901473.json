 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Malkus will conduct experimental and theoretical                 studies of bounded elliptical flow in order to isolate principal                mechanisms in the broad-band secondary instabilities of shearing                flow.  Earlier results establish that the instability is a                      parametric sub-harmonic resonance, whose exponential growth is                  limited by the transfer of angular momentum from the basic flow.                It is observed that a three percent ellipticity imposed upon a                  ten centimeter diameter fluid-filled cylinder can catalyze a                    thirty percent reduction in the fluid rotation rate.  This swift                inertial deceleration is countered by a slow viscous spin-up,                   resulting in intermittent behavior in the just post-critical                    regime.  Theoretical study will be directed towards a deductive                 understanding of the mechanism responsible for this highly                      efficient withdrawal of energy from the vortex flow.                                 Tidal forces also cause elliptical flow.  An additional                    aspect of this study will be the exploration of three-dimensional               instabilities in stratified atmospheric, oceanic, and earth-core                tidal processes.                                                                     Professor Malkus will also continue the theoretical search                 for the deductive foundation of observed statistical stability.                 The success of the efficiency function as a measure of                          statistical stability in the channel flow offers hope for the                   discovery of a more general integral form. //",
