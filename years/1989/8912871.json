 "awd_abstract_narration": "Middle class Blacks are often classified as status inconsistents                because their racial status is lower than their socioeconomic status.           It is asserted that individuals with social status imbalances resolve           their resulting psychological stress and tension through liberal                political behavior.  This research project is to provide support for            this assertion by examining the political attitudes of middle class             Blacks relative to those of middle class whites and lower class                 Blacks.  This project will contribute to this area of study by showing          that there are times when status inconsistents resolve the                      psychological stress and tension produced the adding cognition, other           times by altering cognition, and still other times by changing                  cognition.  The PI hopes to show that there are times when class or             ethnicity plays a major role in the formulation of middle class                 Black's political attitudes, but that does not mean that status                 inconsistency is not a factor in the formation of their public                  opinion.  This PI believes that this was just another way of reducing           the stress and tension of the status imbalance.                                                                                                                 The research design for this project will consist of survey and data            analysis.  A questionnaire will be designed to solicit individual               response to a number of social, political and economic questions.  The          subjects will be residents of new Castle Country, Delaware.",
