 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Purdy is investigating modifications to the area-time                 complexity model of computation, which will enable her to more                  accurately predict the performance of algorithms designed to be                 implemented in VLSI circuits.  Initial research is in the CMOS                  technology, and development of tools for experimental research.  Issues         being addressed are:  understanding the problems in deriving practical          circuit models from theoretical models; more accurate inputs and                outputs; formalization of \"rules of thumb\" for VLSI circuit design              which will be useful in developing more powerful silicon compilers; and         the development of a methodology for rapid initial design and                   simulation of large families of VLSI chips, based on different                  algorithms, in order to predict accurately trade-offs in efficiency and         yield of fabricated chips.                                                      The proposed research is in the intersection between theory and                 practice of automated design of VLSI chips.  The Principal                      Investigator's approach is novel.  She has successfully begun a change          in her research career from mathematics to IC design algorithms, and            brings to bear useful mathematical methods and techniques on the                problems.  She has the potential to advance her career by doing quality         research.",
