 "awd_abstract_narration": "An environmental engineering laboratory course is being developed               to introduce undergraduate civil engineering students to the                    laboratory procedures and analytical processes associated with                  environmental engineering.  The intent of the course is for                     students to examine the scientific principles behind current                    analytical methodologies and to subsequently have then perform                  each analysis.  Environmental problems within the region are often              associated with the pollution of the aquatic environment,                       particularly by metals, due to the considerable amount of maritime              and urban development activity.  Instrumental analysis of metals                will be an important component of this course and will focus on                 metal contamination of the aquatic environment.  In this regard,                samples from surrounding coastal marine and freshwater systems                  will be sampled by the students and subsequently analyzed.  Links               between anthropogenic activities and the contamination of aquatic               systems will be strengthen through these practical experiences.                 An enhanced appreciation of this linkage is relevant for civil                  engineering students since a large percentage enter maritime or                 urban development-related employment.",
