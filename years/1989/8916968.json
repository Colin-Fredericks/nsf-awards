 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern techniques of mathematical analysis will be applied                 to fundamental problems in differential equations, complex                      analysis, wavelet theory, and dynamical systems in this group                   research project.                                                                    Work on inverse scattering continues efforts to study higher               dimensional problems by means of a new approach derived from                    methods of several complex variables: the d-bar method.  Although               this approach has had considerable formal success in two space                  dimensions and some success in higher dimensions, very few                      problems have been analyzed rigorously.  In particular, work will               be done on problems with large potentials or with general                       singular scattering data.                                                            Recent analyses of the d-bar-Neumann problem associated to                 domains in a complex manifold have shown that the corresponding                 trace of the heat kernel (for the heat equation) has a small time               asymptotic, expansion whose coefficients are integrals of local                 geometric invariants, including the logarithmic terms.  Very                    little is known about these invariants beyond some general                      results about their form and degree of homogeneity.  Work will                  continue in efforts to elicit more concrete information.                             New proofs of the boundedness of the Cauchy integral and                   other singular integral using special bases has opened up areas                 of exploration both in operator theory and numerical analysis.                  Using basic Littlewood-Paley theory, one can translate the T(1)                 theorem of David and Journe into an effective numerical tool.                   This powerful result establishes the boundedness of a singular                  operator solely through its action on the constant functions.                   Work will be done in representing integral operators in wavelet                 bases as matrices which decay rapidly off the diagonal.  These                  techniques can be shown to produce considerable reduction in                    complexity in the discrete approximation to the operators.  A                   wide range of applicability of these ideas to signal and image                  processing is expected as a consequence of this research.                            Other work will focus on relationships between the Cauchy                  integral, analytic capacity and rectifiable sets.  Work directed                at characterizing rectifiable curves has led to new insights into               the traveling salesman problem.  Further applications will be                   considered relative to the problem of estimating the integral of                the derivative of a conformal mapping and on determining the                    relationship between analytic capacity and Favard length of                     compact planar sets.  Although they are not equivalent                          quantities, it is likely that they do agree on sets of finite                   one-dimensional Hausdorff measure.  Work will be done to resolve                this issue.  //",
