 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bombesin-like peptides play a pivotal role in both normal and                   pathological processes in the mammalian central nervous system                  (CNS).  This class of neuropeptides are potent hypothermic,                     hyperglycemic and satiety agents and they also alter pituitary                  hormone secretion as well as behavior.  Bombesin stimulates                     turnover of dopamine, an important neurotransmitter in                          schizophrenia, Huntington\"s and Parkinson\"s disease.  Although it               is clear that bombesin-like peptides are biologically active in                 the CNS, its precise physiological role remains unknown.                                                                                                        Dr. Moody hypothesizes that bombesin-like neuropeptides alter the               growth and/or development of brain cells.  During his previous                  National Science Foundation support, Dr. Moody reported the                     presence of high affinity receptors in discrete brain regions.                  He will now characterize and determine the regulatory role of                   bombesin-like peptides and their receptors in CNS.  He will                     evaluate the possibility that receptors for these neuropeptides                 regulate cell growth by examining effects on neural transplants,                development and human cultured cells.  In addition, Dr. Moody                   plans to solubilize and purify the bombesin-like neuropeptide                   receptors and then generate specific monoclonal antibodies.                     Interestingly, high levels of receptor have been localized to                   some types of cancer cells and bombesin-like peptides stimulate                 the growth of these malignant cells.  Thus, understanding the                   various effects and mechanisms of action of these neuropeptides                 could lead to important breakthroughs as well as the development                of new therapeutic approaches in the cancer field.",
