 "awd_abstract_narration": "All cells must maintain a relatively constant volume in order to                function properly.  The PI will use fish to study cell volume                   regulation since they are excellent subjects in which to study this             process.                                                                                                                                                        When marine fish move into brackish water from sea water they are               confronted with a dilution of their body fluids because of the more             dilute environment.  To avoid a resultant swelling of their cells they          unload ions and small organic molecules from their cells and thus               balance the osmolarity (concentration of salts) between the inside and          outside of their cells.  A non-essential amino acid, taurine, is a              prime component of this regulatory mechanism.  Following dilution of            the extracellular fluid taurine is released from the cells into the             blood and must then be eliminated from the body.  As it is not                  metabolised it must be excreted by the kidneys.  The PI has shown that          the marine fish secrete this compound across the kidney tubule cell by          a transport system that is dependent on sodium ion and partially                dependent on chloride ion.  The mammalian kidney appears to have a              similar transport system but it moves in the opposite direction;                taurine is reabsorbed by the kidney.  In this project the PI intends to         further characterize this transport system and study its regulatory             mechanisms.                                                                                                                                                     The information gained in these studies should increase understanding           of how cells regulate their volume when confronted by changes in the            concentration of the extracellular fluids.",
