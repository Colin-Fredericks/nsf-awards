 "awd_abstract_narration": "That the midlatitude atmosphere affects and, in turn, is                        affected by the tropics is well known, but the mechanisms by                    which this occurs are not well understood.  The objective of                    this research project is to expand our understanding of the                     atmospheric dynamics of the interactions between the tropics                    and midlatitudes.  The research involves three major topics.                    The first is a study of heating over the Tibetan Plateau.  Dr.                  Yanai and his colleagues intend to determine the seasonal                       heating patterns over the Plateau and the surrounding regions,                  the mechanisms responsible for that heating, and the effect of                  the heating on the Asian monsoon.  The second broad area                        involves studies of equatorial waves and the so-called 30-50                    day oscillation.  The group is focusing on the roles of cumulus                 convection and midlatitude disturbances in initiation and/or                    maintaining these two phenomena.  Finally, the group is                         investigating the statistical representation of cumulus cloud                   ensembles and how downdrafts and mesoscale convective                           organization affect the ensemble characteristics.                                                                                                               This work should significantly advance our understanding of the                 large-scale atmosphere.  The last topic also has important                      implications for the representation of physical processes in                    numerical models of the atmosphere.",
