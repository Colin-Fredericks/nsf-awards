 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project supports a cultural                          anthropological study of workers and farmers in the citrus                      industry in Belize.  The focus of the study is in how small firms               and individual workers deal with the more powerful economic                     actors in the citrus industry to defend their interests.  Methods               will include surveys, intensive interviews, and participant                     observation.  The research will shed light on the success or                    importance of development projects that attempt to democratize                  political and economic systems that have been organized in a                    repressively monopolistic manner.                                                                                                                               This research is important because Central America is a vitally                 important part of the hemisphere that is currently subject to                   severe unrest.  Understanding of the causes of success and                      failure in local-level economic development projects, and of the                causes of accommodation or unrest in local industries, can help                 guide policy in the future.",
