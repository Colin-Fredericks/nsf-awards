Several projects are proposed.  The instrument will be used to                  identify pheromones and other behaviorally active compounds from                bark beetles that inhabit pine trees.  Another project will study               the biosynthetic pathway of phenromones in fruit flies and also                 cuticular lipids that are important water proofing agents in mole               crickets.  Another study will  use the instrument to study                      allochemicals and their metabolites that are responsible for                    enzyme induction in insects.  Cardiac glycosides and                            pyrrolizidine alkaloids used as defensive compounds by                          butterflies will be identified with the instrument.  Finally, the               insect hormones involved in host parasite interactions will also                be determined.",
