 "awd_abstract_narration": "The contractor will carry out the 1990 Survey of Academic               Research Facilities, a sample survey of higher education                        institutions that collects data on the status and condition of                  science and engineering research facilities.  A \"Quick Response                 Survey\" was conducted in 1986 followed by a more detailed full-                 scale facilities survey in 1988.  Tasks involved in the 1990                    followup study include conduct of data collection activities,                   tabulation of data results, provision of technical support as                   required for the National Science Foundation's own analytical                   uses of the data, and production of a final analytical report                   summarizing the results of the study, for submission to Congress                in September 1990.  A second analytical report on the biomedical                sciences will be prepared for the National Institutes of Health,                co-sponsors of the study.                                                               The Authorization Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-159) directed              NSF to \"...design, establish, and maintain a data collection and                analysis capability in the Foundation for the purpose of                        identifying and assessing research facilities needs of                          universities.\"  This study, initiated in response to the above                  mandate, provides quantitative and qualitative information on the               amount, cost, and condition of existing research facilities as                  well as current and planned construction and repair/renovation                  activities, including the sources of funding for these capital                  projects.",
