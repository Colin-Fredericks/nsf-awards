 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant covers part of the operation of the Big Bear                    Solar Observatory, emphasizing high-resolution imaging in                       multiple wavelengths, measurement of longitudinal and transverse                magnetic fields, and image processing based on video and digital                images.  The program focuses on the evolution of magnetic fields,               both in the active and quiet sun.  Major programs over the next                 three years will be:                                                                                                                                                 1.   Round-the-clock observations of solar magnetic fields.                          Study of the evolution of small magnetic elements and                           the equilibrium of creation and destruction of field                            elements.                                                                  2.   Study of emerging flux regions and how sunspots                                 develop.                                                                   3.   Investigation of the detailed relationship between                              magnetic elements and photospheric and chromospheric                            phenomena.                                                                 4.   Observations of the Wilson effect and other properties                          of sunspots.                                                               5.   Measurement of transverse magnetic fields with the                              existing magnetograph and connection of these fields                            with flare occurrence.                                                     6.   High-time-resolution videotape recording of flares                              aimed at finding the sources of spike events.                              7.   Study of the diffusion of magnetic elements from the                            active regions of the new cycle and the reversal of the                         polar field.                                                               8.   A special study of the circumstances of impulsive                               flares will be made, with the object of determining if                          there are special circumstances in which those flares                           occur.                                                                     9.   Continuation of operation of the Tel Aviv                                       photoheliograph.                                                           10.  Studies of solar magnetic fields and the temperature                            minimum using the 12-micron lines.                                         11.  Continuation of our high-resolution long-term                                   observational programs on active regions including                              support of various rocket, balloon and other special                            intervals, maintaining a data base on solar activity                            for the solar community.                                                   12.  Development and increased utilization of digital data                           obtained with CCD's, leading to all-electronic data                             recording.                                                                                                                                            The overall aim is to understand flares and sunspots due to the                 rise and climax of the next activity cycle.",
