 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objectives of this program are to introduce modern                    instruments to improve undergraduate instruction and to interface               computers with scientific instrumentation for design and measurements.          Modern solid-state sources, frequency sweepers and amplifiers will be           used to replace the obsolete and unreliable vacuum tubes.  Equipment            with digital input/output will be used to interface with the micro-             computers and computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided                    manufacturing (CAM) techniques will be emphasized in circuit and                device design.  Circuit testing will be done by automatic measurement           methods which will be introduced for accurate and fast data                     acquisition.  The recent advances of microstrip integrated circuits             and solid-state devices will be emphasized.                                     To accomplish the goal of educating future engineers with fundamental           and modern knowledge, microwave integrated circuit workstation                  equipment is needed.  This equipment consists of 5 circuit design               stations, 1 circuit fabrication station, 2 circuit assembly stations,           1 antenna test station, and 5 circuit test stations.  The five circuit          test stations and the antenna test station will also be used to                 conduct experiments for other conventional waveguide and coaxial                components.  The experiments and projects are designed to prepare the           students by providing them with a modern working knowledge of the               equipment and design methods used in the microwave, antennas,                   electromagnetics, optics and high frequency solid-state device areas.",
