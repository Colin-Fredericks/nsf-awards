 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the origin of granitic rocks is an essential                 part of reconstructing earth history.  It is likely that several                processes (fractional crystallization, restite unmixing, and                    magma mixing) are important.  Isotopic and chemical data have                   suggested that mixing of mafic and felsic magmas is widespread,                 producing commingled rocks to more thoroughly hybridized rocks,                 depending on compositions, temperatures and relative proportions                of the interacting magmas.  Rheological modeling predicts that                  commingling should predominate, and small-scale composites dikes                support this prediction.  In larger plutons, however, hybridi-                  zation has apparently occurred under conditions that models                     suggest are prohibitive of mixing.  This dichotomy suggests that                mechanisms other than two fluid mixing may be operative in the                  large plutons.                                                                       Murray and Reid will perform a coordinated field, petro-                   graphic, geochemical and isotopic study of localities in                        Yosemite National Park to test the viability of two additional                  hybridization mechanisms, disintegration of chilled globules and                contamination of basalts with wallrock to more easily mixed                     intermediate compositions.  Sites include a suite of partially                  disaggregated pillows in the El Capitan and Tuolumne granites                   and a series of contaminated basalts in the North America Wall,                 El Capitan.                                                                          This project will enhance geologic education at both insti-                tutions by involving students in all aspects of the study:  field               and analytical work, participation in research seminars and                     professional meetings.",
