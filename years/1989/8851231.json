 "awd_abstract_narration": "The modern undergraduate course in process control must cover not               only theory, but also state-of-the-art control instrumentation.                 Great improvements have been made in recent years in                            microprocessor-based controllers which can be configured, tuned,                and operated from a personal computer.  In addition to                          conventional PID algorithms, the new instruments have many                      built-in features such as transport lag, logic functions, alarm                 blocks, linearization blocks, adaptive gain, and self-tuning.  In               order to upgrade the control laboratories three sets of equipment               are required.  Each set includes four Taylor MOD-30 instruments                 (two controllers, one math unit, one recorder), an IBM personal                 computer with Taylor software, and a communication link for                     operating the instruments from the computer.  With this equipment,              a wide variety of experiments will be developed which range from                basic single-loop control systems to complex systems involving all              of the instruments.  Advanced experiments to be developed for                   which these modern instruments are ideally suited include cascade               control, feedforward control, adaptive control, self-tuning, and                over-ride control.",
