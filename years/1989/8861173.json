 "awd_abstract_narration": "High temperature flue gases from industrial plants are a                        potential reservoir of useful energy.  However, these gases are                 very corrosive and cause severe degradation of heat exchange                    equipment used to recover the energy.  The proposed SBIR project                builds on previous work and utilizes a shallow bed recuperator as               the basic element of the heat exchanger.  The bed is to be                      metallic, made of materials such as carbon steel, austenitic                    steel, Monel 400, and Inconel 617.  The underside of the bed will               be coated with a ceramic material.  This ceramic layer will serve               as the thermal skin of the bed plate.                                                                                                                           The concept of a thermal skin is well established for heat                      exchanger tubesheets.  It is well known that the ligament                       temperature in a tubesheet is essentially constant throughout its               thickness except for a thin layer (i.e., a thin skin) on the                    shellside surface where nearly all of the temperature rise                      occurs.  This skin is quite thin and is a source of sharp                       incremental stress in the tubesheet, but it cannot produce bowing               of the tubesheet.                                                                                                                                               The bed plate will be water cooled, so that the bulk metal                      temperature will be maintained in the range of 550 degrees                      Fahrenheit.  This temperature is low enough to ensure sufficient                material strength and resistance to corrosion.",
