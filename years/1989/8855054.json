 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UW-River Falls Young Scholars Project has been designed by a                multidisciplinary team of academic (biologist, chemist, computer                scientist, physicist, physiological psychologist) and industrial                scientists and engineers (3M Company Visiting Technical Women's Group)          to provide high potential rural students, especially rural female               students with:  (l) a \"hands-on\" experience in science and                      engineering, and (2) the opportunity to explore careers in science and          engineering.                                                                                                                                                    Thirty high potential students will be recruited for a two week summer          residential program which will include a research methods course                designed to familiarize students with scientific methods and resources,         a range of interdisciplinary experiments and problem solving activities         which include both laboratory and field work experiences, career                exploration activities in academic and industrial (the 3M Company)              environments, and a participant directed seminar on ethics in science.                                                                                          Follow-up activities are designed to facilitate independent scientific          or engineering exploration by participants during the academic year,            followed by the opportunity to convene and share results of independent         participant investigations.  A double mentoring system in which student         intellectual growth is guided by the cooperative effort of two mentors,         an expert/mentor (UW-River Falls scientist) and a teacher/mentor                (middle school science teacher), will be established.",
