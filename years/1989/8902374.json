 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds for the support of a Gordon                           Conference on the Population Biology and Evolution of                           Microorganisms, to be held in Plymouth, New Hampshire, July 24-                 28, 1989.  The field of microbial population and evolution is a                 growing field of research.  It is an interdisciplinary field in                 which the power of the techniques of microbial genetics and                     molecular biology combined with increased emphasis on                           hypothesis testing in evolutionary biology has brought                          microorganisms into the mainstream of the fields of population                  genetics and evolutionary biology.  In fact, microorganisms                     with their large populations, short generation times and                        biochemically defined genetics provide the only practical                       systems for experimental testing of some kinds of evolutionary                  mechanisms.  Funds will be used to help cover expenses of                       speakers and discussants and to permit a modest number graduate                 students, post-doctoral fellows, and younger scientists whose                   resources are limited to attend the conference.",
