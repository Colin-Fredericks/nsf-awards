 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal is to use parallel computers to generate tests for VLSI                circuits whose complexity makes conventional test generation techniques         costly in terms of computation time.  A parallel implementation scheme          for representation and manipulation of vectors is being created to              provide a uniform basis for development of various vector test                  generation techniques.  Theoretical studies as well as implementation           are being used to evaluate alternatives.  Approaches ranging from tree-         embedding procedures to macro-based techniques to fault simulation              based methods are being investigated to provide a comparative basis for         the various approaches.  The implementation of the approach is                  efficient and is being done on conventional vector machines as well as          distributed memory multi-processors.                                            New approaches to VLSI testing need to be developed in order to                 thoroughly test complex, high transistor count IC's.  The research              investigates the use of parallel computers to efficiently generate test         vector sets.  The approach is unique in that several test generation            approaches, both traditional and novel, will be compared to assess the          effectiveness of using parallel computers in reducing IC test time.             The principal investigator is a promising and competent young professor         who should make a significant contributions to the field.",
