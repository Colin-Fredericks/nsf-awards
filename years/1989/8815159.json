 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support cooperative research in geophysics between              Dr. Robert Liebermann, State University of New York at Stony Brook              and Dr. Jean-Paul Poirier, Institut de Physique du Globe,                       University of Paris VI.  The objective of this research is a                    better understanding of the rheological behavior of the                         high-pressure phases of mantle minerals.  Specifically, the                     investigators propose to synthesize specimens of high pressure                  phases of olivine and pyroxene in the large-volume, uniaxial                    split-sphere apparatus at Stony Brook and to study their                        deformation using tranmission electron microscopy in Paris.                     Special attention will be devoted to phase assemblages which                    contain mixtures of spinel and garnet and to specimens synthesized              at P-T conditions which straddle the garnet-ilmenite phase                      boundary.  These new data will be utilized to interpret the                     dynamic processes occurring in the transition zone of the Earth's               mantle.  These investigations also have relevance for the dynamics              of the subduction processes and the occurrence of deep focus                    earthquakes beneath island arc regions.                                                                                                                         The U.S. and French laboratories are well qualified to pursue this              project.  Dr. Poirier and his colleagues have developed techniques              to produce co-existing phases at high pressures and temperatures                in diamond-anvil-cell apparatus and used transmission election                  microscopy to examine the microstructure of high pressure phases                produced synthetically in the laboratory or naturally by meteorite              impact.  The U.S. laboratory at Stony Brook is an international                 center for high pressure measurement.",
