 "awd_abstract_narration": "Magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetostriction are                     fundamental properties of magnetic materials and derive from the                fact that the exchange energy which is responsible for the                      existence of spontaneous magnetization is controlled by the                     overlap of electron clouds in the crystal.  Magnetocrystalline                  anisotropy derives from the fact that the energy of magnetization               is a function of the orientation with respect to the lattice.                   This leads to \"easy\" and \"hard\" directions for magnetization and                is a critical parameter controlling the width of domain walls.                  It is thus clearly important that we have accurate measurements                 of these parameters if we are to make much progress in our                      understanding of TRM mechanisms.  A major problem is that both                  constants are known to vary with temperature.  In particular, we                need values at temperatures near the Curie point as this is where               remanence in locked in.  The PI will make sure measurements.  He                will measure both constants for x-values up to 0.8 and                          temperatures up to the Curie point.  His goal is to measure the                 magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant for several x-values and                 at temperatures significantly above room temperature.  He will                  use a technique that has seen only limited use in rock magnetism,               ferromagnetic resonance.",
