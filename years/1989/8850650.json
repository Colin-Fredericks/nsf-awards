 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide an opportunity to broaden the dissemination of        a new experimental program for introducing more plant science into              biology teaching (vis-a-vis current heavy emphasis on animals) and              enhancing the hands-on character of plant science teaching.  It is based        on the use of a new variety of brassica, christened \"Wisconsin Fast             Plants\", developed by the Principal Investigator at the University of           Wisconsin.  They have many characteristics which make them well suited          to school laboratory experimentation, but particularly important is             their very short life cycle (35 days from planting to seed harvest).            Teaching methods and materials designed to allow full exploitation in           school settings of the characteristics of the Fast Plants have already          been developed under an National Science Foundation Materials                   Development grant.                                                                                                                                              Nine teams spanning the country will be trained in the use of these             methods and materials and extend them as necessary to serve primary and         secondary students.  Teams will be made up of elementary, middle and            high school teachers, science supervisors, university professors, both          of science education and science, and representatives of state                  departments of education. Each team, with the cooperation of an Advisory        Board which includes school, business and community representatives,            will develop a regional plan for further dissemination.  All teams will         participate in setting up a Fast Plants Cooperative to continue                 networking and outreach.",
