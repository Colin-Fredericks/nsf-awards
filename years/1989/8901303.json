The role of spaces of algebraic cycles in                   universal constructions in topology and homology-cohomology                     theory will be carefully studied.  Work will progress on                        establishing the existence of Kahler-Einstein metrics on open                   manifolds, on the structure of p-Kahler spaces in Moishezon                     geometry, and on the structure of Riemannian 4-manifolds with                   boundary.                                                                            The team of investigators will establish more of the ground                work necessary for the understanding by physicists of our four                  dimensional space-time.  The connections between the branch of                  mathematics broadly referred to as \"differential geometry,\" and                 cosmological physics dates back to Einstein; the mathematical                   theory which Einstein applied goes back even further to Gauss and               Riemann in the nineteenth century. The group being funded here                  maintains close connections with physicists, and steers their                   research in directions of current excitement both to                            mathematicians and physicists.",
