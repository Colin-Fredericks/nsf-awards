 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will implement the second year of a four-year                 program to develop a modern physics laboratory facility at                      Moorpark College.  The laboratory facilities will be used                       principally by physics, engineering, chemistry, electro-optic,                  mathematics and biology majors enrolled in physics laboratory                   courses at Moorpark College.  The equipment will be integrated                  into the existing calculus-based and trigonometry-based physics                 curriculums.  The College will buy six stations of x-ray                        diffraction equipment and six stations of electron diffraction                  apparatus.  Typically two students will utilize each station at                 a given time.  By running the x-ray and electron diffraction                    stations simultaneously, 24 students can be comfortably                         accommodated in the laboratory facility at a given time.                        Laboratory instructional materials are also provided with the                   equipment.  A wide variety of student experiments have been                     developed in areas such as E-M theory, radiography,                             crystallography and radiation measurement.  This wide range of                  published experiments will allow laboratory instructors to                      tailor the instructional sessions to the specific educational                   needs of the students.                                                                                                                                              The college will match the award with an equal amount of                    funds.",
