 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exploring Career Options in Engineering and Science (ECOES) is a program        designed to stimulate interest in, and introduce young women to major           aspects of engineering, science, computer science and technical                 management.  The program will involve one four-week session to be               conducted on the campus of Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New        Jersey.  A total of forty high ability students, located in the middle          Atlantic states will be selected to attend.  Participants will have             demonstrated ability and interest in mathematics and science and will           have completed their junior year of high school.                                                                                                                ECOES will have hands-on laboratory experiences, on-site field visits to        nearby corporations, and seminars on research methodology, women in             society, and ethics and the new technologies.  Participants will gain a         broad perspective of the technical professions by interacting with              students, faculty members and women who are practicing engineers and            scientists.",
