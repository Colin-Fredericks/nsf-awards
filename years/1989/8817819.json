 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) as                an energy source in streams in well documented and considerable                 data exist on FPOM transport and benthic storage.  An important                 aspect necessary to complete understanding of the dynamics of                   this material is information on FPOM transport distance, rates of               FPOM deposition and resuspension, retention time on the stream                  bed, and capture by aquatic insects.  This project will use a                   recently developed method to label FPOM particles with 14C.  The                labeled particles will be used to study the dynamics of FPOM                    transport under natural stream conditions.  The processes which                 will be studied include movement of FPOM, rates of loss from the                water column (sedimentation, deposition), and lengths of times                  the articles remain in place (retention and resuspension).  The                 pattern and magnitude of accumulation of transported 14C-labelled               FPOM by aquatic insects will also be evaluated and provide data                 that would permit testing of several critical assumptions                       inherent in current methods of constructing carbon budgets and                  applying the Nutrient Spiraling Concept to lotic ecosystems.                         The investigators are well qualified to perform this type of               research and the facilities at Idaho State University are more                  than adequate.",
