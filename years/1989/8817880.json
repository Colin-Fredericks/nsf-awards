 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algal consuming crustaceans living in freshwater lakes and                 ponds have a variety of adaptations to avoid being consumed by                  fish and other predators.  One of these adaptations is to be                    active during Winter when fish feed very little, and to produce                 dormant stages in Spring and Summer when fish feeding activity is               high.  Dormant eggs of the copepod, Diaptomus sanguineus, are                   deposited on lake sediments where plankton-feeding fish cannot                  find them.  The eggs hatch in Autumn after fish have again become               quiescent.  A recent study showed that after fish were removed                  from a small lake, the timing of the production of dormant eggs                 shifted to later in the spring than had been the case when fish                 were present.  To test if this shift represents a genetic                       response to fish removal, the small lake was divided into                       quarters with a solid vinyl barrier.  Fish were introduced to 2                 of the quarters and were excluded from the other 2.  This                       research will continue the necessary monitoring of the timing of                production of dormant eggs in all quarters to see if it differs                 in the presence and absence of fish.  Laboratory experiments will               be carried out to test if any differences observed are                          genetically based.",
