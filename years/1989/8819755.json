 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to elucidate the molecular                           mechanism of muscle contraction by following the rotational                     motion of specific probes attached to myosin cross-bridges                      in muscle fibers.  Muscle fibers will be perturbed chemically                   or mechanically and the effect of these perturbations on the                    orientation of the cross-bridges will be followed in the                        steady state and time-resolved modes.  The resulting data                       will be correlated with the rotating cross-bridge model of                      muscle contraction.                                                                                                                                             An appealing model of the molecular mechanism of muscle                         contraction proposes that active protein elements of the                        mechanism move in a cyclical manner in synchrony with the                       hydrolysis of ATP to produce muscle shortening against a                        load.  It is known that the head region of myosin (the                          cross-bridge) contains the hydrolysis site for ATP and acts                     as a transducer converting chemical energy to mechanical                        energy.  Actin is also of interest in this class of models                      since the actin filament has specific binding sites for                         myosin.  A popular model of model contraction, the rotating                     cross-bridge model, serves as a focal point of the                              experimental investigation of muscle contrating mechanisms by                   Dr. Burghardt.",
