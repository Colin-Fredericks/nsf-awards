 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smooth muscle cell is the contractile component of many body organs such        as blood vessels, lung airways, intestines, and uterus.  Therefore              normal functions of smooth muscle cells are intimately related to the           normal function of body systems such as regulation of blood pressure,           lung ventilation, digestion and reproduction.  Smooth muscle cells are          similar to muscles involved in locomotion (skeletal muscle) in using            ionized calcium (Ca2+) as the regulator of contraction.  However, unlike        skeletal muscle, smooth muscle does not contain the Ca2+-binding protein        called troponin involved in the regulation of contraction in skeletal           muscle.  Therefore, the mechanism(s) by which Ca2+ regulates smooth             muscle contraction is still not fully understood.  The broad objective          of the proposed research is to understand the Ca2+-dependent regulation         of smooth muscle contraction by combining methods of muscle mechanics,          protein biochemistry, and mathematical modeling.                                                                                                                Based on biochemical studies, it is understood that smooth muscle               contraction is a result of cyclic interactions between two proteins -           actin and myosin.  In a smooth muscle cell, actin molecules combine to          form a filament-like structure (thin filament).  Myosin molecules also          combine to form a filament-like structure (thick filament), but in              addition, the thick filament contains projections from individual myosin        molecules called crossbridges which can interact cyclically with the            thin filament.  Force production or muscle shortening are results of the        sliding of the two filaments passing each other due to cyclic                   interactions of the myosin crossbridges with the actin filament.  The           regulation of the acto-myosin interaction in smooth muscle is not fully         understood, but phosphorylation of a protein subunit on the myosin              crossbridge appears to be involved.  Some of the model assumptions and          predictions have been verified experimentally, but several aspects of           the model remain untested.  The specific aims are: (1) to test the              remaining model assumptions experimentally at tissue and cellular               levels, (2) to test the model predictions under controlled experimental         conditions, and (3) to determine the utility of this model in generating        testable predictions on other aspects of smooth muscle contraction.  The        dual emphases on careful experimentation combined with in-depth                 integration of information assisted by mathematical modeling should             provide useful insights into the understanding of contractile function          of smooth muscle cells.",
