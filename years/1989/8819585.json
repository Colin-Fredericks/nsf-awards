 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research included in this proposal will investigate the low-                temperature theoretical behavior of several systems that display                macroscopic quantum properties.  Laughlin has recently suggested                that particles obeying half fractional statistics would exhibit                 superconductivity.  They will continue their study of this model                for high-Tc superconductors, focusing on the excitation spectrum                and the effect of a repulsive short-range potential, the                        screening of the long-range gauge forces, and the response to an                external magnetic field, both at zero temperature and at finite                 temperature.  The behavior of precessing dissipative domain walls               in superfluid 3He-A will be investigated with the hydrodynamic                  model of orbital dynamics, with particular attention to the                     stability of these dynamic textures, the response to external                   magnetic fields, and the effect of dipole unlocking.  The quasi-                classical formalism will be used to extend their previous studies               of superfluid 3He in severly confined geometries beyond the                     Ginzburg-Landau regime.  They initially plan to analyze planar                  boundaries, but they eventually seek to treat flow through a                    constriction as a model for a weak link.",
