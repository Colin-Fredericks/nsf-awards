 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Prekopa-Borell theorems are recent mathematical discoveries                 in aggregation theory.  This project uses these theorems to                     extend and unify diverse branches of economics.  The project                    applies aggregation theory to social choice, imperfect                          competition, the distribution of income in a multi-sector labor                 market, the self-selection of individuals into local                            jurisdictions providing different levels of local public goods                  (the Tiebout hypothesis), the first-order approach to Principal-                Agent problems, and verification of the Law of Demand.                                                                                                          The research on social choice is especially exciting.  The                      project formulates a mathematical definition of social consensus                and demonstrates using the Prekopa-Borell theorems that the                     outcome most-preferred by the mean voter cannot be defeated if a                sufficiently large super-majority (64%) is required.  This is in                the spirit of the famous median-voter theorem that the most-                    preferred outcome of the median voter always beats any                          alternative.  The median-voter theorem breaks down in an election               with more than one issue at stake.  The results obtained under                  this project hold for multi-issue elections.  This is a very                    important result because it makes it possible to develop a                      positive theory of social choice based on investigations of mean-               voters.  It is much easier to study a representative voter than                 investigate the behavior of all voters.  This work is extended to               environments in which individuals select into groups that then                  vote on some set of issues, e.g., corporate shareholders,                       residents of local governments, etc..  The project determines                   whether the self-selection in such environments reduces the size                of the super-majority required for the existence of an unbeatable               proposal.",
