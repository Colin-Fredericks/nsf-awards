 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a study of the rates of deposition, seabed                      regeneration, and sediment accumulation of biogenic silica and organic          carbon in the Ross Sea, and is part of a coordinated study of the               biogenic silica and organic carbon cycling in the water column and the          sediments of the Ross Sea.  The antarctic deep sea and continental              shelf environment is the major repository for silica accumulation in            the global ocean, and dominates the global silica budget.  The Ross             Sea is a particularly anomalous area in which large amounts of                  biogenic silica are accumulating in modern sediments, while the                 surface production rates are generally below the global average.                Moreover the usual similarity between the oceanic silicon and carbon            cycle does not appear to hold around Antarctica, and the two cycles             are decoupled in that the rate of particulatew carbon deposition in             the modern sediment is very low.  The overall project is an integrated          study of production, vertical transport, dissolution, and deposition            processes, using moored instrumentation and direct observations in a            series of transects in the Ross Sea by R/V POLAR DUKE.                                                                                                          The approach to be used to quantify the rates of bottom processes will          be to collect box cores, piston cores, and kasten cores along specific          transects in the Ross Sea that included both silica-rich and silica-            poor sediments.  Seabed dissolution of silica and degradation of                organic carbon will be evaluated by measuring pore-water profiles               of dissolved silica, carbon dioxide, amonia and nitrogen species,               sulfates, and phosphates.  Accumulation rates will be determined from           radiochemical chronologies.  These sea-floor studies will provide the           closure for the surface production studies and the water column flux            studies that will be carried out by other investigators cooperating in          this project.",
