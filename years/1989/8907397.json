 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of this project in the Inorganic,                       Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program is to achieve                 greater understanding of how transition metal compounds can                     effect the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Such                  reactions are among the most important in chemistry and are                     involved in industrial processes such as reforming gasoline to                  upgrade the octane number.                                                                                                                                      The overall strategy of the project is to isolate and model the                 individual steps of organic transformations involving C-C bond                  forming or cleavage as effected both stoichiometrically and                     catalytically by transition metal reagents. Emphasis will be                    placed on compounds with cyclopropenyl, cyclopropene and                        vinylcylclopropene ligands. Reactions of perfluorocyclopropene                  with transition metal centers will serve as a model for the C-C                 bond cleavage reaction, with oxidative addition of the C-C bond                 providing a route to metallacyclobutene complexes. The                          mechanism of transformation of 3-vinyl-1-cyclopropenes into                     1,3-cyclopentadienes, or into eta-5-cyclopentadienyl(hydrido)                   metal complexes, are of particular interest since sequential                    C-C bond cleavage and C-C bond formation steps are involved.                    For some Rh- and Ir-promoted reactions intermediates can be                     isolated, and the structures of these intermediates demonstrate                 that the mechanism for opening the cyclopropene ring is more                    complicated than for simpler cyclopropenes, and cannot involve                  a \"simple\" oxidative insertion of the metal into the C-C bond.                  Reactions of selectively isotopically labelled precursors will                  be used to map the course of the novel skeletal rearrangements,                 corresponding to previously unknown organometallic                              transformations, which occur during the ring opening reactions.                 Isotopically labeled precursors will be used also to further                    elucidate the mechanism of the C-C bond forming reaction                        whereby 1,2,3,5-eta-pentadienediyl and 1,5-eta-pentadienediyl-                  (1-metallacyclohexa-2,4-diene) complexes of Rh(III) and Ir(III)                 undergo conversion to eta-5-cyclopentadienyl(hydrido) metal                     compounds.",
