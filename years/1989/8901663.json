 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project allows a student to conduct dissertation research                  in Italy on an alternative psychiatric treatment program. The                   student will study the program called \"Democratic Psychiatry\", a                system whereby patients are deinstitutionalized and the treatment               focuses on reorienting the patients' understanding of society and               their illness.  The hypotheses to be tested focus upon the degree               of similarity between the patient's model of his or her illness                 and the prevailing institutional model of the illness: the more                 congruent the understanding of patients and practitioners about                 the problem, the more likely the patient will be improved.                      Methods to be used include intensive interviewing of personnel                  and participant observation in a Mental Health clinic, and                      interviews with a stratified random sample of 25 patients                       including life histories, and discourse analysis.  A standard                   psychometric instrument will be used to evaluate treatment                      outcomes.                                                                                                                                                       This project is important because it studies the process whereby                patients and practitioners negotiate, redefine, and reinterpret                 the reality of the illness and its betterment (as opposed to the                view that the illness is caused by external factors and cured by                technicians acting upon a passive patient). As such it                          contributes to current theories of the culturally determined,                   interactional nature of illness, in specific, and of human                      behavior in general.",
