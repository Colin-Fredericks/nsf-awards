 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central theme of this mathematical research project is                 the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations.                       Particular emphasis will be placed on extending methods which                   describe invariant manifolds and attracting sets of perturbations               of integrable nonlinear equations to the case of higher                         dimensional semilinear differential equations.  Work will also be               done in developing methods for determining global coordinates                   that best describe the finite dimensional attracting sets.                      Application of these investigations to problems of physical                     importance include studies of the damped and driven sine-Gordon                 equation describing the Josephson junction and the analysis of a                system of Euler-Raleigh-Plesset equations describing a cloud of                 gas bubbles in liquid.                                                               Additional work includes studies of perturbations that                     change the spatial structure of the perturbed equations; in                     particular the question of existence of breather solutions to                   these equations will be taken up. The bearing these answers have                on the symplectic geometry of the phase space containing the                    solutions will also be considered.                                                   Long term objectives of this research include the                          application of bifurcation techniques developed in the study of                 perturbed integrable differential equations to improved                         understanding of general fluid equations.***",
