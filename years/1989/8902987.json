 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Rice, a physical chemist, is undertaking a two year                   half-time study and research program in the history and                         philosophy of chemistry under Professor Noretta Koertge of                      Indiana University.  He is undertaking a comparison of theories                 and mechanistic explanations for osmosis, both ordinary and                     anomalous, proposed by chemists, biologists, and physicists.                    Osmosis is a topic on which he has carried out scientific                       research and study.  It represents a case study of considerable                 potential value to historians and philosophers of science.  Under               this grant, he will participate in graduate surveys and seminars                in the history and philosophy of science and an organized reading               program of basic and essential works in this area.  While                       undertaking regular consultation with the faculty in history and                philosophy of science at Indiana University, Professor Rice will                be examining the history of osmosis with its competing theories.                This history is fairly straightforward up to the time of van't                  Hoff who carried out a thermodynamic analysis of osmotic pressure               on the basis of the analogy between dilute solutions and gases.                 At this point, however, chemists lost interest in mechanistic                   descriptions of osmosis, although physiologists have maintained                 their interest and a lively discussion of rival interpretations.                Some of these physiologists advocate the tensile solvent theory,                which appears to eliminate the need for the concept of activity                 in thermodynamics.  An interest in so-called anomalous osmosis,                 which includes electrostatic interactions between charged                       membranes and the ions in solution, developed in the early 1900s                and still occupies the time of both chemists and biologists.                    Professor Rice's goal is to investigate approaches, questions,                  beliefs and acceptable answers, models and theories of scientists               from different disciplines or paradigms studying the same                       phenomena by comparing (1) the historical development of the                    pertinent thematic content of different paradigms,(2) the                       semantic or linguistic differences in the languages developed by                different paradigms to discuss the same phenomena, and (3) the                  epistemological differences in acceptable answers to similar                    questions.",
