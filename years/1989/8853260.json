 "awd_abstract_narration": "The undergraduate laboratory capabilities will be expanded to                   include the area of coherent optical measurement.  The equipment                will be used for experiments in required undergraduate laboratory               courses, serve as the laboratory basis for a course on coherent                 optical measurement, and be used for undergraduate research                     projects.  This program is being undertaken because of the                      increasing use of lasers and coherent optics in engineering                     applications and the need for mechanical engineers who                          understand these techniques.  The mechanics laboratory and the                  thermal sciences laboratory are involved.  Mechanics laboratory                 experiments to be developed are interferometric measurements of                 simple beam deflection and the measurement and visualization of                 the vibrational modes of a clamped plate.  In  the thermal                      sciences laboratory, the equipment will be used for visualization               and temperature measurement of heat convecting flows.  The                      comprehensive undergraduate course in coherent optical methods                  will include laser doppler velocimetry, holographic                             interferometry, and speckle photography.  Finally, the equipment                will be used for senior level student research projects in                      fluid mechanics, dynamics, and design.  Some specific projects                  will include visualization of separated flows, studies of crack                 propagation, and surface contouring and profilometry.",
