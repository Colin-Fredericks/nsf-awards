 "awd_abstract_narration": "Food intake is reduced in hot ambient temperature in a variety of               mammals, including man.  Thus it appears that thermosensitive                   mechanisms control food intake in situations when a thermogenic                 activity, food intake, is counter-productive to the maintenance                 of normal body temperature.  The neural substrates involved in                  the thermal control of food intake are poorly understood.                       Preliminary findings indicate that the neurotoxin, capsaicin,                   damages neural fibers involved in heat-induced reduction of food                intake without altering the ability to maintain normothermia at                 elevated temperature in rats.  This suggests that capsaicin acts                to selectively lesion thermosensitive systems controlling food                  intake.  Examination of functional deficits in thermoregulation                 and food intake reduction at elevated temperatures in rats                      treated systemically, and at localized central and peripheral                   sites with capsaicin should reveal the lesion sites responsible                 for the functional deficits.  The specificity of capsaicin-                     induced damage to thermal controls of food intake at central or                 peripheral sites will be further examined using                                 immunohistochemical and silverstain degeneration techniques.                    Finally, peptides will be applied at sites that demonstrate                     impairment of heat-induced reduction of food intake.  This will                 provide a measure of the role of specific peptides in the thermal               control of food intake.",
