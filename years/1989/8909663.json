 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental advantage of distributed systems over centralized systems         is fault-tolerance:  correctly functioning processors can successfully          complete a computation in the face of failures by other processors.             The design and efficiency of fault-tolerant applications increases with         the severity of the failures that may occur.                                                                                                                    Most practical fault-tolerant systems tolerate only very simple                 failures (such as stopping); there has been no formal characterization          of the effects of different types of faulty behavior.  The proposed             research is a formal study of different types of faulty behaviors,              comparing them in several ways.  The expected results will greatly              expand the utility of existing systems, allowing them to be modified to         tolerate more severe failures.                                                                                                                                  This proposal outlines two primary methods by which this research is to         advance.  The first is the study of translations that automatically             convert applications designed to run in systems with benign failures            into ones that run in systems with more severe failures.                                                                                                        The second method used here is the study of processor knowledge.                Techniques from this area promise to lead to more thorough analysis of          the effects of failures on the computation and communication necessary          to solve certain problems in systems with failures.",
