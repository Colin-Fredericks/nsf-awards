 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one-week workshop is being offered to a group of fifteen faculty              participants from institutions that are predominately involved in               teaching undergraduates.  The workshop is being led by faculty who are          knowledgeable in the use of microcomputers to carry out studies in              computational chemistry.  The unique features of this workshop are that         it is providing the faculty participants with a syllabus and with               hands-on experience, so as to facilitate the implementation of                  computational chemistry at their home institutions.  The emphasis of            the workshop will be on the use of microcomputers in quantum chemistry          and in molecular modeling.  The software and hardware that are being            used is sufficiently inexpensive so that almost any institution now has         the resources to incorporate computational chemistry into the                   undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  Computational chemistry is a               relatively new area of chemistry, but one that is fast becoming                 important to both academic and industrial scientists.  It is therefore          imperative that the undergraduate chemistry student be given some               exposure to this area.  At present very few institutions provide an             adequate introduction to computational chemistry.  The workshop is              helping to correct this deficiency in the training of undergraduate             chemists.",
