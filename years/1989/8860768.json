 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lease-Squares (L.S.) algorithm is the basis for many modern signal          processing applications including spectral analysis, beamformation,             direction finding, adaptive antenna array, equalization, Kalman                 filtering and parameter estimation.  Triangular and linear systolic             arrays are the most efficient ways to achieve high computational                throughput rates for high performance real-time applications.  The              company is making a detailed comparison of the arithmetical complexity          (number of multiples, divides, etc.) and finite precision computational         effects of the triangular and linear internal and boundary systolic             processing cells under Givens, fast Givens, modified fast Givens,               modified Gram-Schmidt, and Householder transformations for l.s.                 estimation based on the QR decomposition approach.  By selecting the            processing algorithm with the least computational complexity, it can            determine the architecture of the high throughput rate systolic array           processor for VLSI fabrication.  A generic (programmable) systolic              array processing chip can be developed for a variety of signal                  processing applications.                                                        Reviewers awarded this uniformly high scores of 16, 17 and 18.  They            said that the research problem was precisely defined and was one of             high impact.  The proposal is knowledgeable, current and comprehensive.         Success will lead to signal processing architectures with very high             throughput rates.  The personnel have excellent qualifications.  This           research will contribute to the design of future instruments that               require a high rate of data manipulation.",
