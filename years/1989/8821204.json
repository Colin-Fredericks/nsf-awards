 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to study giving for the support                 of privately provided public goods, like the support of                         charities.  The project will entail the development of                          appropriate theoretical models, econometric analysis, and                       laboratory experiments.  This research is motivated by recent                   studies showing that the classical free rider hypothesis is                     insufficient for describing observed behavior.                                                                                                                  The theoretical work examines a general model that includes both                private and public goods motives for giving.  It stresses that a                general equilibrium approach to policy is necessary.  The                       econometric research follows from the theoretical work by                       proposing a spatial autoregressive study of charitable giving.                  This technique will account for the interdependence of                          preferences, and will permit tests of the theoretical hypotheses.               The laboratory experiments are designed to test alternative                     hypotheses about when and why free riding occurs.                               %%%                                                                             Over the past ten years there has been a growing body of                        theoretical, econometric, and experimental work on privately                    provided public goods.  The standard view of public goods is that               if left to individuals to supply, a less than desirable amount                  will be privately provided, and thus government must supply these               goods to attain a social optimum.  However, researchers have been               surprised that there is a considerable amount of cooperation                    among individuals in supplying certain types of public goods, as                in the case of charitable giving.                                                                                                                               This project involves a three pronged approach involving the                    development of better theory, statistical analysis of giving                    behavior, and laboratory experiments studying cooperative                       behavior.  The underlying theme of these three different                        approaches is that the traditional theory of public goods does                  not adequately explain observed behavior of private giving.  This               research is important because it will help explain known facts                  about charitable giving and, hence, provide a better framework                  for policy analysis.  The project will also develop new methods                 for measuring the effects of taxes and subsidies on giving                      behavior.",
