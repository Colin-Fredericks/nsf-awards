 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program to                   support the research of Dr. Richard Weiss of Georgetown                         University. His research will explore in detail the ability of                  anisotropic media with varying rigidities, such as liquid                       crystalline solvents and alkylated silica particles, to alter                   the conformations and photoreactivities of solutes.                                                                                                             Dissection of the factors responsible for the influence of                      anisotropic solvent order on solute reactivity requires a                       detailed knowledge of how solutes and neighboring solvent                       molecules interact under constrained conditions and the                         consequences of those interactions on both the mobility and                     flexibility of the reactive centers of the solutes.  Specific                   processes to be studied include the formation of twisted                        intramolecular charge-transfer states, Norrish II reactions of                  alkanones and alkylphenones, and electron transfer reactions.                   In some cases, the reactive solutes will serve as a diagnostic                  tool of their local environments and in others the solvent will                 be used to determine the degree to which a solute's reactivity                  can be diverted by external forces.  Reactivity parameters                      measured in the ordered and isotropic phases of the media will                  be compared and correlated with the sizes and shapes of a                       series of solutes. Initial solubilization sites and modes will                  be discerned from measurements that probe the macroscopic and                   microscopic properties of the systems.  Results from these                      experiments should be germane to studies where dynamic                          intermolecular interactions are important.",
