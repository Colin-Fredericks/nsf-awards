 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of electrochemical reaction                       dynamics.  The electrochemical properties of several widely                     different modified electrode systems will be investigated,                      including electrodes modified with polymer and clay films,                      organized molecular assemblies, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)                 systems.  Electrochemical methods will be used to investigate                   how the structure, charge and polarity of small molecules                       affect their interactions with DNA and to attempt selective                     cleavage of the DNA strand.  Electrolytes based on novel inert                  solvents capable of operation at very low temperatures, e.g.,                   liquid sulfur dioxide, will be used to generate superoxidizing                  agents that have not previously been prepared.  The kinetics                    and energetics of reactions of organometallic species that                      exhibit large conformational changes on electron transfer and                   those that contain multiple electroactive groups will also be                   studied in order to gain information about the effects of                       structural changes and intramolecular interactions on                           oxidation-reduction potential.                                                                                                                                  This research project is concerned with the continued                           development of electrochemical methods as analytical tools and                  their application to chemical problems.  Electrochemical                        methods of analysis play a complementary role to the                            spectroscopic methods more generally used and provide special                   insight into the kinetics of electron transfer processes and                    the oxidation-reduction potentials of electrochemical reactions.",
