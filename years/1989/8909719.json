 "awd_abstract_narration": "The next decade will see increasing levels of integration of               all kinds of communication needs in a common network.  There has                been a marked interest in packet-switched networks as a means to                attain that goal.  While the performance of data traffic is                     measured in terms of delay, real-time traffic such as voice and                 video is measured in terms of packet losses.  Besides giving                    real-time traffic priority over data traffic, little work has                   been done in determining scheduling policies which minimize                     packet losses.  This research models nodes in the network as                    queues with  customers (packets), each of which has a deadline                  for service  which, if exceeded, leads to a packet loss.  A                     scheduling policy, called the shortest time to extinction (STE)                 policy, is shown to be optimal for a class of queues.  These                    results are extended to a larger class of queueing systems,                     including multi-server and  multi-class queues.  To aid the                     analysis and design of queues  with such scheduling policies,                   methods of computing losses for  such queues are developed.",
