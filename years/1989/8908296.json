 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Television News Archive of Vanderbilt University will establish a           universally accessible electronic television news database, placing the         Television News Index and Abstracts on the Vanderbilt Library system's          mainframe computer, eventually to be exported to a universal database           network.  The Index and Abstracts provide access to all videotaped              national network news broadcasts since August 5, 1968.  They are the            only means of access to all current collections of videotaped national          news in the Vanderbilt News Archive, the Library of Congress, the               National Archive, and other less comprehensive collections.  The Index          and Abstracts also provide valuable media events data that can and              have been used independently without reference to videotapes.                                                                                                   The electronic database will greatly enhance access to the wealth of            television data contained in the Index and Abstracts and in videotaped          news collections.  Television research has attained the status of a             fully developed area of social scientific inquiry, one essential to             understanding contemporary society.  The potential for future growth            and development of such inquiry is enormous.  The universally                   accessible electronic television news database will greatly enhance the         likelihood that the potential will be realized, guaranteeing easy               access for all scholars everywhere to data of fundamental importance to         television research.",
