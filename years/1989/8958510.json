 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research plan will consist of:  (a) Quasicrystal growth and                 structure.  There is still a great deal of controversy whether                  the disorder observed in real quasicrystals is intrinsic to this                phase of matter or just a consequence of non-optimal growth                     conditions.  A particular non-equilibrium model of growth appears               to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the disorder                 observed in diffraction experiments.  A more difinitive                         comparision will be devised since the structures generated by                   this model very definitely are characterized as having intrinsic                disorder, similar to a glass.  Progress in this direction may be                made by using the electron microscope in a more quantitative                    capacity than previously.  (b) Low temperature physics.  Beyond                 the work of Nagaoka and Thouless in the 60`s, surprisingly little               is understood (even qualitatively) about the motion of a hole                   (vacancy) in a lattice of spin 1/2 particles (electrons, 3He).                  Examples: (1) Is the ferromagnetism induced by a single hole in                 a bipartite lattice stable when a finite density of holes is                    introduced?  (2) What form of magnetic ordering is induced by a                 single hole in a triangular (nonbipartite) lattice?  These are                  among the simplest, highly correlated fermion systems which are                 nontrivial and for which an intuitive understanding is completely               lacking.  Through the use of trial wavefunctions and various                    other computational techniques, these and similar problems will                 be investigated.",
