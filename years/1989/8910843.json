 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large variety of spartial and spatio-temporal patterns with a                   wide degree of complexity exist in nature.  Such structures                     show mathematically predictable order in the midst of complex                   nonlinear behavior.  The coupling of chemical and biological                    reactions to transport processes such as diffusion or                           hydrodynamic convection leads to the formation of spatially                     organized distributions of the reactive compounds in reacting                   systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The objective of this research is to conduct a coordinated                      experimental, theoretical and numerical study of the formation                  and evolution of spatial and spatio-temporal patterns on the                    surface of heterogeneous catalysts on which chemical reactions                  occur.  The experiments will characterize quantitatively                        stationary and travelling wave temperature patterns on                          catalytic surfaces using an infrared imager.  Analytical and                    numerical studies will help direct and organize the                             experimental studies and guide the development of principles                    predicting pattern formation.  The experiments, in turn, will                   serve as a critical test of theoretical predictions and as a                    guide to model development and modifications.  The study                        should help develop a framework for predicting the classes of                   reactions and mechanisms which lead to the formation of                         spatial and spatio-temporal studies, the conditions which lead                  to the evolution of these patterns, the impact of surface                       nonuniformities on these structured states, and the impact of                   these patterns on the performance of a catalyst.  The study                     should provide information on how common these temperature                      patterns are, point out potential pitfalls in current                           interpretation of experiments carried out on catalytic                          surfaces, and advance the ability to exploit these structures                   for chemical synthesis purposes.",
