 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Fiona Marshall and her colleagues will conduct research among               the Okiek people of Kenya.  The Okiek, who live in small local                  groups scattered throughout the highlands of Kenya, are of great                anthropological interest because they have retained a traditional               lifestyle which relies heavily on hunting and the gathering of                  wild plant foods.  They are also important because they occupy                  high montane forest and little is known about adaptation to such                environments.  The team will provide a case study of hunter-                    gatherer faunal use.  They will live with the Okiek, accompany                  hunting parties, and study faunal acquisition, bone modification,               and discard.  Because the project will extend over twelve months                and the Okiek move frequently, it will be possible to study                     faunal use at a variety of sites, in a variety of habitats, and                 through a variety of seasons.  Data will be collected on Okiek                  hunting strategies, details of carcass processing, and the                      relationship between human actions and the location and character               of cuts and bone breakage.  Records will be kept on bone                        transport and discard.  Discarded bone will be mapped, collected,               and studied, and post-discard bone modification processes will be               examined at selected sites.                                                                                                                                     This research will accomplish several anthropologically important               goals.  It will document a unique, and fast disappearing way of                 life.  It will also provide insight into hunting and traditional                subsistence practices and yield data which will help                            archaeologists to understand the past.  Finally, through                        examination of the relationship between subsistence and the                     faunal byproducts of this process, it will provide a set of tools               which will aid in the interpretation of archaeological remains.                                                                                                 Until approximately 10,000 years ago all humans lived by hunting                and gathering and many pan-human traits such as the family and                  language developed in this context.  We can better understand                   ourselves today when we view ourselves in this broader context.                 Dr. Marshall's research will contribute to this goal.",
