 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long, uninterrupted time series of cosmic ray                          observations recorded by neutron monitors is an invaluable                      resource for the study of secular and periodic variations of                    cosmic rays, the sun, and the interplanetary medium.  These data,               together with measurements of heliospheric particles and fields                 acquired in situ by spacecraft, allow us to perform rigorous                    observational tests of charged particle acceleration and                        transport, thus pointing the way to improved theoretical                        descriptions of this fundamental process of Solar Terrestrial                   Research.  In addition, the cosmic rays can often be regarded as                test particles and, as such, can be treated as remote probes of                 the interplanetary medium in regions that are otherwise                         unsampled.  With appropriate analysis, particle observations can                be used to derive information on the interplanetary magnetic                    field that would be difficult or impossible to obtain by other                  methods.                                                                             This grant will support a broad-based program of theoretical               and observational research on cosmic rays and their interaction                 with the magnetic fields of the sun and solar wind.  Included is                the continued operation of the Thule and Newark neutron monitors                through the upcoming solar maximum to mid-1992.  Specific study                 tasks include (1) particle scattering near 90o pitch angle in                   dissipative, dynamic turbulence, (2) magnetic helicity effects in               solar particle transport, (3) solar energetic particles and their               long term variability, (4) the three-dimensional structure of                   interplanetary magnetic turbulence, as revealed in cosmic ray                   measurements, (5) dependence of the cosmic ray diurnal anisotropy               upon the sun's magnetic polarity (the \"twenty year wave\"), and                  (6) the sunspot cycle and solar magnetic cycle variation of the                 cosmic ray gradient.                                                                  The overall aim is to use energetic particles to probe the                earth's natural electromagnetic environment.",
