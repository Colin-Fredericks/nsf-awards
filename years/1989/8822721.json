The goals of the research are to:                                  1. Create tools that can be used to rapidly generate application-             specific,                                                                            visually-oriented computing environments on high-performance               workstations;                                                                     2. Build prototype environments in the application areas of                   massively-                                                                           parallel algorithms and architectures, asynchronous and                    distributed                                                                          systems, and VLSI design;                                                    3. Use these prototypes for research within the three application             areas.                                                                                                                                                          The approach to building environments will be based on a declarative            semantic conceptual architecture, in which each environment is                  specified as an interface to an underlying semantic model with which            the user interacts.  The environment always maintains the screen                display as a presentation of the current state of the underlying model,         so that the presentation automatically changes when the state of the            model changes.  The mapping between the states of the underlying model          and the screen display is defined declaratively, in terms of the                desired relationship that must be maintained, and not on the precise            program used to maintain it.  This approach will require advances in            user interface management, knowledge bases, and declarative languages,          which are active research areas in the department.",
