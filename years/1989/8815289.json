 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Prof. Dale Edmondson of Emory University to             engage in collaborative activities with Dr. Bruno Curti and his                 group at the University of Milan.  The researchers will focus on                the enzyme glutamate synthase, which plays a key role in the                    assimilation of nitrogen in nitrogen-fixing microorganisms.                     Specifically, they will pursue the investigation of the roles of                the flavin and iron-sulfur centers in the catalytic mechanisms of               glutamate synthase isolated from two nitrogen-fixing bacteria,                  Azospirillum brasilense and Azotobacter vinelandii, the first of                which is microaerophilic and associated with plant roots while the              second is an aerobic free-living soil bacterium.                                                                                                                Experimental work on the enzymes will be conducted at both Emory                and Milan.  Azospirillum glutamate synthase will be purified and                characterized in Milan while the Azotobacter enzyme will be                     purified in Atlanta.  The U.S. lab will provide the expertise in                physical measurements on the enzyme systems.  The interaction                   between Dr. Edmondson, who has an extensive background in areas of              biophysical chemistry in general and flavoproteins in particular,               and Dr. Curti's group, which has worked with the enzyme glutamate               synthase for several years, should be of mutual benefit.                        Furthermore, it has the potential for yielding substantial results              concerning the basic structure and mechanism of glutamate synthase              as well as new information concerning nitrogen metabolism.",
