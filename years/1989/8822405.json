 "awd_abstract_narration": "Worldwide manufacturing capacity expanded markedly in the 1980-                 1984 period, prompted in important ways by the strength of the                  U.S. dollar.  Newly industrialized countries have emerged who,                  because such a substantial portion of their capital is relatively               new, are able to compete very effectively with U.S. producers.                  They do so, in part, because this new investment embodies cost                  structures associated with the latest technology, while U.S.                    industrial pricing reflects the use of plant and equipment of                   less recent vintage in many industries.  The U.S. government is                 faced with major policy issues as a result of this competition.                 Similarly, the U.S. firms which face this competition directly                  must make decisions about investing in new technologies, and if                 so, whether the investment should be here or abroad.                                                                                                            This project is a Phase II award funded under the Small Business                Innovation Research Program.   The purpose of this research is to               develop and test a new analytical technique for determining the                 range of technologies in use each of the four-digit U.S.                        manufacturing industries.  The research will utilize data from                  both the 1982 and 1987 Census of Manufacturing.  In addition, a                 longitudinal data series on new investment by a single                          establishment will be prepared.  This will be accomplished by                   working directly with the micro data at the Census Bureau, which                also provides an opportunity to do advanced basic research and                  develop marketable tools in a manner never before possible.  The                research will culminate in the creation of a data base that will                clearly identify the range of technologies in use in each                       industry and identify unit costs and other aspects of production                associated with each technology.  These data will be utilized on                an ongoing basis for evaluating the effects of investments in new               technologies on competitiveness, employment, costs and profits at               the industry level and by geographic regions.   The database will               also be useful in predicting the pace at which investment will be               undertaken in each industry.",
