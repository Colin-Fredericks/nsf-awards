 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin of ancient potash evaporites, in terms of parent                waters, depositional environments, and timing of formation is                   controversial largely because no modern potash-bearing basins                   have been described in detail.  The goal of this study is to                    document the geochemical and sedimentological conditions of                     potash mineralization in the Qaidam Basin of western China, where               modern bedded potash salts (carnallite and sylvite) are widely                  developed.  The project consists of three interrelated parts:                   (1) chemistry of inflow waters and their evolution into brines,                 using a computerized specific ion interaction solution model, (2)               field and petrographic study of modern potash salt deposits and                 geochemistry of associated brines, and (3) Holocene-Pleistocene                 history of brine evolution and potash salt deposition from study                of two cores (fluid inclusions in halite, pore fluid chemistry,                 and petrography).                                                                    Many ancient potash deposits lack the MgSO4-salts that are                 characteristic of a seawater evaporite sequence.  Hardie (1984,                 in review) challenged the marine origin of ancient MgSO4-free                   potash evaporites and proposed a new model involving hydrothermal               inflow waters, especially for those formed in tectonically-                     active basins.  Study of the Qaidam Basin, with recent tectonic                 activity, MgSO4-free potash evaporites, and major spring inflow,                will allow testing of new hypotheses on the origins of ancient                  potash evaporites.",
