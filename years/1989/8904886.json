 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phaseolin, the major seed protein of the common bean (phaseolus                 vulgaris) is encoded by approximately 7 copies/haploid genome.                  Genomic and cDNA clones have been sequenced and the developmental               regulation of expression of a 3.8 kb beta-phaseolin gene followed               in transgenic tobacco. Deletion studies and gel-retardation                     experiments have been initiated and have identified putative                    regulatory regions. Dr. Hall here proposes further mapping of the               5' and 3' regions of the beta-phaseolin gene to identify                        additional sequence motifs that confer tissue-specificity. This                 investigation will include a study of the role of cis- elements,                such as the duplication of the CATT and TATA boxes, towards                     promoter strength. The development of a protoplast system for                   rapid assays of transient expression from the various gene                      constructions will be undertaken. Sequences indicated (by gel                   retardation, footprinting, and transient expression approaches)                 as being of regulatory importance, will be tested for functional                activity in transgenic plants. Initial Southwestern blot                        experiments suggest that it is feasible to isolate sufficient                   quantities of the nuclear proteins interacting with phaseolin                   gene fragments to permit cloning of the corresponding genes by                  reverse genetic approaches. Consequently, an additional goal is                 to clone such sequences, a necessary step towards further                       understanding the developmental biology of this strongly                        expressed, temporally regulated and tissue specific gene.                       %%%                                                                             Our understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating gene                       expression in plant systems is very limited. Seed storage                       proteins have provided a powerful model for the study of gene                   regulation in higher plants. The study here will help to                        elucidate the details of one such gene system that is                           developmentally regulated.",
