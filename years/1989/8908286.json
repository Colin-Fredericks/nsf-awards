 "awd_abstract_narration": "Various matching problems in strings, multi-dimensional arrays, and          trees are useful in computer science and related disciplines.  A well-          studied problem is the exact matching problem, which is to find all             occurrences of a pattern in a text.  However, exact matching is only a          special case.  Scientists in all fields often need to analyze                   situations where the data is not completely reliable.  The first goal           of this project is to find efficient serial and parallel algorithms for         the \"inexact\" matching problem.                                                    Following the technological developments of the past decades we              reached the point where the speed of hardware components is very close          to the physical lower bounds.  Thus, it seems that the most feasible            way to increase the speed of computations substantially is by making            them more efficient.  Inspired by this perception this project will             also focus on the following interlacing aspects of computation theory:          design of efficient parallel algorithms that work on an abstract                machine model known in the literature as PRAM, and design if efficient          distributed algorithms for various network models.",
