 "awd_abstract_narration": "The WGBH Educational Foundation proposes to produce a series of                 six one-hour television programs for PBS broadcast on the history               of the development of the computer.  Each of the six programs                   will focus on a period defined by the unique development of                     computer technology at that time, such as the first invention of                mechanical calculating machines. The producers will tell the                    stories of the men and women whose work evolved into  \" The                     Information Age\"  using dramatic reconstruction of historical                   events.  Advanced computer graphics, interviews with the                        computer industry's past and present leaders, and historical film               and still photographs will be used to capture the excitement of                 technological invention and to demystify the inner workings of                  the computer.                                                                                                                                                   An audience of more than ten million will view the series in                    1991, complemented by videotapes and teacher guides distributed                 within the education community; the series will ultimately be                   seen in more than 70,000 classrooms.  Program research products                 and production materials will be contributed to a historical                    archive when the project is completed.  The project budget totals               $3.67 million; NSF support is less than 3% of the total.",
