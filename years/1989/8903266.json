 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the second Brazil/U.S. Workshop on                          Physical Oceanography to be held in Sao Paulo, Brazil                           at the Oceanographic Institute of the University of                             Sao Paulo (IOUSP).  The U.S. organizer is Wendell                               Brown of the University of New Hampshire and his                                Brazilian counterpart is Affonso Mascarenhas of IOUSP.                          The participants include ten U.S. scientists in                                 physical oceanography and a larger number of Brazilian                          scientists than participated in the previous workshop.                                                                                                          The areas to be discussed include the circulation                               along the South American coast, equatorial and shelf                            dynamics, surface and deep western boundary currents,                           deep water/shelf interaction, Amazon river outflow and                          shelf flow interaction and estuarian dynamics.  The                             workshop will foster future cooperative research on                             the South Atlantic.  Only a collaborative effort can                            provide the level of human and financial resources                              necessary to understand the kinematics, dynamics and                            theormodynamics of this crucial part of the global                              ocean in the next decade.  Planning discussions for                             cooperative research projects will be held and will                             provide the basis for a draft planning document on                              future Brazilian/U.S. collaborative research.",
