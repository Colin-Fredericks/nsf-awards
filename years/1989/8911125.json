 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ecological structure of pelagic communities is not well                     known, except for portions of the zooplankton.  Pelagic marine                  zooplankton communities may be organized differently than                       benthic or even terrestrial communities.  Seabird abundance,                    species assemblages, assemblage constancy, and responses to                     habitat perturbation can be quantified more satisfactorily than                 for any other pelagic nektonic organisms.  The EPOCS program, a                 large oceanographic project gathering data for prediction of El                 Nino events, will be used to quantify the link between seabird                  ecology and physical factors of the epipelagic environment.                     Seasonal periodicity and interannual variability of climate, a                  complex of well known water types in the eastern tropical                       Pacific, a non-migratory avifauna, and the EPOCS cruises                        dombine to provide natural experiments in which factors that                    structure pelagic seabird communities become clear.                             %%%                                                                             Seabirds which depend upon pelagic organisms at the surface or                  near the surface of the sea often are found aggregated in                       particular areas of the ocean coincident with major features of                 the physical environment such as currents and fronts.  Because                  seabirds can be seen and recognized at a distance, their                        abundance and presence in one area of the ocean or another is                   often indicative of a particular water mass carrying a                          particular group of pelagic organisms.  In the Pacific Ocean,                   recent natural variation known as El Nino and cold anomalies,                   have shown that seabirds vary spatially in the same way as                      water masses influenced by El  Nino.  The distribution of birds                 and types of birds indicate not only what water mass is present                 in an area, but also the kind and abundance of plankton present                 which are the food resource of the birds.  Bird ecology gives                   us a unifying overview of oceanic processes and their                           biological effect on the large scale.",
