This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic, corporate,               and government cooperation in the support of basic research in                  the mathematical sciences.                                                           This equipment will be used to support several research                    projects in the Department of Mathematics at Purdue University:                 Applications of a Graphics Supercomputer to Numerical Modeling of               Physical Processes - (1) Numerical Simulation of Flows in                       Fractured Reservoirs, (2) Numerical Methods for Compressible                    Fluid Flow, and (3) Inverse Problems and Acoustic Well-Logging,                 directed by Todd Arbogast, Jim Douglas, Jr., Bradley Lucier, and                Fabio Milner; and Applications of High Level Computer Graphics                  to Complex Analysis, directed by Steven Bell, Richard Penney, and               Allen Weitsman.",
