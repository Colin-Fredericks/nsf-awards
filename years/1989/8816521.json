 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fish larvae are an important component of the zooplankton community, yet        little attention has been focussed on Antarctic larval fish ecology.            The processes by which marine fish larvae function affect the dynamics          of antarctic fishes and ultimately the entire antarctic marine                  ecosystem.  Before meaningful research can be conducted on these                processes, it is essential to identify which life history stages, and/or        environmental events are significant to larval growth, survival and             ultimately recruitment into the adult population.  The examination of           variables influential to larval fish survival has been augmented by             dramatic advances in the study of microstructural patterns in fish              otoliths; structures which effectively serve as storage sites of                chronological information.  The employment of otolith techniques in             larval fish investigations promises to provide a schedule of larval fish        growth rates, hatching periodicity, and environmental histories, and            subsequently would make it possible to better understand larval fish            processes.  Through the execution of controlled laboratory experiments,         otolith microstructure will be investigated to determine the causative          agents involved in otolith formation.  Knowledge from the laboratory            experiments will be applied to field populations to delineate larval            fish ages and growth.  The resultant information will be coupled to             environmental data in order that growth and survival will be related to         the physical and biological aspects of larval fish habitats.  These             results will provide the structural framework within which research may         be directed toward elucidating the factors influential to growth and            mortality, and will guide the way for similar research in other                 ecosystems.  A broad model, developed through the utilization of otolith        information, would be applicable to recruitment studies and would               greatly improve our understanding of the dynamics of the early life             history stages of Antarctic fish populations.",
