 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is designed to extend what we now know about what                 people see, think about, and experience while interacting with                  others.  We know that people see things differently when they are               responding or concerned about responding to others than when they               are passive observers.  For example, people are very poor at                    realizing how much the reactions of others are distincly                        influenced by their own actions.  To an important extent we                     create our own social reality by affecting others and,                          unfortunately, we then interpret the reactions of others without                realizing the extent to which we have caused them.  This research               focuses on several aspects of this process of creating social                   reality.  One aspect is the specific role that our prior                        expectations play in acting toward and perceiving others.                       Another aspect is the effects of various social goals on how                    people present themselves.  A special interest lies in one                      person's evaluation of another's abilities when the former has                  some degree of control over the latter's level of performance.                  With this research, we will have a richer understanding of the                  thinking processes that accompany and affect social interactions.               In practical terms this will bring us closer to understanding how               initial false impressions can be sustained in any social                        interaction, and what determines whether interactions that get                  off on the wrong foot can be resolved in friendships and mutual                 understanding .. or drift into further conflict and acrimony.",
