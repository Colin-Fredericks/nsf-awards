 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both normal and transformed cells regulate the expression of                    some genes at the level of translation.  Understanding the                      molecular mechanisms underlying these controls could give                       valuable insights into why certain cells lose the ability to                    control processes such as growth.  The long term objectives                     here are to determine: (a) the role played by translational                     repressors in regulating specific gene expression; (b) the                      repressors; (c) how eukaryotes use this form of translational                   regulation to control essential cell processes, such as                         growth, development, and responses to stress conditions.                        These projects are focused on the study of translational                        repressors specific towards ferritin mRNA.  The specific aims                   are to:  1) Purify repressors of ferritin mRNA translation;                     2) Determine the physiological role of these repressors; 3)                     Study the mechanism of derepression of ferritin mRNA                            translation; 4) Isolate and characterize cDNA and genomic                       clones of ferritin repressors; 5) Determine the pattern of                      expression of repressor genes.  Ferritin translational                          repressors will be purified using standard enzyme                               purification techniques.                                                                                                                                        Translational control mechanisms can have a major influence                     on the final level of expression of specific genes in                           eukaryotes.  The list of examples of genes whose expression                     is controlled at least in part, is growing.  Each of the                        examples raises essentially the same question:  how does the                    cell choose to (or choose not to) translate a particular                        messenger RNA over another?  In certain cases this has been                     answered, however for most of the mRNAs the control of                          translation is poorly understood.  Dr. Walden's work should                     help this understanding.",
