 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor de la Llave will study several maximal operators              that control many problems. In dynamical systems, he will                       investigate cocycle equations and their applications to rigidity                problems, and computational Kolmogorov . Arnold . Moser theory.                 He will also develop methods to obtain numerically accurate lower               bounds for Schrodinger operators.                                                       This research project concetrates on several questions in               mathematical analysis that are relevant to dynamical systems and                to the N.body problem in quantum mechanics. A wide variety of                   methods will be used. On the one hand, regularity problems will                 be approached by the traditional methods of hard analysis,                      defining appropriate spaces and proving sharp estimates for                     operators acting on them. On the other hand, the research will                  systematically use computers, not only as a heuristic aid but                   also in a framework being developed by de la Llave and others                   for automating the routine parts of proofs of analytic estimates.               This will make it possible to employ proof strategies                           inaccessible to a human mathematician just because of the large                 amount of elementary work involved.",
