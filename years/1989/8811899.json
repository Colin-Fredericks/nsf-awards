 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for a symposium entitled \"Marine                 Invertebrate Allorecognition and the Evolution of Immunity\" which               will be held at the annual meeting of the American Society of                   Zoologists in San Francisco on December 27-30, 1988.  The                       symposium will bring together whole-animal biologists who study                 self-recognition in invertebrates with molecular biologists whose               technological approaches to vertebrate self recognition are                     applicable to invertebrate systems.  The invited speakers, who                  are leaders in their respective fields, will discuss basic                      questions regarding the evolution of vertebrate adaptive immunity               using the phylogenetic perspectives that the invertebrate                       allorecognition systems offer.  There are two objectives for this               meeting:  (1) to formulate a consensus, using the workshop                      format, as to which biological questions are common to all our                  research efforts, and (2) to facilitate discussion of                           invertebrate models in the context and language of molecular                    biology and protein chemistry.                                                                                                                                  This symposium should provide important new perspectives on self-               recognition and self-defense in marine invertebrates.                           Enhancement of basic knowledge in this area is important not only               for its intrinsic interest, but because, in the long term, it may               provide insights into the practical problems of maintaining the                 diversity of marine organisms inhabiting the oceans.  In                        addition, the many potential uses of marine invertebrate systems                in biotechnology has also just begun to be appreciated.  The area               represented in this symposium represents an important part of the               basic science foundation for these applications.",
