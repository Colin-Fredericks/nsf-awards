 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is concerned with the study of models of                  population growth and multispecies interactions involving                       structured populations, i.e. populations for which the vital                    growth, mortality and fecundity rates of individual organisms are               significantly dependent upon physiological traits such as size,                 age or developmental stage.  The effects that such physiological                traits of individuals have on the dynamics at the population                    level will be explored.  Some models which have appeared in the                 literature will be studied and extended.  The focus, however,                   will be on the careful derivation of new models for certain types               of structured populations and multispecies interactions to which                an importance and interest has been attached in the biological                  literature and which have not been previously modeled.  A full                  range of standard as well as recently developed analytical tools                will be applied and in some cases, as part of the proposed                      research, extended for use in this study.  The numerical analysis               of models is expected also to play an important role.",
