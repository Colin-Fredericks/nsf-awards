 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work in theoretical condensed matter physics and materials                 research will cover the fields of semiconductors, transition                    metals, surfaces, chemisorption systems, solid-solid interfaces                 and superlattices, defects, electronic structure of novel                       materials, materials under high pressures, high Tc                              superconductors, and many-body effects in solids.  The major                    objective is to explain and predict the properties of real                      materials at the microscopic level from first principles.                       Several different approaches are employed depending on the                      systems and properties under investigation.  Structural and                     bonding properties are obtained using the ab initio                             pseudopotential density functional formalism:  excited-state                    properties are calculated using a many-body Green's function                    approach; groundstate properties of strongly correlated                         electronic systems are calculated using a quantum Monte Carlo                   approach.  A host of solid state properties are obtained with                   these methods.  Among these are:  structural information, phase                 stability, quasiparticle energies, optical and photoemission                    spectra, density of states, charge density distributions, surface               and interface characteristics, phonon dispersion relations,                     electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interaction parameters,                       magnetic properties, superconducting transition temperatures, and               a variety of other solid state phenomena.  Some specific new                    directions are planned in the areas of ceramics, layered and hard               materials, quasiparticle energies and excitation spectra of                     solids, surfaces and interfaces, clusters, quantum Monte Carlo                  calculations of solid state properties, and total dielectric                    functions.",
