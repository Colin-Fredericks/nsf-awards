 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical research concerned with potential theory and                  the boundary properties of harmonic functions will be done.  Much               of the best work done in potential theory occurs in the two-                    dimensional setting where the connections with complex analysis                 of holomorphic functions can be exploited.   In higher                          dimensions, \"real variable\" techniques have to be developed in                  conjunction with advances in partial differential equations.  A                 typical gap in the lore is the lack of information on the roots                 of the gradient along the boundary.  In two dimensions, this set                has zero measure.  Work will be done to clarify the situation in                higher dimensions.                                                                   A second thrust of this project will focus on the Oksendal                 problem for higher dimensions (and related issues).  If one                     accepts the idea of a density (measure) on the boundary of a                    domain which produces harmonic extensions of continuous boundary                functions, it has been shown that this measure is concentrated on               a set of dimension 1 (precisely) in the two-dimensional case.                   The natural conjecture is that n-dimensional domains support                    harmonic measure on sets of dimension n-1, regardless of how                    complicated the boundary may be.                                                     The preceding effort requires careful analysis of the                      Green's function of a domain.  Several questions have been raised               concerning the geometry of the level sets of the Greens's                       function which will be addressed in this research.  At the base                 of this work is the fundamental question of how Green's lines                   deform under continuous deformation of a domain.                                   //",
