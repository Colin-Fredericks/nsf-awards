 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is part of the AmasSeds Project (A Multi-                         disciplinary Amazon Shelf Sediment Study), which seeks to                       understand the physical, chemical and geological processes that                 affect, or are affected by, particle fluxes on the Amazon shelf.                High particulate fluxes occur on the Amazon shelf as a result of                the enormous sediment discharge from the Amazon River and the                   extensive resuspension of fine-grained shelf sediment by tidal                  processes.  This component of the research examines Fe and Mn                   reduction reactions occurring in Amazon inner shelf muds.  The                  dominance of Fe and Mn reactions over SO4 reactions apparently                  results from a favorable balance between low organic C,                         moderately Fe-rich particles, and massive nonsteady-state                       deposition and physical reworking of the seabed.  These                         properties promote the formation of nonsulfidic authigenic                      minerals (Fe-carbonates, Fe, Al-silicates) more typical of low                  SO4 deposits, strongly influence export and storage of                          minor/trace elements during diagenetic remobilization/                          precipitation of Fe carrier phases, inhibit benthic communities                 and shell-bearing fauna, and have major consequences for the                    nature of the preserved sedimentary record.  These                              characteristics suggest the Amazon shelf may be an analogue to                  ancient environments of ironstone or greensand formation.                       Relationships between the variables affecting these processes                   will be investigated in the Amazon shelf and delta-shelf region.                                                                                                By understanding the processes by which chemical phases of                      sediment are deposited in this estuary, other river/ocean systems               can be better characterized.  In particular, Fe and Mn reduction                reactions occurring in Amazon inner shelf muds depend upon a                    balance between low organic C, inner shelf muds depend upon a                   balance between low organic C, moderately Fe-rich particles,                    massive nonsteady-state deposition and physical reworking of the                seabed.  The processes by which in situ precipitates enter the                  historical geological record will be investigated in the Amazon                 shelf and delta-shelf region.",
