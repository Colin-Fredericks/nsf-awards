 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project requests that partial support for the 1989 program                 of the Federal Construction Council (FCC) from the National                     Science Foundation in the amount of $22,000 through continuation                of Grant No. MSM-8803034*.  Addition funding is expected to be                  provided by other agencies, as indicated in Attachment I.  The                  1989 FCC program was discussed at a 29 September 1988 meeting of                senior representatives of the sponsoring agencies of the FCC (see               attachment III).  Agency funding commitments as shown in                        Attachment I were made at that meeting.  As indicted in                         Attachment II, the estimated total cost of carrying out the                     program is approximately $652,900, which is approximately $48,000               more than funding commitments received to date.  Additional                     funding is being sought.  If sufficient funding carry out the                   program is not received, the program will be reduced accordingly                by the FCC Program Committee in consultation with FCC sponsors                  and the Building Research Board staff.                                                                                                                          Described in the proposal is the FCC technical program for the                  period 1 January 1989 to 31 December 1989.  The program was                     developed through a process involving meetings of FCC consulting                committees to identify current problems and concerns of Federal                 agencies, a program planning workshop at which an                               interdisciplinary group of agency professionals met with the FCC                Program Committee to select the most pressing agency problems and               to prepare plans for projects to address those problems, a                      meeting of the FCC Program Committee at which the proposed                      program for 1989 was reviewed and refined, and finally, a meeting               with senior officials for the sponsoring agencies to ensure that                the proposed program reflected the concerns of agency managers.                 Unless otherwise indicted, all projects are expected to be                      completed during the 12-month period covered by this proposal.                                                                                                  The proposed technical program is divided into three parts:                     advisory studies, information studies, and base activities.  The                nature of the work expected to be carried out in each part is                   summarized in the proposal.//",
