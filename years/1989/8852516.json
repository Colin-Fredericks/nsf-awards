 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to supplement classroom                        presentations of the fundamentals of mechanical vibrations with                 classroom demonstrations and laboratory measurements by students.               Equipment and instrumentation are needed to excite and measure                  mechanical system response.  Various spring-mass systems (with and              without dashpots) will be built for use by instructor in the classroom          and by students in the laboratory.  The spring-mass will be simple              models of one, two, and many degrees of freedom and will be designed            to interface with theory.  Equipment is needed to excite these systems          in a controlled manner.  Instrumentation is needed to measure the               excitations and system responses.  Major equipment includes a shake             table, modal analysis system with fast Fourier transform analyzer, PC           computer with printer and plotter, and accelerometers.  Eight                   laboratory experiments are designed to support fundamental mechanical           vibration theory.  The project is significant because it gives a                physical dimension to complex theory and exposes students to modern             vibration measurement and analysis techniques.",
