 "awd_abstract_narration": "All people are members of multiple social categories.  And it                   is well known that when individuals are judged on the basis of                  one categorization system over another (for instance as a Black                 person rather than as a lawyer), this can profoundly affect how                 they are judged and responded to.  The present research                         concerns the general issue of which of many available                           categorization systems are most likely to be used when judging                  others.  The experiments investigate how the momentary                          construct accessibility  of a given categorization system                       influences social categorization.  In the experiments, the                      accessibility of a single social category will be increased by                  varying either the recency or frequency with which that                         categorization system has been used, or by varying the                          motivational importance of the categorization for the subjects.                 It is expected that the category which is currently most                        accessible will be used to a greater extent than other                          available categories, when processing information about target                  persons who are members of multiple social categories.  The                     results of this research into social-cognitive and social-                      motivational processes of social categorization will provide                    insight into the determinants of social stereotyping and                        prejudicial attitudes, and a foundation from which strategies                   designed to reduce and/or redirect social categorization may                    proceed.",
