 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systematic work will be initiated in the diagnostics of swirling                liquid spray flames.  To date, the measurement of swirling flows has            been performed mostly with gaseous fuels.  Measurement of liquid                sprays has been restricted to simple atomizers spraying liquids into            quiescent environments.  Detailed data of drop size, drop velocity,             particle number density, and size-velocity correlations have never              been measured in swirling isothermal or combusting liquid sprays.  The          objectives are to determine the effect of swirl on the turbulent                mixing of liquid spray particles and their response to the swirling             flow, and to determine the effect of swirl on the formation of the              toroidal vortex core and its effect on the spray.                                                                                                               Advanced laser-based diagnostic techniques will be developed                    specifically aimed at investigating the properties of liquid sprays in          combusting swirling flows.  The dynamics properties of the liquid               sprays will be determined; these are key to flame stabilization and             pollutant formation and will lead to optimization of overall                    combustion efficiency, with applications to internal combustion                 engines, gas turbine, and furnace design.",
