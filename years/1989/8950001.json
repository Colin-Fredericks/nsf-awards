 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inadequate exposure of undergraduates to laser physics in the U>S>          stems in large part from insufficient experience and expertise within           undergraduate faculties.  By capitalizing upon an existing pilot                program that focusses upon the introduction of laser physics and modern         optics in undergraduate programs nationwide, the Department of Physics          is offering a pair of intensive, NSF-sponsored workshops that will help         undergraduate faculty develop the necessary background to incorporate           laser topics into their own curricula.  Twenty faculty members from             across the U. S. are spending five days at these workshops in order to          become acquainted with both the subject and practice of laser physics.          Participants in this project are becoming familiar with eight different         types of laser skystems and a gradation of laser experiments that               demonstrate basic principles and serve as powerful vehicles for                 undergraduate instruction.  The workshops are emphasizing experimental          aspects of laser physics and hands-on exposure of the participants to a         large assortment of laser hardware.  Lectures and discussions are               dealing with practical matter such as choices of equipment, space               requirements, costs, sources of supply, safety considerations, and              support services.  Near the end of the workshop, attendees and the              staff will scrutinize the specific, individualized plans developed by           participants to incorporate laser material and experiments into their           respective curricula.                                                                                                                                           The universities whose faculty participate will provide partial support         for this program.",
