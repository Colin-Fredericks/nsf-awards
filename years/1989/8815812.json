 "awd_abstract_narration": "The peculiar characteristics of the products and the                            technological constraints of construction significantly                         differentiate it from other forms of manufacturing; this suggests               that the process of innovation and factors governing this process               will differ.  This investigation will decipher the process of                   product innovation in construction, which has been neglected by                 researchers despite its immense importance to the technological                 advancement of construction.  This investigation will consider                  several successful product innovations that occurred on different               construction projects.  Each project will be the subject of an                  individual case study, and the study as a whole will use a                      multiple.case design.  The conclusions and implications obtained                form the generalizations across the multiple cases will not only                add construction's dimension (which is conspicuously lacking) to                the existing knowledge base regarding the process of innovation,                but contribute to the technological progress in the construction                industry itself by allowing researchers and industry                            professionals to focus their resources on the critical variables                of the innovation process in developing new products.//",
