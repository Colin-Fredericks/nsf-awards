During                 the past six years the collection has been undergoing renovation                in the form of confirmation of identifications, taxonomic                       updating, association of ancillary data (color transparencies,                  tape recordings, etc.) with specimen data and reorganization.                   During the past two years a hierarchical electronic data                        management system has been established, and data on part of the                 collection have been input into the data management system.  In                 October 1987 the Museum acquired the Albert Schwartz collection                 of about 68,000 specimens of amphibians and reptiles from the                   West Indies.  This project will provide funds for (1) completion                of the renovation of the collection and input of the data into                  the management system, (2) concurrent curation of the Schwartz                  collection and input of the data into the management system, and                (3) collection storage equipment that will result in about 30%                  increase in the collection storage facilities.",
