 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study the general problem of how                geometric or dynamic properties characterize negatively curved locally          symmetric spaces.  Specifically, she will consider the relationship             between time-preserving geodesic flows on the unit tangent bundle, and          constant curvature.  She will also work toward proving that if the              metric and topological entropy of a geodesic flow coincide, and the             Riemannian metric is 1/4-pinched, then the manifold must have constant          curvature.                                                                                                                                                      Dr. Hamenstadt will teach a graduate course in the geometry of                  manifolds of negative curvature; she will serve as an advisor for the           undergraduate honors mathematics society, Pi Mu Epsilon, and lecture            in departmental seminars.                                                                                                                                       This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and  (2) to encourage               women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing                 greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in               industry, government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the            participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
