 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research program is to produce a reliable,                versatile, and reasonably-priced equipment to screen potential anti-            cancer agents.  This automated cellular electrode system will provide           capability that is currently not available commercially for routine             screening purposes.  The system will be able to measure on-line, the            dynamic response of various cell lines or tissues to anti-cancer drugs.         It will be simple to use and its capacity can be modulated to handle            multiple screening.  The analytical component utilizes a sterilizable           oxygen electrode which measures the oxygen consumption of the cells             continuously.  The system is automated and the data acquisition,                handling and management are simplified for the convenience of the user.         The feasibility of this approach was successfully demonstrated in Phase         I.  In Phase II, a second generation design of the automated cellular           electrode screening system will be designed and built.  This will               undergo testing in-house as well as in other investigators' testing             laboratories.",
