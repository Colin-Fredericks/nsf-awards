 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of an                           anthropology student in Botswana, southern Africa.  The project                 examines the historical consciousness of being exiled of a people               (the Herero), which is in contrast with their present situation                 of adaptation to their host society.  The methodology combines                  intensive interviewing on oral life histories and a household                   survey with participant observation of the current society.                                                                                                     This project is important because the history of the world can be               seen as one of exile, displacement and other significant                        population movements.  Understanding how some people rationalize                their current situation and come to terms with their sense of                   exile can help us understand general patterns of adaptation to                  population movement across national borders, which can help                     ameliorate problems.",
