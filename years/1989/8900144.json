 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rocky subtidal zone of temperate coasts is characterized by                 complex topography and equally heterogeneous distributions of                   marine algae and invertebrates.  Long-term studies of subtidal                  rock walls (1987-1988) in Northern Massachusetts have produced                  and tested hypotheses concerning the long-term stability and                    short-term regulation of community structure on such substrata.                 Previous studies have focused on the interactions between                       species on rock walls, on the population biology of a few                       dominant species, and on the effects of water movement on                       individual, population, and community processes.  The present                   this research will extend the long-term studies including a                     detailed analysis of separated population on nearby rock walls,                 and populations in contact with competing species.  A                           mathematical model of the subtidal rock wall community will be                  developed.  New information is needed on the role of larval                     dispersal and recruitment in this system, and its influence on                  the maintenance of patchiness of invertebrated populations.                     There are clearly three levels of larval dispersal (adjacent,                   local, regional) that affect population dynamics and thus                       community structure.  These will be investigated using a                        combination of field studies, laboratory investigations, and                    modelling of large scale flow patterns and to incorporate the                   results into a realistic community model.",
