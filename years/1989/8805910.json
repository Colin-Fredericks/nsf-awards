 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is aiding in the establishment, enhancement and operation of         a modern laboratory facility to support experimental work in two major          areas, viz. image processing and development of computing environments          for mathematical applications.  The project in image processing                 includes work in image coding, image restoration and enhancement,               digital filtering, texture modeling and discrimination, image                   interpretation, computer vision and applications of neural networks to          image understanding.  The goal of the second project is the development         of a software environment in which natural scientists and engineers can         solve problems in an efficient and convenient manner.  It involves              bringing together state-of-the-art computational tools including high-          level graphical programming environments, languages and compilers that          automatically detect vector and parallel structures, software for the           automatic solution of differential equations, parallel linear algebra           packages, integrated computer algebra systems, an environment for               performing graph theoretic operations, and programming laboratories and         libraries of frequently-used procedures and notions.  The project is            based on ongoing work at Rensselaer in each of the above areas and will         utilize a large-scale scientific computer, several high-performance             graphics workstations, some Lisp environment/symbolic computation               machines, AI workstations and necessary peripheral equipment.",
