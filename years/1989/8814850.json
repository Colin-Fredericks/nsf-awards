 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on chemical                            studies of Chilean flora to be conducted by Maurice                             Shamma of Penn State University, Victor Fajardo of the                          University of Magallanes in Punta Arenas and Alejandro                          Urzua of the University of Santiago, Chile.  They will                          study certain steroids obtained from the sticky                                 compounds present on the surface of the leaves of                               plants from several genera.  These compounds may act                            as defense against herbivorous pests and will be                                investigated for possible anticancer potential.                                                                                                                 The facilities of both sides are complementary; the                             U.S. scientist will contribute expertise in the                                 interpretation of complex NMR spectra and the Chileans                          will help elucidate the chemical structures through                             the use of their chromatographic equipment and UV and                           IR spectrometers.  They also have facilities for plant                          extraction.  These two scientists will spend time at                            Penn State to isolate the natural products from plants                          and obtain spectral data.  This project is a good                               example of the fulfillment of the goals of the Science                          in Developing Countries program.",
