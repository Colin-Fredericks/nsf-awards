 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and apply three dimensional                      mathematical models of fluid flow and heat flow in the mold                     region of continuous casting processes.  The models will be                     extended from previous work developing two dimensional finite-                  element models, which incorporate the turbulence equations, and                 separate meshes for the nozzle and mold cavity.  The models will                be validated through comparisons with experimental measurements                 conducted using water models of continuous slab casting molds at                Inland Steel and ARMCO, Inc., which are being funded separately.                By applying these models to investigate the influence of                        individual process variables, the mechanisms of defect formation                can be better understood and improvements made to the steel slab                casting process.  Fundamental issues important to the numerical                 calculation of turbulent fluid flow and the accompanying heat                   transfer will also be investigated in this project.  These                      include mesh refinement, convergence schemes, turbulence                        parameters, boundary conditions, and incorporation of two-phase                 flow and buoyancy.  This work will help extend the current                      accuracy, range of application and state-of-the-art of                          mathematical fluid flow modeling.  Once developed, the models                   will be extended to other casting processes, particularly the                   \"near-net-shape\" steel casting processes of continuous thin-slab,               single-, and twin-roll casters.  This project will help in the                  design of these new processes, and could have a tremendous impact               on the future competitiveness of the American steel industry.",
