 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of how people come to organize and comprehend the                   information contained in another person's continuous or ongoing                 stream of behavior is an issue that is of fundamental importance                to several areas of psychology. These include social, cognitive,                and clinical as well as to other disciplines such as sociology,                 communication, and political science whose focus is also                        concerned with issues related to the nature of social action and                interaction.  Despite this fact relatively little theory and                    research has been devoted to the behavior perception problem.                   The overall goal of this research is to further illuminate the                  nature of the behavior perception process and at the same time                  establish its prominent role in a variety of psychological                      phenomena.  More specifically, several causes and effects of                    variation in how an individual divides or utilizes another                      person's ongoing behavior into meaningful actions will be                       explored.  An initial set of studies examines the relationship                  between the number of actions perceivers divide a behavior                      sequence into (i.e., their utilization rate) and their subsequent               memory for the action.related details of that sequence.  A second               set of studies examines the relationship between utilization rate               and causal attribution. A final set of studies examines the                     relationship between utilization rate and affect.  The studies                  will make use of experimental as well as statistical (i.e., path                analytic) procedures to test hypotheses derived from recent                     theory and data.  The results of this project will yield new and                important knowledge concerning the manner in which people                       acquire, retain, and utilize social information.  The research                  has important implications for various models of mental health                  that draw heavily on the social perception/cognition literature.",
