 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dinoflagellates are extremely important components of marine                    phytoplankton.  They are motile, but relatively little is known                 about their swimming behavior or the physics of it.  This project               has three main objectives that address dinoflagellate swimming.                 (1) To obtain observations using a video-based computer-assisted                motion analysis system that will aid in the development of                      swimming velocity models in response to light, temperature,                     salinity and nutrient concentrations. (2) To examine the time                   course of the biological terms in Stokes Law for dinoflagellates                grown under a variety of environmental conditions using a variety               of techniques.  (3) To expand a newly developed random walk                     turbulence model to include a broader range of eddy diffusivity                 coefficients; water column stratification; various phase                        relationships between turbulence initiation and diel vertical                   migration; and various dinoflagellate swimming characteristics.                 The models developed will be very useful in understanding and                   predicting factors that account for the distribution of                         dinoflagellates in the water column.",
