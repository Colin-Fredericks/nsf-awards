 "awd_abstract_narration": "Very little attention has been paid in industrial organization to               the timing of firms' quantity decisions, in particular when firms               have private information.  When a firm is privately informed,                   e.g, about the state of demand, any action taken by that firm can               convey information.  This includes the decision on when to make                 (or announce) a quantity (capacity) choice.  While making a                     decision early enables a firm to commit to an advantageous                      quantity level, other firms gain information about the state of                 demand.  Furthermore, the possibility of misleading the other                   firms by choosing a small quantity (which leads the other firms                 to conclude that the state of demand is worse than it actually                  is) results in equilibrium in small quantity choices.  This                     effect can be so marked that, ex ante, no firm wants to choose                  before the other firms have chosen.  The investigator has already               proven in a simple model that the most informed firm will choose                before other firms.  This project will extend the analysis to                   more complicated dynamic and informational environments.                                                                                                        The project also studies general equilibrium models of firm                     formation.  Earlier work has viewed ownership of a firm as either               equivalent to ownership of an asset or production process or the                ability to exercise residual rights.  While these aspects are                   certainly important, this project shows that production                         externalities and the transmission of resources over time are                   also important aspects of entrepreneurial activity.  Private                    information also plays an important role.                                                                                                                       This is exciting research because it promises new insights into                 the timing of firm's investment decisions and into the creation                 of new jobs by the formation of firms.  Methodologically, this                  project also improves the widely used leader-follower(s) game-                  theoretic model.",
