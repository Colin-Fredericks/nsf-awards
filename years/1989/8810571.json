 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are three general classes of behavioral responses to a               novel stimulus: startle, arousal and orientation.  The startle                  response is a short latency set of muscular contractions induced                by a brief stimulus, typically visual or acoustic.  It is                       characteristic for the startle threshold to be much greater than                the animal's detection threshold.  Arousal behavior is                          characterized by a suite of physical responses.  Although more                  subtle than startle behavior, both the effective stimuli and the                responses are quite general with arousal, making investigation of               the individual neural elements involved in novelty detection                    problematic.  Although orienting responses have not been well                   defined in fish, the novelty response of pulse-type weakly                      electric fish fits best into this category as defined for                       mammals.  The novelty response is a transient acceleration of the               pacemaker which drives the fish's electric organ.  Elicited by                  small stimulus changes near detection threshold, it is a subtle                 but reliable behavior which is not explosive, has a short                       refractory period, and involves a single effector pathway.  The                 novelty response of pulse-type weakly electric fish is well                     suited to neurophysiological analysis and permits simultaneous                  measurement of behavioral and neural responses.   Dr. Randy                     Zelick will continue his work on novelty detection in electric                  fish.  This work is significant since it will give us a better                  understanding of the means by which the nervous system                          distinguishes novel from background sensory input.                               //",
