 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Hart will carry out numerical and theoretical                    modeling, as well as further laboratory experiments, on the                     transition between various ordered and chaotic states in a two-                 layer baroclinic rotating fluid.  The numerical modeling will                   address the extensive laboratory data sets on transitions between               steady, periodic, and chaotic (aperiodic) types of motion arising               from baroclinic instability on the f-plane, as well as on the                   polar B-plane.  Of particular interest is the role of the rigid                 sidewall boundary condition in the transition process.  Its                     presence leads to a horizontal shear of the basic flow, a                       modification to the basic eigenfunctions of the linear free-slip                problem, and the possibility of flow separation.                                     Theoretical and experimental studies will focus on the                     processes that may destabilize the simple steady and vacillatory                regimes that are observed in laboratory experiments, and which                  are successfully predicted by low-order (and/or weakly nonlinear)               quasi-geostrophic theory.  In addition to the role of the viscous               sidewall, two potentially destabilizing mechanisms of interest in               atmospheric and ocean sciences are periodic and topographic                     forcing.  The action of these physical effects on the B-plane                   finite-amplitude baroclinic instability problem will be                         investigated through the use of laboratory and numerical models.//",
