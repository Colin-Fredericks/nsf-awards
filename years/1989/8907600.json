 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emulsion polymerization is used in industry for the production                  of polymer latexes for applications such as coatings, binders,                  adhesives, paints and foams.  In this process, polymer                          particles are created in the presence of stabilizing                            emulsifiers with diffusion of monomer from large droplets                       (greater than approximately 10 microns in diameter) to the                      growing particles which are approximately 0.1 to 0.4 microns                    in diameter.  An alternative to emulsion polymerization is                      miniemulsion polymerization in which the monomer phase is                       first dispersed into the aqueous phase in the form of small                     and stable droplets in the size range of approximately 0.05 to                  0.4 microns in diameter through the use of a mixed emulsifier                   system.  These miniemulsions are formed by the addition of a                    co-surfactant (for example hexadecane or cetyl alcohol) to the                  usual emulsion polymerization recipe, typically containing                      sodium dodecyl sulfate as surfactant.  Initiation an                            polymerization then take place in the monomer droplets and the                  product polymer particles are approximately the same size as                    the initial monomer droplets.                                                                                                                                   To gain a more fundamental understanding of the mechanisms                      involved in miniemulsion polymerizations, the PIs plan to:                           1.  Determine the effect of the composition of the                                  particle/water interface and the monomer/polymer                                particle on the entry and exit rates of free                                    radicals to and from the droplets/particles.                                2.  Test the existing methodologies for the determination                           of the entry and exit rate coefficients which have a                            direct bearing on the mechanisms of this                                        heterogeneous polymerization.                                               3.  Determine the relative importance of droplet/droplet,                           particle/droplet, and particle/particle                                         instabilities and their influence on miniemulsion                               polymerization.                                                             4.  Examine the effect of the breadth in the                                        particle/droplet size distributions through                                     simulations of the miniemulsion polymerization                                  kinetics, hereby approaching a more realistic                                   description of an actual system.",
