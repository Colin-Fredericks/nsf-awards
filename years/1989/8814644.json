 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose herein a program of basic study on a variety of topics in            discrete optimization.  The models considered derive from integer               programming problems of broad applicability in operations research,             computer science and many areas of the natural, engineering,                    mathematical and social sciences.  The apparent computational                   intractibility of the most general such models is well-known; thus              highly structured combinatorial optimization models are the focus of            the proposed research.  The models to be studied are frequently                 directly applicable to real-world problems and in other instances               serve as components in solution methodology for more general models.            Furthermore, algorithmic insight gained from study of such highly               structured models is often a useful guide in the design of heuristic            solution procedures of general applicability.                                                                                                                   We propose two major research projects.  First, a duality model is              proposed as a unifying framework for investigating duality properties           of linear subspaces, polyhedral cones, rational geometric lattices and          certain classes of integer programming problems.  Second, study of              several specific combinatorial packing and covering models is proposed          as a means to guide further research on problems related to supply-             demand networks, production scheduling, stock cutting, two-terminal             cut packing, branchings and vertex packing.",
