 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  Under this project scientists from the U. S.                      and India plan to develop reliable methods of predicting                        compressive strength of laminated structures when known                         faults of delaminations exist.  Specifically the                                scientists, Dr. J. N. Reddy of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg,                     VA, and Dr. A. V. krishna Murty of Indian Institute of                          Science (IISc) in Bangalore, plan to develop methods of                         predicting sublaminate instability, delamination growth and                     residual strength of laminated composite panels subjected                       to compressive loads.  The interaction between the two                          scientists and their associates is aimed at development of                      methods for the design of fibre reinforced composite                            laminates subjected to compressive loads.  The work will be                     primarily theoretical but will build on results of                              experimental data already generated at the IISc.                                                                                                                Scope:  Composite materials are increasingly used in a                          variety of structures in areas as diverse as medical                            prosthetic devices, electronic appliances, sports                               equipment, automative parts and high performance space and                      underwater structures.  A limiting factor on their load                         capacities is the presence of small delaminations and their                     progress under certain loads.  The research is timely,                          important and of both scientific and practical benefit.                         The two collaborating teams possess outstanding                                 complementary capabilities to study the problem and the                         behavior of such materials.  The research is likely to                          benefit both India and the U. S.",
