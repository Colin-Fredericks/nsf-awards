 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long-term program of computer simulations to study how galaxies               form, evolve and cluster in one specific and very successful                    theory will be continued.  The galaxy distribution traces the                   structure of the universe on the largest scales accessible to                   observation; it reflects both the processes which generated                     irregularities on the cosmos and the nature of its material                     contents.  Most of the universe appears to be in an unknown                     \"dark\" component, which may be an entirely new form of matter, a                relic of the very early history of the Big Bang.  Computer                      simulations of cosmic evolution based on this assumption lead to                galaxy clustering which agrees well with that observed.  They                   suggest that our Universe may contain enough \"cold dark matter\"                 that it will eventually stop expanding and recollapse.  Such                    simulations can be \"observed\" in the same way as the real                       Universe, allowing a very direct comparison between theory and                  observation.  The research will involve studies of interactions                 between close pairs of galaxies to see whether such pairs always                merge into a single system.  Finally, the extent of the                         distribution of dark matter around individual spiral galaxies                   will be estimated.  Even if the theoretical premises of the cold                dark matter theory turn out to be false, this program will deepen               our understanding of the structure and origin of galaxies and                   galaxy clusters.",
