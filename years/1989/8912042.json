 "awd_abstract_narration": "Of central importance to hydrologic and soil erosion modelling is          the development of an adequate representation of terrain.  Such a               representation must be capable of yielding precise estimates of                 elevation, slope, and aspect at any point.  Little progress has been            made in solving this problem because of its complexity, however.                Present models for predicting effects of land use practices and                 agricultural management practices on nonpoint source pollution, for             example, are limited by their inability to adequately consider                  three-dimensional effects.  Based on the idea that terrain can be               represented in the form of discrete polygons, each bounded by two               contour segments and two interpolated streamlines, the investigators            will develop a technology to handle spatial variability of the                  attributes in large watersheds and river basins.  This project will             refine and begin testing of an established hydrological model that              integrates algorithms developed for more specific models.                                                                                                            This innovative study aims to develop methods that encompass               three-dimensional effects and that are more tractable, accurate, and            practical for use by engineers, soil scientists, and other                      practitioners than are current methods.  Explanation of means of                representing terrain, and the central statistical questions that must           be dealt with in working out this representation, will contribute to            the development of geographic information systems.  These methods have          the potential to facilitate progress toward modelling the effects of            management and land use practices on nonpoint source water quality and          quantity.  The techniques developed may also be applicable to                   subsurface water movement and to related groundwater applications,              which in turn are likely to be essential considerations in the                  development of reliable remedial measures.",
