 "awd_abstract_narration": "Profound organizational change -- restructuring, mergers, new                   affiliations, service changes, closure -- is a key constituent of               any competitive organizational environment. This research will                  look at the way the structure of organizations' governing boards                affects what organizational change occurs. Also considered is the               way organizational change alters the structure of governing                     boards. Where the organization is within a cycle of growth,                     stability or decline is expected to influence the relationship                  between governing board structure and organizational change. The                structure of governing boards depends on their size, range of                   backgrounds of members, the number of inside directors, amount of               management participation, degree of board accountability,                       limitation on consecutive terms and concern with asset                          preservation or with strategic activity. A ten-year data sample                 of 1800 community general hospitals will be analyzed.",
