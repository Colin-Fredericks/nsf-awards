Under the previous           grant research, Professor Byer and his group have made major advances           in development of a tabletop-sized scanning soft x-ray microscope               using a laser-produced plasma as the source of intense X-rays.  This            approach to a scanning soft x-ray microscope is currently the only              such one which does not require a major synchrotron light source                facility as the radiation source.  Professor Byer has proposed a novel          utilization of this new microscope capability to demonstrate x-ray              transmission tomography of small samples at 140A wavelength.  The               various techniques of computer tomography currently employed for 3-             dimensional imaging have already had major impact on fields such as             medicine, biology, and materials research.  This project could provide          a significant new research capability in these areas and would be the           first demonstration of soft x-ray tomography.",
