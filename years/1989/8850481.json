 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Curriculum Research & Development Group (CRDG) of the College of            Education of the University of Hawaii is taking the lead in a national          consortium of 2 school districts, 13 universities, 29 elementary                schools, and its publisher, the University of Hawaii, to develop and            disseminate a sequential and integrated curriculum in science, health,          and technology for elementary schools, kindergarten through grade 6.                                                                                            The Developmental Approaches in Science and Health (DASH) curriculum            focuses on:                                                                                                                                                       o  teaching the basic concepts of science, health, and technology;              o  fostering understanding of the relationships among science, health,             and technology;                                                              o  developing the strategies and cognitive skills needed for using                 scientific, technological, and health-related knowledge; and                 o  fostering awareness of the responsibility of citizens for insuring              the appropriate uses of the knowledge and products derived from                 science, health, and technology.                                                                                                                           DASH offers an integrated, holistic approach to elementary science              education for students.  Its content is drawn from the foundational             concepts of the biological, physical, and earth sciences, and it                incorporates applications of these concepts in health and technology.           In accord with the emerging knowledge of cognitive development, DASH            content is weighted toward the applied and practical rather than the            abstract and theoretical.  Learning activities are carefully sequenced          to anticipate the cognitive and physical development of children.                                                                                               For Teachers DASH will provide instructional materials that integrate           science, health, and technology, alternative instructional strategies           for teaching a heterogeneous populations of students, and instructional         materials that require minimal preparation time and are easy to organize        and manage.                                                                                                                                                     Twenty years of experience in developing science curricula at CRDG have         provided the grounding in theory and practice on which the instructional        design of DASH is based.",
