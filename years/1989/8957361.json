 "awd_abstract_narration": "This microbiological research by Dr. Deming will focus on the                   positive interactive effects between elevated hydrostatic                       pressures and extremes in temperature.  The work seeks to                       understand the limits of life on this planet (and perhaps                       elsewhere), both during early Archaean stages and in more                       contemporary settings.  By focusing on the simplest of                          microorganisms and on environmental parameters conventionally                   viewed as biologically inhibitory, Dr. Deming has discovered                    novel types of bacteria operating in environments previously                    considered depauperate if not sterile of life, from hadal depths                (8300m) in the Puerto Rico Trench to superheated hydrothermal                   vents (350 C) in the Pacific to subzero muds in the Arctic.                     During the period of this Presidential Young Investigator award,                Dr. Deming will research bacteria from the benthic marine                       environment to address several issues:                                                                                                                          *  What is the molecular-genetic basis for stable metabolic                     processes at the most extreme conditions to temperature and                     pressure?                                                                                                                                                       *  Do bacteria from extreme marine environments produce                         extracellular enzymes of unique physical/chemical properties                    that alter the environments apart from living organism?                                                                                                         *  To what extent is the ecological importance of benthic                       bacteria tied to relationships (symbiotic, mutualistic) with                    other marine inhabitants?                                                                                                                                       *  What is the global significance of carbon cycling by benthic                 bacteria, especially in climatically dynamic polar regions                      and hydrodynamically variable temperate zones?                                                                                                                  Sea-going portions of the research plan will involve in situ                    measurements of the carbon-cycling activities of natural                        bacterial assemblages in benthic samples, using microscopic and                 radioisotopic tracer techniques.  Laboratory research will                      include recovery of novel microorganisms and selected enzymes and               nucleic acids, experimental tests for activity and stability of                 both the organism and its constituents under extreme temperatures               and pressures, and molecular study of those genes most likely to                open new avenues of both fundamental and applied research.",
