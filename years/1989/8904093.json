 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fungal toxin fusicoccin (FC) binds to a receptor (FCBP) in                  the plasma membrane (PM) of virtually all higher plant cells and                causes enhanced proton excretion by the plasma membrane proton-                 (ATPase).  The ubiquitous nature of the response suggests that                  the FCBP, a receptor for a compound a plant normally never would                encounter, is a conserved protein with a different but essential                function.  If so, a loss of FCBPs should be lethal.  To test this               hypothesis, a search is being made for mutant Arabadopsis                       thaliana plants which are insensitive to FC and lack FCBPs.  To                 characterize the FCBP, the FCBP gene will first be isolated from                an Arabadopsis genomic library.  This will require                              microsequencing the 31 kDa FCBP polypeptide which has been                      purified, and then constructing an oligonucleotide probe.  The                  manner in which FC-FCBP enhances ATPase activity is uncertain.                  One possibility is that it alters the pH profile for the ATPase                 to enchance its activity in the cytoplasmic pH range.  It may do                so by increasing the content of lysophospholipids (LPL) in the                  PM.  Two questions concerning this hypothesis will be tested.                   First, are the FCBP and ATPase sufficient for a FC effect or are                other PM proteins required?  Secondly, does FC enhance the LPL                  content of the PM, and can increased LPL replace the requirement                for FC?                                                                                                                                                         Cells move chemicals across their membranes by a system of active               transport.  The pumps are proteins but they are difficult to                    separate and purify because they are located across and embedded                in membranes.  It is now possible to study one of these proteins                from plants because it has been purified.  This protein is                      thought to play a role in plant growth hormone action.",
