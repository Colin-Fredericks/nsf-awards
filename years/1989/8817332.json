 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective is to make a comprehensive study of low                          temperature hydrothermal convection occurring in young mid-                     ocean ridge flanks where sediment cover is thin and incomplete.                 The field program will involve a transponder navigated heat                     flow survey in three sediment ponds of different ages on the                    flanks of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, as well as pore pressure                      measurements to determine flow rates and in situ hydrologic                     properties of the sediment.  Heat flow measurements will be                     made in a profile along and across each pond, with additional                   measurements in the neighborhood of anomalies.  Piston cores                    will be taken for the determination of physical properties and                  will be preserved for future work on pore water chemistry. The                  data will be interpreted in terms of fluid flow models.                         %%%                                                                                  Hydrothermal circulation in the oceanic crust has a                        profound impact on the heat budget of the earth and on chemical                 exchange between the crust and the ocean.  Little is known                      about the low temperature hydrothermal regime of incompletely                   covered sediment ponds that occur on the flanks of mid-ocean                    ridges.  This field program will be the first detailed look at                  this important thermal regime in the oceanic crust.",
