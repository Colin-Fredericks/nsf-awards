 "awd_abstract_narration": "This career advancement award will enable the PI to work in a new               area and enhance her research capabilities.  The research deals                 with geotextiles, a relatively new and rapidly developing area in               geotechnical engineering.  Geotextiles are often used in drainage               applications as a filter medium,i.e. when placed against soil                   they prevent the soil from moving or eroding, while allowing the                free passage of water through the soil and the geotextile.                      However, if the fabric and soil are not properly matched, the                   filter (the fabric in this case) can become clogged with soil                   particles, and water will not pass through the drain. The drain                 has failed by clogging. This project will study the filtration                  behavior of nonwoven geotextiles when used in drainage                          applications with gap-graded and silty sands. The soil retention                and clogging mechanism in nonwoven (both needle-punched and                     heat-bonded) geotextile fabric will be studied from macroscopic                 and microscopic points of view. The PI will work with Professors                R.M. Koerner (Drexel University), A. Rollin (Ecole Polytechnique)               and C. Tien (Syracuse University) to gain a deeper understanding                in this new line of research. This project will also explore                    industrial interaction in the proposed area of study.",
