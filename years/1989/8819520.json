Fenves, Department of Civil Engineering, Carnegie                 Mellon University and Dr. C. S. Krishnamoorthy, Department of Civil             Engineering, Indian Institute of Tehnology, Madras in the area of               knowledge-based expert system (KBES) in civil engineering design.               The aim is to provide a synergistic merger between U. S. research               results in the development of KBES for engineering design and Indian            research on local civil engineering design practice, thus producing a           set of computer tools that can substantially improve the efficiency             and economy of structural design in India and other developing                  countries.  The specific area of research planned is that of KBES for           structural design including preliminary design analysis and detailed            component design.  The three KBES to be developed are to deal with              multistory reinforced concrete buldings, concrete bridges, and                  single-story steel industrial structures.  The resulting KBES will be           exstensively evaluated by leading designers and practicioners.                                                                                                  Scope:  The area of this research is of great interest because of the           wide range of knowledge-based programming strategies that need to be            incorporated and the variety of local expertise that must be                    collected, organized and formalized.  The U. S. scientist is a                  pioneer reasearcher in KBES with a very good reputation in artificial           intelligence application in civil engineering.  The Indian scientist            has broad experience in research  and practice, and the joint effort            should lead to a fruitful product.
