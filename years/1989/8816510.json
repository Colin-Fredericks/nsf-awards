 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an investigation of pathways and processes of fine-                     grained sediment dispersal in the Cretaceous Western Interior                   Seaway of North America.  The study will focus on the Tununk                    Member of the Mancos Shale, exposed in central and southern Utah.               The specific objectives of this study are 1) to document the                    location of river mouths along the coastline of the Tununk Sea,                 and the orientation and areal extent of associated fine-grained-                sediment dispersal systems, and 2) to reconstruct processes of                  sediment transport on the ancient shelf.  Field observations and                laboratory studies will involve analyses of time-equivalent                     horizons in the Tununk Member, exposed at localities situated at                various positions perpendicular and parallel to the ancient                     shoreline.  Reconstructions of the ancient dispersal systems will               employ concepts and techniques derived from study of modern,                    muddy shelves, and will include documentation of lateral trends                 in grain size, sedimentary macro- and microfabric, and organic                  carbon isotopic ratios.  Interpretations of processes on the                    ancient shelf will rely on detailed field observations, as well                 as the use of quantitative, sediment-transport models.  The                     overall goals of this study are to contribute to accurate                       paleogeographic, paleotectonic, and paleoceanographic                           reconstruction of the Cretaceous Seaway, and to the development                 of techniques for the reconstruction of other ancient                           environments of fine-grained sediment deposition.  Work will help               to develop models used in exploration for energy resources.",
