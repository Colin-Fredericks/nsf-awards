 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this research project is to determine how                cell lineage, developmental hormones, cell interactions and                     developmental genes influence the fate of neurons within the                    developing nervous system of an insect.                                                                                                                         Within the nervous system of the moth, \u001aManduca\u001a \u001asexta\u001a, adult                 specific neurons are generated during the larval stage by arrays                of neuroblasts.  Each neuroblast generates a nest of                            developmentally arrested progeny.  With the onset of                            metamorphosis the development of the adult specific neurons                     resumes.  Electrophysiological techniques will be employed to                   determine both the physiological and morphological properties of                the arrested cells during the larval stage and as they develop                  into mature neurons.  The influence of the developmental hormones               on the fate of the new neurons will be examined.  Using surgical                manipulations, Dr. Booker will also determine if the size of the                periphery influences the fate of the adult specific neurons.                                                                                                    The role of segmental determination in the development of the                   insect nervous system will be examined using two approaches.                    First, a screen for new homeotic mutations in the moth will be                  conducted.  The new mutants will be analyzed to determine if they               influence the fate of identifiable pattern elements within the                  segmental ganglia.  Second, DNA in \u001aManduca\u001a which shares homology              with the homeobox genes of \u001aDrosophila\u001a \u001amelanogaster\u001a will be                  cloned.  The cloned moth genes will be characterized as to the                  temporal and spatial pattern of their expression within the                     segmented ganglia of both wild.type and mutant animals.  These                  complimentary approaches will further the understanding of the                  role of the developmental genes in segmental and neuronal                       determination.",
