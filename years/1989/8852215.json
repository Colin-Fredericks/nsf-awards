 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to purchase equipment for the                         Department of Sociology at Memphis State University.  The                       equipment will be used to improve the undergraduate social                      research curriculum in sociology and to increase the number of                  women and minorities choosing careers involving social research.                The undergraduate social research curriculum will be revamped                   beginning with the required courses dealing with methodology and                techniques of scientific inquiry and later changing the research                component of substantive courses.  Courses will be changed to                   emphasize the development of analytic and critical thinking                     skills instead of rote memorization and cookbook learning.  They                will also be revised to incorporate the analysis of substantive                 research questions of special relevance to women, minorities,                   working class, and Southern students (the least represented                     groups in social research fields).                                                                                                                              The funds will be used to purchase 16 microcomputers and special                software to equip a laboratory capable of providing simultaneous                hands-on education in sociological research methods and                         statistics to as many as thirty undergraduate students in each of               six classes in the first year.  The software to be purchased                    includes two statistical and two data base packages.  These                     packages will facilitate the development of critical thinking and               analytic skills by enabling students to work jointly on                         instructor-guided research activities as well as to conduct                     individual research projects on topics of special interest to                   women, minorities, working class, and Southern students.  The                   grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds from                  non-Federal sources.",
