 "awd_abstract_narration": "For twelve years the PIs have studied several populations of               wrens (Campylorhynchus griseus) that practice cooperative                       breeding in Venezuela.  These birds live in extended family                     groups on permanent communal territories, a habit that is                       widespread among tropical birds.  These populations are an                      especially revealing test case of the above evolutionary ideas                  about cooperation because it so effectively increases the number                of young that can be produced.  Genealogies are available for 85                groups (more than 700 marked individuals) of this species in two                distinct habitat types.                                                              Using newly-developed DNA fingerprinting techniques, the PIs               will establish whether the presumed breeders are the only birds                 reproducing in these family groups, and whether putative                        nonbreeding helpers are aiding in rearing siblings.  This test                  will now be based on conclusive evidence from the genetic                       material itself rather than on fallible inferences based on                     behavioral observation.  They will document the extent to which                 parentage is shared within and between groups, and analytical                   models and computer simulations will quantify the potential                     importance of parentage shared beyond a principal pair in social                groups.  They will continue field experiments examining the                     processes of competition for productive breeding positions and                  group defense against predators, the suspected mechanism of the                 advantage of breeding in a group.  They will also explore the                   implications of short-distance dispersal for the genetic                        structure and distinctness of populations, using restriction-                   fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses and our long-term                  data on differences in dispersal tendencies between populations.",
