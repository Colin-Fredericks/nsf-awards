 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous NSF-sponsored research in the hyperarid eastern                   Sahara has established a discontinuous geochronological sequence                spanning the Quaternary.  Early to Middle Pleistocene alluvium                  and eolian sediments with Early Paleolithic archaeology in buried               \"radar\" valleys are inset by lacustrine deposits associated with                Middle Paleolithic archaeology.  These are overlain by Holocene                 sand sheets, playa deposits, and laminated lake beds with                       associated Neolithic archaeology.  Paleoclimatic and paleo-                     environmental interpretations based upon geology, archaeology,                  fauna, and palynology indicate major north-south fluctuations of                the Sahelio-Saharan transitions zone during late Quaternary time.                    The Meidob Hills, a basaltic volcanic pile, periodically                   active for perhaps the past 30 millions years, lies on the                      present southern fringe of the Sahara and has, therefore,                       experienced the passage of the transition zone back and forth                   several times.  With the collaboration of an interdisciplinary                  team I propose to study alluvial and eolian sediments interbeded                with datable volcanics to establish a time-calibrated strati-                   graphic sequence that will be correlatable to strata of the                     hyperarid core of the Sahara as well as southward to African rift               valley sequences.  The results will be of value in understanding                past man-land relationships in the sensitive Saharan fringe in                  order to better assess future land uses and also in comparing                   hyperarid geomorphic processes with semiarid American West.                          Investigative techniques include stratigraphy,                             sedimentology, palynology, AMS radiocarbon dating, space imagery                remote sensing, isotope geochemistry, and archaeological                        observations.  The possibility for early hominid remains will not               be overlooked.",
