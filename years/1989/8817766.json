 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is directed towards the development of                an important new criterion for establishing the machinability of                a work material as well as to provide an important new method of                predicting the shear angle for a given set of cutting conditions.               This investigation involves tests on a wide range of materials                  and conditions and includes a simple noncutting test that gives                 the rate of increase of shear stress with shear strain for large                strains.  The results will be used to better understand the                     relation between workpiece chemistry and structure and the slope                of the shear stress-shear strain curve for large strains.  The                  results will also be used to verify a new shear angle criterion.                An important secondary objective of this work is to provide a                   better understanding of basic mechanisms involved in large strain               deformation.",
