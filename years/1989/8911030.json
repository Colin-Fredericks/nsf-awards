 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of military spending and arms accumulation in less developed            countries have concentrated on arms races.  Arms races in the                   developing world have been especially violent and deadly.  This                 investigation will amplify our understanding of military spending               patterns in the developing world by also examining the specific ways in         which decision-makers in the developing world use the military budget           to help control their economies and to augment their internal                   political support.  These aspects of defense policy making have been            shown to be important in Western industrialized societies, but rarely           studied in the context of a developing society.  In essence, the                researchers will be testing these ideas for eight developing nations            that are significant arms producers to explore whether the interplay            between domestic political and economic concerns, that helps to                 determine military spending policy in the industrialized world, also            apply more generally around the globe.  More specifically, a great deal         is already known about defense-welfare tradeoffs in Western                     democracies, but, how, if at all, does this tradeoff operate in the             developing world.                                                                                                                                               Systematic, in depth case studies for the political economy of                  military spending in India, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel, Egypt,                 Argentina and Brazil, and South Africa will be conducted.  A small              computer simulation of the relevant mathematical dynamics in each               society will be developed drawing on the insights from prior work.              Data for each nation in the study will then be used to \"test\" the               statistical validity of the hypothesized relationships.  These data             will consist of quantitative information about arms expenditures, arms          productions, arms sales, the size of the armed forces, war casualties,          et. cetera.  Economic data such as GNP, inflation rates, corporate              profits, governmental deficits will also be used in addition to                 information about the domestic political situation in each society.             Much like models of the economy, these models will permit different             policy scenarios to be explored.                                                                                                                                Successful completion of this research should embellish our                     understanding of defense spending in the developing world - - where             according to one estimate, roughly 16 million lives have been lost to           warfare during the past 40 years.",
