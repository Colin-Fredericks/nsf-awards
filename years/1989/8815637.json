 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study of the relationship of climate and vegetation to the               stable isotope chemistry of grassland soils in the Great Plains                 will be conducted.  Six study sites in differing temperature,                   moisture, and vegetation regimes have been selected and will be                 monitored for biomass production, dust accumulation, and soil CO2               production.  This background information, in conjunction with                   climatic data, will provide a basis for interpreting the delta                  13C and delta 180 of pedogenic carbonate in these soils.  An                    investigation of the data 13C and chemical composition of                       occluded C in opal phytoliths is the major goal of this                         research.  The delta 13C of opal phyoliths extracted from the                   soil will be examined and it will be determined whether it                      represents the ratio of C3 to C4 vegetation and the delta 13C of                the soil organic matter.  The work will demonstrate the                         suitability of opal phytoliths, as well as pedogenic carbonate,                 as tools in paleoenvironmental reconstruction studies.                               This research should be of fundamental ecological importance               as well as potentially useful in providing a significant new                    method for soil science in general.
