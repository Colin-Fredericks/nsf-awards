 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research                           project in solid state physics between Ljiljana                                 Dobrosavljevic of the Institute of Physics in Belgrade and                      John Clem of Iowa State University, the investigators will                      develop a phenomenological theory of magnetic and transport                     properties of high tc superconductors.  Through these                           studies, the investigators will identify the mechanism for                      superconductivity (how does it work), weak links in the                         materials, and inhibitors to electrical flow.  Despite the                      significant advances in this field, experimentalists are                        searching for explanations to these problems.  The U.S. and                     Yugoslav investigators are among the leaders in theoretical                     research.  Their joint research will yield new insights into                    high tc superconducting properties and microstructure.                                                                                                          This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board                      on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported                       through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions                       from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia.                       The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department                    of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to                       the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia, but                         include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia                    and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
