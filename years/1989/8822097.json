 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research by Dr. David W. Thompson will be funded by the                    Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program at the College of William                   and Mary.  The research will be carried out primarily by                        undergraduate students and should provide well trained students                 who have been involved in new development of new organometallic                 chemistry.                                                                                                                                                      The general goal of the research centers on the development of                  selective syntheses for 3-alkylidenetetrahydrofurans,                           5,6-dihydro-2H-pyrans, and tri- and tetra-substituted allylic                   and homoallylic alcohols.  The projected cyclic ether syntheses                 are of two types: 1) bimetallic                                                 organotitanium/zirconium-aluminum carbometallation of                           acetylenic acetals followed by vinylmetal/oxocarbocation                        coupling, and 2) Lewis acid promoted cationic cyclization of                    acetylenic acetals.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the                  selective synthesis of 3-alkylidenetetrahydrofurans which will                  be subjected to newer ether cleavage reagents with expectation                  of producing selectively tri-/tetra-substituted alkenols.",
