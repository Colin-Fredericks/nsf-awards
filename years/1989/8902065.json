 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular Science, fundamental to all of science and engineering                (S&E) is viewed as:  the University of Idaho's strongest research               area; an area that can be gradually strengthened at other Idaho                 institutions; and an important discipline in Idaho's future.  The               goals of Idaho's Implementation Plan for the Experimental Program to            Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) are to:  a) improve the                 quality of basic molecular science research at the University of                Idaho; b) enhance the ability of molecular science faculty in Idaho             to compete successfully and consistently for Federal research funds.                                                                                            Specifically, Idaho EPSCoR objectives are to:  a) support targeted              S&E faculty in molecular science to advance Idaho's national                    competitive position; b) improve the research environment in Idaho;             c) raise public awareness of the importance of S&E research; d)                 develop self-sustained involvement in S&E in Idaho; and e) build                strong ties between faculty researchers in Idaho universities and               nationally competitive academic and industrial researchers.  In                 keeping with NSF's EPSCoR Program goals, significant progress will              continue to be made in meeting these broad objectives by the action             of Idaho's legislature, industry and universities, and by the                   implementation of this proposal.  The proposal includes three                   exciting aspects including a national mentor system promoting active            participation of researchers at other Idaho universities, and a                 mini-grant program to identify and support new faculty and ideas for            Idaho's development program.",
