 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research                 project between Dr. Kenneth Stevenson of Purdue University and                  Dr. Otto Horvath of Veszprem University is to better define the                 photophysics and photochemistry of halocuprates through continuous              photolysis and time-resolved studies of transient absorbance and                luminescence research.  Results are expected to broaden fundamental             knowledge of the photochemistry of these copper (I) complexes having            CTTS (charge-transfer-to-solvent) absorption bands.  In particular,             the intent is to determine whether there are trends for all                     halocuprates, may the trends be assigned to both cationic and                   anionic complexes and do complexes also exhibit CTTS behavior.                                                                                                  This project in inorganic chemistry fulfills the program objective of           advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the               United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and           pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                  competence.",
