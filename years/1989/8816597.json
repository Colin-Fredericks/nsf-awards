 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Prof. Chang-Lin Tien of the University of                California, Irvine, to collaborate with Prof. Kunio Hijikata of the             Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, and other Japanese researchers            over a period of two years.  They will investigate fundamental                  processes and mechanisms influencing the passive control of the                 performance of devices, such as heat pipes, which operate on the                basis of counter-current, two-phase reflux condensation.  Such                  passive control may be achieved by addition of a second component to            the heat-pipe working fluid; this component might be a noncondensable           gas or a binary mixture of working fluids to control the condensation.                                                                                          The heat and mass transfer mechanisms which control gas distribution,           and hence overall performance of the heat-pipe system, will be                  investigated both analytically and experimentally.  The purpose of              this research is to enhance our basic understanding of the phenomena            which control the performance of heat pipes and similar mechanisms.             Adequate understanding of these phenomena could stimulate the use of            heat pipes, which has been limited even though they offer considerable          advantages over other heat-transfer methods in many applications. To            achieve this objective the U.S. researcher will analyze the heat-trans-         fer performance of heat pipes with noncondensable gases.  Heat                  transfer with binary vapor mixtures will be investigated experimentally         by the Japanese collaborator.  By comparing the analytical and                  experimental results, the investigators will jointly determine                  the most effective combination of working fluids.  This research thus           utilizes the complementary analytical and experimental skills of the            U.S. and Japanese investigators.",
