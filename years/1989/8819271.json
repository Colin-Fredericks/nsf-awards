 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most free-swimming microorganisms swim in helices.  Recent                      mathematical analyses in this laboratory demonstrate that (1)                   microorganisms that swim in helices rotate their bodies as they                 move forward, (2) the rotational and translational velocities                   determine the radius and pitch of the helix, (3) changes in the                 rotational velocity change the direction of the axis of the helix               (the net direction of motion), and (4) a microorganism can orient               to a stimulus gradient by changing its rotational velocity.                     These investigators have developed a working prototype of a                     device that tracks the motion of microorganisms in three                        dimensions.  The goals of this project are to refine this device                and the techniques of data analysis required to track                           microorganisms accurately and precisely.  The motions of                        spermatozoa and a flagellate will be tracked to test (1) whether                they change their rate of rotation when stimulated, and (2) if                  the resulting change of direction is sufficient to orient the                   organism to a stimulus gradient.                                                                                                                                The results of this research may reveal a previously unknown                    mechanism by which free-swimming microorganisms orient their                    direction of motion, i.e., by changing their rate of rotation.",
