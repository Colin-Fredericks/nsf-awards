 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project  to carry out trace element and isotopic                 analyses on samples from the East Pacific Rise at 9\u001a 16' to 9\u001a                  40' N and 13\u001a 30' to 15\u001a N that have been obtained by dredging on               a fine scale. The objectives are to investigate trace element and               isotopic heterogeneity among lavas from a single magma chamber,                 to study nature of ridge segmentation and its controls on fine                  scale geochemistry, examine temporal variability and test                       hypothesis the local Pb-Pb correlations are isochrons recording                 the age of local mantle heterogeneity.                                          %%%                                                                                  One of the most interesting results of geochemical                         measurements on rocks dredged from the sea floor in recent years                has been fine scale variations of composition along the axis of                 mid-ocean ridges where the rocks are formed.  These compositional               variations appear to be related to tectonic segmentation of the                 ocean ridge axes themselves, but the details are not well                       understood.  This project, being carried out by an established                  geochemist (White) and a bright young geochemist (Castillo), who                was engaged in the initial collection on the sample set, on a                   suite of rocks from an area where much geophysical data exists,                 should yield significant insight into the relationship between                  tectonic and magmatic segmentation of ridge crests.",
