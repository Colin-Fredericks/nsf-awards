 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal examines the effects of prior beliefs and                         variations in information acquisition behavior as keys to                       understanding risk perceptions among english- and spanish-                      speaking farm workers in California.  The project addresses                     an important general concern in risk communication, which is                    that individual and group differences have largely been left                    unaddressed by current models of risk perception.  As a                         result, little is known about the contribution of cultural                      background, prior belief structures, or the consistency                         between risk messages and prior beliefs to the effectiveness                    of risk communication strategies.  These topics are addressed                   in this project using a model of risk perceptions that                          extends the current psychological paradigm by incorporating                     additional cultural and behavioral concerns.  This model then                   will be tested using a series of field experiments that will                    explore individual differences in risk judgments not                            associated with demographic characteristics.  Pre-tests of                      several of the experimentals already have been run, leading                     to refinements in the hypotheses as well as data of interest                    on its own merit.  The results of the study will include                        both additions to general risk management decision making,                      leading to improvements in the development of risk                              communication strategies, and additions to specific knowledge                   concerning the risk perceptions of farm workers and their                       understanding of pesticide hazards.",
