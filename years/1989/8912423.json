 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central theme of this mathematical science research                    project group is approximation theory.  Problems will be selected               from areas such as differential equations, interpolation of                     operators, orthogonal polynomials and special functions.                             General areas of research include potential theoretic                      methods in approximation theory which has already provided the                  necessary tools for the resolution of two major conjectures in                  approximation theory.  A second project concerns multivariate                   special functions including the evaluation of multivariate beta                 and q-beta type integrals and finding constant terms in Macdonald               type identities.  Asymptotic expansions, integral                               representations and generating functions of multivariate analogs                of the classical orthogonal polynomials will be studied.  Other                 work will focus on the behavior of best and near best                           approximants on compact plane sets.  Specifically, efforts will                 be made to understand the sets where nearest point polynomials                  actually achieve the minimal distance (in the uniform norm.)                         Orthogonal polynomials play a key role in the spectral                     theory of second order difference and differential equations.                   This research will investigate the general fourth order                         equations.  Explicit solutions and the computation of the                       spectral measure will be primary goals.  A related line of                      investigation will consider the nature of roots of polynomials                  orthogonal with respect to absolutely continuous measures in                    cases where Markov's theorem does not apply.",
