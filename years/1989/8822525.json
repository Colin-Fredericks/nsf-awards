Moffatt,                     Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics,                      University of Cambridge, England.  During a one year research visit             at Cambridge, Dr. Loper will study the structure and dynamics of                the Earth's interior, including the structure of core motions                   driven by compositional buoyancy, dynamo action of fluid motions                and fundamental studies of partially solidified systems.                                                                                                        The past decade has seen significant advances in our understanding              of the structure and dynamics of the Earth's deep interior,                     brought about by the application of physical principles and                     mathematical analysis.  Dr. Loper has carried out previous work on              the nature of the dynamo energy supply and the structure of the D\"              layer at the base of the mantle.  During the proposed visit, these              topics will be extended in several directions.  In particular, he               will investigate specific motion fields in the Earth's outer core               which may sustain the geodynamo.  Dr. Moffat and his colleagues at              Cambridge have significant expertise in this area of research.  Dr.             Loper is an applied mathematician, who has become an expert                     theoretical geophysicist through his research on dynamical and                  thermodynamical properties of the core and mantle of the Earth.",
