 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation by eight                      U.S. scientists in a binational conference on molecular                         mechanisms underlying neural response to damage.  The meeting                   is to be held at the National Institute of Mental Health and                    Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) in Bangalore, India.  It is                            co-organized by Dr. B.S. Sridhara Rama Rao, Head,                               Neurochemistry Department, Dr. G.N. Narayana Reddy, Director                    of NIMHANS, and Dr. Stephen Bondy of the University of                          California, Irvine.  The focus will be on the molecular and                     cellular mechanisms underlying adaptive and regenerative                        events within the nervous system following physical or                          chemical damage.  Effort will be made to integrate the                          specific presentations, by means of discussions and                             workshops, to make a synthesis of recent advances, to enhance                   the focus of definition of the molecular and cellular basis                     of neural repair mechanisms and to pinpoint precise areas for                   future research and especially joint research.                                                                                                                  Scope:  This is the third in a series of Indo-U.S.                              neuroscience meetings held over the last five years, aimed at                   exchanges of information and discussions on recent advances                     in fundamental, mechanistic neurobiology.  The theme of this                    meeting was recommended by the advisory panel of the previous                   meeting held in April 1987 in New Delhi.  The U.S. and Indian                   organizers are very well suited to handle such a joint                          meeting.  It is expected that significant exchanges of                          information will take place and that potentially good                           research collaboration would result.",
