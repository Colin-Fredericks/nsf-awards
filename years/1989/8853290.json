 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of sophisticated yet inexpensive integrated                     circuits and the associated development of microprocessors have                 made it possible to find feasible solutions to complex problems in              multidimensional signal processing using state-of-the-art                       microcomputers with specifically designed peripherals.  Senior                  undergraduate laboratory projects will be developed based on such               microcomputers equipped with application oriented hardware and                  software for signal processing 1-D and 2-D.  Twenty sets of                     state-of-the-art, compatible microcomputers and peripherals such                as video digitizers, image acquisition and display units,                       motherboard packages including development system for DSP systems               that allow 1-D signal processing and real-time parameter                        modification will be acquired.  This laboratory program will                    enable senior students to have hands-on experience in various                   applications of digital signal processing, image analysis and                   computer vision to complement multidimensional signal processing                courses and project laboratories.  Such practical experience will               provide the students with a better background for future work in                solving present problems in multidimensional signal processing                  ranging from speech synthesizers to automated image matching and                analysis.",
