 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.                                                                                                                                              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will help the Department of Chemistry at Harvard University to                  acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer.   Among the areas of                     chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are                  the following:                                                                                                                                                  1) Organic synthesis of oligo-  and polysaccharides using                          enzymes as catalysts                                                         2) Synthetic, bio-organic, and medicinal chemistry                              3) Discovery and development of new organic and organometallic                     reactions and associated synthesis methodology                               4) The design of small molecule enzyme mimics                                   5) Conformational analysis of C-glycosides and glycosides                       6) Natural product structure elucidation by the methods of NMR                     and organic synthesis                                                        7) Structure elucidation of complex synthetic intermediates.",
