 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work to be done under this grant is aimed at                                electrochemically producing alcohols at ambient temperature from                carbon dioxide.  The alcohols, such as methanol can be used as                  fuel or as chemical feedstocks.  The primary drawback to                        economical electrochemical reduction of CO2 has been low                        efficiencies.  The technology to be investigated would increase                 this efficiency and make the process economically viable.                                                                                                       Specifically, work will be directed towards achieving both high                 Faradaic efficiencies and current densities for the                             electrochemical reduction of CO2 is aqueous electrolyte to                      alcohols.  The electrocatalysis strategy will involve providing                 distinct sites on the electrode surface for electrochemically                   generating chemisorbed carbon dioxide (at either FeRhO3, LaRhO3,                LaNiO3 or LaCoO3 sites).  This will be achieved by                              electrochemically in situ depositing copper from the electrolytic               cell catholyte onto the electronically conducting metal oxide                   perovskite.  Mechanistic insight will be obtained on the                        synergistic role of this electrocatalysis approach for enhancing                CO2 reduction kinetics to give the desired condensed species                    (alcohols).",
