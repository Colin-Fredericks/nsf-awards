During the first week, presentations will               be made by scientists at the National Center for Supercomputing                 Applications (NCSA), faculty from the University of Illinois and                Parkland College, and local business persons whose companies are                built around computer applications.  The students will (1) learn                about how the Center has been helping may scientific fields with                Cray Supercomputers, (2) learn about expanding fields such as                   computer simulations and visualizations, artificial intelligence                and algorithm development, (3) learn how mathematicians,                        physicists, astronomers, astrophysicists, chemists and engineers                are using scientific workstations such as those from Sun and                    Apollo, (4) see demonstrations and have hands-on experience with                a variety of computers.                                                                                                                                         During the last two weeks, the Program will provide student                     assistantships.  Each student will be matched with a faculty                    preceptor whose expertise is a field of interest to the student.                The pair will devise a project utilizing computational resources                at Parkland College and complete it in the two week period.",
