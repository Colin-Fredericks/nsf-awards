 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop a more robust process               model of plan recognition without the restrictive assumptions of                previous systems.  In order to effectively engage in a                          cooperative dialogue, a natural language system must be able to                 infer a user's plan recognition have made several restrictive                   assumptions that prevent them from handling naturally occurring                 dialogues.  These assumptions include:  1) a user cannot intend                 that the system recognize his/her goal unless it is the only goal               that can account for the current dialogue in the given situation,               and 2) the model inferred by the system is always in total                      agreement with the task related plan under construction by the                  user.  This project will investigate a more robust model of plan                recognition without these unrealistic assumptions and which                     therefore will be able to handle dialogues that are less than                   ideal.  Our approach will be to study hjow evidential reasoning                 techniques can be used to facilitate rational and natural                       recognition of user intention in the presence of multiple                       alternatives and how techniques for handling ill formed input can               be applied to the problem of recognizing and recovering from                    errors in the system's model of the user's plan.",
