 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Dietz to continue his study of the golden                lion marmoset (Leontopithecus rosalia).  This marmoset, which is                an endangered species, is confined to isolated fragments of                     forest in a narrow strip along the southeast coast of Brazil.                   The Poco das Antas Reserve contains a number of these marmoset                  troops.  Dietz and his team will monitor the composition,                       reproduction and size, quality and overlap of territories for                   between 20 and 30 groups.                                                                                                                                       Marmosets and tamarins are of particular interest to biologists                 because they have several distinct kinds of social groupings.                   Some troops are monogamous; other are centered about a male                     accompanied by several females; others are organized around a                   focal female accompanied by several males.  Dr. Dietz is                        examining this variability in order to determine its cause.  He                 will also attempts to determine the relative reproductive fitness               for individuals in each type of group.  His prediction is that                  differences in environmental quality lead to different kinds of                 group composition, and that monogamy is a response to poor                      resource quality.  This research will test that idea.                                                                                                           This research is important for two reasons.  First, the golden                  lion marmoset is an endangered species, and efforts are underway                to breed them in several zoological parks.  The data collected by               Dr. Dietz will aid in this goal.  Second, different species of                  primates exhibit different kinds of social organization and the                 reasons for these differences are not clear.  Because these                     animals have such a wide range of social behavior within a single               species, they offer a particularly valuable opportunity to                      understand this issue.",
