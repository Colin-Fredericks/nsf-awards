 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of social interaction, the observation of behavior in its             social context, is a central endeavor of developmental, personality and         social psychologists.  Accordingly, this project establishes a \"Social          Interaction Laboratory\" for undergraduate instruction in a range of             seven courses from Introductory Psychology to upper-level research              seminars.  Funds support the purchase of a) videotape equipment to              allow students to make permanent records of interaction in laboratory           or natural settings, b) an integrated video/computer system for on-line         coding of interaction data, and c) software for the analysis of                 interaction data. This laboratory enhances the current curriculum, and          in some cases allows for the first time, students to observe, be                trained, and actively participate in the study of human social                  interaction.  Applications include studies of mother-infant                     interaction, dominance hierarchies in children's play, the dynamics of          gender in small group discussions, analyses of political debates, and a         number of other projects.                                                                                                                                       The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of               funds.",
