 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the history of science, there occurs on occasion a case of a                 prescient scientist who examines all the evidence and presents a                theory which is rejected in his or her own life-time, only thave                this theory confirmed at some later point.  Alfred Wegener,                     (1880-1930), is perhaps the paradigm example of such a scientist                for the 20th century.  He is best known for his theory of                       continental drift, confirmed in the 1960's with the NSF-supported               ocean-margin drilling program.  When Wegener proposed his theory,               however, it was long before the results of these expeditions were               available.  Perhaps as important, though, for the failure of the                Wegener theory, was the fact that the geologists of his time                    could see no feasible mechanism for accommodating the drift of                  the continents--it took the development of plate tectonics along                with the new evidence of the drilling expedition to present most                scientists with convincing arguments in favor of continental                    drift.  Wegener is important, however, even beyond his work on                  this \"premature\" theory.  He also made fundamental contributions                to meteorology (cloud physics, theory of precipitation),                        geophysics (atmospheric optics, solid earth geophysics),                        paleoclimatology (paleo-equator and paleo-pole fixing by climate                zonation), lunar geology (theory of impact craters), and  polar                 exploration and geology.  Despite these contributions, there has                been no significant scholarly study of Wegener's life and work in               English.  Professor Greene aims to produce such a study.  He will               use the support from this grant to examine archives and museums                 containing papers, letters, photographs, expedition diaries,                    notebooks and equipment used by Wegener.  These materials are in                Denmark, Greenland, West Germany and Austria.",
