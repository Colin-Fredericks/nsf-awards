 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nature of the ground state of a two-dimensional electron                    system (2DES) subjected to an intense magnetic field has                        attracted a great deal of research, both experimental and                       theoretical.  As a result of a systematic effort to optimize the                design and the growth process they have developed GaAs/GaAlAs                   heterostructures containing very high-mobility, low-density 2DES                with extremely low disorder.  The realization of high-quality                   2DES with low electron concentration is of particular interest                  because they provide the means to achieve and study fundamental                 properties of 2DES in a new regime of extreme magnetic quantum                  limit in available magnetic fields.  Magnetotransport, activated                transport and nonlinear transport measurements will be used to                  investigate collective states of 2DES - the Fractional Quantum                  Hall states and quantum Wigner crystal - and the magnetic-field-                induced localization in 2DES.  Radiofrequency magnetospectroscopy               will be used to study collective excitations in these states.                   Electron beam microlitography will be used to fabricate                         nanostructures from the same state-of-the-art materials.  The                   above described experimental techniques will be employed to study               collective states of 2DES in restricted geometry (down to 200A).",
