 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues the past research on domain decomposition                methods for elliptic partial differential equations.  These are                 iterative methods for solving large linear or nonlinear systems of              algebraic equations which arise when elliptic problems are discretized          by finite elements or finite differences, and they offer very                   considerable promise for efficient parallel solution.  The methods              considered in this investigation can be regarded as divide and conquer          algorithms.  In each step of an iteration, the original discrete                elliptic problem is solved on the subregions into which the original            region has been subdivided.  The interaction between the different              parts of the region is handled by transferring data of a suitable type          across the interfaces which are created by the subdivision.  In                 addition to the local problems, some global, coarse problem must be             incorporated into the preconditioner in order to obtain a fast rate of          convergence in the case of many subregions, the case of primary                 interest in parallel computing.                                                                                                                                 Further work will be carried out to develop a general framework for the         study of domain decomposition methods both those which use overlapping          subregions and those which do not.  There are two main aims of this             research: (1) To develop new and improved methods and to extend them to         the nonconforming case, mixed finite element models, the finite volume          case, etc. (2) To develop tools and experience which will make it               possible to provide specific recommendations for the solution of                important problems of elasticity, fluid dynamics, problems with widely          varying values of the coefficients, etc.",
