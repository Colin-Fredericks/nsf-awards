 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are several fish with small electric organs, called weakly                electric fish, that use their own electrical signal for                         \"electrolocation\" much as a bat or dolphin uses emitted sound                   (sonar) for echolocation of objects.  Many of these fish produce                an ongoing electrical waveform of nearly constant frequency to                  produce an electrical field around the fish, and special                        electroreceptors in the skin all over the body detect distortions               in this field when objects are nearby.  A reflex called the                     \"jamming avoidance response\" also is used by some fish to alter                 their own frequency if there is another signal in the water at                  close to the same frequency, that otherwise would mask out the                  fish's own signal.  The neural circuits for parts of this                       detection system are now fairly well known, and a particular area               of interest is part of the midbrain called the torus                            semicircularis.                                                                                                                                                 This project will investigate how neurons in the different layers               of the torus respond to spatial and temporal changes in signal                  amplitude and phase, and how those responses are affected in the                presence of jamming signals.  Extracellular and intracellular                   recording will be used, along with labelling physiologically                    characterized neurons with dye to identify their location and                   connections.  Responses will be compared between species with and               without the jamming avoidance response, to identify which neural                elements of the sensory-to- motor pathway are involved in that                  stereotyped behavior.  This study exploits the well-described                   circuitry for electrosensory detection and its link to some                     highly quantifiable behaviors.                                                                                                                                  Results from this novel approach will be valuable to sensory                    neuroscience in general, because they address problems of signal                detection in noise, of motion detection and its discrimination                  from self-movement, and the functional role of layers in brain                  structure.",
