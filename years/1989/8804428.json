The instrument will be                 installed and operated by Department of Geological Sciences at                  the University of Michigan.                                                          Research in progress and planned in the Department of                      Geological Sciences requires many thousands of stable isotope                   analyses of natural and synthetic materials per year. Emphasis                  has been, and will continue to be, placed on microsampling                      techniques including the use of laser ablation methods. Research                projects for which the spectrometer is needed include: 1) the                   isotope geochemistry of alunite, a mineral found in association                 with precious metal deposits, 2) oxygen isotope fractionation                   during the bacterial synthesis of apatite, useful for studies in                paleothermometry of the oceans, 3) a study of the stable isotope                composition of clay minerals at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary                (an enrichment factor in the heavy oxygen-18 isotope could point                to a glassy precursor for the clay which, in turn, would be                     related to the major bolide impact that has been hypothesized as                the cause of the mysterious mass extinctions of living forms that               occurred at the time).//",
