The first is to identify                 mechanisms that may be crucial in determining the rate of                       spread of infectious diseases and to make initial evaluations                   of the relative value of possible intervention strategies.  The                 emphasis will be on the dynamics of HIV (Human                                  Immuno-Deficiency Virus, the etiological agent for AIDS).  The                  second objective is to create the basis for a solid long-term                   research program in mathematical epidemiology at the population                 level, on social dynamics, and on their connections to the                      field of theoretical population biology.                                             This project's principal goal is to begin a systematic                     study of the dynamics of social interactions and their role in                  the dynamics of sexually-transmitted and communicable diseases.                  Castillo-Chavez will use a phenomenological framework to                       describe human mixing patterns, and deterministic mathematical                  models (involving single or interacting populations) will be                    developed to determine the role of social mixing, variable                      infectivity, long periods of infectiousness and, co-factors in                  the dynamics of HIV.  Secondary goals include upgrading of the                  mathematical methodology in the areas of mathematical                           epidemiology and population dynamics by systematically                          integrating different types of social mixing and analyzing                      their effect on the transmission of other infectious diseases.",
