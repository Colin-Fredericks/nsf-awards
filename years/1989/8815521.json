 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program supports research of                 Dr. Harry Walborsky, Florida State University, which is aimed                   at two areas of research in structural and mechanistic organic                  chemistry.  The first investigation will provide information                    about the detailed pathway of the reaction of alkyllithiums                     with halogenated, saturated and unsaturated organic compounds.                  The second is aimed at a better understanding of methods for                    determing the structure of acyclic dienes.                                                                                                                      This project will investigate carbenoids, intermediates which                   possess a metal and a halogen on the same carbon atom.  These                   intermediates may collapse to form carbenes or they may undergo                 ambiphilic reactions.  The effect of variation in (1) metal                     (2) halogen  and (3) nucleophile is to be studied.  Since in                    the latter case, the metalating agent also serves as the                        nucleophile in a second step, mixed organolithiums will be                      used.  A second part of the study will investigate chiroptical                  properties of acyclic dienes.  For example, the 5-X- and                        5-X-7-Y-adamantylideneacetaldehyde (and adamantylidenepropene)                  will be studied since the adamantyl system has a built-in                       reference which enables direct comparison of the effect of                      equatorial substituents X vs. Y on the pi-pi-star Cotton                        effects.  The data so derived should allow  configurational and                 conformational assignments to be made in otherwise undefined                    systems.",
