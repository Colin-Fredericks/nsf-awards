 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new technique is offered that combines information on food               supply, feeding rates and vegetative cover to predict the feeding               sites of several sparrow species.  New research will determine to               what extent this technique which has been successful on a very                  local scale, can be used to predict the abundance andhabitat                    distributions of these same species in a complex mosaic of many                 habitats.  An \"iso-preference\" technique will be employed at the                local scale of measure habitat preferences quantitatively and to                predict how the distribution of several species will change as a                function of food depletion and habitat manipulations.  The iso-                 preference technique ranks habitats according to preference of                  each species based on food and cover characteristics of the                     habitats.  To predict patterns of habitat utilization,                          information on habitat preference and habitat availability must                 be combined.  Therefore, it is proposed to create a mosiac of                   experimental habitats in replicate old-field landscapes.  The                   food and cover characteristics of both the experimental habitats                and the old-field matrix surrounding them will be manipulated.                  Since limitations of this approach of \"scaling up\" from the local               to the landscape scale are recognized, simultaneous \"scaling                    down\" will be done by initiating a study in larger, more natural                landscapes.  The scaling down will determine how characteristics                of the matrix in which a study site is embedded influence the                   abundance and distribution of sparrow species on the focal study                site.  With this hierarchial approach, the extent to which                      variation in sparrow abundance and community structure is                       controlled in the resources on the study sites versus differences               in the characteristics of the surrounding landscapes will be                    determined.",
