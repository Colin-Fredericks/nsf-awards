This meeting,          which is held every second year, will bring together researchers in             the areas of electronics and optoelectronics to discuss the physics             and technology of picosecond solid state devices and their                      applications to ultrafast measurement techniques.  The selected topic           areas include ultrafast optoelectronic devices, semiconductor device            physics, ultra-wideband electronic devices, superconducting- and                cryoelectronics, device characterization and fabrication technology,            and highspeed circuits and signal processing.  This is an important             area of current technology, and there will be a strong contingent of            outstanding U.S. and international researchers present at the meeting.",
