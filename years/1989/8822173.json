 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent trends in the chemical industry have resulted in a move away             from the production of large amounts of commodity chemicals toward              more emphasis on low-volume speciality and high-value-added products.           Such materials are often produced in batch plants which provide the             needed flexibility for changing products, uncertain market conditions,          variable feedstock materials, etc. and for complex synthesis requiring          long residence times.  Scheduling such manufacturing facilities are             complex procedures because most batch plants produce multiple products          in a single facility, and the resources of this facility, such as the           equipment, the manpower, the utilities and the time, etc. are shared            among the products.  This project will concentrate on developing                computer-aided methodology for scheduling a general batch plant with            arbitrary constraints on its shared resources.                                                                                                                  The PI's method of approach is to develop a schedule that accounts for          the allocation of all limited resources (vessels, manpower, utilities,          etc.) and then incorporate costs associated with late penalties,                inventory, change-over, set-up and clean-up.  The method is viable in           a dynamic sense because the assumed initial state is the current                operating state which thus also automatically accounts for                      rescheduling in the event of equipment failure, changes in feed, etc.           He thus established a feasible schedule and make evolutionary changes           to improve it based on                                                          heuristics.  Commercial use of such methodology should result in                higher personnel productivity, resource (time,  equipment, labor,               energy, etc.) utilization levels, lower production costs, and                   economically more profitable batch plants.",
