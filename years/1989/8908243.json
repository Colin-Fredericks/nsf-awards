 "awd_abstract_narration": "Energy conservation is achieved by reducing the inertia or                      resistance to acceleration of the moveable parts, particularly                  those parts that are required to change velocity rapidly.  One                  way to minimize inertia is the redistribution of mass of an                     oscillating component such that the center of mass is closer to                 the pivot.  This may be unimportant for parts that move slowly,                 but is highly significant for parts that must change velocity                   rapidly.  Perhaps the finest natural example of this structural                 design is that of the avian wing.  Surprisingly, very few                       experimental investigations have focused on the internal control                and biomechanics of this highly derived and evolutionarily                      successful locomotor system.  And despite variations in flight                  styles it appears that selection pressures act to retain the                    basic design of the avian forelimb among the various species.                   This research project will explore specific evolutionary                        adaptations responsible for the success of the avian locomotor                  system.  The interpretation of the results will be viewed with                  the understanding that historical tetrapod limb design imposed                  constraints on forelimb flight mechanics while pressures of                     physiological optimization drive the existing system toward                     maximum efficiency.",
