 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this work is to identify the protein domain that         allows vacuolar proteins to be targeted to the vacuoles of plant cells,         and to identify the receptor(s) with which they interact.  The work will        concentrate on three vacuolar proteins present in bean (Phaseolus               vulgaris) seeds, phytohemagglutinin, phaseolin, and cx-amylase inhibitor        and will use two different transgenic systems, the yeast Saccharomyces          cerevisiae and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum).  In addition, we will               attempt to transform bean with Agrobacterium tumefaciens to be in a             position to study transport to the vacuole.  The work will utilize              translational fusions between portions of these three proteins and the          yeast invertase gene (a secreted protein) to delineate the targeting            domain.  Mutagenesis will be used together with computer-based sequence         comparisons to identify the critical residues.  Identification of the           receptor will rely on affinity studies (either columns or gel/blot              binding procedures) using the targeting domains of these proteins and           solubilized membrane fractions.  Once the receptor has been isolated, we        will attempt to clone the gene and carry out immunocytochemical work to         study its subcellular distribution.                                                                                                                             This project will provide important basic information relevant to our           understanding of how cellular proteins get to their specific functional         sites within the cell.  It will also provide important information              concerning how seed storage proteins get to the sites of storage within         the cell, which is of practical value in terms of genetic engineering of        nutritionally \"improved\" seeds and grains.",
