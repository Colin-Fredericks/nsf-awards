 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drosophila have played a central role in the study of                      genetics, development, and evolution.  Dr. Jaenike's research                   focuses on mushroom  feeding species of Drosophila which are                    ideally suited to studies of the ecology and behavior of these                  insects.  A primary concern of the proposed research will be with               ecological interactions between these Drosophila and a species of               nematode that parasitizes them.  Because as many as 50% of these                flies are parasitized at any time and because infected flies are                seriously debilitated in terms of fertility, these nematodes have               a substantial impact on populations of Drosophila.  A series of                 field and laboratory studies will be used to investigate how                    nematodes affect survival, mating success, and competitive                      interactions of their Drosophila  hosts.  How ecological factors,               such as ambient temperature, mushroom species, and Drosophila                   population densities, affect frequencies of parasites will also                 be examined.  This research will provide basic information on the               ecology of host-parasite interactions.  In additions, because                   nematodes have the potential to be important agents for                         biological control of insects, this work could shed light on how                best to carry out such control programs.                                             Dr. Jaenike also has plans to study chromosomes which he has               discovered to affect sex ratio in a species of Drosophila.                      Because \"sex ratio\" males sire only daughters, these chromosomes                are expected in theory to increase in frequency and eventually                  cause population extinction.  In reality, they do not do so.  Dr.               Jaenike will study ecological factors, including competitive                    ability and susceptibility to nematode parasitism, that may                     prevent the spread of these chromosomes.  This research will                    provide insight on how selection at one level (chromosomes within               individuals) is counteracted by selection at another level                      (individuals within populations).",
