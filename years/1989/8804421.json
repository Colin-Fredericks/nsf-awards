 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Hille will continue his study of the molybdenum hydroxylase,                xanthine oxidase.  He will fully characterize the enzyme from a                 physical stand point with particular regard to features likely to               be relevant to catalysis.  For a variety of reasons, xanthine                   oxidase has become the prototypical molybdenum hydroxylase, a                   small but important class of metalloproteins.  Physicochemical                  studies of the enzyme lie at the forefront of understanding                     molybdenum enzymes and will provide important insight into the                  general features of biological electron transfer processes.                                                                                                     Molybdenum hydroxylases are members of a small but extremely                    important class of enzymes that are responsible for the                         incorporation of oxygen into a variety of organic and inorganic                 compounds.  They are not well understood in comparison to other                 hydroxylating systems.  This is due in large part to the absence                of experimental probes for molybdenum centers, which lack the                   convenient spectrophotometric properties exhibited by other                     oxidation - reduction centers.  Nevertheless, the presently                     available information regarding the mechanism of action of the                  molybdenum hydroxylase suggests several fascinating aspects of                  these enzymes.",
