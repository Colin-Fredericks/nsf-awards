 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emphasis on the interplay between partial differential                     equations and the theory of several complex variables will be the               main theme of this mathematical research project.  Work will be                 done on the study of regularity and existence of solutions of                   differential equations which reflect the boundary behavior of                   holomorphic mappings, on local and global embedding theorems for                Cauchy-Riemann manifolds, studies of holomorphic functions with                 smooth boundary values and on the structure of hypersurfaces in                 hyperbolic space.  This work, much of it continuing, leads to the               study of geometrical objects such as local and global invariants                of manifolds with boundary, foliations by complex varieties and                 envelopes of holomorphy.                                                             The most pressing problem at this time is that of obtaining                Holder estimates for solutions of the d-bar Neumann problem for                 weakly pseudoconvex domains of finite type and the corresponding                estimates for the corresponding operator on CR manifolds.  A                    major step was taken in this direction recently when the                        estimates were established in two complex dimensions.  The                      generalization to higher dimensions has received considerable                   attention, but no breakthrough has yet appeared.  Work will                     proceed by first considering domains in three or more dimensions                whose Levi form has at most one degenerate eigenvalue and then                  moving to those where the form is diagonalizable.                                    Another line of investigation will pursue questions                        concerned with linear differential operators having simple and                  double characteristics. The object of this work is to determine                 conditions on overdetermined systems which imply that the                       operator is hypoelliptic.  The terminology means simply that the                solution of any inhomogeneous equation is at least as smooth as                 that of the inhomogeneous part of the equation.",
