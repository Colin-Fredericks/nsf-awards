 "awd_abstract_narration": "A comprehensive fundamental biochemical engineering study is being              undertaken to develop a distributed parameter system working model,             which takes into consideration distributed equilibrium coefficients as          a function of system's and operational variables, for immuno-affinity           purification.  The biochemical and immuno-chemical reaction system as           well as the purification process will be studied systematically to              develop a practical systems model.  For the development of this model           the systems to be used are:  (1) immuno-affinity purification of human          plasma Protein C, and (2) purification of monoclonal antibodies using           Protein A affinity chromatography.  The benefits and impact of the              anticipated research results will be:  (1) The knowledge base for the           development of large-scale immuno-affinity process design and                   optimization for the purification of blood proteins will be broadened           and advanced, (2) A rational strategy will evolve by which large-scale          immuno-affinity purification processes can be designed and optimized            based on predictive modeling and the simulation of system performance.                                                                                          This study should provide a greater insight into the microscopic                phenomena and also a better understanding of macroscopic phenomena              related to the optimal design and operational strategy for large scale          immuno-affinity purification systems.  Both experimental and                    theoretical studies will be carried out to                                      establish a knowledge base and to develope an optimal design and                operational strategy through mathematical modeling and                          experimental verification.  Protein C is a protein whose                        functions in blood include both blocking the blood coagulation                  pathways and dissolution of clots in animal, thus maintaining                   hemostasis in the human body.  Lack of this protein causes                      complicated blood clotting related symptoms, such as                            thromboembolism, stroke, or even sudden death.",
