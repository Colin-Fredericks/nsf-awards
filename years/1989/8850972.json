A total of 60 high-school teachers will participate over                 the three years. They will receive instruction in recent                        developments in environmental sustainability, agroecological                    practices and allelopathic control methods. They will also be                   shown how to integrate economic, ethical and political factors                  pertaining to environmental use into their curricula. Five                      mornings per week will be devoted to discussion and classroom                   activities, and the afternoons will be occupied with laboratory                 and fieldwork. The teachers will be divided into groups and each                group will be expected to modify one laboratory exercise per week               to make it applicable to their high school courses. A leadership                component will be included, in which teachers who have had a                    previous molecular biology experience will be grouped with those                who have not. The workshop is part  of a comprehensive program to               help teachers keep abreast of the developments in science, to                   provide them with a support system for course and curriculum                    enhancement, and to further communication within and among the                  various school constituencies.                                                                                                                                  An amount equivalent to 34.7% of the NSF award is being                         contributed by Michigan State University and other sources as                   cost sharing.",
