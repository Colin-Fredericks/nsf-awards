 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently within evolutionary biology much controversy                     surrounds the study of inbreeding.  The controversy address the                 role of inbreeding or, conversely, its avoidance in the                         evolution of plant and animal social systems.  Proponents of one                extreme assume the disadvantages of inbreeding (inbreeding                      depression resulting, for example, from exposure of deleterious                 recessive alleles) categorically to be large and further that                   advantages in inbreeding are rare or non-existent.  Thus,                       selection is thought to favor individuals who outbreed.  On the                 other hand, proponents of the other extreme think of inbreeding                 as having such positive effects (inbreeding \"enhancement\"                       resulting from reduced genetic recombination thus potential                     increased genetic harmony) that any potentially detrimental ones                are negligible.  In this view, selective advantage is though to                 accrue to individuals who inbreed.                                                   This symposium will bring together leading scientists                      involved in theoretical and empirical research on inbreeding                    across taxa.  The symposium will facilitate exposure and review                 of the available data on inbreeding and outbreeding.  The                       symposium will help evaluate both extremes of the controversy,                  highlighting the valuable parts of each argument and discarding                 the fruitless.  In this way important questions surrounding                     inbreeding and outbreeding will be identified, focusing future                  research on them.",
