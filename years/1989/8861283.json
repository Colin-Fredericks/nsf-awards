 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emerging Digital Signal Processing (DSP) VLSI products are widening the         horizons of system designers.  Because of their compact size and low            cost, tightly-coupled single-board multiprocessor configurations are            now quite feasible.  This research examines the degree to which                 hardware can be minimized by judicious selection of an architecture             that lends itself to modern Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW)                   compilation techniques.  With the need to solve DSP problems in mind,           the architectural tradeoffs are being determined for a small number of          critical DSP routines involving FFT's, 2D filtering, and dynamic                programming algorithms.  Also, automatic instruction                            scheduling/compaction techniques are being related to the architectural         choices.  Ultimately, it is expected that the results generated will            highlight the strengths and weaknesses for some of the commercially-            available DSP chips.                                                            Reviewers awarded this very high scores of 16, 18 and 18.  All                  reviewers saw this as quality work stemming from innovative ideas to be         done by an excellent group.  There is high potential for a Phase II             project.  Success will lead to a meaningful advance in the theory and           practice of instruments that require signal processing circuit design.",
