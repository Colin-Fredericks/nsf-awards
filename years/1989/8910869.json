 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within all cells a complex array of fiber-like protein assemblies               form a scaffold for the support and organization of the cell and                its components; this scaffold is referred to as the cytoskeleton.               The cytoskeleton of cells of the brain is especially complex;                   each brain cell (neuron) is composed of two distinct regions, and               each of these regions has unique components which are partitioned               into that region alone.  While significant progress has been made               in recent years towards understanding the composition of the                    axonal cytoskeleton, factors governing its initial assembly, as                 well as the attainment of cytoskeletal stability, remain less                   well documented due to the inherent difficulties of studying                    these processes in the intact brain.                                                                                                                            To surmount these difficulties, a model system involving neurons                in cell culture has been developed for manipulating the formative               events in the brain that occur during development and maturation.               These cells multiply continuously in culture and thus provide a                 virtually unlimited source for experimentation.  Following                      defined chemical treatments, these cells cease multiplying and                  elaborate long axon-like processes that contain most if not all                 of the proteins comprising the axonal cytoskeleton of the brain.                Exploitation of this model system by both established and newly-                developed molecular biological, biochemical, immunological and                  electron microscopic analyses to examine the sequence of events                 accompanying the assembly of the axonal cytoskeleton will be                    investigated.  The results obtained from these analyses will                    elucidate events critical for mediating axonal outgrowth, and                   stabilization, required for orderly development and maintenance                 of the nervous system.",
