 "awd_abstract_narration": "Very recent advances in computer technology provide the power of                mainframe systems in relatively compact and inexpensive personal                computers.  Over the next decade this tremendous computing power will           become available in high schools throughout the country.  This new              technological resource will be harnessed as a teaching tool for specific        topics in math and science, focusing on random processes in nature and          their deep connection to concepts in probability and fractal geometry.          Such natural phenomena as the growth of snow flakes via random                  aggregation and the disordered geometric configurations of polymer              chains demonstrate that fundamentally random microscopic processes can          give rise to predictable macroscopic behaviors.  They also give rise to         random fractal structures of inherent interest and great beauty.                Because it is impossible to view the underlying processes directly,             computer simulation and visualization is an indispensable tool for              understanding and studying these phenomena.  In the process of \"doing           science\" with both hand-on experiments and computer simulations,                students will learn abstract mathematical concepts in a context which is        at once concrete and inherently motivating.  Futhermore, the techniques         they will employ will mirror in most respects those in current use by           researchers, thus forging an unprecedented link between this curriculum         and the professional worlds of science and mathematics.",
