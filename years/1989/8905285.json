 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal protein of the electron                      transport chain, is composed in mammals of thirteen subunits,                   three encoded by mitochondrial DNA and the remainder by                         nuclear DNA.  In addition to the fact that the function is                      unknown for all ten of the nuclear-encoded subunits, a second                   level of complexity has been introduced by the finding that                     at least three, probably more, and possibly even all of these                   nuclear subunits occur in more than one cellular form                           (isoforms).  We will (1) focus on two subunits of cytochrome                    c oxidase, VIIa and VIIc, that are present as isoforms in                       order to (a) isolate and characterize cDNAs for each isoform,                   and (b) determine the mechanism by which these isoforms arise                   by examining their transcripts and the organization of their                    coding regions in the genome; (2) seek insights into the role                   of these isoforms by examining the distribution of their                        transcripts in various adult bovine tissues, and in tissues                     taken from several different developmental stages; and (3)                      investigate the regulation of these and other cytochrome c                      oxidase subunits for which we have probes by observing their                    stoichiometry in cultured bovine cells, particularly after                      perturbation of the synthesis of specific subunits with                         antisense transcripts.                                                                                                                                          How a complex protein such as cytochrome c oxidase is                           correctly assembled is obscure.  Even more mysterious are the                   mechanisms involved in the synchronous regulation of gene                       expression, particularly when some are located on the nuclear                   genome and others on the organelle genome, so that the proper                   ration of subunits to be assembled results.  The results of                     this study will give us little more insight into that complex                   process.",
