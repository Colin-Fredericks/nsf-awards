 "awd_abstract_narration": "Attempts are being made to determine the mechanism by which                     frog virus 3 selectively blocks host cell translation.  To                      accomplish this it is planned to identify and isolate the                       FV3 virion-associated translational inhibitor, to determine                     the mechanism of FV3 mediated translational shut-off by                         identifying where in initiation the translational defect                        occurs, and to determine whether the 5' untranslated region                     of viral messages controls their translational efficiency.                                                                                                      During the past twenty years, the sequence of events and                        specific components involved in eukaryotes have been                            determined and the importance of translation control in gene                    expression has gained general accpetance.  However, despite                     advances in both areas, there remain significant gaps.  For                     example the precise roles for several eukaryotic initiation                     factors and function(s) of their various subunits is not                        known.  In light of this, it should be apparent that model                      systems, of which FV3 is one, will be most important in                         advancing our understanding of translation and translational                    control.  Dr. Chinchar is well qualified to carry out this                      research.",
