 "awd_abstract_narration": "Central to this teacher enhancement project is the trainng of teachers          in the scientific method of research in a zoo setting.  Classroom               teachers that have been working with the principal investigator have            expressed high interest and a need for upgrading of knowledge in course         discussions and course evaluations during l987.  Input from these               teacher educators, science educators, scientists, and zoo personnel was         used to construct an inservice plan.  The three-phase plan involves 20          elementary and middle school teachers (grades 4-7) in spring, summer and        fall workshops and seminars with follow-up evaluation by the project            directors.                                                                                                                                                      Ethology, the application of scientific methods to the study of behavior        and basic life science concepts in animal adaptation, animanl                   endangerment, and animal diversity of lifestyle will comprise the               science content used to develop curriculum projects in animal behavioral        research.                                                                                                                                                       State in more general terms the outcomes of this project will be in the         improvement of instruction and knowledge about life sciences and the use        of the scientific method of research.  This project has the potential to        impact on the staff development program of the schools in the area as           well as on the teacher preparation program at the University of                 Louisville.                                                                                                                                                     An amount equivalent to 62% of the NSF request has been contributed to          the total cost of the project by the University of Louisville, the              Louisville Zoo and the Jefferson County Public Schools.",
