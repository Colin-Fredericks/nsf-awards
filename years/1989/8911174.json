 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insect metamorphosis is a time during which the nervous system is               dramatically altered to allow the very different organism which                 emerges from the larva to behave in new ways appropriate to its                 new life situation.  These pronounced changes in behavior require               a striking reorganization of neuronal circuits and the properties               of individual cells.  Dr. Levine follows the changes in a                       mechanosensory reflex circuit that mediates a very different                    behavioral response at different life stages.  Using innovative                 state-of-the-art techniques, he examines the mechanisms by which                steroid and peptide hormones direct the formation of new synapses               and modifies important cellular events which are reflected in the               altered patterns of behavior.  Recent findings have led to the                  conclusion that the adult nervous system is not rigid since adult               neurons can undergo morphological changes.  Dr. Levine's findings               will enhance our understanding of the events underlying neuronal                plasticity.  Thus, his work holds promise of providing insights                 into how changes can occur in adult brains, especially with                     relationship to learning and memory and recovery of function.",
