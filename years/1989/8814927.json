 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professors Andrew Hanson of Michigan State              University (MSU) and David Rhodes of Purdue University in a                     research collaboration with Professor Claudia Lerma Ortiz of the                Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN) in Mexico City, Mexico and                 researchers at the Mexican International Maize and Wheat                        Improvement Center (CIMMYT).  The investigators intend to test the              hypothesis that betaine synthesis in grasses is necessary for                   adjustment of plant tissues to water stress, either as a result of              drought or salinity.  Betaine is synthesized and accumulated in                 grasses and chenopods (spinach and beets as well as many weeds)                 under salt or drought stress conditions.  In chenopods, the enzymes             of betaine synthesis have been identified and betaine seems to be               central to osmoregulation and stress adaptation.  Among grasses,                high betaine-accumulating capacity has been shown to be broadly                 correlated with adaptation to saline or dry conditions, but neither             the biosynthetic path nor the physiological function of betaine is              known.  The investigators intend to use maize in parallel studies               of a) betaine biosynthesis and b) the relation of betaine                       accumulation to overall osmoregulation in a grass.  The choice of               maize is dictated by two factors: 1) genetic variation for both                 betaine level and ability to osmoregulate is available in maize;                2) maize has relatively low salt- and drought tolerance which could             be associated with the low betaine levels found in this crop.                                                                                                   Work on betaine biosynthetic enzymes will be carried out at MSU and             at the IPN, with synthesis of labeled compounds and fast atom                   bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) analysis at Purdue                        University.  Work relating betaine accumulation to osmoregulation               will be conducted at INP in collaboration with researchers at                   CIMMYT.  The proposed work will increase our understanding of plant             acclimation to low-water situations, while at the same time it is               likely to provide a sensible pathway to further advances in the                 genetic engineering of high salt- and drought tolerant plants.",
