 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project provides partial support for eight                   U.S. scientists to participate in an advanced study institute                   (ASI) on energy optimization in manufacturing and material                      processing to be held at the Indian Institute of Technology                     (IIT), Madras, January 2-13, 1989.  Several scientists from                     Japan, UK, Switzerland and the USSR are also expected to                        participate.  Topics to be covered include casting, metal                       joining, metal forming, metal cutting, laser processing,                        electron beam processing and non-metal topics.  Research                        needs will be discussed and possible joint U.S.-Indian                          collaboration will be examined.  The Indian co-organizer of                     the ASI is Dr. L.S. Srinath, Director and Professor of                          Mechanical Engineering at IIT, Madras.                                                                                                                          Scope:  The U.S. P.I. is an active scientist in heat transfer                   research and in applications in industry.  The U.S.                             participants have solid background in the various topics of                     the ASI.  It is highly likely that the U.S. scientists and                      the Indian scientists will benefit considerably from the                        interaction during the institute and especially from                            participation by scientists from Europe and Japan, and that                     future cooperative research will result.  The publication of                    the ASI proceeding should be quite beneficial to those                          working in academic institutions and to industrial concerns.",
