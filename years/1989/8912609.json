The                  research plan will explore more fully the use of cobalt                         complexes for the protection of acetylene and diyne units.                      Results of  this phase will be applied to the synthesis of                      histrionicotoxins, a set of complex organic molecules.                          Knowledge from these experiments will provide rationales for                    broader studies of substituent and electronic influences on the                 pharmacology of histrionicotoxins which in turn will increase                   our understanding of neuromuscular disorders.                                                                                                                   This ambitious examination of complexation reactions for                        transition metals will significantly increase the research                      capability of a predominantly minority institution.  The                        principal investigator has excellent synthesis training and                     has published in refereed journals.  Faculty and students                       working on this project will have their skills in chemical                      synthesis measurably improved.",
