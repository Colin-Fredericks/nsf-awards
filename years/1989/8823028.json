 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to obtain petrologic, major and trace                    element abundances, and radioisotopic data for lavas of varying                 age from diverse localities in the eastern Indian Ocean.                        Objectives are to determine the long term geochemical trends                    along 90E Ridge in order to understand changes in mixing ratios                 between enriched and depleted mantle components; evaluate growth                and evolution of individual 90E volcanoes as they migrated away                 from hot spot source; determine role of unusual mantle components               as function of age; determine if enriched components distinct                   from a Kerguelen hotspot signature have also contributed to                     volcanism on the eastern Indian Ocean seafloor.                                 %%%                                                                                  Relatively little is known about the geochemical signature                 of volcanic rocks from the eastern Indian ocean, and this project               will provide baseline data needed for comparison with the                       observed isotopic anomalies from the western Indian Ocean.  Dr.                 Frey is a well respected petrologist and there is mo doubt that                 his lab is equipped to generate the high quality data that is                   necessary.  He has worked successfully on projects of a similar                 scope in the past.",
