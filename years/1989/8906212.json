The basidiomycetes, one of two major divisions of                  higher fungi, are characterized by the basidium, the spore-                     forming cell, which can be of two types: those which form cross                 walls or septa after meiosis and those without septa.  The                      auriculariaceous fungi, whose basidia typically become divided by               septa after meiosis, are a group of organisms with                              characteristics intermediate between the ascomycetes, the                       presumed ancestors of the basidiomycetes, and the presumably                    advanced basidiomycetes, with undivided basidia.  Dr. McLaughlin                of the University of Minnesota will use powerful electron-                      microscopic techniques to study ultrastructural features in                     several groups of auriculariaceous fungi.                                            Cellular features that are likely to yield evidence of                     taxonomic relationships among fungi include aspects of meiotic                  and mitotic cell-division, the spindle pole body, primary and                   secondary septa within basidia, and the differentiation of cell-                wall layers.  The correlation of evidence from these several                    aspects of cellular structure and function should help determine                a more natural grouping of the fungi intermediate between the                   ascomycetes and basidiomycetes.",
