 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many unconventional pairing mechanisms of electronic origin have                been proposed for superconductivity in heavy fermion compounds                  and high Tc superconductors.  While the measured Fermi surfaces                 of UPt3 and YBa2Cu3O7 seem to agree with the predictions of band                theory and experiment which indicate the limitation of the local                density approximation and the important role of quantum charge or               spin fluctuations.  Here, they discuss the origins of these                     discrepancies based on their understanding of the                               Hubbard/Anderson model Hamiltonian.  Both band structure                        calculations and model simulations are essential to understand                  the computer programs for finite temperature Monte-Carlo                        simulations, as well as a new efficient algorithm for zero-                     temperature variational Monte-Carlo simulations in which a                      Gutzwiller projection operator is used to restrict charge                       fluctuations in noninteracting wave functions.  They will                       continue along these lines to (1) study the novel properties in                 systems of almost-localized Fermi liquids, and (2) develop                      techniques for first principle variational quantum Monte-Carlo                  simulations.  In particular, they will investigate the ground                   state properties of Fe, where the magnetic energy was                           underestimated by the local-density approximation, and therefore                a wrong ground state crystal structure was predicted.",
