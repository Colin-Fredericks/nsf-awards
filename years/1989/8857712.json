 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research award is improved methodology for the                scale-up of animal and insect cell cultures.  Three projects are                now in progress which involve collaborations with industrial and                academic laboratories.                                                                                                                                          Diagnosis of Cell Stress in Large-Scale Bioreactors.                                                                                                            The goal of this project is to develop techniques for identifying               specific sources of cell stress in large-scale bioreactors through              analysis of intracellular protein synthesis.  Recent results have               shown a set of intracellular proteins whose increased synthesis                 rate is indicative of heightened hydrodynamic stress.  The goal of              future work is to identify and quantify intracellular proteins                  associated with other types of environmental stress.  This                      information is to be ultimately used for the rational scale-up of               animal cell cultures.                                                                                                                                           Scale-Up of Genetically-Engineered Insect Cells.                                                                                                                An insect cell expression system has recently been developed for                the production of genetically-engineered proteins of therapeutic                and agricultural interest.  In this project, the potential of this              expression system will be assessed.  Recent results have                        identified the conditions necessary for the growth of these cells               in a sparged bioreactor.  Future work will examine environmental                conditions necessary for optimum cell growth and product formation              in large-scale bioreactors.                                                                                                                                     Metabolic Engineering of Mammalian Cells.                                                                                                                       Normal human cells have a limited life span in cell culture.  This              problem is being addressed through the incorporation of a specific              class of genes, called oncogenes, into human cells.  Recent                     results demonstrate that one of these genes can increase the life               span of human kidney cells at least five-fold.  Future research is              directed toward further characterization of these kidney cell                   strains, toward the reduction of mammalian cell growth factor                   requirements through oncogene incorporation, and toward an                      extension of this approach to other important cell types.",
