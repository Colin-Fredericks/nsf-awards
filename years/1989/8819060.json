 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this research is to determine the                           developmental sequence of events that leads to the formation of                 the theca layer of an ovarian follicle. It is likely that many of               the most pivotal developmental events take place very early in                  folliculogenesis.  In order to study these events, it is                        necessary to have markers that identify different cell types in                 early stages of development.  The main objective of this proposal               is to produce monoclonal antibodies against thecal                              differentiation antigens.  These antibodies will be used in                     immunocytochemical procedures to mark thecal progenitor cells.                  This methodology will be applied to the study of three aspects of               thecal cell development: 1) thecal cell ontogeny during the                     initial period of follicular organization in newborn rats, 2)                   thecal cell ontogeny during follicular development in adult                     cycling rats, and 3) interactions among granulosa cells, theca                  cells, and oocytes in culture.                                                  %%%                                                                             The ovary  undergoes dramatic morphological remodeling throughout               life in response to the reproductive status of the individual.                  The theca cells are components of the ovarian follicle and are                  involved in steroid hormone production. They are key players in                 the ovulation cycle of mammals.",
