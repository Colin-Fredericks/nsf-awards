 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides partial support for planning a national                   conference and clearinghouse on computer ethics.  The planning                  advisory group includes philosophers, computer professionals, and               social scientists.  Among them are key people in the Association                for Computing Machinery, Institute of Electronic and Electrical                 Engineers, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, and                the American Philosophical Association.  There are specialists in               computing education and accreditation and five journal editors.                 The principal investigator will circulate a proposal for the                    conference and clearinghouse to this group, who will critique and               expand it.  The next version will be circulated to group members,               who will meet to discuss and refine the plans further.  A new                   proposal will be submitted to NSF.  It will include details about               the conference program, who will participate, how prospective                   attendees will be informed and selected, how the journals which                 planning group members (and others) edit will be used to further                the project, and follow.up and follow.on activities.  Computing                 is changing social interactions and raising new ethical concerns.               This project provides a basis for developing an ongoing network                 that can help us to respond to these new developments with                      adequate research and educational programs.  The investigator and               his advisors are exceptionally well qualified to undertake this                 planning activity; institutional support is very good; the award                request is very modest.  Support in the amount of $13,755 is                    recommended.",
