 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dormancy and its relief in fungal spores constitute an                          attractive model system for the study of development and                        differentiation.  The spores of many fungi are triggered to                     germinate by exogenous glucose.  However, the early events in                   glucose-induced germination may be independent of glucose                       metabolism.  Instead, glucose triggers a rise in                                intracellular cyclic AMP which in turn releases a regulatory                    cascade that activates the cell.  Associated with this                          regulatory cascade is a dramatic surge in glycolytic                            activity.  The objectives of the proposed research are to                       examine the mechanism by which the glucose-induced cyclic AMP                   signal is generated and to understand the relationship                          between the cyclic AMP signal and the increase in glycolytic                    flow.  Specifically, the proposed research will test the                        hypotheses that (1) the cell's glucose transport system is                      the receptor for the cyclic AMP signal and (2) a rise in                        fructose 6-phosphate is responsible for the surge in                            glycolysis.                                                                                                                                                     Dormancy has survival value because it isolates the organism                    from a hostile environment.  To be effective, however,                          dormancy must be accompanied by the ability to recognize                        environmental factors characteristic of favorable periods.                      Otherwise, dormancy would assure death of the organism                          without reproduction.  These recognition systems, once                          activated usually provoke biochemical and physical changes                      that are rapid and dramatic.  This project studies the early                    events once dormancy is broken.***//",
