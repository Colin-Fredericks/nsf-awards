 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to conduct laboratory                          experiments that will provide data on the effects of flow rate,                 cation exchange capacity, and permeant fluid characteristics on                 the leachability of heavy metals from fly ash liner materials.                  The laboratory tests will be conducted on fly ash in various                    combinations with cement, bentonite, and/or two well-                           characterized soils.  Flow rates ranging from those expected to                 be operative under field conditions will be used in the                         experiments.                                                                                                                                                    The characteristics of the permeant fluids will range from tap                  water to a synthetic electrolyte solution varying in both                       concentration and composition.  The concentrations and amounts of               specific chemical species being leached from fly ash mixtures                   will be monitored to draw conclusions about the effect of cation                exchange capacity, and the effect of electrolyte solution on the                leachability of heavy metals.  As a result of the research, a                   more valid assessment of the use of fly ash in waste impoundment                facilities will be possible.  Such an assessment will have far                  reaching technical and economical implications, especially for                  the electric power industry.",
