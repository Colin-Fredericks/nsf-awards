 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flow cytometry and slit scanning measuring technology will be                   developed and applied to analyze growing populations of Saccharomyces           cerevisiae cells at the single cell level.  While conventional flow             cytometry provides data on the joint distribution of specific single-           cell properties at rapid rate, the slit scanning measuring technique            can provide information on low resolution spatial distribution within           individual cells of certain properties such as cell size, DNA, or               protein content.  With this technique, properties of mother cell and            growing daughter cell can be quantitated during the cell cycle and              during asymmetric cell division.  In particular, with this novel                experimental approach, information is obtained on frequency                     distribution functions of properties within the total cell population,          within the subpopulation of dividing cells, and within the group of             cells that has been formed by cell division.  These experimental data,          in combination with population balance equations, allow rapid                   determination of single-cell rates of accumulation of any component             detectable by flow cytometry.  The work includes refinement of the              measuring technique, refinement of cell preparation, and                        immunofluorescence staining procedures to detect specific                       intracellular components in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.  In                 particular, an immunofluorescence technique suitable for flow                   cytometric quantification of bacterial \u001a-                                       galactosidase is used as a model system to study the dynamics of                expression of a single protein in S. cerevisiae at the single                   cell level and under varying environmental conditions.  In                      addition, single cell growth models are being developed to                      support the experimental work.                                                                                                                                  For the design of a production process that utilizes                            microorganisms, it is important to know the composition of the                  microorganism and how this composition changes over time.  Flow                 cytometry represents a sophisticated, laser based measuring                     technology that permits determination of the composition of                     single cells at rates up to 5000 cells per second.  Within a                    fraction of time one obtains the information on how the single                  cell composition is distributed within a cell population.                       Knowledge of such distributions provides a detailed insight into                the properties of entire cell populations that are determined by                the contribution from each individual cell present in that                      population.  For instance, cell to cell heterogeneities are                     particularly pronounced in the case  of unstable recombinant cell               populations because of genetic differences and because of                       different developmental stages of individual cells.",
