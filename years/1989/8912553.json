 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soviet and Western scholars have been devoting increasing attention to          the question of the efficiency potential of the Soviet economic system.         It has long been thought and/or known that that Soviet allocational,            productive and distributive arrangements impede efficiency,  but                attempts to rigorously classify,  analyze and measure these phenomena           are of more recent origin.  A good deal of valuable work has been               accomplished,  but much remains to be done.                                                                                                                     The purpose of this research project is to continue past joint work with        collaborators at the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute of the         Soviet Academy of Sciences (TsEMI) in Moscow.  It represents the second         year (Phase II) of a five-year research agenda,  to which the Soviet            research team also is committed.  The current Phase involves four main          directions of analysis:  (1)  to complete a monograph entitled Theory           and Measurement of Economic Efficiency in the Soviet Union and the              United States;  (2)  to assimilate the disparate strands of the                 efficiency literature into a status report on the analysis and                  measurement of Soviet economic efficiency;  (3)  to assess the                  efficiency potential of the Soviet economic system by extending                 existing theoretical and empirical analyses;  and (4)  to evaluate              the implications of Gorbachev's unfolding reforms from the                      standpoint of the efficiency potential of the system.                                                                                                           The methodology being developed and applied in this project has broad           applicability in economics.  The collaborative effort,  unique for its          scale in this area,  should provide a better formal picture of the              emerging Soviet economic arrangements,  at the same time that it                acquaints some influential Soviet economists with state-of-the-art              Western analysis.",
