 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project by Peter Ogilby of the University of New Mexico,                   which is within the Organic Dynamics Program, is aimed at an                    understanding of the way in which excited states of molecular                   oxygen may be generated and destroyed.  Of particular interest,                 is the excited state interaction and energy transfer between                    molecular oxygen and organic molecules.  These studies will                     provide information about the degradation of organic materials                  in air.                                                                                                                                                         Excited state interactions and energy transfer between                          molecular oxygen and organic molecules will be investigated                     using a variety of spectroscopic techniques including                           time-resolved detection of singlet molecular oxygen                             phosphorescence and time-resolved absorption studies of                         molecular transients (e.g., triplet states and radical ions).                   Recent results suggest the following two areas to be especially                 fruitful:  (1) a study of the oxygen-organic molecule                           charge-transfer (CT) state and the extent to which it                           determines oxygen-organic molecule photophysics and                             photochemistry, and (2) a study of oxygen-organic molecule                      interactions in solid organic polymers.",
