 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central goal of this effort is the investigation of fundamental             issues involved in the potential for optics to be utilized for                  computational purposes.  One of the systems proposed, that of the two-          digit digital multiplier serves as a basis to investigate some of the           aspects of primary concern- for instance the ability to carry out more          than one operation with a single frequency, or the isolation of the             input from the output, as well as the net power consumption is the              basic operations.  A two-digit multiplier is proposed via an extension          of the Goodman-Woody algorithm for the optical analog multiplication            of two signals, using nonlinear optical Fabry-Perot elements.                                                                                                   As a second aspect of this effort, the investigators are proposing a            Gaussian beam approach to analyze the number of resolvable                      interconnected addresses, the degree to which cross-talk is a problem           and the number to interconnections which can be made using the                  photorefractive effect.                                                                                                                                         Related to the above two areas is the issue of appropriate sources, in          particular an effort towards the investigation of possible                      semiconductors for the generation of visible emission.  The                     investigators have initiated a collaborative effort with Mike Ruben of          the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory for the investigation of possible II-          VI compounds which would be possible.  This also has the  possibility           of investigating new materials and structures for the use of nonlinear          elements.",
