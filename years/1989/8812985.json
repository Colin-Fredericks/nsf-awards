 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at understanding phosphorus fluxes in               the mixed layer of the ocean.  Radioisotopes of phosphorus (P-32                and P-33) will be used as short-lived tracers of the biodynamics                of this nutrient.  Data have been obtained to show the technique                is feasible and methods to measure dissolved inorganic phosphorus               (DIP), dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and particulate organic               phosphorus (POP) are fully developed.  This is a two-year study                 in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans at places and times to be                    determined on an opportunity basis.                                                                                                                                  Biologists have long attempted to define phosphorus cycling                in the mixed layer of the ocean and have faced the difficulties                 of multiple rates of exchange among several compartments, such as               dissolved inorganic phosphorus, dissolved organic phosphorus                    and particulate organic phosphorus.  Through new techniques using               short-lived radioactive isotopes of phosphorus as tracers, the                  movement of this nutrient through the various compartments can be               defined.  This is a two-year study involving ships of opportunity               to sample and analyze the upper layer of open ocean water in the                Pacific and the Atlantic.",
