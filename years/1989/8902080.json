 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Park will continue her ergodic-theoretical study                 of actions by Z^2 and other groups, including such nonabelian                   groups as GL(2,Z). Properties of non-cocompact subgroup actions                 in Z^2-actions are to be examined, in particular when the action                has a rigid property like minimal self-joinings or simplicity.                  She will also study further the centralizers of rank 1 actions of               Z^2. She will continue her work on cellular automata, in                        particular on the continuity of directional entropy. She will                   seek representations of certain kinds of geodesic flows, from                   geometry, as flows built under ceiling functions.                                    Classically, ergodic theory is concerned with what happens                 in the long run when a transformation of a space is iterated many               times. (The space in question need not be anything particularly                 elaborate; something like a line segment will do.) Via the                      transformation, one can think of the group Z of integers acting                 on the space, or of time passing in discrete steps. Continuous                  time, similarly, is modeled by an action of the group R of real                 numbers, called a flow. This situation is also of interest in                   ergodic theory. A good example is a geodesic flow on a surface,                 where points on the surface are imagined as moving at constant                  speed along paths of shortest distance. A principal goal of                     research in ergodic theory is to classify the various sorts of                  long-run behavior that are possible in a given situation.                       Typically, there will be not too many, and all of them will be                  realizable within an appropriate standard model, or                             representation. Professor Park's research is concerned with what                happens for other groups beside Z and R. The general framework of               ergodic theory still makes sense, but new phenomena appear, even                in the case of the group Z^2 of pairs of integers.",
