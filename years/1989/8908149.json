Prior support for curation of these                    materials has been provided by the National Science Foundation.                 The collection consists of human skeletal specimens exhibiting                  disease, trauma, and morphological variation and includes nearly                3,500 specimens from more than 1,500 individuals.  It was made in               the early part of this century by Arthur W. Meyer, M.D., of                     Stanford University and is especially important because it                      predates the introduction of antibiotics.  Therefore, materials                 include evidence of diseases which are rare in present day                      populations.  An osteologist/paleopathologist and a forensic                    anthropologist will assist in the cataloging and conservation of                the materials.  Descriptions will be made of the remaining parts                of the collection and databases selected for collections                        management.  Co-mingled specimens will be sorted and fragile                    specimens conserved.                                                                                                                                            These reference materials are extremely important because they                  derive from known individuals, many with extensive medical                      records.  Therefore, control is excellent.  The specimens can be                used for both teaching and research purposes and serve as a                     starting point for the analysis of older materials.  Because the                skeletal system provides a fairly permanent record of the                       diseases and insults to an individual, through the study of such                specimens, it is possible to examine the effects of such                        variables as nutrition, crowding, and disease at different ages                 in an individual's life on such dependent factors as growth,                    development, and morbidity.                                                                                                                                     This research is important because it can help us understand the                normal processes of human growth and development as well as the                 effects of specific diseases.",
