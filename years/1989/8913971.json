 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Dr. Robert Kottwitz in                 Automorphic Forms. Among his projects are joint work with D.                    Shelstad involving a twisted form of the Trace Formula and its                  relation to twisted endoscopic groups. He will also investigate                 the spaces of points modulo p on certain moduli spaces, and work                on a conjectured \"Fundamental Lemma\" in the field, according to                 which certain spherical functions have matching orbital                         integrals.                                                                           Non-Euclidean Plane Geometry began in the early nineteenth                 century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                     century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                       fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                 The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                  rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                    study of Automorphic Forms is one of the most active. This field                is principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers,                but in its use of Geometry and Analysis, it retains connection to               its historical roots.",
