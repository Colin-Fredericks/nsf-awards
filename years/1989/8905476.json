 "awd_abstract_narration": "The human shoulder is a highly mobile structure whose                      function is to position the hand almost anywhere within a nearly                spherical range of motion.  Many features of this complex region                in humans, including the function of certain muscles, are shared                with the living apes, as was previously demonstrated by this                    investigator and others using electromyographic studies.  The                   present proposal describes a new set of functionally                            interpretable osteological features of the scapula and humerus                  that have been suggested by the results of previous                             electromyographic studies of shoulder muscle function among                     living apes and humans.  It follows in the tradition of S.L.                    Washburn who more than three decades ago urged the use of                       experimental comparative anatomy to help answer questions of                    human inheritance.                                                                                                                                                   Analysis of a new set of features in the skeleton of the                   shoulder will further our understanding of the relationship                     between form and function, as well as expand the collection of                  functional characters that may be applied to the interpretation                 of human fossils.  This will aid in our understanding of this                   region of the body.",
