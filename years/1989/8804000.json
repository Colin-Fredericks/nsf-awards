 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of equipment for automated protein sequencing and                       peptide synthesis has, in the last few years, become crucial to                 the progress of research in many areas of biological science.                   Determination of the amino acid sequence of a protein is often a                required initial step in the isolation and subsequent sequence                  analysis of the gene, or DNA, that encodes the protein.                         Synthesis of peptides is often an important step for modern                     analysis of functional and structural aspects of proteins and of                the regulation of genes.                                                                                                                                        The funds provided by this award will be used to purchase                       instruments that perform purification of proteins and synthetic                 peptides, and the automated sequencing of proteins.  The                        equipment will be housed with existing and other new                            instrumentation in the Central Service Laboratory, and will be                  devoted to providing service to approximately 50 researchers on                 the Oregon State campus.  Researchers whose projects are                        discussed in the proposal are active in animal, plant and                       bacterial virology, neurobiology, cellular biochemistry,                        enzymology, or biophysics.",
