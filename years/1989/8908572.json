The data                     records are housed in Dar es Salaam and must be reviewed there.                 The purpose is to test the hypothesis, generated in studies of                  captive animals, that there is a correlation between the degree                 of social contact and the pattern of genital swelling in wild                   female chimpanzees.                                                                                                                                                  It is well known that human females who live together tend                 to synchronize their menstrual cycles (the dormitory effect),                   suggesting that social contact is the significant factor                        regulating synchrony.  Laboratory experiments have indicated that               synchronous onset of estrous swelling in chimpanzees is also                    mediated by social contact.  This project will determine whether                similar synchrony can be demonstrated under natural conditions,                 thus adding to our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the                  reproductive life cycles of chimpanzees.",
