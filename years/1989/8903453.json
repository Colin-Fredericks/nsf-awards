 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic research topic is the formation of ordered micellar                   solutions.  The proposed research is a natural extension of past                research.  Micellar systems with a Landau point in the isotropic                nematic transition line offer a unique opportunity to study                     critical phenomena which they intend to explore fully.  In other                experiments curvature elastic and flow properties of the ionic                  conductivity of micellar nematics will be measured with aim of                  investigating the effects of co-surfactants over concentration                  ranges that extend from hexagonal phases to lamellar smectic                    phases.  New additives of special interest are polymeric                        surfactants.  They will affect the dynamics of micellization and                influence flow properties.  In theoretical research, they will                  investigate ribbon-like micelles and relate their properties to                 the formation of different types of nematic phases.  A second                   theoretical effort is directed toward a model for a new type of a               cholesteric modification detected in biaxial cholesterics.",
