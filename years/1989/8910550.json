 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acoustic communication is common among animals, and it has                      recently been discovered in bees, which are among the most well-                understood of all insects.  The well-known \"dance\" of the bee in                the hive gives information on the direction and distance of a                   food source to other foraging bees.  Preliminary recent studies                 now show that sound communication almost certainly plays a major                role in this dance behavior.                                                                                                                                    This project will use behavioral experiments to clarify the role                of airborne sounds from the dancing bees, and further                           characterize the ability of bees to respond to sound.  Bees will                be trained to respond to artificially generated sounds, to                      analyze the frequency sensitivity of their acoustic sense;                      ablation studies will be used to identify the acoustic receptor                 organs.  In addition, collaborating bioengineers have                           manufactured a small mechanical dancing bee, controlled by the                  experimenters, and this device will be used in the presence of                  real bees to determine which signals are necessary and sufficient               for successful communication during the waggle dance.  Both                     acoustic and non-acoustic cues will be given by the mechanical                  model, and the observed food-seeking field behavior of the bees                 that go out to forage will be assayed to see what parameters were               important to communicate site direction and distance.                                                                                                           This novel study will have high impact on an already rich story                 of a sophisticated sensory-guided behavior.  In addition, there                 is a strong component of undergraduate participation in this                    work, and the work is very likely to have importance in the                     continuing use of bees as an important agricultural resource.",
