 "awd_abstract_narration": "Specific DNA oligomers will be synthesized to use a model                       systems to aid in the understanding of the structure-                           activity relationship of certain nucleic acid conformations.                    These model conformations will be examined with high                            resolutions by employing state of the arts techniques. It                       has been suggested that Z-DNA may contribute to the control                     of biological events, in particular, genetic activities.                        Although direct evidence is still lacking or at least                           incomplete, the suggestion has not been disproved.  Therefore                   it is very plausible that mechanisms of conformational                          transition in DNA are best studied on Z-DNA models.                                                                                                             In particular, the primary goal of this project is to expand                    the work already completed on the structural analysis of B-Z                    junctions.  Much of the work will incorporate a B-Z junction                    into an already well defined system.  There are four major                      areas of interest:  1) multiple and poly conformational                         junctions; 2) B-Z junctions in DNA hairpins and dumbbells; 3)                   the effects of base pair mismatches at or near a B-Z                            junction; and, 4) the hyperactivity of B-Z junctions to                         certain carcinogens.  Multiple and poly junctions will                          examine the effect of the presence of many conformational                       junctions on the global conformation of a long DNA oligomer.                    The effects of the loops in hairpins and dumbbells and the                      effects of mismatches at or near a junction will be                             evaluated in terms of the thermodynamics of the DNA duplexes                    in question. Their effects on the formation and structure of                    the junction will also be evaluated.",
