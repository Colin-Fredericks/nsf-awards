 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transport of ions, such as sodium and potassium, across cell                membranes is a critically important process for all living                      systems.  This transport is necessary for life; for example, it                 is directly involved in the transmission of signals along nerves                and the production of metabolic energy.  Ion transport is                       facilitated and controlled by protein structures, called ion-                   channels, that reside in the cell membrane.  While these ion-                   channels can be identified, their structures are not well                       understood at a molecular level.  These ion-channels can be                     \"gated\" open by small molecules called neurotransmitters or by                  changes in electric fields that occur in the cell membrane.  At                 present, the structural changes that open ion-channels are not                  characterized.                                                                                                                                                  The objective of the research project is to advance the                         understanding of ion-channels.  A membrane ion-channel that is                  opened by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, called the                        acetylcholine receptor, will be studied.  This channel proves to                be an ideal system for chemical/physical study because it can be                obtained in large quantities.  Using powerful new chemical and                  physical techniques, the molecular structure of the acetylcholine               receptor and the mechanism by which it opens ion channels will be               examined.  Since electric fields also can open ion-channels, the                effects of electric fields on proteins in cell membranes will be                studied.  Small proteins will be designed and produced so as to                 investigate interactions between proteins and electric fields in                membranes.",
