This proposal is for support to construct a large bismuth germanate             glass scintillator detector for studying high energy particle                   production.  This cooperative study is proposed by Dr. Frederick                Becchetti, University of Michigan, and Professors Yin Zhiwan and Shen           Dingzhong, Shanghai Instititute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of                 Science.                                                                                                                                                        The research team at the University of Michigan has successfully                tested the use of a large bismuth germanate glass scintillator to               detect particles generated under high energy (E > 200 MeV).  The                collaborating scientists from the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics                (SCI) have extensive expertise in producing large, clear bismuth                germanate crystals, an essential part in constructing this high                 energy scintillator detector, but not commercially available.                   Jointly they plan to construct a very high energy (E>200 MeV) large             bismuth germanate glass scintillator detector for detecting particle            production.                                                                                                                                                     Bismuth germanate glass scintillator detectors are used extensively             in high-energy physics and nuclear physics, and form an essential               part of the PET scanners.  The result of this project is a device               capable of detecting particles generated under high energy (E>200               MeV), which no equipment is able to measure at present.  Applications           of this detector can provide critical data for improving detection              efficiency for radiation monitoring devices and satellite surveillance.         This project is jointly supported by the NSF and the Chinese Academy            of Sciences.",
