 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectroscopy is essential to chemists and biologists who are                    carrying out frontier research.

The areas of research that will be enhanced by                   the acquisition include:                                                                                                                                        1) Multinuclear magnetic resonance studies of Group 14                             organometallic compounds                                                     2) Synthesis of natural products                                                3) Interactions between cytochrome P-450-CAM and camphor                           derivatives                                                                  4) Conformational dynamics of selected binary and ternary                          complexes of thymidylate synthase                                            5) Studies of proton spin lattice relaxation times as a                            definitive method of distinguishing classical from                              nonclassical structures in transition-metal hydrides                         6) Synthesis of macrocycles.",
