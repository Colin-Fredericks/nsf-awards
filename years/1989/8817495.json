 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Janice Moore requests support for a comparative study of               behavioral changes in host cockroach species caused by                          acanthocephalan worm parasites.  Previous studies have postulated               that parasite-induced behavioral changes may increase the                       probability of transmission of the worms to vertebrate hosts,                   raising the possibility of adaptive significance of the                         behavioral changes.  This project will establish the degree and                 kinds of behavioral changes induced in ten cockroach species by a               single parasite species, and will investigate the extent to which               closely-related cockroaches have similar responses to being                     parasitized.  Behavioral changes will be measured relative to                   five environmental tests (substrate color and orientation,                      shelter choice, activity level, and responses to air currents).                      The project has wide implications for the study of host-                   parasite coevolution.  If behavioral changes are highly                         coincident with evolutionary relationships, then parasitism can                 be viewed as a noteworthy factor in the evolution of the group.                 If they are not well-predicted by evolutionary relatedness, then                species would appear to be more generalized in their responses,                 and therefore more directly adapted to their ecological                         circumstances.",
