 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dendrochronology (the temporal analysis of growth rings in woody           plants) has become an important field of research with many                     applications spanning geography, biology, hydrology, climatology,               ecology, geomorphology, and related sciences.  By analyzing the width           and condition of growth rings, scientists gain valuable information             about plant growth and the conditions that enhance or inhibit growth.           Dendrochronological studies have permitted scientists to infer                  historic conditions as far back in time as the plants from which growth         rings are taken have lived, which has been thousands of years under             special circumstances.  The grant will support establishment of a tree-         ring analysis laboratory at Montana State University.  This lab will            contain equipment necessary for collection, preparation, and analysis           of woody plant growth-rings, and it will be used as an integral                 component for climatic and sedimentologic research.  One of the major           research projects underway at the laboratory site involves the use of           dendrochronology to reconstruct past temperature, precipitation, and            air mass patterns at both upper and lower timberlines in a region of            the northern Rocky Mountains.  This work will add a substantial body of         information to the minimal amount of data currently available on the            paleo-environmental conditions of that region, and it will provide              knowledge of recent environmental change and the consequences of that           change.  The second ongoing project involves determination of the               frequency of debris flows generated by high-precipitation events on             modern alluvial fans in the northern Rocky Mountains.  Analysis of the          sedimentology and frequency of debris flows caused by high-                     precipitation events will provide extensive information about the               volume and timing of debris flows in temperate, semi-arid alluvial              fans.  Correlation of debris flows with local patterns of climatic              variation can also help to evaluate the degree to which climate                 influences erosion.  These results will also contribute toward                  refinement of models commonly applied to interpret deposits in the              stratigraphic record of alluvial fans.                                               There are few existing tree-ring analysis laboratories in the              United States.  The establishment of such a laboratory at Montana State         University will facilitate the acquisition of dendrochronologic data in         an inexpensive and timely manner not now possible.  This lab will               provide data for two major ongoing paleoclimatologic and                        sedimentologic investigations and for a number of future projects               planned by scholars at that institution and elsewhere.  These research          projects will increase our understanding of the temporal significance           of climatic fluctuations and earth surface processes.",
