 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a group of U.S. researchers under the                   direction of Professor John E. Walsh of Dartmouth College, New                  Hampshire, to collaborate with a group of Italian scientists headed             by Dr. Gian-Piero Gallerano of the ENEA Research Center in                      Frascati, Italy.  The investigators intend to produce a moderate                (10-100KW) source of tunable, short-pulse (10-30ps) coherent                    radiation at FIR and IR wavelengths with the Frascati Cerenkov                  Free-Electron Laser (C-FEL).  Such a source should find ample                   application to a wide range of research topics, including                       excitations in thin films, biophysics plasma diagnostics, and the               study of transient excitations in large molecules.                                                                                                              For this collaboration, which has been ongoing for the last four                years, Dartmouth researchers provided the original design concept,              the basic theory for the device, and construction of a C-FEL                    resonator.  The ENEA (Frascati) laboratory has provided laboratory              space, a 5-Mev microtron accelerator, a beam transport channel and              beam-focussing monitoring and diagnostic equipment.  A particular               advantage of the C-FEL schemes is that in comparison with other FEL             schemes, the beam energy required for operation at shorter FIR and              IR wavelengths is modest.  This results in a source that is compact             and thus ultimately practical for a wider range of applications.",
