 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contaminated ground water treatment is most economically accomplished           by air stripping followed by complete catalytic combustion.  For                hydrocarbon sources from underground gasoline storage, the catalytic            combustors are now being deactivated by contaminants such as lead.              Poison tolerant catalyst designs are needed to prevent inactivation of          the converter.  The proposed research focuses on the development of a           poison tolerant system to handle leaded gasoline contaminated ground            water.  The program exploits the use of a special guard bed combined            with design and control strategies to reduce the impact of                      deactivation.  Mathematical modeling of the process together with               measurements taken during the deactivation process of a commercial              catalyst will lead to a guard bed feasibility demonstration.                                                                                                    Successful completion of this research project could have a                     significant impact on the technology used to eliminate contaminants             from ground water and industrial waste streams.  Catalytic conversion           of the unwanted hydrocarbons could become the preferred technique for           ground water cleanup if catalyst poisoning is controlled.",
