 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a central research facility, the Electron Microscopy                         Laboratory of the University of Maine is a resource for a wide                  variety of projects in the biological as well as physical and                   chemical sciences.  Research projects making use of this facility               call for a new transmission microscope equipped with a eucentric                goniometer stage; this proposal requests funding for such a                     microscope.  Twenty-two investigators have been identified to                   represent a range of applications to which this microscope will                 be applied; five fo these investigators, with NSF-supported                     projects are identified as major users.  Projects specified in                  this proposal call, for example, for ultrastructural                            stereological analysis to clarify the roles of mitochondria in                  hyperoxic and hypoxic conditions and in acclimation to life at                  low temperatures, to characterize diurnal changes in                            photoreceptors, and to quantify effects of acid-rain stress in                  plant and animal tissues.  Ultrastructural immunocytochemistry                  will be used in some projects to identify extracellular matrix                  components of lower invertebrates, to localize enzymes in                       plant/fungal associations, and to characterize enzymes of wood                  degradation.  In systematic biology, phylogenetic analysis of                   ultrastructural characters will be used to elucidate evolutionary               relationships in diatoms, higher plants, and lower                              invertebrates.  Applications in molecular biology and virology                  include characterization of extrachromosomal DNA in a protist and               characterization of genetic material and structure of a                         mycovirus.//",
