 "awd_abstract_narration": "They are establishing a program at Cornell to study novel                       transport phenomena in solids, with emphasis on charge-density-                 wave transport.  Charge-density waves (CDWs) provide a new and                  fundamentally different electrical conduction mechanism.  Their                 primary objectives for the next five years are (1) to establish                 the quantitative experimental phenomenology of CDW transport; (2)               to develop a more detailed theoretical understanding of CDWs; and               (3) to explore CDW applications.  To meet these objectives, they                are adopting a materials-oriented approach.  Chemical,                          structural, and electrical characterization methods will be used                to identify defect types and concentrations.  An intensive                      materials preparation effort is being mounted to determine                      crystal growth conditions which minimize defect densities and to                identify new CDW compounds with novel and/or more desirable                     properties.  Transport measurements on high-quality, well-                      characterized materials will be used to study CDW dynamics, to                  quantify the CDW-defect interaction, and to evaluate possible CDW               applications.  In collabration with theorists at Cornell and                    elsewhere, these emperiments will be analyzed in an attempt to                  understand the fundamental processes underlying CDW transport.",
