 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate and improve the trade-off between                 accuracy and cost of the numerical solution of the transport                    equation, when (a) the driving flow is unsteady and strongly non-               uniform, and (b) the period of simulation is much longer than the               smallest time scales that must be resolved (due to \"physics\").                                                                                                  The research focus is on particle methods (PMs) and on Eulerian-                Lagrangian methods (ELMs).  One part of the research will concern               numerical accuracy, emphasizing (a) the understanding of the                    accuracy properties of alternative algorithms for particle                      tracking, as a function of the flow complexity, and (b) the                     influence of these properties on the global accuracy of the                     transport equation by PMs and ELMs.  The other part of the                      research will concern numerical efficiency:  investigation of                   implementations of selected PMs and ELMs on alternative types of                computer architectures:  serial and parallel (with shared and                   distributed memory).  The different pairs of numerical methods                  and computer architectures will be compared with regard to (a)                  \"cost\" (CPU and user time) for fixed accuracy, and (b) accuracy                 for fixed \"cost.\"                                                                                                                                               Research will blend (a) theoretical analysis of numerical                       methods, (b) algorithm development (with emphasis on parallel                   algorithms), and (c) numerical experimentation.  Direct                         motivation is provided by long-term simulations of tidal                        transport in estuaries and coasts, but results should also                      benefit other scientific and engineering fields.",
