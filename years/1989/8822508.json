 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  chemistry Program is in the area of transition metal                            organometallic chemistry. The results of the project will                       enhance fundamental knowledge in an area critical to the                        development of new catalysts for chemical synthesis and                         hydrocarbon conversion.                                                                                                                                         The foci of the research are the monoimido alkylidene chemistry                 of Mo and W and the chemistry of alkylidyne, alkylidene and                     imido complexes of Re. Mechanistic studies will be carried out                  on olefin metathesis reactions involving Mo and W complexes of                  the type M(CHR')(NAr)(OR)2, where Ar=2,6-diisopropylphenyl. The                 goal of these experiments will be to sort out the role of                       trigonal bipyramidal metallacyclobutane complexes versus square                 pyramidal metallacyclobutane complexes, and how precisely                       olefin metathesis activity is controlled by varying the nature                  of the OR group.  Another goal will be to develop a practical                   synthetic route to molybdenum catalysts, since molybdenum is                    more tolerant of functional groups than is tungsten. A third                    goal will be to extend what has been learned to rhenium,                        i.e.,to prepare rhenium acetylene and olefin metathesis                         catalysts whose activity can be controlled by the choice of                     alkoxide ligands, in part because rhenium is likely to be the                   most tolerant of these metals toward functional groups. The                     behavior of monoimido alkylidyne complexes of the type                          Re(CR')(NAr)(OR)2 as acetylene metathesis catalysts will be                     investigated also, since at least one related complex is known                  already to be an active catalyst for internal acetylenes. The                   organometallic chemistry of Re(VII) in general will be                          developed as routes to such compounds become available.",
