 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current maps of global vegetation have been produced by the                Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the AVHRR                    satellite sensor.  These maps have been related to absorbed solar               radiation or surface leaf area index, but the NDVI has only been                related theoretically to evapotranspiration and photosynthesis                  processes for vegetation and then only under optimal conditions                 of water and temperature, constraints that severely limit real                  world applications.  The project will utilize a simple                          evapotranspiration and photosynthesis model for forests driven                  entirely by AVHRR data that is sensitive to sub-optimal water and               temperature conditions.  The investigators will (1) relate the                  seasonal trend of weekly composite NDVI to vegetation phenology                 and temperature limits, (2) test a satellite-derived surface                    resistance factor which is related to canopy diffusion resistance               and (3) define physiologically based energy to mass conversion                  factors for carbon and water.  These NDVI driven models will then               be evaluated against a more complex ecosystem process model.                    The resulting simple, satellite-driven forest canopy models                     should allow a vastly improve computation of surface water and                  carbon exchange rates by global forests and improve accuracy of                 global carbon and hydrologic budgets.                                                                                                                           Output from the project should be useful in understanding the                   regional-to-global dynamics of water, CO2 and climate with regard               to the \"greenhouse effect\" as well as possibly providing better,                more rapid means of estimating forest production on large scales.                                                                                               The investigators are quite well qualified.  Institutional                      accommodations and support for both collaborators is excellent.                                                                                                 The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends support for this three-                year collaborative effort.",
