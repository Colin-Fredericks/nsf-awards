 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long range scientific goals of this research are to increase                the understanding of the correlation of molecular structure with                physical properties of ferroelectric liquid crystal phases and to               test strategies for the design of new materials.  The practical                 goal is the invention of new materials with properties suited for               incorporation into commercial shutters and large-area matrix                    displays.  Ferroelectric smectic C liquid crystals have been                    shown to exhibit high speed, multistate electro-optic and                       display device applications, particularly when incorporated into                the surface stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal light valve.                The best materials for use in such devices would have a high                    ferroelectric polarization and low orientational viscosity,                     affording a fast electro-optic response time, broad temperature                 range, and excellent chemical stability.  No materials currently                available possess the required speed, temperature range, and                    stability to allow fabrication of large area multiplexed arrays                 operating at video rates with gray scale.  This work will be                    directed toward developing materials to satisfy these needs.                    Demonstrating the concept \"steric coupling\" of stereocenters in                 the tail with orientation of substituted aromatic rings in the                  core to produce a family of crystals with extremely high                        polarization and low viscosity for use in the above stated high                 speed applications.",
