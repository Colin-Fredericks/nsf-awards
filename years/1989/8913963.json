 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine evaporite sequences constitute a somewhat                           discontinuous record of seawater chemical compositions through                  time.  The sequence and relative amounts of precipitation of                    different evaporite minerals in each deposit constrain                          hypothesized excursions of seawater composition.  Mass                          inventories of ancient evaporites suggest that some major                       episodes of evaporite deposition decreased mean oceanic salinity                and perhaps changed major ion ratios of seawater.  In addition,                 marine evaporite sulfate minerals contain a record of the sulfur                and oxygen (in sulfate ion) isotopic composition of seawater                    through time.  The major disadvantage in evaporite geochemical                  records is the lack of stratigraphic age control within                         sequences.  Sequence ages are usually interpolated from those of                underlying and overlying marine strata, but biota in these and in               interbedded units are commonly restricted or endemic and have                   little stratigraphic utility.  This problem may be alleviated by                measuring strontium isotopic ratios of the gypsum/anhydrite                     mineral fractions of the evaporites.  The dominant source of Sr                 in most marine evaporitic brines is seawater and, as for marine                 carbonates, no significant Sr isotopic fractionation takes place                during incorporation of Sr into the precipitating sulfate                       minerals.  Sr isotope redistribution due to diagenesis, excluding               dewatering of gypsum upon deeper burial, is probably not as much                of a problem as it is in carbonate sequences because sulfate                    mineral alteration is easily recognized and avoided.                                 Sr-isotopic stratigraphy for middle to upper Miocene                       evaporite sequences in the Gulf of Suez-northern Red Sea, a                     deposit that provides a relatively long potential geochemical                   record will be constructed.  Determination of Sr-isotopic ratios                for the evaporite sequences and comparison to established Sr-                   isotopic secular curves for late Cenozoic seawater, based on                    pelagic carbonate sequences, gives reasonable age estimates for                 presumed Langhian (ca. 15.5 Ma) and Messinian (ca. 6 Ma)                        anhydrites from industry wells in the Gulf of Suez.  The                        improved stratigraphy will have important applications for                      higher resolution dating of secular isotopic curves, for chemical               mass balance considerations, for a better understanding of timing               and nature of tectonic processes in a developing rift basin, and                for hydrocarbon exploration.  The technique, if successful, may                 also be applied to other evaporite sequences.  The possibility of               an Sr-isotopic signal derived from continental runoff will also                 be considered and, if present, will provide important information               on the paleohydrology of \"marine\" evaporite basins.  Such                       considerations are crucial if we are to regard ancient evaporites               as marine paleochemical monitors.",
