Specifically the team will:  Identify the                               decision-making process and analyze the needs of the                            decision-makers with reference to selected service systems in                   a sample study area; develop an analysis procedure with                         optimizing models for resources allocation; develop                             interactive software for the analysis in the form of a                          micro-computer based system; evaluate alternative models in                     an interactive mode; and bring together scholars, planners                      and decision-makers to refine the decision-support system and                   to assist in its dissemination.  The project should lead to                     enhancing the quality of health services, banking services,                     education and other sectors that consume large public                           resources.  In addition the study should increase the                           knowledge of the performance of rural service delivery                          systems in developing countries and help define the generic                     features of service delivery systems and develop rules for                      expert systems that will be more appropriate than any                           existing at present.                                                                                                                                            Scope:  The University of Iowa has a Center for International                   Cooperative Studies and Department of Geography each of which                   has excellent resources including staff with relevant                           international experience as well as scholars who are                            conducting research in this field.  The IIMB has a mandate                      and the needed facilities to play a major role in the design                    of new systems for Indian conditions and to train managers in                   recent development in computer assisted decision-making and                     information systems.  These two institutes working jointly                      should help make this project successful and produce                            meaningful results of scientific benefit and of pertinent                       applications.",
