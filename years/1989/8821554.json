 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project by Craig Ogle of the University of North Carolina,                 Charlotte is within the Organic Dynamics Program, and is aimed                  at a better understanding of organolithium compounds.                           Organolithiums are important intermediates in the synthesis of                  a wide variety of organic compounds, and this research will                     provide the elucidation of their structure by a relatively new                  technique known as rapid injection nuclear magnetic resonance                   spectroscopy.                                                                                                                                                   The reactivity of alkyllithium reagents is often modified by                    the addition of alkoxides.  Mixed bases have been used                          extensively in metalations, polymerizations and alkylations,                    without a clear understanding of how the reagent is being                       changed.  This study is aimed at providing a fundamental                        understanding of the mechanism of the reaction of alkyllithiums                 and mixed aggregates with electrophiles; this may lead to the                   development of more reactive and selective reagents.  The work                  will consist of the preparation and identification of mixed                     aggregates of organolithiums and alkoxides of groups IA and                     IIA. The reactivity of these mixed aggregates towards                           electrophiles and carbon acids will then be investigated by                     Li-7 and H-1 rapid injection NMR.  Mixed aggregates formed from                 the reaction of alkyllithiums with electrophiles will also be                   investigated.",
