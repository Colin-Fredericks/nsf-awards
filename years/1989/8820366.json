 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geographers, ecologists, and other scholars are beginning to understand         how the process of urbanization affects plant aggregations and how              vegetation changes through time in an urban environment.  Within the            rapidly developing field of spatial analysis in ecology, little                 research has been conducted on urban vegetation change, or, more                particularly, on change in urban forests.  Trees affect microclimates           and water balances in urban regions, provide aesthetic elements of the          urban landscape, and furnish habitats for fauna.  A mix of issues in            biogeography and urban geography are examined in this project, which            investigates changes in the distribution of vegetation, especially              trees, in St. Paul, Minnesota for the period from 1850 to 1980.                 Combining archival and historical analyses with contemporary field              work, the study will use a geographic information system (GIS) to store         data on vegetation cover and to explain observed changes as a product           of initial cover, land use, population density, and trends in the               changes of the urban landscape.                                                                                                                                 The development of general concepts and theories of urban forest                dynamics depends on this kind of study, which will analyze the effects          of changing land use on the structure of urban forests over a longer            time period than has been examined previously.  By studying the                 biophysical aspects of the urban environment, this research will                contribute to the scientific basis of knowledge essential to planning           for healthful and attractive urban environments and to our                      understanding of human-environmental relationships.",
