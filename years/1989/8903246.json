Dr. Hanlon will work in two general problem areas at the                 junction of Combinatorics and Representation Theory. The first                  area is concerned with the homology of certain nilpotent Lie                    algebras, and homological extensions to the Macdonald root-                     system conjectures. The second area is concerned with problems                  related to Jones's basic construction, and the algebra structures               of Brauer's centralizer algebras corresponding to Stanley's                     Fibonacci r-differential posets.                                                     This research falls in the broad category of Combinatorics,                which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                  Fundamentally, Combinatorics represents a systematization of the                very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                     modern development, however, Combinatorics has gone beyond just                 counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                 techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the               field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                  because of its importance in communications and information                     technology.",
