 "awd_abstract_narration": "The assessment of seismic hazard involves specifying the likelihood,            magnitude, location, and nature of earthquakes that might have                  damaging effects at the site of construction; and estimating the                intensity, duration, and frequency characteristics of the induced               ground shaking.                                                                                                                                                 This project is applying statistical techniques to investigate the              adequacy of the Poisson-Independent-Exponential (PIE) model of                  earthquake occurrence used in most seismic analyses in the United               States.  However it is recognized that the PIE model is not consistent          with the physical process of crustal strain accumulation and release            associated with earthquakes.  Therefore the research is also exploring          alternative models of seismic hazard and its uncertainty, especially            those models which include the effects of non-stationarity and memory           patterns in earthquake occurrence.                                                                                                                              The research focuses on the inadequate understanding of seismicity of           continental interiors, specifically within the central and eastern              United States.  This is a region where the short historical earthquake          record available cannot be trusted to be representative of future               hazards.  The record of earthquakes in China is the only one that can           be used to assess \"memory models\" of seismicity in intraplate regions.          The project involves a collaboration with the Institute of Geophysics           in the PRC State Seismological Bureau: the long catalog of earthquakes          in China is being used to explore and calibrate models of seismicity            with memory.                                                                                                                                                    For intraplate regions, many engineering decisions related to                   earthquake hazard mitigation involve great uncertainties.  As a                 result, this research project is expected to contribute significantly           to the assessment of earthquake hazard in the central and eastern               United States.",
