 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past three years, the Oceanic Society, San Francisco Bay               Chapter, has pilot-tested a high impact marine science immersion                program, Project OCEAN, in West Coast schools.  Funding for this pilot          effort was obtained from the California Fund for Postsecondary                  Education, the US Department of Education and the Packard Foundation.           This project disseminates the model to additional school sites in               California and to schools around the University of Texas Marine Science         Institute on the Gulf Coast.                                                                                                                                    This three year project will field test the model over an extended              period of time, the use of a second expert facility (UTMSI) as a                resource for the teacher enhancement, and refine the curriculum and             teacher materials developed by the Oceanic Society for use in the               teacher enhancement projects.  The seven grade level specific marine            science guidebooks integrate science, mathematics, social studies and           language arts and are thus used by all teachers in all classes from K-6.        Each volume is built around the context of a specific habitat, such as          Kelp Forest, Bays and Estuaries, Tidepools, etc.  The Project includes a        year-long emphasis on the marine sciences which culminates in a                 school-wide observation of Oceans Week.  There are strong indications           that the immersion event significantly improves school climate and              culture, student and teacher attitudes about science, and learning and          second language acquisition among students who are Limited English              Proficient (LEP) and/or otherwise at risk.                                                                                                                      Sixteen schools from California and Texas coastal regions will                  participate with 10 teachers from each school attending the intensive           leadership workshops.  These schools serve heterogenous populations that        include a relatively large number of educationally disadvantaged and LEP        students (Black, Hispanic and Southeast Asians).  The schools have              committed money, released time, minimum of 80% faculty involvement in           workshops and Oceans Week and the presence of strong committed                  administrators and teachers.  Project activities include a 10-day               residential training workshop led by Project Ocean and UT staff for             small teams of specialist teachers to become immersed in marine science,        trained in innovative curricula and instructional methods.  This is             followed by a third week of training for these teams to develop their           leadership capabilities in order to expedite the school wide program.           All-day faculty workshops will be held for the entire school staffs             prior to Oceans Week.  In the second year, habitat-specific workshops           will be held for all teachers as well as follow-up workshops by                 specialist teams, presentations for parents and evaluative activities.                                                                                          Extensive documentation and evaluation will be carried out enabling             other sites to use the model.  Schools, University and Oceanic Society          cost-sharing is equivalent to 56% of the grant request.",
