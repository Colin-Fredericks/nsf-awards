 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is increasingly apparent that the integument of aquatic                      animals can play an active role in mediating the exchange of                    organic compounds between animals and environment.  In this                     project, the PI will compare the mechanisms of integumental and                 intestinal nutrient transport.  This will represent the first                   study integrating the characteristics of organic solute transport               in these nutrient gathering organs; and include an expansion of                 their observation of an apparent homology between glucose                       transporters in invertebrate integument and vertebrate intestine.               They will also examine for the first time the regulatory                        influence of two significant environmental factors, salinity and                nutrient availability.  This is particulary exciting given the                  recent observation that the quaternary nitrogenous compound,                    betaine, is avidly transported by the integument;                               characterization of this transporter, which has not been reported               in any epithelial system, could have an important impact on                     current studies of the role of betaine and related compounds in                 vertebrate and invertebrate osmoregulation.  Finally, the PI                    proposes to begin study of the development of integument                        transport, including the mechanism of transport activation that                 occurs upon fertilization.  The approach in all these studies                   will be to combine the use of intact animals, isolated tissues,                 and preparations of subcellular membranes, along with the                       introduction to this work of several recently introduced                        molecular probes for transport proteins as well as use of NMR as                a tool for studying changes in the physical nature of                           intracellular solutes.  The proposed work also includes a                       comparative examination of integumental and intestinal nutrient                 transport in two major phyla, the Mollusca and Echinodermata.                   The proposed work examines the regulation of nutrient uptake by                 several different organ systems in aquatic organisms.  The                      studies include the first examination of the molecular basis of                 the activation of nutrient uptake into newly fertilized eggs, and               then follows the development of particular aspects of these                     processes from egg to the nutrient acquiring organs of the adult.               These results should be directly applicable to the understanding                if optimal growing conditions for several species of commercially               important shellfish.",
