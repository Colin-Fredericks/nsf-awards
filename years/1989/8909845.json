 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Key problem in solar flare physics is the manner in which                protons and other particles are accelerated in a few seconds as                 evidenced by impulsive y-ray emission.  The most widely accepted                models in explaining this acceleration are shock acceleration and               stochastic acceleration by Alfven or magnetosonic waves.                             Neither of these models has developed self-consistency or                  has direct observational verification.  This grant will permit                  the consistent development of a single-loop Alfven wave                         stochastic acceleration model as the topic most likely to allow a               close interaction between theory and observations.  A half-loop                 is divided into 3 coronal sections attached to a model                          chromosphere and photosphere.  The coronal sections include the                 source where primary acceleration occurs, a section beyond the                  source where further acceleration occurs and a transport section                in which protons propagate diffusively.  Unlike previous work, it               will be a complete model for nonrelativistic energies including a               nuclear interaction calculation.  Thus , it will be possible to                 study the effect of changing the spectrum and/or power of                       turbulence in the source, the loop size, etc., throughout the                   whole loop.  In short, it will be possible to put the stochastic                acceleration model to a very thorough test.                                          Observational consequences in prompt y-ray emission come                   from the nuclear interaction part of the calculation.  A radio                  diagnostic of the low-frequency turbulence in the source will be                developed to provide an observational means of verifying its                    existence.  These results will increase understanding in this                   important area of research.  The overall aim is to improve                      current understanding of particle acceleration at the sun.  These               particles form part of the earth's environment and, therefore,                  this work is important to S/T relations.     //",
