 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular gas plasmas are currently widely used in the                          micreelectronics industry for the deposition and etching of thin                solid films.  Plasma chemical reactor design is largely empirical               at this time because the many processes occurring during deposition             and etching are not well understood.  These processes include:                  creating an electric field which accelaerates electrons to very                 high energies, reaction of these electrons with neutral molecules               to create free radicals, and reaction of the free radicals with the             solid surfaces on which a new surface is deposited or from which                one or more solid layers is removed (etched).  This project is                  aimed at elucidating these mechanisms, the information to be                    ultimately used in the design of plasma reactors.                                                                                                               Dr. Graves has already established an active research program in                the area of plasma chemical reactors.  He plans to implement the                following projects under this grant:                                                 (1) Laser ablation of materials is used, for example, for high                  temperature superconducting film deposition.  He plans a                        combination of laser spectroscopy, optical emission                             spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to detect ablated species                    and their temperatures.                                                         (2) Computer simulation of plasma surface interactions will                     be used to resolve effects that occur at surfaces exposed to                    low temperature plasmas.                                                        (3) A study of particle formation in fluorocarbon and                           chlorocarbon plasmas etching silicon and gallium arsenide.                      (4) Simulation of microwave-sustained and magnetically                          enhanced plasmas used as a replacement for conventional radio                   frequency, capacitively coupled plasma reactors.  The work                      will be used to elucidate how and why they show improved etch                   and deposition characteristics.                                                 (5) Study of surface composition and structure in a plasma                      chamber by using surface analytical tools.                                                                                                                 This grant is to provide research support for Dr. David B. Graves               under the National Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards               Program.",
