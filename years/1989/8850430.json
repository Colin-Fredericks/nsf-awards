 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goals of the project are to establish a three-year primary             mathematics and science leadership project for teachers of grades k-3.          There is a subject matter emphasis on statistics and probability,               measurement, geometry and the physical sciences. The project develops           teachers' leadership capabilities by engendering in them confidence and         competence in mathematics and science through involvement in a                  coordinated program of educational content and methods, including               activity-based lessons, strategies for questioning and responding,              conceptual knowledge, cooperative learning, writing across the                  curriculum, appropriate integration of technology, involvement of               parents and encouragement of minority and female students. Year one             involves ten teams of three teachers representing school districts in           the San Francisco Bay Area in a model local leadership development              institute which provides 120 hours of instruction and a variety of              academic year activities. The teams work together during the year to            develop leadership skills and improve science and mathematics education         in their classrooms. They also conduct workshops for their colleagues.          During the second year the model under development is refined and               disseminated statewide through the California Leadership Program. Seven         new teams of teachers from different locations in California will join          the project. In year three, seven new teams of teachers from the Bay            Area districts are joined by seven teams from different locations in the        nation.                                                                                                                                                         The participant teams are selected from among those recommended by the          school districts that have committed to the project. A total of 114             teachers are to participate of which 72 come from the San Francisco Bay         Area, 21 from throughout California, and 21 from districts nationwide.          There are contributions of $289,819 cost sharing which amount to                289,819/694,060, or 42% of the funds requested from National Science            Foundation. The actual duration of the project is 42 months.",
