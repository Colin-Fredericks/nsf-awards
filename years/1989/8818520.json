 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. Edward W. Kolb of the Fermi National                 Accelerator Laboratory and other members of the Fermilab Astrophysics           Group to collaborate with Prof. Katsuhiko Sato of the University of             Tokyo, Japan, and other Japanese scientists over a period of two                years.  They will perform a systematic study of the expanding                   universe model and its space-time structures, including aspects of              the universe's creation and evolution.                                                                                                                          The purpose of this research is to study the cosmological effects of            the breaking of the natural symmetry which, it is assumed, was                  manifest in the very earliest stages of the existence of the universe.          At high energies the laws of physics have a higher degree of symmetry           than is achieved at present in nature; therefore experience gained in           high-energy physics is relevant to this research.  This experience of           the Fermilab researchers and their Japanese co-workers will be                  applied to theoretical studies of dynamical systems with extra                  dimensions, which may describe the universe in its early stages; of             cosmic strings, and their influence on the creation of particles; of            anisotropic universes and quantum cosmology; of quark-hadron                    transitions in the early universe; and of the failure of conservation           of baryon numbers. Close U.S.-Japanese cooperation made possible in             this program will facilitate the completion of many of these projects,          which are too comprehensive to be tackled by any single group.",
