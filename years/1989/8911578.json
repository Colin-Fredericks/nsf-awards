 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are many different factors which affect the development of                modern science.  Not only are there the intellectual factors                    which drive a particular discipline, but there are also                         influences of adjacent fields, the philosophical milieu in which                the science is imbedded, and the institutional and social factors               which influence the direction of research, the methods to be                    used, and the selection of problems to be addressed.  Professor                 Nye is examining this whole complex of influences in her study of               the development of theoretical chemistry at the turn of this                    century.  Specifically, she is looking at the interactions                      between physics and chemistry in the nineteenth and twentieth                   centuries; the aims of explanation in the modern physical                       sciences, especially the nature of chemical explanation in                      contrast to explanation in physics; and the emergence in the                    twentieth century of a \"theoretical chemistry.\"  She is                         approaching these problems through both the conceptual history                  of science and the social history of science, analyzing                         explanations and theories in chemical textbooks, monographs and                 papers; as well as scientific correspondence and statements on                  the aims and methods of chemistry and physics; and records and                  histories of laboratories and research schools.  As a detailed                  case study within the larger project, she is working on a study                 of aspects of the historical development of physical organic                    chemistry with emphasis on France and England from roughly 1880-                1950.  This case study compares two distinct research schools,                  over three generations, one loosely associated with training in                 London and Manchester and the second with education at the Ecole                Normale Superieure in Paris.",
