 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to their bloodsucking habits, mosquitoes are disturbing annoyances          to the public, as well as being the vectors of many serious diseases.           Many of the species of mosquitoes which pose a health hazard in the             United States breed in salt water.  On the East Coast, saltwater                mosquitoes occur in huge numbers in coastal marshes and their control is        essential for the use and enjoyment of beaches and coastal waterways.           In the West, salt-tolerant mosquitoes are the vectors of very serious           diseases such as viral encephalitis and heartworm.                                                                                                              The larvae of mosquitoes are aquatic.  Dr. Bradley is investigating             mechanisms used by salt-tolerant mosquitoes to survive in this harsh            aquatic habitat.  A better understanding of the mechanisms used by              these mosquitoes may enable us to circumvent these mechanisms and/or            predict the location of mosquitoes populations, thereby reducing these          populations and directing control procedures to the sites where                 intervention is required.                                                                                                                                       This proposal describe investigations into the mechanisms of                    osmoregulation in mosquito larvae. \"Brackish-water\" mosquito larvae are         euryhaline osmoconformers by means of the accumulation of organic               osmolytes in the hemolymph.  Using the brackish-water species Culex             tarsalis, Dr. Bradley will examine a) the time course and pattern of            osmolyte regulation during changes in salinity, b) the role of the              excretory system in eliminating or retaining osmolytes of low molecular         weight and c) the osmolytes used intracellularly for volume and osmotic         regulation.  Phylogenetic evidence indicates that mechanisms associated         with the brackish-water pattern of osmoregulation arose independently           in two genera of mosquitoes.  The Principal Investigator will compare           the mechanisms employed by these independent lineages.  The studies are         designed to increase our understanding of the mechanisms of                     osmoregulation in a taxonomically restricted group of insects                   inhabiting a diverse range of osmoregulatory niches.",
