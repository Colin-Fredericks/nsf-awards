 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Greenleaf will apply the theory of group                         representations to problems in mathematical analysis on nilpotent               Lie groups and their homogeneous spaces. Particular emphasis will               be placed on studying the invariant differential operators on                   homogeneous spaces, describing algebras of such operators in                    terms of  Kirillov's orbit picture, and developing solvability                  criteria for large classes of differential operators on these                   spaces.                                                                             Lie groups arise naturally in mathematics and physics as                    groups of symmetries. An interesting example that lies readily                  at hand consists of all rotations of a sphere, made into a group                by applying rotations successively. Understanding this group is                 important in any situation in which spherical symmetry is                       present. The simplest noncommutative example of a nilpotent Lie                 group (the class of most immediate interest here) is the                        Heisenberg group of upper triangular three-by-three real matrices               with ones on the diagonal.  The Heisenberg group plays a                        fundamental role in the quantum mechanical treatment of the                     harmonic oscillator, as the symmetry group of a certain                         differential equation. The strong relationship between                          differential equations and the representation theory of the                     underlying symmetry group is at the heart of Professor                          Greenleaf's project.",
