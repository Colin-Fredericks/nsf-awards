 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of individuals to move from one jurisdiction to                     another is generally seen as a constraint on the amount of                      redistribution that each jurisdiction within a system of                        governments can undertake.  This project looks more closely at                  this proposition by elaborating and applying a positive theory of               income redistribution by local governments in a federal system. A               model of multi-community equilibrium is developed in which the                  population of each community is endogenously determined and tax                 rates are chosen by majority vote of residents of each local                    jurisdiction.  This model is extended and used to address such                  questions as:  When both central and local governments                          redistribute, how do changes in redistribution by the central                   government affect the amount of redistribution done locally?  How               do changes in intergovernmental grants affect local                             redistribution?  How will consolidation of local governments                    affect redistribution?                                                                                                                                          It has been argued that the use of the property tax to finance                  local public expenditures provides an incentive for localities to               use zoning restrictions to prevent entry by households who would                pay less in taxes than the cost of the public services they                     consume.  It is alleged that housing to serve low- and moderate-                income households is not built, and housing that is built is                    unnecessarily costly and uses excessive amounts of land.  In                    response to these concerns, state courts in the last decade have                taken an increasingly active role in \"fair share\" zoning in which               a locality is directed to accept its fair share of regional low-                and moderate-income housing.  The investigators extend their                    model of the conditions under which communities adopt zoning                    policies that prevent entry by low-income households to study how               various fair share rules affect housing prices, community                       composition, and the types of land-use restrictions that                        communities adopt.                                                                                                                                              This research contributes to our understanding of                               intergovernmental relations.  It provides new insights into the                 way local governments respond to different political and economic               institutions.  It eventually will lead to a comprehensive model                 of U.S. federalism that can be used to explain patterns of                      intergovernmental grants and address timely policy issues.",
