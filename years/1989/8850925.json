The present                 version seeks to train 50 middle and high school teachers (at                   least half of which will represent minorities and most of which                 are disadvantaged) in the New York City metropolitan area. The                  project will focus on \"Energy and Environmental Control\" and will                                                                                               utilize previously-developed materials to (i) allow teachers to                 master the subject, (ii) acquire techniques for the teaching of                 urban environmental studies to children and adolescents, (iii)                  implement environmental science curricula in the classroom                      (including computer-based materials), (iv) develop appropriate                  environmental science activities for their classes, (v) inculcate                                                                                               in the participants a sense of excitement about scientific                      investigations in general, and to (vi) provide the participants                 with problem-solving experiences in science.
