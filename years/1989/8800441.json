The specific aims of the project are to: (1) Identify              and describe information commodities currently in use or under                  development in several different industries;  (2) Develop a                     taxonomy of information commodities that can be used in studying                the evolving information marketplace;  (3) Characterize - by means              of graph theoretic representations -  changes in production and                 marketing practices induced by information commodities in business              organizations.                                                                       The project is intended as a contribution to our                           understanding of the growing importance of information commodities              in the economy.  A sound taxonomy is indispensable for making                   reliable estimates of information-related employment and revenues.              Systematic knowledge of the organizational impacts of information               commodities will become a vital component of strategic planning by              businesses.  Such knowledge will become equally important for                   precise targeting of economic and social policy initiatives by                  government agencies.",
