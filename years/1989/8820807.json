 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interactions between climate and the biosphere have a                      profound influence on the nature of our environment.  The                       biosphere directly affects climate through regulating                           the concentration of CO2 and trace greenhouse gases, and by                     exerting a major influence on the hydrologic cycle.  Climate has                a great effect on the distribution of terrestrial ecosystems, and               the related process of ocean circulation, is a major determinant                of oceanic production and the characteristics of marine                         ecosystems.  Describing the nature of climate-biosphere                         interactions is fundamental to understanding climatic evolution                 and its effects on the planetary ecosystem.                                          The glacial-interglacial time scale is of special relevance                to the interactions between climate and the biosphere here.  Over               this relatively short time interval (102 kyr), climate is not                   influenced by changing continental positions, long-term tectonic                events such as mountain building, or the evolution of the fauna                 and flora.  Rather, climate change is forced by variations in the               distribution of solar insolation on the Earth's surface,                        variations in the atmospheric concentrations of the radiatively                 active gases, and perhaps by incompletely understood tectonic,                  stochastic climatological, and biotic processes as well.  The                   detailed study of Pleistocene biogeochemistry and paleochemistry                is an excellent way to learn about climate-biosphere interactions               and is also crucial to the understanding                                        of how Earth's climate will be influenced by man's alteration of                the planetary environment. This research addresses a wide                       range of issues concerning interactions between the climate and                 the biosphere.  The experimental work will determine the                        concentration and isotopic composition of O2, N2, and Ar in                     trapped air in the Vostok ice core, which preserves a record of                 the ambient environment back to 160 Kyr B.P.",
