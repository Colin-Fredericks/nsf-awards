While relaxation kinetic studies have shown that                    rates of adsorption/desorption reactions are quite rapid, the                   observed rates of approach to equilibrium in batch or column                    reactors are much slower.  This suggests that physical                          transport processes caused by particle association control the                  rates of sorption.  This project involves an investigation of                   the relative importance of surface chemical and physical                        processes on the extent and rate of sorption, by varying the                    particle-fluid hydrodynamics, particle size and porosity, and                   mineralogy of sorbent, using various reactor types including                    batch, column, and differential column reactors and                             determination of how changes in surface and interfacial                         properties affect two-phase flow in porous media.  One key                      factor affecting the transport of a separate organic liquid in                  the subsurface is the properties of the three interfaces of                     the systems:  organic liquid-water, water-solid, and organic                    liquid-solid.  These properties determine wettability which,                    in turn, influence the pore networks through which the two                      liquid phases flow.  Very little is known about how inorganic                   and organic solutes change wettability by changing the                          interfacial properties.                                                                                                                                         This initial increment of support for this Presidential Young                   Investigator is aimed at identifying the effects that mineral                   surfaces and interfacial properties have on transport and                       transformation processes of environmental contaminants in                       groundwater aquifers.  A variety of problems of national                        concern are controlled by surface and interfacial properties                    of geologic subsurface formations.  The release of                              polyehlarinated biphenyls and heavy metals from resuspended                     lake or ocean sediments from dredging operations, the leakage                   of radionuclides into the groundwater from subsurface geologic                  repositories, or the migration of hazardous organic liquid at                   spill and waste disposal sites are examples of the issues                       toward which this research is addressed.",
