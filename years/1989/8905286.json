 "awd_abstract_narration": "The energy level of a cell is determined by the state of three                  interconvertible components:  ATP, the proton motive force, and                 the redox level of the electron transport chain.  Oxygen taxis,                 oxidizable substrate taxis and phototaxis are all behaviors                     governed by sensing of the energy level.  This research will                    identify the energy-level sensor of E. coli and establish the                   principal mechanism of sensing.  An arcB mutant fails to show O2-               taxis and oxidizable substrate (proline) taxis.  A cloned arcB                  locus will be used to identify the sensor by expressing and                     localizing the arcB product.  By comparing cell responses to CN                 and uncoupler that similarly decrease the pmf, but have different               effects on the redox state, it will be found whether a redox                    chain component or pmf per se are immediately responsible for                   energy level sensing.  Understanding of information transduction                will be achieved by isolating pseudorevertants to arcB that will                map in a che gene(s).  This study bridges two fields of                         knowledge:  metabolic regulation and behavior, since arcB                       controls both taxis and O2-dependent transcription.  It is highly               possible that arcB (or a homologous compound) is additionally                   responsible for other instances of so-called \"pmf-dependent\"                    regulation in various bacteria, as well as in mitochondria and                  chloroplasts.                                                                                                                                                   It is of fundamental significance to learn how the bacterial cell               senses its own energy level and uses this information to control                behavior.  A new type of sensor which is substantially different                from known sensors will be explored in this study.  The principal               mechanism of energy level sensing will be elucidated.  Since it                 is possible that mitochondria and chloroplasts \"inherited\" the                  energy level sensor from bacteria, this research may provide a                  model system for studying behavior of higher organisms.",
