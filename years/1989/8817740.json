 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project provides support for a U.S.                          scientist, Dr. Raj. S. Chhikara, Department of Natural                          Sciences, University of Houston-Clear Lake, (UHCL), Houston,                    TX, to spend a sabbatical leave at the Indian Agricultural                      Statistics Research Institute (IASRI) in New Delhi.  The                        cooperating scientist is Dr. Randhir Singh, Senior Professor                    at IASRI.  Chhikara plans to investigate the applicability of                   remote sensing technology to study the Indian environment and                   to research for efficient estimation of agricultural                            resources, including development of efficient sampling                          strategies and crop discriminants and a yield forecasting                       model.  In addition he will finalize a research plan and task                   details for a collaborative research program between his                        university and IASRI.                                                                                                                                           Scope:  The UHCL has been involved for several years in the                     evaluation of the satellite derived crop acreage estimation                     methodology as implemented by the U.S. National Agricultural                    Statistics Service (USDA).  IASRI has a number of experts in                    sampling and experimental design.  The interaction during this                  visit will be beneficial to both sides, and should help extend                  the use of satellite data for the development of agricultural                   statistics on a global basis.",
