 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vitellins (Vts) of insects are phosphoglycolipoproteins which               serve as the major nutrient source for the developing embryo.                   Following its uptake into the oocyte via adsorptive endocytosis,                Vt is stored in vesicles called yolk granules or platelets,                     variably processed and finally degraded in a controlled manner                  during embryo development.  The mechanisms which regulate the                   processing of Vt and control the timing of the breakdown are                    unknown, as is the role of the yolk granule.  Dr. Nordin proposes               to investigate certain aspects of the postovulatory processing of               Vt in Blattella germanica to increase our understanding of this                 phase of insect embryogenesis.  The project has the following                   objectives: 1) Development of procedures for preparation of yolk                vacuolar elements, particularly yolk granules, which have not                   been isolated from insects. 2) An assessment of vacuolar                        acidification in the processing and degradation of Vt in the egg.               3) Purification and characterization of two developmentally-                    expressed enzymes, a protease which participates in the                         postovulatory processing of this Vt and an acid/neutral                         phosphatase, whose activity correlates with the processing and                  which may facilitate Vt utilization.                                            %%%                                                                             During the maturation of the insect egg, protein in synthesized                 and stored as yolk. As much as 90% of the stored proteins in                    these eggs is vittelogenin. Much is known about the synthesis and               uptake of this protein by the maturing oocyte. However very                     little is known about how they are broken down and utilized                     during embryogenesis.",
