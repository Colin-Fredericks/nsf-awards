 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pines, conifers of the genus Pinus, are among the most                     geographically widespread and most economically important trees                 of the northern hemisphere.  Whereas many aspects of the biology                of pines are well known, especially characteristics relevant to                 forestry, evolutionary relationships among the ca. 100 species of               pines and relationships with other living and fossil conifers are               still controversial.  Improved taxonomic knowledge of                           phylogenetic affinities is likely to aid improvements in breeding               techniques and management of forest resources, as well as clarify               genealogical lineages among pines and related conifers.                              Using modern methods of molecular biology, including the new               methods of polymerase-chain-reaction to amplify targeted DNA                    molecules for nucleotide sequencing, Dr. Steven Strauss of Oregon               State University will study samples of all the taxonomic                        subsections of the genus Pinus and determine an evolutionary                    framework through comparisons of DNA differences.  Preliminary                  results from Dr. Strauss's laboratory demonstrate the feasibility               of the techniques; the data promise robust findings on the                      genomic changes that have occurred during evolutionary divergence               of pine species.  When correlated with the well-known record of                 fossil pines, the molecular findings may enable calibration of a                \"molecular clock\" of DNA changes in this group of gymnosperms.",
