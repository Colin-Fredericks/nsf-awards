 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kriete will investigate four problems in which                   operator theory and function theory interact in a fruitful way.                 The first of these is to determine completely the invariant                     subspace lattice of a particular cyclic subnormal operator                      related to the Cesaro operator. The second concerns composition                 operators acting on Bergman spaces. The third is a classical                    question in weighted polynomial approximation which is of                       interest in the study of subnormal operators. The last is about                 the extremal behavior of the norms in the de Branges - Rovnyak                  functional model for contraction operators.                                          The research envisioned here is about analytic functions, a                central preoccupation of mathematics for well over a century.                   They can be defined variously as solutions of a certain simple                  system of partial differential equations, as maps which take                    planar regions to other planar regions in a way that preserves                  angles except at isolated singularities, or as limits of                        polynomials in a suitably precise sense. Corresponding to the                   diverse ways of describing them, analytic functions can be                      studied in a variety of ways. The approach favored in this                      project is operator-theoretic, building up Hilbert spaces of                    functions by taking polynomials and their limits in a particular                fashion, then studying operators on the spaces that arise                       naturally from the functions, e.g. by multiplication or by                      composition. Conversely, these function-theoretic operators often               turn out to be quite general in operator theory, so by studying                 the functions one can learn a great deal about operators in the                 abstract. Professor Kriete's project is to travel this two-way                  street in both directions.",
