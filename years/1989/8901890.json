 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the study of new classes                   of noncommutative noetherian rings. An underlying goal is to                    show that there are many algebras which have a structure                        similar to the enveloping algebra of a semisimple Lie algebra.                  Among those to be studied are some having primitive factor                      rings which have an associated graded algebra which is the                      coordinate ring of a Kleinian singularity. In addition, the                     enveloping algebras of Lie superalgebras, and q-analogues of                    enveloping algebras will be studied with the long-term goal of                  classifying the space of primitive ideals.                                           This research is in the general area of noncommutative                     ring theory. The rings considered in the project are of                         interest in many areas of mathematics including algebraic                       geometry. Given a curve, one of these rings can be associated                   with certain points on the curve. A better understanding of                     these rings and this association will be useful in determining                  the geometry of a given curve.",
