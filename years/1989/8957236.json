 "awd_abstract_narration": "Initial research efforts will focus in two area:  (1) Selective                 Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD):  One of their objectives here is               to determine how \"functionalizing\" surfaces such as Si with H,                  OH, and halides will alter the barriers to film nucleation.                     Experimentally, they will probe the barriers to adsorption and                  nucleation by scattering a seeded supersonic molecular beam of                  precursor molecules from the functionalized surface at various                  well-defined translational energies.  At incident energies where                the barrier height is exceeded, the dissociatively adsorbed                     surface intermediates will be trapped by maintaining the                        substrate at cryogenic temperatures.  Vibrational spectroscopy                  (by electron energy loss) will be employed to identify the                      adsorbed fragments.  The gas phase products, film composition,                  and the degree of epitaxy during deposition will be monitored by                mass spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and low-energy                  electron diffraction, respectively.  In addition, they will apply               scanning tunneling microscopy to study film nucleation at an                    atomic level during CVD.  (2) Heterogeneous Catalytic                           Polymerization:  Initially, studies will focus on olefin                        polymerization.  The polymer chemistry will be modelled by                      attaching alkyl groups to modified Ti and Zr surfaces.                          Precursors such as aluminum alkyls and alkyl iodides will be                    utilized to generate the surface alkyls.  The olefin insertion                  chemistry will be probed by scattering olefin molecular beams                   from active catalysts deposited onto a quartz crystal                           microbalance designed to measure the polymerization rate.  These                studies will permit them to determine the effects of olefin                     translational energy on the polymerization rate.",
