 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mississippi's revised proposal to NSF describes a Program Plan                  designed to increase the competitiveness of selected research                   scientists in the State over a three year period with a goal of                 attaining or exceeding the threshold of national competitiveness.               Reviews were conducted to evaluate the scientific merit and potential           for achieving national competitiveness for the principal                        investigators and their associates.  The revised plan includes 6                components (5 approved herein) in the areas of Chemistry/Materials              Science.  These components represent investigators in Mississippi's             four largest universities (Jackson State University, Mississippi                State University, The University of Mississippi, and The University             of Southern Mississippi) and the University of Mississippi Medical              Center.  The component proposals incorporate various mechanisms to              remove identified barriers to research, including the acquisition of            critical equipment or facilities, addition of technical support                 personnel, increased faculty release time, an reduction of                      professional isolation.  Mississippi proposes cost sharing in a                 ratio of about 3/1.  A management plan (amended) is outlined which              will permit monitoring component project progress to ensure that NSF            goals and the goals of the Mississippi Program Plan are achieved.",
