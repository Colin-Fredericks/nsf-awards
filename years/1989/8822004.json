 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines an extension of recent work on structured                modeling frameworks that includes the development of a prototype                modeling system based on this extended framework.  The proposal is              interesting because it involves a very creative and productive                  investigator in a project that includes elements from three important           areas of operations research: model representation, construction of             modeling systems, and algorithmic design.  The development of a                 prototype mathematical programming modeling system, for which the               database environment would itself generate the models, represents an            important next step in the design and application of modeling systems.          A number of management scientists and other researchers are interested          in this area but the approach suggested in the proposal, which would            apply object-oriented programming languages to address model                    construction, is considered to be novel and highly promising.  The              scope of the project is ambitious but necessarily so, with the                  potential for a high payoff regarding issues of model management that           would be of central theoretical and applied interest to the operations          research and management science research communities.",
