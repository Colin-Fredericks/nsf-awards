 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Pickering is exploring a pragmatist understanding of                        scientific knowledge and practice, an understanding that                        recognizes the orientation of science to technical goals and that               explores the implications of this recognition.   The research                   will involve detailed case studies of important episodes in the                 history of science.  Two such studies already exist:  a study of                Luis Alverez's decision to build a large hydrogen bubble chamber                and a study of Giacomo Morpurgo's search for fractional charges                 on matter--quarks.  He is already engaged in a third dealing with               William Rowan Hamilton's extension of complex-number theory from                number pairs to triplets leading eventually to his \"quaternions.\"               Under this research grant, he will complete this third study and                examine two more: those of Lavoisier and Faraday.                                                                                                               Besides the case studies, Dr. Pickering will draw out the                       implications of the pragmatist analysis for central topics in                   philosophy, sociology and historiography of science.  His                       analysis will acknowledge a trans-situational structure of                      scientific practice, thus setting itself off from the                           ethnomethodological insistence on the radically situated nature                 of practice, while at the same time it draws attention to the                   open-endedness and uncertainty of science, thus setting itself                  off from 'closed' explications of science in terms of method,                   reason or social interests.  The pragmatist approach cuts across                traditional disciplinary approaches to science and promises to                  shed new light on topics such as rationality, realism,                          incommensurability and the social construction of science.  It                  offers a new and significant perspective on what the world and                  human practice in it is like.",
