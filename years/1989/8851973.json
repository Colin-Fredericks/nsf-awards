 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project has two primary goals:  first, to upgrade current          laboratory facilities in the Electrical Engineering Department used in          computer engineering courses; second, to develop a prototype of the             ideal laboratory environment for courses in the computer engineering            area.  Currently-used obsolete single-board computers will be replaced          by modern microcomputer development/prototyping systems.  These                 systems will be supported by engineering workstations for software              development support and hardware debugging support.  The workstations           will be networked to file server for centralized storage and                    input/output sources.  This networked workstation environment,                  communicating directly with hardware development systems and                    laboratory instrumentation, will provide a state-of-the-art capability          resulting in an enhanced laboratory experience for students in                  computer engineering courses.",
