 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaborative study of the transformations of dissolved                  inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) (both               N and C) by phytoplankton and bacterioplankton will be conducted                during the spring plankton bloom period in the Eastern North                    Atlantic Ocean.   Observational studies of DIN and DOM fluxes                   have stimulated network models which consider together DIN and                  DOM flows as inputs and outputs of functionally-define groups of                organisms. Fixation of DIN by phytoplankton and of DOM and NH4 by               bacterioplankton often dominate the flow of nitrogen in the                     euphotic zone.                                                                       Informed by this conceptualization of plankton dynamics, the               study will follow the transformations of nitrogen, beginning with               the transport of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3) to the upper ocean during               the spring, its fixation by phytoplankton, and its regeneration                 and cycling by bacteria and other microplankton.                                The objectives include:   a) precisely quantifying the euphotic                 zone supply, stock and utilization of NO3; b) determining via new               high precision techniques, the reliance of primary production on                new and regenerated nutrients; c) assessing the significance of                 bacterial production in general, of bacteria as competitors with                phytoplankton for NH4; d) determining the impact of microbial                   regeneration of NH4 on the availability of nitrogen for primary                 production; and finally e) evaluating the relationship between                  phytoplankton and bacterial production and the export of PON and                POC over time scales of days to weeks.",
