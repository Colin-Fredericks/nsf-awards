 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports a collaborative research by                 Dr. R. D. Verma, Chemistry Department, Panjab University,                       Chandigarh, India and Dr. J. M. Shreeve, Professor of Chemistry                 at the University of Idaho, Moscow.  The work will focus on                     fluorine chemistry including development of new fluorine                        compounds by introducing fluorine atoms to specific known                       chemicals and characterizing the resulting new materials.  The                  characterization will be via infrared, mass, and NMR spectral                   techniques. The possibilities for major contributions in                        agricultural, health and industrial environments are large.  This               research will require updating facilities at Chandigarh to handle               the difficult compounds involved, including special glass and                   metal vacuum lines, and appropriate reaction vessels.  In                       addition to work in Chandigarh and Moscow, crystal structure                    studies will be carried with Professor Roger Willett at                         Washington State University in Pullman.  Also gas diffraction                   studies on any small volatile molecules of interest will be                     carried out at The University of Tubingen under Professor Heinz                 Oberhammer                                                                                                                                                      Scope:  This project brings together a very active and                          productive Indian chemist with a senior Anerican scientist, who                 is an expert in the field, to build up good research capability                 for fluorine research in India.  Simultaneously the field will                  benefit through the production of new compounds and their                       characterization.  This research could benefit the U.S. and                     India scientifically as well as by applicability of some of the                 results to commercial use in agriculture, health or industry.",
