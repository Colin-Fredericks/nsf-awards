 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to be directed along two closely related                  avenues, namely, the solution of equations and paths of                         equations with homotopies, and the solution of parametric or                    short paths of equations with infinitesimals.  The essence of                   the first avenue is path following the preimage of a                            point,perhaps, in subdivisions.  The essence of the second is                   doing arithmetric with infinitesimals and, transferring                         algorithms, problems and solutions from one ordered field to                    another.  The parametric problem is lifted to an ordered field                  containing an infinitesimal to obtain a single problem, the                     original algorithm is run in the new ordered field, and the                     solution is lowered to the original field to obtain a short                     path of solutions to the parametric problems; this sequence is                  referred to as a lift, solve, and lower.  To see that the two                   avenues are related we note that piecewise affine homotopy                      methods regularly employ infinitesimals and can be used to                      solve parametric problems, and the lift, solve, and lower                       sequence applies to piecewise affine homotopy methods.                               Specific tasks and projects to be studied under these                      headings include variable dimension algorithms for infinite                     dimensional problems, parametric linear programs, average                       analysis of homotopy and simplex methods, matrix scaling,                       design centering, computing dynamic curves, various aspects of                  computing in ordered fields and problem characterization,                       transfer principles in ordered fields, a compiler for                           algorithms computing with an infinitesimal, solution and                        combinatorial analysis of economic models, and parametric                       production problems.",
