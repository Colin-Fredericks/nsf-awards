 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bottle Biology is and exciting concept which turns disposable                   nonbiodegradable plastic soft drink bottles and other throw away                containers into miniature ecosystems, scientific equipment and science          models for teaching the full range of life sciences in grades K-12.                                                                                             Activities will be developed through interaction among research                 scientists in industry and education with the project staff and K-12            teachers.  Materials will focus broadly on the exploration of the               natural, human and agricultural ecology and biotechnology, with emphasis        on the integration of mathematics, physics and chemistry.  Three                categories of materials are envisioned:  1) Basic Bottle Biology:               single or multi/interdependent container systems used to create local or        exotic ecosystems (students collect materials and organisms and                 construct systems), 2) Impact of Science and Technology on Human                Ecology:  explorations using the bottle systems in biotechnology,               bioprocessing, waste and resource management, 3)Modeling Microscopic and        Molecular Worlds:  model building and computer-aided modeling.                                                                                                  Bottle Biology will be implemented by the Wisconsin Fast Plants program         through the newly formed Center for Biology Education on the UW-Madison         campus.                                                                                                                                                         The bottle biology concept strongly impacts science education because it        is unlimited and inexpensive, is scientifically valid and educationally         sound, provides full technical support to teachers and utilizes research        scientists in the creation of instructional materials.  Outreach to             scientists for materials creation will lead to their involvement in             local school districts and to greater public awareness and support for          science education.",
