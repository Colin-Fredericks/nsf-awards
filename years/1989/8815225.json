 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in polymer                             engineering to be conducted by Luis Garcia-Rubio of                             the University of South Florida and Gregorio Meira of                           the Institute for the Technological Development of the                          Chemical Industry (INTEC).  Additional collaborators                            are from the National University of the South and the                           National University of Mar del Plata.  The work will                            involve the further development of analytical                                   procedures for polymers, copolymers and other complex                           systems.  The method to be employed is size-exclusion                           chromatography used on line for the control of                                  copolymerization reactors.  Kinetic models for                                  predicting property distribution in copolymers will be                          validated.                                                                                                                                                      This work will take advantage of the progress already                           being made by these scientists in the characterization                          of copolymers and complex polymer systems.  The                                 prospects for mutual benefit are strong since Prof.                             Rubio's forte is the specifically designed model                                copolymer systems which must be coupled with complex                            data analysis of the size-exclusion chromatograms                               which are the focus of Prof. Meira's work.  The                                 expertise of the participants is complementary.  Real                           progress should result from the collaboration.",
