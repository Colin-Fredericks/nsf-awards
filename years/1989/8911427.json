 "awd_abstract_narration": "10Be is preferentially removed from the ocean at an ocean-                      margin site in the eastern equatorial Pacific at a rate 4-7                     times greater than at 3 open-ocean sites.  This study at other                  areas of the Pacific Ocean will determine whether or not other                  margins act as boundary sinks for 10Be.  Scavenging of 10Be and                 231Pa in open-ocean and in ocean-margin regions will cover a                    range of total particulate matter fluxes and a diversity of                     particle compositions and determine the relative importance of                  several factors which influence scavenging intensity.                           Sediments deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum will also                   be studied to determine whether or not the intensity of                         boundary scavenging changed significantly between the extreme                   range of climatic conditions represented by LGM and Holocene                    times.  Completing the proposed work will achieve more than                     just a better understanding of the marine geochemical cycling                   of radiotracers such as Th isotopes, 10Be and 231Pa.                            Identifying:  1)  the relative importance of different factors                  which regulate the scavening rates of particle-reactive                         elements in the ocean, 2)  the degree to which different types                  of ocean margins act as important boundary sinks for particle-                  reactive elements, and 3)  the extent to which boundary                         scavenging intensity has changed with time, will lead to a much                 better general understanding of the transport and fate of trace                 elements in the ocean.",
