 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cyanobacterium Oscillatoria (Trichodesmium) is the most                abundant and active N2 fixing species in the plankton of tropical               and subtropical seas.  The frequency of blooms, distribution of                 the species and the estimates of rate of N2 fixation and primary                production could be assessed more accurately by use of remote                   sensing when future satellites such as the ocean color scanner                  and Modus I satellites are launched.  Trichodesmium has some                    ideal properties, a unique spectral signature and gas vesicles                  which bring it at or near the surface, thus facilitating remote                 sensing.  This study will use an airborne spectrometer to map the               spectral signature and ocean color in a field program at                        Barbados, West Indies.  Ground truth data will be collected on                  density of Trichodesmium as well as rate of N2 fixation                         (acetylene reduction) and primary production while the                          spectrometer is operated in overflights.  This information will                 be used in developing algorithms for the measurements of                        Trichodesmium distributions and rates of C and N2 fixation.  In                 addition to the field studies, a search of existing images from                 the LANDSAT, CZCS, and manned spacecraft will be made to                        determine whether any images were taken during literature                       reported blooms.  These images will be processed to determine the               best modes of quantifying blooms.  Results from this research                   will be directly relevant to the Global Ocean Flux (GOFS)                       program.                                                                             The microscopic plants that are responsible for most of the                ocean's biological production contain pigments for absorbing                    sunlight just as their terrestrial counterparts do.  These                      pigments have long been used to quantify marine phytoplankton                   through direct chemical analysis of the chlorophyll present in a                given body of water.  Recently, the discovery that phytoplankton                distributions can be measured remotely based on the color they                  impart to the water has opened up exciting opportunities for the                large scale analysis of marine biological production. Dr.                       Carpenter and his co-workers seek to extend the use of remote                   biological sensing by developing optical methods for determining                the spatial extent of a unique type of tropical microorganism                   known as Trichodesmium.  Not only is the distribution of this                   organism of importance to the nutrient cycling and biological                   productivity of tropical areas, but the ability to differentiate                among the different groups of floating organism in surface ocean                water is an important area for future research.",
