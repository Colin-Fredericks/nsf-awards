 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are numerous examples of astrophysical phenomena where                    knowledge of the effect of bombardment of ices by charged                       particles is crucial.  Cosmic ray particles in the Galaxy                       modify gases and organics which are condensed on the mantles of                 interstellar ice grains.  Ions in the solar wind and from solar                 flares, which bombarded ice grains and icy materials in the                     early stages of the evolution of the Solar System, altered the                  chemical nature of those materials which then accreted to form                  objects such as comets.  Bombardment by plasma ions in the                      magnetospheres of the outer planets can alter the spectral                      characteristics of the surfaces of the satellites and rings of                  these planets.                                                                                                                                                  With this grant, Drs. Johnson and Boring, at the University of                  Virginia, in collaboration with colleagues at AT&T Bell                         Laboratories will continue their laboratory study of the                        changes produced in the spectral and chemical properties of icy                 surfaces when bombarded by energetic, charged particles.  The                   experimental results will be used to understand the spectral                    alteration of icy grains and the production of large molecules                  in the interstellar medium, the modification of the surfaces of                 the satellites and rings of the outer planets, and the effect                   of long term ion                                                                bombardment on cometary debris and pre-cometary materials.",
