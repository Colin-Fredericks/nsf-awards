 "awd_abstract_narration": "A regenerable hydrogen-bromine battery is a high energy density                 system with potential applications in space projects, storage                   systems for solar electric power plants, and in transportation                  uses.  The present hydrogen/bromine fuel cell is characterized by               the presence of hydrogen on one side and HBr/Br2 on the other                   side of a solid Nafion and membrane.  Nafion imposes certain                    constraints on the system which limit it's usability.  Due to the               water content required for Nafion (to maintain its ionic                        conductivity) as well as other engineering considerations, a 48                 percent HBr solution is used as a fully charged cathode fluid.                  This requires a large amount of water which, although  inert,                   adds considerable battery weight and volume.  Second, the cycling               of this aqueous liquid reactant concentration and therefore the                 Nernst potential varies continuously.  Third, bromine and bromide               ions migrate to the hydrogen side resulting in the poisoning of                 the electrode.                                                                                                                                                  The specific goal of this Small Business Innovation Research                    (SBIR) Phase I grant is to develop a high efficiency rechargeable               hydrogen-bromine power source.  A novel means to utilize bromine                and hydrogen bromide separately on opposite sides of an anion                   exchange membrane as single phase reactants in the gaseous state                will be explored in this project.  It is expected that this will                alleviate the changing cell voltage with the state-of-charge and                reduce the water needed as well as offer the potential for other                performance improvements.  A central factor is finding a suitable               anion exchange membrane which will support bromide ion transfer                 with high efficiency.  The membrane needs to perform in a water                 free environment or with reduced water concentration and still                  maintain a low ohmic resistance.  Based on preliminary work,                    ruthenium oxide catalyzed carbon as the positive electrode and                  platinum or palladium catalyzed carbon as the negative electrode                will be tested.  Successful completion of this project will yield               a rechargeable hydrogen/bromine battery with relatively constant                Nernst potential and a minimum water requirement.  This will lead               not only to higher efficiency and light weight, but also to                     improved system simplicity and reliability as well as presenting                the potential for further performance improvements.",
