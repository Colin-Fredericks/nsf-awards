 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an investigation of a novel membrane reactor in which carbon            monoxide and hydrogen are catalytically converted into methanol.  This          is an important reaction, for example, in the conversion of syngas to           liquids.                                                                                                                                                        It is proposed that under conditions of strong adsorption of the                methanol on the membrane surface, for a small enough pore size through          the membrane, a surface diffusion mechanism may dominate transport              through the membrane and give a higher permeability of methanol than            one or more of the reactants.  This expedited award will allow the              investigator to search for conditions under which methanol is                   selectively passed by a ceramic membrane.  A major economic impediment          to more widespread use of the technology to produce renewable fuels is          that the equilibrium constant is very small, resulting in very small            conversions of carbon monoxide to methanol per pass.  To use a                  membrane reactor to improve conversions by selectively removing                 methanol from the reaction mixture, conditions must be found under              which a ceramic membrane will selectively pass the reaction product,            methanol, out of the reactor, thus resulting in much higher yields and          much better economics.",
