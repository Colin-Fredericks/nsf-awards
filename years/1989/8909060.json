 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                              Organometallic Chemistry Program Dr. Richard Eisenberg will                     take advantage of a new phenomenon recently discovered in his                   laboratory, para hydrogen induced polarization, in the study                    the mechanisms of a variety of organometallic reactions. This                   phenomenon leads to greatly enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance                 signals, with the promise of significant improvements in one                    ofthe most important tools used in the study of metal-hydrogen                  interactions.                                                                                                                                                   The focus of the project is the chemistry of platinum group                     complexes. For the complexes under study most of the ligands                    are bridging and non-bridging di(tertiary phosphine) groups,                    with some hydride ligands as well. A major thrust of the                        project is para hydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) in which                   unusual NMR enhancements result when hydrogenation and hydrogen                 addition reactions are performed using para enriched                            dihydrogen. Observation of PHIP provides definitive evidence of                 a reaction mechanism involving pairwise transfer of dihydrogen.                 The specific studies to be performed will: a) analyze PHIP for                  its kinetic significance; b) use PHIP to observe catalytically                  significant hydrides and intermediates: c) examine asymmetric                   hydrogenation and cluster hydrogenolysis reactions using para                   enriched dihydrogen; and d) use PHIP to enhance NMR signals in                  P-31 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy. A second thrust focuses on                      metal complex-promoted reactions of silanes with the principal                  objective of catalyzing Si-Si bond formation. One series of                     studies will investigate the reactions of primary silanes with                  binuclear complexes leading initially to complexes with                         bis(silylene) bridges. Subsequent coupling of SiRH units will                   be probed through coordination control of the metal centers, by                 redox-promoted reactions, and by photolyses. Removal of                         dihydrogen generated in dehydrogenative coupling of silanes                     will be done by hydrogenating an appropriate olefin. In a                       related series of studies mononuclear bis- and tris(silyl)                      complexes will be examined with regard to Si-H vs Si-Si                         reductive elimination. Other reactions of silyl complexes such                  as hydrosilation will be studied also.",
