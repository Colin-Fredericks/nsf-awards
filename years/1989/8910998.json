 "awd_abstract_narration": "The manner in which the growth of each of the component                    parts of the human skull--the face, neurocranium, and                           basicranium--interrelates and affects each other has been a                     problem in physical anthropology which has alluded complete                     understanding for a long time.  A variety of experimental                       techniques has been used on laboratory animals, but knowledge                   gained has not always been applicable to humans because of unique               features in human growth.  This study will investigate a so-                    called natural experiment--the intentional binding of the cranial               vault by various groups of American Indians--to determine whether               intentional binding, which retards growth of the bound part,                    affects the growth of the other components of the skull.                        Although artificial cranial deformation has been studied in the                 past, conclusive answers to this question have not been                         forthcoming due in part to the use of inadequate measuring                      techniques.                                                                                                                                                          This study will utilize a relatively new analytical                        technique, finite element scaling, to measure and evaluate                      differences between deformed and non-deformed crania from the                   same skeletal series.  The data obtained in this study will be                  important in evaluating various hypotheses about the                            relationships of the cranial components.",
