 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will bring together approximately 25                         ecologists and scientists in related disciplines to discuss the                 response of ecological systems to large-scale spatial and                       temporal variation in their environment.  It will focus on: 1)                  the basic research that is required to understand and predict the               responses of ecological systems to environmental change, and 2)                 the practical application of ecological knowledge to address the                serious changes in the environment of the earth caused by the                   growing human population.  The goal of the workshop is to reach a               consensus on a modest number of areas where increased research                  support may be expected to result in major advances within the                  next decade.  These finding will be presented in two                            publications: 1) a scientific article in a major                                interdisciplinary journal, and 2) a non-technical booklet                       designed for distribution to government officials and funding                   agencies.",
