 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Dean and Graybill will continue their dendroclimatological                 work to reconstruct past climates in the United States Southwest.               Because the size and configuration of annual growth rings in                    trees are affected by changes in rainfall and other environmental               variables, it is possible to use them to reconstruct past                       climatic change.  Also, since tree rings are deposited on an                    annual basis, they permit an accurate dating of this change.                    Drs. Dean and Graybill will add to an already substantial data                  base through the collection and analysis of additional cores from               living trees in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado.  They                  will correlate this information with data obtained from weather                 stations and apply the results to older samples derived from                    archaeological contexts.  They will reconstruct changing annual                 and seasonal variations in precipitation, temperature, growing                  season length, the Palmer Drought Severity Index, and changes in                stream flow.                                                                                                                                                    The Southwestern United States saw the rise, in pre Hispanic                    times, of complex cultures which covered large portions of                      several states.  These archaeological complexes expanded and                    contracted over time and the largest disintegrated before the                   arrival of the Spanish.  Archeologists have hypothesized that                   these cultural changes were in fact responses to variation in the               environment and that the Southwest offers an excellent laboratory               to study the relationship between environmental change and human                response.  The tree ring data will significantly aid in analyses                of this kind.                                                                                                                                                   This research will be important not only for archaeologists, but                also paleoecologists and scientists interested in climate                       dynamics and changes.  Changes in temperature and precipitation                 which are of such concern today occurred many times in the past.                It is important both to understand them and to learn how human                  societies responded.",
