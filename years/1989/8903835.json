 "awd_abstract_narration": "The protein encoded by the recA gene of E. coli, Eco RecAp, is of               paramount importance in several processes of DNA metabolism: (1)                general genetic recombination (2) repair of chemical and                        irradiation damage to DNA, (3) UV mutagenesis and (4)                           coordinating repair, replication, and cell division after DNA has               been damaged.  Analogues of recA with similar activity have been                found in five bacterial species closely related to E. coli and                  nine distantly related species.  Proteins with activities of                    EcoRecAp have now been isolated from fungal, insect, plant and                  mammalian cells.  Of all these EcoRecAp has been most thoroughly                studied genetically and enzymatically.  Still, however, we have                 only limited insight into the structure of EcoRecAp and how that                structure relates to enzymatic activity.  The standard technique                of x-ray crystallography has been applied to EcoRecAp but has so                far been unsuccessful in revealing its structure because of the                 flexibility of the protein.  Computer analysis has detected                     similarities of the central part of EcoRecAp with a homogeneous                 group of proteins, called parallel aB proteins.  Half of this                   proposal consists of genetic tests of the three-dimensional model               of this central part, which has been called the core.  The tests                consist in part of averaging predictions for RecAps from several                species, a method used successfully to predict the                              three-dimensional structure of another parallel aB protein.  The                test also consist in part of examining the predicted results of                 altering specific amino acids.  These tests will help refine the                model, whether the predictions are confirmed or contradicted, by                a process akin to successive approximations.  The other half of                 the proposal concerns the structural and functional roles of the                amino and carboxy terminal regions of EcoRecAp.  These are the                  regions whose structure was not predicted in the model of the                   core.  Two monoclonal antibodies will be studied for their                      effects on EcoRecAp.  One, MAb4B4, binds to amino terminal amino                acids; the other, MAb156, binds to carboxy terminal amino acids.                Binding competition of the two antibodies may reveal how closely                these regions are situated in the structure of EcoRecAp.  Effects               of each antibody on six in vitro activities of EcoRecAp may                     reveal how these regions participate in the functions of the                    protein.",
