 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pituitary hormone, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), is derived                   from the precursor protein, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC).  This                  precursor not only contains the sequence of ACTH, but also the                  sequences of alpha-melanotropin, beta-melanotropin and the                      endogenous opiod peptide, beta-endorphin.  POMC is synthesized in               two regions of the pituitary as well as in distinct sets of                     neurons in the central nervous system.  Although this                           biosynthetic pathway is present in all extant vertebrates, few                  studies have attempted to explain how this biosynthetic pathway                 evoluted.  Insights into this issue can be obtained from studies                on species that appear to exhibit traits that can be considered                 ancestral.  This study will focus on two \"mainline species,\" the                holostean fish, Amia calva, and the Australian lungfish,                        Neoceratodus forsteri.  These species occupy pivotal positions in               the phylogeny of the bony fish.  The holostean fish are on a line               of evolution which gave rise to the teleosts, the modern bony                   fish, and the lungfush are on the line of evolution which gave                  rise to the tetrapods.  The projects in this proposal will focus                on the biochemistry of the POMC end products in these species.                  These studies will provide new information on the evolution of                  the pro-opiomelanocortin biosynthetic pathway and will further                  our understanding of the mechanisms involved in production of                   chemical signals by endocrine cells.",
