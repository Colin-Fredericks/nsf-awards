 "awd_abstract_narration": "Faculty who teach primarily undergraduates are being exposed to the             excitement and vitality of modern laser/optics technology and science.          The activities are being carefully structured to illustrate connection          between fundamental optical concepts and well focused applications              involving advanced and sophisticated equipment.  Basic concepts are             those normally taught in a second or third year optics segment or               course at the undergraduate level.  The result is an increased                  understanding of the flow from basic to applied on the part of the              participants, who will gain direct, hands on experience with recent             developments in the rapidly advancing field of optics.  The personal            experience gained by the participants is translating into better                instruction through both lecture and laboratory development and                 motivation of students toward optics careers.  The motivation and the           connection of these workshops with universities offering graduate               training is resulting in greater opportunities for the participant's            students.                                                                                                                                                       By holding these workshops in conjunction with the Laser Institute of           America's annual meetings in Florida, Massachusetts and California in           each of the next three years the opportunities for undergraduate                faculty are greatly expanded.  In addition the annual meeting enhances          the educational opportunities available to the participants.  Follow up         for the participants and their students is designed to provide                  continuing program improvement, and maximum long-term impact.  A                laboratory manual is being produced as a part of the workshops and              follow-up activities.                                                                                                                                           Cost sharing by the participants for their travel and the Laser                 Institute for publicity will constitute about 20 per cent of the cost           of the program.",
