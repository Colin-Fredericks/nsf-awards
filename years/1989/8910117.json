 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds detailed theoretical models describing                      economic institutions.  The models employ the methods of the                    theory of noncooperative games in extensive form, paying careful                attention to issues of information and timing of actions.  The                  objective is to understand better the efficiency properties of                  these institutions, why they exist and persist, and how to                      improve their performance.  The institutions modeled span micro                 and macroeconomics.  One part of the work focuses on detailed                   modeling of market institutions for determining the prices and                  quantities in transactions.  A major element of this work is to                 study the possible emergence of involuntary unemployment in                     macroeconomic models with explicit microfoundations.  The                       project already has demonstrated how labor rationing emerges                    naturally from business decision making.  This work is                          generalized.  The project seeks to determine whether appropriate                government policies or institutional changes such as the use of                 the labor compensation contracts advocated by Martin Weitzman in                his book \"Share Economy\" can reduce involuntary unemployment.                                                                                                   The other part of the work focuses on the internal organization                 of the firm.  Major elements in this part of the work are the                   concept of influence cost and the impact of technological change                on organization.  For example, the investigator demonstrated that               personnel departments should be unresponsive, even to efficiency                arguments, so as to prevent line managers' spending too much time               trying to get good deals for their people and, in turn, to                      discourage employees' attempting to get managers to exert                       influence to their benefit.  This work will be generalized into a               novel theory of bureaucratic structure.  Members of the                         bureaucracy are rewarded on grounds other than immediate                        organizational performance in order to reduce influence costs.                                                                                                  This research is part of the emergence of a comprehensive,                      rigorous theory of organizations that is improving the scientific               rigor of research on political and economic institutions and                    providing valuable new insights into a wide range of economic                   issues.  The research on models of market organization and the                  foundations of macroeconomics is especially important because it                synthesizes and reconciles two different bodies of theory that                  often give conflicting results about the possibility of                         persistent involuntary unemployment.  The research on the                       internal organization of firms should provide new insights into                 ways of improving firm performance.",
