 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. John                 Brady, California Institute of Technology, and Dr. George Bossis,               Laboratoire de Physique de la Matiere Condensee, University of                  Nice, France.  The objective of this research is to study the                   transport properties of fractal aggregates and polymers by dynamic              simulation.                                                                                                                                                     The past several years has seen an increased interest in the                    transport properties of condensed matter in the form of colloids,               ceramics and polymers.  Part of this interest arises from the                   practical uses of such substances, motivated by the potential to                design and manufacture materials with novel and desired                         properties.  A large part of the recent theoretical activity in                 these research areas has been sparked by the recognition that                   collodial aggregates and polymers have an important geometrical                 feature in common--they are fractals.  A fractal is an object that              is not space filling; the mass does not grow as the radius cubed,               but rather to some other power called the fractal dimension.                    Fractals also possess a dilational symmetry; that is, the object                looks the same at least statistically, regardless of the                        magnification used.  These two aspects, particularly the dilational             symmetry, have allowed researchers to make simple and far reaching              predictions about polymer structure and properties.  The transport              properties of polymers and collodial aggregates depend on the basic             fractal microstructure, and an understanding of the relationship                between structure and property will aid in predicting and                       controlling the manufacture of these microstructured materials.  In             this project, the investigators will use a general                              molecular-dynamics-like method which they have developed together,              called Stokesian dynamics, with the aim of providing a                          computational bridge betwen analytical theories and laboratory                  experiments.  A major focus of the work will be to assess the                   importance of hydrodynamic interactions and the restrictions                    imposed by the preaveraging assumption on aggregate and polymeric               behavior.  This project will benefit from the specific expertise of             Dr. Bossis in statistical mechanics and Dr. Brady's background in               fluid mechanics.",
