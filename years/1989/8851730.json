 "awd_abstract_narration": "Old Dominion University believes that their curriculum is deficient in          that undergraduate students in Science and Engineering are not educated         in the theory and practice of high performance vector/parallel                  computing.  They believe that there is a pressing need for this kind of         education at the undergraduate level in view of growing importance of           large scale computing in Science and Engineering and the proliferation          of supercomputers.  This project is intended to introduce Senior                students in the Science and Engineering to the theory and practice of           high performance vector and parallel computing.  This will be centered          around a laboratory where each student will obtain hands-on experience          in programming vector and parallel computers, both SIMD and MIMD.  The          students will measure the performance of the program and compare it to          the prediction obtained form simple complexity analysis.  The emphasis          will be on the analysis and implementation of a few representative              examples chosen from computational problems in Science and Engineering,         of course tailored to the capabilities of undergraduates.",
