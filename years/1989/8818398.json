 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Baldwin will continue his investigation of the                              stabilization forces of short helical peptides.  He has                         previously shown that short peptides are able to form                           monomeric  -helices in aqueous solution.  Helical stability                     depended strongly on residue spacing in this set of peptides                    and therefore helix stabilization by salt bridges was likely.                   He will now extend this study to include other pairs of                         charged residues potentially able to form salt bridges in                       order to evaluate the helix-stabilizing properties of these                     salt bridges, if they exist, and to investigate further the                     mechanism of  -helix stabilization by salt bridges and non-H-                   bonded ion pairs.                                                                                                                                               Salt bridges formed by short helices of de novo design are                      being studied by only a few scientists.  The study of                           designed helices is closely related to the study of  -helix                     formation by naturally occurring peptides derived from helix-                   containing segments of peoteins.  The broad significance of                     this work is that short helices, formed at early stages in                      the folding process, have the ability to play a directing                       role in the pathway of protein folding.***//",
