 "awd_abstract_narration": "The changing relationship of science with philosophy is of great                importance for the discipline of philosophy of science.  A change               of great significance is occurring in philosophy which, under                   logical positivism, sought to prescribe what \"good\" science is.                 Today, philosophers tend to view the role of philosophy of                      science not to be so much prescriptive but rather more                          descriptive.  Dr. Ryckman, a recent Ph.D. in philosophy from                    Columbia University, will be using this postdoctoral fellowship                 to work with Dr. Arthur Fine at Northwestern University on the                  history of the relationship of science and philosophy.  He will                 examine the early writings of F. A. M. Schlick, Hans                            Reichenbach, and Rudolf Carnap as well as other logical                         positivists.  Dr. Ryckman will focus his attention on the                       perceived impact of developments in science, in particular, the                 theory of relativity, on more traditional philosophical concerns                and issues.  He will try to establish lines of connection and                   divergence with other philosophical trends of the time,                         especially the older positivism and neo-Kantianism.  He will also               consider these early writings as innovative and exploratory                     attempts to redefine the terms of interrelation and mutual                      dependence of science and philosophy, attempts which were lost                  sight of in the later militant period of logical positivism, but                which retain much of value and of interest to philosophers of                   science and others who reflect on the nature of science and its                 role in society, today.",
