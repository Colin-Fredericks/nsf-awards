 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over forty years of intermittent observations have                         established that the aurora emits radio noise which can be                      observed on the ground.  Surprisingly, despite the intensity                    with which the aurora is studied, very little is known about                    these radio emissions, their frequency-time characteristics,                    their occurrence statistics, or their generation mechanisms.                    This grant will support an investigation into the spectrum of                   radio emissions from the aurora in the frequency range 0.2-20                   MHz using an inexpensive ground-based \"smart\" system,                           consisting of a radio receiver and data storage device                          controlled by a small computer.  This will be located near                      Fairbanks, Alaska at the site of previous measurements of                       auroral radio emissions, thus saving time and expense of                        finding a low-noise location.  Other instruments are located                    nearby to support the measurements, and the Geophysical                         Institute in Fairbanks will provide on-site assistance.  The                    scientific motivation for this grant may be summarized as                       follows: 1)  To better characterize the earth's radio                           environment; 2)  To study space plasma physics processes from                   the ground by observing the radio signatures of those                           processes; and 3)  To explore possibilities of using radio                      emissions as an index of auroral activity.  Although radio                      emissions comprise a small fraction of the total energy of the                  aurora, they may provide important clues to the more energetic                  processes, in analogy to the way in which solar radio emissions                 have been used to infer the processes taking place in the solar                 corona.",
