 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mississippi Museum of Natural Science proposes to build on its              program of activities that involve children in science and bring them           into contact with the approaches, objects and equipment that scientists         use, with each activity designed to stimulate thinking and heighten             interest in science.  Cardinal features of the program are the                  development of hands-on exhibits, science kits for classroom use and a          studied tie with the children's television program, \"3-2-1 Contact.\"            The goals are to coordinate these activities with hands-on science              activities for students in grades 3-6, and to coordinate classroom              activities with those at the museum, which conducts \"3-2-1 Contact Days\"        throughout the year when students come to the museum and take part in           experiments, observations and enrichment lessons and actively manipulate        museum objects.                                                                                                                                                 The museum now will refine the program components, including improvement        and duplication of the hands-on kits, continuation of the workshops for         elementary teachers and development of new participatory exhibits               dealing with insects and endangered species, and will present them to an        expanded audience.  One-third of the children in the state live below           the poverty level, and fifty per cent represent minority populations.           As most of these children lack such out-of-school experiences these             informal science activities are particularly meaningful.",
