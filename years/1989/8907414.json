 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three-year study of convective cloud systems, with               emphasis on their interaction with large-scale circulations and                 their effects on the Earth's radiation budget.  The cloud types                 to be studied include cumulus clouds and also the stratiform                    anvil clouds and cirrus clouds that are associated with                         convective cloud systems                                                             The key problems to be addressed are:                                      1. What is the nature of the physical couplings between upper-                  tropospheric stratiform anvil and cirrus clouds and deep cumulus                convection, and how do the clouds and convection interact with                  the large-scale circulation?, 2. How can the radiative effects of               convective cloud systems be determine when the cloudiness                       fluctuates significantly on unresolved scales?, 3. What are the                 statistics of convective cloud systems in the tropics, and what                 are the spatial distributions of the resulting radiative and                    latent heating that drive the large-scale circulation?                               The proposed research will address these problems through:                 1. analysis of recent observational results; 2. theoretical                     studies of the relations among cloud water (or ice), cloud                      amount, and cloud optical properties; 3. high-resolution                        numerical simulations of mesoscale convective systems and the                   associated upper level cloudiness; 4. synthesis of results in                   the form of a new parameterization of convective cloud systems;                 and 5. analysis of the results of GCM simulations of the                        interactions of convective cloud systems with large-scale                       circulations produced by this new parameterization.",
