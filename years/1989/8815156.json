 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Doctoral Dissertation Research proposal, the                       principal investigator and his doctoral student seek support for                the study of genetic variation in North American cervids (deer,                 elk, caribou and moose) both within and between species using the               modern techniques of DNA-DNA hybridization of genes that occur                  within the nucleus and mitochondria (mtDNA) of cells.                           Supplemental analysis of mtDNA will be carried out using a                      technique termed restriction enzyme analysis. Specific goals are:               1) to reconstruct an evolutionary history for the 4 North                       American genera, Alces (moose), Rangifer (caribou), Cervus (elk)                and Odocoileus (deer), 2) to determine whether mtDNA and single                 copy nuclear DNA, which comprises the genes inherited through the               nucleus, have comparable rates of evolution within the group and                to calibrate the molecular clock against the fossil record, 3) to               construct detailed evolutionary histories for populations and                   subspecies of the several species and to analyze the genetic                    structure of species populations in context of Pleistocene                      glacial history and barriers to gene flow (for example, mountain                ranges, prairies, etc). This study will help us understand the                  roles of genetic variation, habitat and history in the origin and               preservation of these important game animals and enable us to                   make informed decisions about their future management.",
