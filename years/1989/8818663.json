 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the identification and                        molecular characterization of developmentally active plant genes.               This will be done by isolating insertional mutants. So far in Dr.               Redei's laboratory and in that of his collaborators, about 1,500                Arabidopsis plants have been regenerated after transformation by                a variety of T-DNA vectors, including different fusion vectors.                 The insertion of T-DNA by Agrobacterium in about 1% of the cases                inactivated various genes as revealed by the appearance of                      recessive mutations absolutely linked to inserts.  These inserts                serve also as a molecular tag on the plant genes and promoters,                 permitting their isolation and molecular and functional                         characterization. A number of developmentally regulated promoters               have been identified and the reisolated and sequenced gene                      fusions indicate that the T-DNA insertion does not necessarily                  involve structural rearrangements, losses or additions.                         Therefore the experiments outlined appear useful for the study of               developmentally regulated genes in depth and under native                       conditions. Because of the high efficiency of the transformation                system, Dr. Redei expects to cover with gene fusions and                        insertions a substantial part of the entire genome and obtain                   developmental information on a representative collection of                     Arabidopsis genes. This project is a collaborative effort between               the University of Missouri, Columbia and the Max-Planck Institut,               Cologne.                                                                        %%%                                                                             Arabidopsis has become one of the key model systems for the study               of plant development. This is due in part to its short life cycle               and to its small genome size. Dr. Redei's work will generate a                  series of mutants which could prove to be a extremely valuable                  resource for the research community.",
