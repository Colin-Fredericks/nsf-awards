 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Professor J.             Ophir of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston,              and Dr. D.E. Robinson of the Commonwealth Department of Health,                 Sydney, Australia.  The investigators will develop techniques for               estimating the speed of sound in living bodies, particularly in the             human liver, and will join, in this work, the independent efforts               that have been under way for some time in Houston and in Sydney.                                                                                                The collaboration will involve the sharing of knowledge derived from            simulations, and phantom and in vitro tissue studies at the University          of Texas; and of information obtained from clinical results in                  Sydney.  The U.S. investigators will benefit from the experience of             their Australian counterparts in the implementation of clinical                 apparatus, and the Australians will in turn benefit from the experience         of the U.S. investigators with a complementary beam tracking                    measurement method.  This study could advance the ability to diagnose           liver disease, and certain other  organic diseases, using ultrasound.",
