 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the early 1960's, it is believed that the primary mechanism               by which steroid hormones exert their widespread effects is                     through the activation of the genome.  In hormone responsive                    cells, such as the brain, the steroids bind to specific protein                 receptors.  These steroid receptor complexes then bind to                       acceptor sites in the nucleus to alter gene expression.  However,               the activation of specific genes is too slow to account for some                of the observed rapid neurophysiological and behavioral responses               to steroids.  Recent evidence indicates that the glucocorticoids,               stress hormones of the adrenal, directly modulate receptors for                 GABA, a neurotransmitter that is a potent inhibitor of nerve cell               activity.  Moreover, Dr. Moore has demonstrated that these stress               hormones have a robust and rapid effect on behavior.  The                       doctoral-dissertation research of Miles Orchinik will determine                 whether the rapid behavioral changes to stress hormones are                     mediated by their action on GABA receptors.  Using sophisticated                state-of-the-art techniques, such as radioligand binding, ion                   flux studies, and quantitative receptor autoradiography, these                  studies will advance our understanding of how steroid hormones                  rapidly modify behaviors during periods of stress.",
