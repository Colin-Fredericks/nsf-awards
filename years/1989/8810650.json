 "awd_abstract_narration": "The formation of precipitation is of great scientific as                  well as practical significance.  It is known that atmospheric ice               plays a crucial role in the development of precipitation, but not               all the mechanisms by which ice forms in clouds are well                        understood.  One of the most fundamental problems facing cloud                  physicists is explaining the enhancement of the number of ice                   particles in clouds beyond what would be expected from the number               of ice nucleating particles that are available in the atmosphere.                       Under previously sponsored NSF research, the Principal                  Investigators have been involved in research on ice formation in                clouds.  Major findings include that, in certain types of clouds,               ice formation occurs and appears to be enhanced near cloud top.                 These observations imply a fundamentally different mechanism for                ice enhancement than the currently accepted process.                                 This proposed research will continue field studies of ice                  in clouds.  Primary goals are to determine the origins and                      mechanisms of formation of ice particles with particular emphasis               on ice at cloud tops.  These goals will be pursued through the                  acquisition of data sets in cumulus and altocumulus clouds.  The                data sets will include information from new airborne instruments                which will provided improved capabilities in detecting ice,                     determining fine scale structure of streamers of ice within                     clouds and in measuring humidity.",
