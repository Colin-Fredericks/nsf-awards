 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thin films play an ever more important role in the U.S.                    electronics, automotive, jewelry and related industries whose                   competitiveness in the international area depends on developing                 new and better ways to produce coatings having the best                         characteristics for specific applications.  This award establishes              an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Thin Film                and Interface Research (CTFIR) jointly between Brown University                 and the University of Rhode Island.  Research at the CTFIR will                 aim at solving the scientific and technological problems which are              impeding the development of such new thin films and coatings, and               will focus on: characterization of films and interfaces; methods                of deposition (especially high through-put methods such as                      sputtering) and growth of metal, semiconductor and insulator                    films; coatings for corrosion resistance in harsh environments;                 coatings for surgical implants; coatings for various electronic                 applications; thin film semiconductor devices like solar cells and              transistors; films for passivating layers for semiconductor                     devices; films for optical coatings in high power laser and fiber               optic applications; polymer films including Langmuir-Blodgett                   films and high temperature superconducting films produced by                    sputtering.                                                                          The Industry Advisory Board for the Center has been                        established with 12 industry members, and the State of Rhode                    Island will provide $1M to equip a state-of-the-art diagnostics                 laboratory.                                                                          This Center was coordinated with Dr. J. Larsen-Basse, Acting               Program Director for Materials Engineering and Processing.                           The Program Manager recommends that Brown University be                    awarded $100,000 each year for five (5) years for the initiation                of this joint Center between Brown University and the University                of Rhode Island.  As a Co-Center institution, the University of                 Rhode Island will receive a subcontract from Brown University for               approximately half ($50,000) of the NSF annual support for the                  five year period.                                                                    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager                  and/or Director of The Division of Cross-Disciplinary Research                  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal                   criteria, including the following: (1) extent to which                          university/industry interaction and collaboration is developing;                (2) extent to which the support base for the center is expanding;               (3) extent to which a robust research program is developing.  If                review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support              of the next period of this continuing grant.",
