 "awd_abstract_narration": "Primates are highly social animals with large brains and advanced               levels of intelligence.  Previous comparative studies of primate                intelligence have overlooked the social dimension of cognition,                 and have instead focused on highly repetitive problem-solving                   tasks.  Recently, some researchers have proposed that certain                   forms of social intelligence, related to the attribution of                     intent and purpose, may be limited to the great apes and humans.                If these speculations turn out to be correct, many ideas                        concerning the social function of intelligence and the emergence                of complex forms of social skills in the earliest humans will                   need to be revised.                                                                                                                                             In this study a series of experiments will evaluate the                         proposition that chimpanzees use their own experiences to infer                 the experiences of others and attribute intent and responsibility               to others, whereas rhesus monkeys do not.  The research will                    offer important clues about cognitive capacities linked to food                 sharing, complex social roles, and non-material aspects of human                culture.  More importantly, it will provide a critical test of                  the existing model which postulates that self-awareness exists,                 not in monkeys, but only in humans and in the higher anthropoids                most closely related to humans.",
