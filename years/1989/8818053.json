 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genetical research on wild populations of house mice                       provides insight into the structure and dynamics of those                       populations.  Knowledge of the natural genetic variation will                   enhance understanding of the genome of the laboratory mouse,                    which is a model system for investigating the basis of many                     diseases.  Such knowledge will contribute to understanding what                 makes house mouse populations so successful and to knowledge of                 the genetic basis of evolution.  In this project, the researchers               will determine the nucleotide sequences of genes on the                         mitochondrial chromosome (mtDNA).  MtDNA is of use in                           evolutionary studies because it evolves more rapidly than nuclear               DNA.  The data obtained will be used to estimate the rate of                    mtDNA evolution in mice and to compare it with the rate already                 measured in humans and other animals.  The theories will be                     tested that generation time is a key factor in molecular                        evolution and that rodents have evolved significantly faster than               other creatures at the molecular level.  The results will also be               used to investigate further the genetic interactions in the                     European hybrid zone between Mus domesticus and Mus musculus mice               and to determine evolutionary relationships among various rodents               closely and distantly related to house mice, with emphasis on                   cases where anatomical and fossil data have led to inferences in                conflict with the available molecular evidence.                                      A new technique will be used to obtain the DNA sequences.                  Starting with the DNA in a tiny amount of tissue, the polymerase                chain reaction is used to amplify specific segments of DNA up to                a million-fold; the amplified product can then be sequenced                     directly.  Because this method avoids the tedious steps of                      cloning and searching for the desired clone among thousands or                  millions of others, it makes possible obtaining DNA sequence data               on a large scale.  Routine surveys at the DNA sequence level of                 hundreds of animals captured and then released after collection                 of a drop of blood or a few hairs are now feasible.  Furthermore,               because the traces of modified DNA that abound in museum skins                  and other samples suffice as the starting material, the world's                 storehouse of specimens accumulated over a century or more is at                last accessible to molecular genetic analysis.",
