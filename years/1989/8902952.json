The inequalities, which compare the weighted                     norm of a given function with that of its image under some                      transform (using possibly a different weight) are fundamental                   in the analysis of differential equations.  Solutions of the                    equations are expressed in terms of integral transforms, often                  involving singular kernels.  If one can establish basic,                        weighted inequalities relative to the transforms, it is then                    possible to show that solutions can be found within given                       classes of functions.                                                                The analysis involves fractional integrals, Sobolev and                    Poincare inequalities, interpolation inequalities, Poisson                      integrals and Fourier transforms.  Degenerate elliptic and                      parabolic equations, including vector fields other than the                     gradient fields will be studied.  In addition, work will be                     done seeking conditions for the global existence of positive                    solutions for a class of semilinear degenerate elliptic                         equations.                                                                           Work is also planned in determining the extent to which                    classical inequalities can be carried over to homogeneous                       spaces.  Emphasis will be placed on the question of whether the                 Sobolev and Poincare inequalities for first order vector fields                 (other than the ordinary gradient) can be carried over to these                 spaces.",
