 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Prof. Ben Chu of the State University of New             York at Stony Brook to collaborate with Prof. Takuhei Nose of the Tokyo         Institute of Technology, Japan, over a period of two years.  They will          investigate how the behavior of binary polymer blends differs from              that of binary fluid mixtures.  Polymer blends may behave in at least           two different ways, depending upon whether they consist only of high            or only of low molecular weight fractions; or of high molecular                 weight fractions dissolved in a solvent of small molecules.  Study of           the cross-over between these two modes of behavior will be examined             by using a high molecular weight fraction for one polymer component             and by varying the molecular weight of the second polymer component.            For these various blends, such measurable quantities as local                   concentration fluctuations and properties of phase separation will be           used to characterize behavior at the cross-over between behavior types.                                                                                         The purposes of this research are to test the basic theory of critical          phenomena for polymer systems, and to provide new knowledge in the              field of advanced polymer materials.  The researchers share common              interests in polymer solutions, blends, and critical phenomena, and             have visited each other's laboratories in the past.  Their combined             experience in polymer dynamics adds to the probability of success of            this work.",
