 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor William Rose of Michigan                      Technological University in collaboration with Eddy Sanchez and                 Jorge Giron of the Instituto Nacional de Sismologia,                            Vulcanologia, Meteorologia e Hidrologia (INSIVUMEH) of                          Guatemala; with Minard Hall of the Escuela Politecnica Nacional                 of Ecuador; and with Carlos Ramirez of the Servicio Nacional de                 Geologia y Mineria in Chile.  The purpose of the project is to                  measure the sulfur dioxide emissions of several volcanoes with a                correlation spectrometer (COSPEC).  All of the volcanoes to be                  visited are very active or increasingly active.  Many pose a                    severe threat to local populations, properties, and economies.                  However, very little information is known about the current                     state of these volcanoes.  Because the sulfur dioxide only                      significantly exsolves from magmas at shallow depths, it is a                   reliable indicator of shallow magmatic processes.  Therefore,                   obtaining information about current sulfur dioxide emissions                    will help the local government agencies coordinate their                        eruption contingency plans and provide significant information                  to the researchers.                                                                                                                                             While the overall objective is to conduct the sulfur dioxide                    measurements, there is a significant training component to this                 grant in that Professor Rose will be instructing the local                      scientists in proper use of the COSPEC.  Such training will lead                to continued monitoring after the visit is over and could help                  to lessen the damage from the eventual destructive eruptions of                 these volcanoes.  In this context the award fulfills the                        objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program.",
