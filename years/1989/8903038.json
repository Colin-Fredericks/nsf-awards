 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will continue examination of the infrared properties of           quasars and other infrared-luminous galaxies.  Among the questions to           be addressed are (1) do infrared-bright quasars represent a                     significant increase in number, or extension in physical properties,            to the quasars found by optical and other classes of galaxies which             rival them in luminosity.  The pace of the research at the Center for           Astrophysics will be greatly accelerated due to Dr. Kleinmann's access          to a large body of relevant observational data on the galaxies and              quasars of interest.                                                                                                                                            Interactive activities will include an upper-level seminar on the               career and contributions of Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin.  It will exploit          access to original research materials used by Payne-Gaposchkin at               Harvard College Observatory.  Additional interactions with staff and            students will include lectures on other topics of current research by           Dr. Kleinmann.                                                                                                                                                  This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women          to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater               visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the                      participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
