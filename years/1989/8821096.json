 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines an approach for developing better methods                for building learning curves in industry and for understanding                  the process of learning in manufacturing.  The topic is                         considered to be important and the researchers well qualified,                  with an unusual mix of theoretical and applied skills.  In                      particular, the researchers' prior experience should provide                    access to industry that is necessary to successfully test their                 ideas.  The specific focus of the proposed research addresses                   some of the most critical practical roadblocks to the use of                    learning curves for cost estimation, and thus the project could                 yield important results for engineers and decision makers working               in this area.  In addition, the basic theory behind the proposed                research has been quite well worked out, with funding requested                 for an investigation of the applicability and validity of the                   learning rate budget concept.  This mix of operational and                      theoretical relevance is very appealing to the DRMS program and                 is considered to be necessary if learning rate concepts are to                  become a practical tool for increasing the efficiency of                        industry.",
