 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate assessment of earthquake risks                                         requires an accurate inventory of the                                           property at risk.  Typically, the inventory                                     data must be assembled from widely scattered                                    secondary sources such as assessor's parcel                                     files, U.S. Bureau of the Census population                                     and housing information, and aerial                                             photographs.  The aggregation of the data                                       into a usable form is tedious, time-                                            consuming, and difficult.  Furthermore, the                                     use of these heterogeneous data sources                                         invariably results in missing data and in                                       some cases inventories which are of unknown                                     reliability.  As computerized techniques for                                    evaluating seismic hazard continue to evolve,                                   we will need to develop methods for                                             assembling integrated, accurate inventory                                       databases.                                                                                                                                                      This project will develop methodologies and                                     computer tools for the automatic integration                                    of inventory databases for seismic risk                                         assessment.  A knowledge-based system will                                      integrate multiple, differing databases into                                    a single unified data structure for                                             representing seismic inventory data.  By                                        incorporating automatic integration, the                                        system will provide more up-to-date, more                                       complete data for use in seismic risk                                           assessment.  Furthermore, new computer                                          programs for risk assessment will need to                                       deal only with the unified data structure                                       rather than with the myriad of local data                                       formats, thus increasing the programs'                                          applicability.  In conjunction with the                                         knowledge-based integration, we will develop                                    an expert system to address the problems of                                     incomplete and inconsistent data within                                         individual and multiple databases.  The                                         expert system will formalize the heuristics                                     and rules-of-thumb that seismic experts use                                     in evaluating and reconciling inventory data.",
