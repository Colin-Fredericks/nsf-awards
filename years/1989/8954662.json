 "awd_abstract_narration": "In previous work by this project, experiment have been developed to             illustrate the use of laser techniques in demonstrating and                     understanding chemical principles.  Emphasis was placed on the use of a         helium-neon laser source which is inexpensive, safe, and readily                available.  These experiments have been designed for use in the                 classroom or for lecture demonstrations or for use by highly motivated          high school students or beginning undergraduate chemistry students.             Although the use of lasers to demonstrate optical phenomena is fairly           well advanced, their counterpart in chemical applications remains in a          highly primitive state, even though laser techniques are revolutionizing        chemical research.  The product of the work being supported through this        project will be a monograph of approximately 250 pages describing all           successful experiment performed over the summers of 1985 through 1988 in        a form usable by the teachers of general chemistry classes.  This               support will also allow dissemination of the monograph so that it can be        shared with other educators in the field.",
