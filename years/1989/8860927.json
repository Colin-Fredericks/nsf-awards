 "awd_abstract_narration": "Health concerns limit the allowed emissions of chlorinated                      hydrocarbons, which are initially present in a fuel or formed during            combustion, to concentrations in the parts per billion range.  A                catalytically stabilized thermal combustor offers an alternative to             current high residence time incinerators for the effective and                  economical destruction of organic materials.  The primary research              objective is to develop an improved model for predicting catalytic              combustor performance.  The model will include a complete chemical              kinetic mechanism, and will be capable of handling the varying                  operating conditions of a field prototype, including start-up, shut-            down, and auxiliary fuel burning.                                                                                                                               The research addresses the development of basic mechanistic data for            catalytically stabilized combustion of hazardous organics, which                impacts upon emission, safety, and economics to the waste producer.             Because the potential benefits address the key issues facing both               waste producers and regulators, successful research is likely to                attract non-Federal investment for further incinerator development,             especially in light of restrictions being placed on landfills and               other off-site disposal strategies.",
