 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dysfunction of dopamine systems in the brain have been implicated               in endocrine, neurological, and psychiatric disorders and                       dopaminergic drugs are widely prescribed for these disorders.                   Brain dopamine receptors are clearly implicated as the targets of               these drugs.  These receptors are in a mobile, dynamic state and                can be modulated by drugs, lesions, diseases, hormones, and other               challenges.  For example, post-mortem brains of schizophrenia and               Parkinson patients have altered levels of dopamine receptors, a                 consequence of dopamine drug therapies and/or the disease states.               Although the end status of dopamine receptor modulation by drug                 treatment has been described, little is known about the                         mechanisms of drug-induced receptor adaptive processes.                                                                                                         The continuation to develop fluorescent probes as a novel                       approach to study cellular and subcellular distribution of                      dopamine receptors and their regulation will occur during the                   Phase II of this research.  Based on the information from the                   Phase I study, fluorescent derivatives of D1 and D2 selective                   agonist ligands with higher affinity and improved fluorescence                  characteristics will be prepared.  The research will determine                  the affinity and selectivity of these compounds for dopamine                    receptors and test the retention of agonist properties.  The most               promising of these novel ligands will be evaluated on tissue                    sections by fluorescence microscopy, biotin-avidin coupling, and                autoradiography.  Experiments will be conducted on receptor                     mobility in response to agonist challenge on attainment of                      receptor-specific fluorescence.",
