 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports a collaborative study by                    Drs. H.J. Simpson and J.W.C. White of the Geochemistry                          Division of Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, Columbia                     University and Dr. M.S. Hamza of the Atomic Energy                              Establishment in Cairo, Egypt.  The objective of the study is                   to obtain indications of the ratio of irrigation water losses                   through the two important mechanisms of transpiration and                       evaporation by observation of heavy isotopes (deuteruim and                     oxygen-18) in residual water.  Samples will be taken in Egypt                   in the Eastern Delta of the Nile River from two separate                        areas, one where the net groundwater flow is from shallow                       soils into deeper groundwaters and the second where the net                     vertical flow is the opposite.  The study is hoped to develop                   a practical empirical approach to estimating evaporation                        losses from large irrigation networks, independent of                           estimates of evaporation plus transpiration based on discharge                  gaging data.  The study is expected also to help understand                     atmospheric water budgets in arid zones with extensive                          irrigation networks.                                                                                                                                            Scope:  The collaboration in this project is beneficial to the                  U.S. and to Egypt.  The project links Egyptian and U.S.                         scientists of varied experiences that mesh well to provide the                  necessary skills and knowledge for its success.  The                            information gained through this research could be useful to                     many countries in arid or semi-arid regions with large                          irrigation systems.",
