 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of an on-going research program that extends a currently funded         project, we will study third graders' construction of arithmetical              algorithms in the context of classroom instruction compatible with              constructivism.  The predominant teaching strategy will be small group          problem solving followed by whole class discussions of children's               solutions.  Both clinical interviews and a one-year classroom teaching          experiment will be conducted during the project.  Conceptual models that        account for children's construction of conceptually-based algorithms for        adding and subtracting three-digit and for multiplying and dividing two-        digit by one-digit numbers will be developed.  The sociological aspect          of the project will focus on the relationship between both whole class          and small group social interaction patterns and opportunities to                construct arithmetical knowledge.  Key constructs include students'             beliefs, obligations, expectations, and emotional acts in the classroom.        Third grade instructional activities will be developed during the               classroom teaching experiment.  The third grade instructional activities        will be developed during the classroom experiment.  The revised                 materials will be used by a minimum of ten teachers in the third year of        the project.  Our goal in coordinating cognitive and social analyses is         to contribute to the wider enterprise of developing a coherent framework        within which to understand both learning and teaching.",
