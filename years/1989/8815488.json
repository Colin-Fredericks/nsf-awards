Reatto of              the Universita degli Studi di Milano, Italy.  The investigators                 intend to continue their studies in the computational quantum                   mechanics of solid and liquid helium.  Our current understanding of             low density solid and of the liquid-solid phase transitions of                  highly quantum systems is still incomplete.  Both experimentally                and theoretically, such transitions are strongly affected by                    quantum effects.  Using variational calculations and a Green's                  function Monte Carlo (GFMC) method, the investigators have obtained             important results about liquid-solid transitions and about basic                properties of two-dimensional liquid and solid helium which will be             extended through this collaboration.                                                                                                                            The proposed work is complementary: the U.S. side will contribute               the methodology of computational many-body theory, especially as it             applies to quantum problems in their ground states and finite                   temperature.  The Italian side will work on theoretical and                     analytical results based on the numerical results obtained by the               U.S. researchers.  Given this degree of complementarity, it is                  likely that the collaboration will lead to increased understanding              of quantum effects of liquid-solid transitions and materials.",
