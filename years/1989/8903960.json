 "awd_abstract_narration": "The examination of faunas characterized by unusual                         preservation and/or occurrence in unusual environments can                      provide much paleoecological information.  In this vein, PIs will               investigate the paleoecology of three exquisitely preserved and                 diverse echinoderm faunas from the Middle Ordovician of Iowa ans                Minnesota.  The lithologies and regional stratigraphy indicate                  that the animals swelled on a shallow, equatorial epicontinental                shelf in waters 40 to 50 m deep.  The communities are dominated                 by suspension-feeding echinoderms.  Catastrophic burial resulted                in the preservation of many complete adult and some juvenile                    ecinoderms.  Consequently, PIs will determine the elevations                    relative to the substrate at which the individuals lived,                       estimate the sizes of food particles taken and infer their                      methods of food capture by extrapolating from Recent crinoids and               other echinoderms and by applying filtration theory.  The                       material encourages reconstruction of ecological structure, both                in the context of adults and ontogenetic sequences.  Preliminary                data demonstrate that the tiering levels and food size selection                of Middle Ordovician echinoderms were as complicated as those of                the crinoid dominated faunas of the Mississippian.  However,                    typical Ordovician forms utilized somewhat different elevations                 above the substrate than in the later Mississippian occurrences.                Ontogeny, survivorship and distribution patterns will be examined               for the abundant taxa within and between different living and                   taphonomic settings.  Inasmuch as most taxa are new, the fauna                  will be described and its phylogenetic affinities ascertained.",
