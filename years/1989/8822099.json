The construction or conversion activity of the Oceanographic                    Centers and Facilities Section provides funds for upgrading the                 capabilities of ocean science research vessels through support                  of ship construction or conversion. Support is provided for                     such things as new deckhouses, improved laboratory spaces,                      improved power systems, sophisticated submersible handling                      equipment, and the lengthening of ships and even new ship                       construction.                                                                                                                                                   The Project Directors, Dr. James D. Ebert, Director CBI, and                    Bruce K. Cornwall, Marine Superintendent, are fully qualified                   to direct this project having had considerable experience in                    overseeing similar activities.                                                                                                                                  This project will provide funds for a detailed design for the                   replacement of the WARFIELD's engines and generators in order                   to extend the useful life of the ship as a coastal zone                         research vessel.",
