 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Gordon's project involves a mixture of Banach                    space theory and probability theory. He will be mainly concerned                with finite-dimensional geometry in Banach spaces and in quasi-                 normed spaces. Probabilistic inequalities figure in both the                    methods to be used and in the applications that are envisioned.                      The problems addressed by Professor Gordon's research have                 to do with keeping track of several random variables                            simultaneously. A random variable, one of the fundamental notions               of probability theory, is a real-valued function on a space                     equipped with a probability measure, or less formally the                       numerical result of performing an experiment whose outcome is                   uncertain. One can put n random variables together to form an n-                dimensional random vector. Probabilistically, its behavior will                 depend not only on the individual components, but on their                      interaction with one another. Various notions of distance in n-                 dimensional space give rise to various geometries in which the                  random vector can move; an advantageous choice of ambient                       geometry can yield interesting probabilistic information about                  the random vector. Further, random vectors can be used to explore               the geometry. This sort of interaction between linear analysis                  and probability theory, currently quite lively, is at the heart                 of Professor Gordon's research.",
