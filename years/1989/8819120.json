 "awd_abstract_narration": "The obligatory role of guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G-               proteins) in many transmembrane signalling events is now clearly                established.  While this has been elucidated most clearly for                   retinal phototransduction and for hormonal regulation of                        adenylate cyclase, similar mechanisms apparently are important                  for regulation of phospholipase C-catalyzed phosphoinositide                    hydrolysis, for neurotransmitter receptor-mediated modification                 of ion channel activity, for various secretory events, and for                  regulation of cell growth and differentiation.  Although evidence               for the involvement of a G-protein in most of these phenomena is                strong, unambiguous identity of this protein has been established               in only a few cases.  The application of molecular cloning                      technology to studies of G-proteins in the last two years has                   resulted in major advances in knowledge of the structure of G-                  protein subunits and has resulted in the identification of new G-               proteins, the functions of which are not yet established.  This                 symposium proposes to bring together leaders in the field of G-                 protein research.  A major goal is to provide a forum for                       interaction between individuals who are actively studying G-                    protein function using model systems and investigators who are                  actively pursuing the identity and structure of G-proteins with                 technologies evolved from molecular cloning.  The broad areas to                be covered in the symposium include:  (1) regulation of ion                     channels by G-proteins; (2) G-protein regulation of second                      messenger production; (3) receptors that interact with G-                       proteins; and (4) structure, function and expression of G-                      proteins.  There will be five sessions, one each on topics 1-3,                 and two sessions on topic 4.  The meeting will also include a                   major keynote address and an afternoon poster session related to                the general themes of the symposium.  The published proceedings                 from the symposium are expected to make a timely and important                  contribution to this rapidly expanding field.                                                                                                                   This symposium on guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G-                    proteins) will provide a unique opportunity to bring together                   biochemists, physiologists, pharmacologists, cell biologists, and               molecular biologists who are leaders in the multidisciplinary                   approaches being taken in this field.  The critical comparisons                 possible in such an interaction should provide an important boost               to our understanding of G-protein structure and function, and                   more generally to understanding of cellular signaling mechanisms.",
