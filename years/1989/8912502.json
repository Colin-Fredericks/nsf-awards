 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social scientists have long studied the effects of individual                   payment systems (including group and individual piece-rates,                    group and individual target rates, time, production bonuses,                    salary, commission) on worker's behavior (their output,                         interactions with other workers).  Relatively neglected in this                 literature, however, are the topics of this research -- the                     determinants of payment systems at the level of establishments                  and occupations within establishments and the effects of payment                systems on wage levels themselves. Of particular interest will be               the adoption of 'incentive' pay schemes, including piece rates                  and bonuses versus the use of straight pay for time. In addition,               comparisons of group and individual incentive systems are                       planned, as are tests of several functions of incentive pay                     systems -- their productivity effects, risk-sharing effects and                 their ability to sort high from low-productivity workers. The                   data to be analyzed comes from underutilized Industry Wage                      Surveys to be purchased from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and                 cleaned by the PI. The data will cover 18 selected manufacturing                industries and are unusually rich in their coverage of                          establishment characteristics, in the quality of the data                       on wages and in their detailed occupational codes. Moreover,                    information on production workers within establishments will                    permit a rare separation of intra- versus inter-establishment                   processes. The PI is a highly regarded young scholar with unusual               mathematical and statistical skills supported by a promising                    track record of publications in both the substantive area of this               research and in the quantitative statistical methods used in this               area.",
