 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to provide an integrated computer-            aided design (CAD) environment for the synthesis and evaluation of              reconfigurable VLSI (very-large scale integrated) or WSI (wafer-scale           integration) concurrent architectures.  With the rapid progress of VLSI         technology, the chip sizes are to increase substantially, perhaps up to         the level of WSI.  However, low manufacturing yield has become a                problem of increasing significance, especially in WSI where it is               unlikely to get a defect-free wafer.                                                                                                                            Redundancy techniques are being utilized to overcome this difficulty.           Substantial yield and reliability improvement in VLSI/WSI parallel              architectures can be achieved by a proper integration of the                    architectural redundancy, fault diagnosis, and reconfiguration                  techniques.  Initial promising results have been obtained on these              issues and further investigation is being performed to enhance the              reconfigurability of classes of architectures, and performance of               diagnosis and reconfiguration algorithms.  Moreover, CAD and analysis           tools are being developed to assist the computer architect in the               synthesis and evaluation of alternative highly parallel designs                 appropriate for yield and reliability enhancement.  The emphasis is on          analysis and design of application specific reconfigurable concurrent           architectures and reconfiguration algorithms appropriate for WSI.",
