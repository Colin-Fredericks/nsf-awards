 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, designed by the Center for Cross Cultural Studies, College        of Rural Alaska, University of Alaska, describes an opportunity for 72          urban and rural middle and elementary school teachers to spend four             weeks engaged in science content, field and laboratory work in addition         to enhancing their teaching strategies.  It directly responds to                identified needs for locally relevant, hands-on science education               appropriate for the diverse multigraded and multicultural teaching              situations in Alaska.  The principle goal of this project is to train           three groups of 24 K-8 teachers over a period of three years in the             application of activities-based teaching strategies while simultaneously        increasing teachers' content knowledge.                                                                                                                         A team of master-teachers, University education and science faculty             conducting four-week basic summer institutes and one-week advanced              institutes followed by audioconferences and networking activities to            accomplish program goals.  Further, a district/ University supported            Consortium be developed to assure maintenance of training after three           years of NSF funding. Excellent support letters from the participating          school districts have indicated financial support for the implementation        of the project and the formation of the Consortium.  This project builds        on previous University of Alaska Title II EESA program efforts.  With           the additional NSF funding, more schools can be reached with                    an intense science-rich program leading toward a long-term                      commitment for the schools involved.                                                                                                                            Excellent cost-sharing has been garnered for this project with                  the University of Alaska, the participating schools and the                     Alaska Department of Education contributing an amount equivalent                to 73% of the NSF request.",
