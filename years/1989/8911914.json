 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to focus on the problem of                      international or sovereign debt, and to develop a better understanding          of the implications of the various ways for restructuring debt in order         to resolve the international debt crisis.  The project consists of              three parts.  The first examines the economic efficiency implications           of attempts by countries like Mexico, Brazil, and Chili to alleviate            their debt burden by repurchasing part of their foreign debt at                 discount, or engaging in the exchange of equity issues for debt issues.         The second part explores the feasibility and desirability of creating a         senior class of sovereign debt.  In contrast to corporate debt,                 sovereign debt treats all classes of debt equally.  Debt restructuring          by offering seniority structures will be examined within a dynamic              bargaining framework.  The third part of this project will focus on             state and local debt, which in many ways is much more similar to                sovereign than to corporate debt.  By comparing sovereign to state and          local debt, it will be possible to explore several important sovereign-         debt issues.  This project is important because it will provide new             insights into ways of mitigating or resolving the international debt            crisis.",
