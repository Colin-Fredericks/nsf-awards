 "awd_abstract_narration": "Disease resistance in plants is dependent on an active defense                  response.  The negation of these pleiotropic responses results in               susceptibility.  Several genes of known function and some opf                   unknown function are activated in plant tissue soon after                       challenge by the pathogen.  Several genes controlling functional                enzymes such as beta-glucanase and of several disease resistance                response genes (DRRG) have been cloned in this laboratory.  The                 latter genes are highly activated in temporal association with                  the expression of resistance and suppressed when the plant                      becomes susceptible.  Two recent observations, that the 3' and 5'               regions of DRRG-49 possess eukaryotic topoisomerase II consensus                sequences and that the fungal challenge of pea tissue sharply                   increases topoisomerase I activity, form the basis for this                     proposal.  A substantial body of recent research has indicated                  that some increases in transcription are associated with the                    topological features of chromosomal loops.  This proposal focuses               on the plant topoisomerases, their cleavage sites, and the                      influence of their activity on plant defense genes.  Because of                 the limited information on these enzymes in plants the objectives               are designed to purify the enzymes and specifically define the                  DNA attachment sites.  Eventually, it is planned to determine                   whether their accumulation, cellular localization or DNA helix-                 altering potential cause or can be a factor in the                              transcriptional changes associated with fungal- or fungal                       elicitor-induced disease resistance responses.                                                                                                                  The disease resistance of plants is associated with a response                  which is activated following contact of the pathogen with host                  plant tissue.  Multiple plant genes are activated immediately                   following the transfer of a signal from pathogen to host. The                   proposed research will test the hypothesis that activation of the               transcription of the multiple plant defense response genes is, at               least in part, due to increases in the activity of                              topoisomerases, enzymes that affect gene expression by altering                 the three dimensional structure of coiled DNA in the nucleus.",
