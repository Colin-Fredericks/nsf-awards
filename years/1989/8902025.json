Short,             National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), to the                    Communications Research Laboratory (CRL), Tokyo, Japan.  Dr. Short              will collaborate with Dr. Kenji Nakamura and other scientists at                CRL on studies related to microwave remote sensing of the earth's               environment from satellite-borne instruments.  In particular, Dr.               Short will work with CRL researchers in examining fundamental                   issues regarding the measurement of surface rainfall from space.                Both active (using radar) and passive (using microwave remote                   sensing) systems are employed for this purpose.  An airborne                    meteorological radar developed at CRL (prototype of a satellite-                borne instrument) is currently being flown on a NASA aircraft in a              joint experiment.  Dr. Short will cooperate with CRL personnel in               developing and testing procedures that utilize their radar rainrate-            measurement techniques in an effort to improve the accuracy of                  passive microwave rainrate measurements.  An important goal of this             research is to understand better the strengths and weaknesses of                both techniques, so that they may be used in complementary ways in              future space missions.  The work can be expected to contribute                  substantially to algorithm development and instrument definition of             proposed future observing systems such as the Tropical Rainfall                 Measuring Mission (a joint U.S.-Japan project) and the Earth                    Observing System Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer.",
