That record will reveal the history, on tectonic                        timescales, of Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation                      intensity and of patterns of continental (largely Australian)                   aridity.  Further the data will link the entire late Cretaceous                 to recent eolian record to the history of the ocean and                         cryosphere based on isotopic and other proxy indicators                         determined from the same core, and sometimes the same samples.                  There are several specific questions or events to be                            investigated.  The first of these is the nature of any changes                  in atmospheric circulation across the Cretaceous-Tertiary                       boundary.  Secondly, to delineate the Southern Hemisphere                       record of the important change in atmospheric circulation that                  occurs in the Northern Hemisphere at the Paleocene-Eocene                       boundary.  Third, examine significant changes in Southern                       Hemisphere atmospheric circulation that occur in conjunction                    with the latest Eocene - early Oligocene polar cooling and                      changes in Antarctic ice volume.  In this regard the fact that                  wind intensity is another indication of the planetary                           temperature gradient means that the data will place further                                                                                                     constraints on the ice-volume vs. temperature discussions.                                                                                                      %%%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The effects of paleoclimatic changes during the last 60 million                                                                                                 years on atmospheric circulation may be determined from                                                                                                         changing patterns of wind-blown particles in deep-sea                                                                                                           sediments.
