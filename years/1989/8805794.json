The                        instruments are well suited to the needs of the multidisciplinary                                                                                               neutron scattering community, and offer a well-balanced cross                   section of modern neutron scattering instrumentation for high                   resolution studies of the micro-structure and dynamics of                       virtually all classes of materials.  They include (1) a high                    resolution Small Angle Scattering Spectrometer (SANS) with                      polarized beam capability, and (2) a Spin Polarized Inelastic                   Neutron Scattering Spectrometer (SPINS) using supermirror                       polarizers and a \"Drabkin\" flipper.  The latter instrument is                   being cost shared 50/50 between the NSF and NIST funding.  The                  SANS instrument is of particular appeal to investigators in the                 fields of Materials Science, Condensed Matter Physics and                       Chemical Physics, Materials Chemistry, and Polymers Science.  The                                                                                               proposed instruments are state of the art facilities and are                    unequaled in this country and will be competitive with the best                 facilities worldwide.  They will be operated as a user facility                 with experiments allocated by an outside Program Advisory                                                                                                       Committee.",
