 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to complete a unified control                 analysis and design methodology, encompassing both 1-d (one                     independent variable, usually time) and n-d (n independent variables)           systems, for reduced order controllers that achieve robust performance          for linear, uncertain plant models.  In order to derive synthesis               methods for n-d systems which are not overly conservative, we will              also develop improved analysis techniques (verifying stability,                 computing norms, etc.) for n-d systems.                                                                                                                         This approach is significant, because it will tie together many                 different areas of current control research with a unified theory.  It          will lead to algorithms that will increase the role that a control              engineer can have in initial system configuration, since the                    cost/benefit tradeoffs in component quality and in component modelling          can be analyzed apriori.                                                                                                                                        The entire methodology is based on linear fractional transformations            of matrices and a mathematical framework to study them called the               structured singular value.  The structured singular value is a                  mathematical tool useful in analyzing matrix perturbation problems.",
