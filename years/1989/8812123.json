 "awd_abstract_narration": "The utilization of microbial organisms as prey by                          suspension feeding copepods currently is thought to be a                        significant part of marine planktonic trophodynamics.                           However, experimental evidence for this link is indirect                        because soft bodied prey such as ciliate protozoa do not                        leave visually identifiable remains in copepod guts or in                       fecal pellets.  Dr. Ohman will use immunological methods                        for identifying microzooplankton remains in copepod gut                         contents.  The work entails several steps, including; 1)                        the production of antisera to nonloricate ciliate protozoa;                     2) elimination of undesired cross reactions; 3)                                 determination of assay sensitivity and specificity; 4)                          determination of gut residence time of anitgens; 5)                             calibration of ingestion rates; 6) preliminary                                  investigation of nearshore copepods for ciliate antigens.                       Immunoassays will be done by a dot blot assay (ELISPOT;                         enzyme-linked immunospot).                                                           The concept of a food web by which organic material is                     synthesized by plants and redistributed by grazing                              processes is similar in both terrestrial and aquatic                            environments.  However, the nature of the marine food web                       is distinct in that much of this trophic activity takes                         place among microorganisms. It is often difficult to                            identify the structure of the food web composed by these                        small particles, much less to quantify the extent to which                      certain organisms are preyed upon by others.  Dr. Ohman                         will apply techniques developed in molecular biology to                         address one of the more problematic predator-prey                               relationships in plankton ecology - that of marine                              protozoans without hard parts and marine zooplankton.                           There is presently little information on this potentially                       important link in the planktonic food web, and this novel                       approach may provide a quantitative technique to analyze                        the importance of these soft bodied protozoa to larger                          maine organisms.",
