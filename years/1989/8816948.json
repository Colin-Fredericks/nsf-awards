 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to study a section of upper mantle peridotites                  and a lower crustal granulite-facies complex exposed on the                     island of Zabargad, Red Sea, as part of a continuing study on the               evolution of the upper mantle and lower crust as continental                    rifts evolve to oceanic rifts.The crustal complex contain garnet-               granulite-facies silicic gneisses, and amphibolitized metagabbros               and metapyroxenites.  The silicic gneisses are probably remnants                of the pre-rift ;lower continental crust formed ;during the Pan                 African cycle.  The high-P meta-igneous rocks are interpreted as                metamorphosed basic magmas that underplated the crust prior to                  and during rifting.  the peridotites include isotopically                       depleted spinel lherzolites that were partially hydrated to                     amphibole peridotites by fluids with the isotopic signature (low                87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd) of subcontinental mantle metasomatism.               They are believed to have been part of the sub-Red Sea mantle.                  Both the crustal complex and the peridotites show successive re-                equilibration assemblages from granulite to amphibolite to                      greenschist facies conditions suggesting they were uplifted                     together from deep tectonic levels.  The PIs will test the                      hypothesis that the entire section was once very close to the                   base of the Pan African crust and was raised and exposed recently               and rapidly, possibly along a major detachment fault that may be                exposed on Zabargad, as a result of the opening of the Red Sea.                 Schedule for study are petrology, major, trace and Ree elements,                mineral chemistry, and Sr, Nd, Pb and possibly Os isotopes of the               Zabargad peridotites and crustal rocks.  A major goal will be to                determine initial ages, recrystallization ages and uplift rates                 of the crustal rocks.  Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd and U-Pb whole-rock and                     mineral results from Lamont-Doherety Geological Observatory will                be coordinated with U-Pb zircon, 40Ar/39Ar amphibole, and                       zircon, sphene and apatite  fission track ages from other                       laboratories.  The objectives are (a) to determine the time, rate               and mechanism of uplift of the Zabargad complex, (b) define the                 nature of the lower continental crust in a transitional rift, (c)               investigate the processes of underplating in a  pre-oceanic rift,               (d) clarify the petrological and geochemical evolution of the                   crust and mantle in a major rift prior to sea floor spreading,                  and (e) infer whether \"active\" or \"passive\" rifting prevailed in                the Red Sea Rift.  The results expected from this project will                  help us understand the crustal evolution of Atlantic-type passive               margins.",
