 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project, devoted to manifolds and cell                    complexes, is to explore the interrelationships between the                     topology of 3-manifolds and the types of laminations and                        representations that 3-manifolds possess.  The main questions to                be investigated are the following:                                              (1) Given a compact oriented laminated 3-manifold N and an                      irreducible 3-manifold M homotopy equivalent to N, is M                         homeomorphic to N?  If a homeomorphism from M to itself is                      homotopic to the identity, is it isotopic to the identity?                      (2) What 3-manifolds are laminated?                                             (3) Calculate the degenerate invariant of a knot in the 3-sphere.               Given an oriented link in the 3-sphere, find an effective way to                decide if it is fibred and if so complete its monodromy.  Can one               obtain a counterexample to the Poincare conjecture by surgery on                a knot?                                                                         (4) Calculate the topological type of the representation spaces                 of the Brieskorn homology spheres.                                              (5) Define and calculate equivariant instanton homology.                        (6) Calculate the relative Floer index of two flat connections on               homology spheres obtained by surgery on knots.                                  (7) Show that a link of two components in the 4-sphere is                       nullhomotopic.",
