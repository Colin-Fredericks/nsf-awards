 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports five U.S. mathematicians for collaborative                  research in group theory with a number of German mathematicians at              several universities in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG).  The             collaborative framework was organized by Professor Stephen D. Smith             of the University of Illinois at Chicago and Professors Franz G.                Timmesfeld of the University of Geissen and Gernot Stroth of the Free           University, Berlin.  The proposed visits will permit continuation of            some highly productive collaborative relationships previously                   supported by the U.S.-FRG Program, while also introducing some new              participants.  Reciprocal visits by the Germans to several U.S.                 universities are being supported by the DFG (the German equivalent of           NSF.)  The various partnerships among the two groups will focus on              several closely related problems: axiomatization and classification             of geometries for simple groups, universal covers of finite geometries,         the theory of trees and more general amalgams for geometric groups;             and the application of such results to the study of maximal subgroups           and representation of simple groups.  Most of the leaders in this               area of mathematics are working in the U.S. and West Germany, so                fruitful collaboration is expected.                                                                                                                             Both geometry and group theory have important applications in                   twentieth century science - for example, geometry in the physics of             relativity, and group theory in physics and chemistry at the quantum            and particle levels.  Natural interrelations between the two theories           have long been studied.  The use of techniques from discrete geometry           in problems of finite group theory is a particularly vigorous area of           modern mathematical research.",
