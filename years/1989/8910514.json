 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the least understood chapters in the economic history of                 black Americans is their experience in the cities and industries                of the northeast and midwest between World War I and the 1950's.                The purpose of this project is to remedy this situation by                      developing samples of black workers from the employee records of                several large industrial employers, who hired significant numbers               of blacks and who kept detailed work histories, including                       information on race.  These data sets will allow a comparison of                the conditions for the entry of black and white workers in terms                of entry-level wages, hiring criteria, and initial job                          assignments.  It will also be possible with these data to track                 the progress of workers within a company over time in terms of                  wage trajectories, job performance, quit rates, and promotions.                 This project is important because it will make a significant                    contribution to better understanding the economics of                           discrimination, and will provide a better basis for analyzing the               economic progress of blacks and for assessing the impact of                     public policy aimed at increasing job opportunities.",
