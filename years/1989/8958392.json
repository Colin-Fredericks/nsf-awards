Research being conducted                       in this project involves the chemical characterization of                       organic matter not removed by coagulation, sedimentation                        and filtration with and without the use of ozone and                            determination of the best physical/chemical process-system                      for removal of the residual organic matter including                            possible intermediate treatment with ozone, advanced                            oxidation, ion exchange and adsorption processes.                                                                                                               Research being initiated by this Presidential Young                             Investigator addresses a problem associated with the                            processes of treating polluted surface and groundwaters to                      make them acceptable for human consumption.  Conventional                       physical and chemical treatment processes may not remove                        organic substances that may be converted into harmful                           substances by chemical disinfection.  Results of this                           research are likely to be utilized in engineering design of                     systems to produce water of more acceptable quality than is                     now possible.",
