 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports a joint research by                         Dr. Gerard Rushton, Department of Geography, University of                      Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa and Dr. Vinod Tewari, Indian School of                    Management Bangalore (IIMB), India to develop and test a                        decision-support system for improving the locational                            efficiency of service systems appropriate to rural areas in                     India.  Specifically the team will:  Identify the                               decision-making process and analyze the needs of the                            decision-makers with reference to selected service systems in                   a sample study area; develop an analysis system with                            optimizing models for resources allocation; develop                             interactive software for the analysis system in the form of a                   micro-computer based system; evaluate alternative systems in                    an interactive mode; and bring together scholars, planners and                  decision-makers to refine the decision-support system and to                    assist in its dissemination.  The project should lead to                        enhance the quality of health services, banking services,                       education and other sectors that consume large public                           resources.  In addition the study should increase the                           knowledge of the performance of rural service delivery systems                  in developing countries and help define the generic features                    of service delivery systems and develop rules for expert                        systems that will be more appropriate than any existing at                      present.                                                                                                                                                        Scope:  The University of Iowa as a Center for International                    Cooperative Studies and Department of Geography each of which                   has excellent resources including staff with relevant                           international experience as well as scholars who are                            conducting research in this field.  The IIMB has a mandate and                  the needed facilities to play a major role in the design of                     new systems for Indian conditions and to train managers in                      recent development in computer assisted decision-making and                     information systems.  These two institutes working jointly                      should help make this project successful and produce                            meaningful results of scientific benefit and of pertinent                       applications.",
