 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Chu will study the physical structures and energetics of                    regions of ionized hydrogen (HII regions) which are under the                   influence of supernovae and winds from stars.  The work will be a               mixture of observations and theoretical interpretation.  Dr. Chu                will first study giant HII regions around associations of OB type               stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud to investigate the                          interactions among stellar winds, supernovae, and the                           interstellar medium.                                                                                                                                            Research on the interactions among young, hot stars, supernovae,                and the interstellar medium can be important to understanding how               stars modify their environments and affect the rate of star                     formation.  One advantage of studying giant HII regions is that                 the large number of ionizing stars make it possible to see the                  relatively rare stellar wind phenomenon and to investigate its                  effects on the interstellar medium.  Rapidly expanding shells of                gas have been detected in at least one giant HII region, and some               of the shells must be young, wind-blown bubbles.  These young                   bubbles and the emission of X-rays, which implies the presence of               supernova remnants, near a high concentration of O type stars                   pose many intriguing problems for theorists on the                              interrelationships of these phenomena.",
