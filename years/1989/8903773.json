 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two-fold study of igneous-related metallogenesis of                      Phanerozoic plutons in the Cordilleran miogeocline of the Great                 Basin is proposed:  (1) district-scale studies of late-stage                    magmatic and mineralizing processes related to Cretaceous                       granitoids, concentrating lithophile-element mineralization                     (LEM) associated with two-mica granites; (2) a comparative                      investigation of the magmatism and metallogeny of Jurassic,                     Cretaceous, and Tertiary intrusions in the miogeocline.  This                   proposal builds on the results of ongoing NSF supported studies                 of LEM and its regional context.  Justifications for this                       approach include:  (1) the LEM is of a type that has been little                studied in the western United States, yet it shares many                        characteristics with important deposits elsewhere in the world;                 (2) examination of igneous-related metallogeny in a single,                     geologically uniform (at a large scale) area nominally eliminates               lateral crustal heterogeneities as a cause for variation,                       enabling comparison of multiple examples of the same type of                    system and investigation of other factors such as long-term                     temporal changes in crustal thermal structure.                                       Evaluation of LEM systems involves completing studies of                   local areas, and intensively studying one area (Birch Creek,                    CA), which contains a well exposed two-mica granite with related                deformation, metamorphism and hydrothermal alteration.  The                     approach combines detailed field work with geochemical and                      petrological studies.  These will be complemented by                            collaborative geochronological and geophysical measurements.                    The main goals are to refine the descriptive and genetic                        understanding of Great Basin-type LEM and to compare it with                    other areas.  Available data demonstrate the Great Basin                        Phanerozoic petrogeny and metallogeny correlate, and that they                  change systematically with time; they appear to reflect changes                 in crustal thermal structure (Barton, in press).  Quantitative                  interpretation is hindered by insufficient data on the igneous                  rocks and ore deposits.  Geochemical reconnaissance (whole rock                 and mineralogical, isotopic and elemental analyses ) of Jurassic                and Tertiary intusions is proposed to complement ongoing studies                of systematic variations in Cretaceous granitoids.  This survey,                along with continuing compilation of published data, will form                  the basis for better indentifying and interpreting regional                     temporal trends.",
