 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Polar Research Board (PRB) is a standing committee of the National          Academy of Sciences.  Under this continuing award the Foundation, with          research programs and assigned interagency leadership roles in both             polar regions, partially funds \"Core Support\" of the PRB under Master           Agreement No. 86-18641.  Core support provides for maintenance of a             support staff at the Academy, two annual meetings of the full Board             (currently 16 members) and some subgroup meetings, and continuing PRB           functions such as liaison with other scientific bodies, preparation of          annually recurring reports, and association with the Scientific                 Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR).                                         Beyond core support, the PRB is free to identify additional projects            and to ask the Foundation or any other entity to support these                  projects.  Some of these are discussed in the proposal, and others are          likely to be identified over the course of the project.  Major                  activities for which the Government is providing funds under this award         follow:                                                                         Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR).  This committee of           the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) is charged with           furthering the coordination of scientific activity in Antarctica.  The          Academy is the U.S.-adhering body to ICSU and thus to SCAR.                     Participation in SCAR furthers U.S. policy fostering cooperative                research in Antarctica.  SCAR working groups and symposia, and typing           and printing of the U.S. Annual Report No. 30 to SCAR.                          Identification of Research Needs.  The PRB will continue work on,               contribute to, or complete studies on:  U.S. research initiatives on            global processes and change; U.S. capability of support research in             polar regions; the scientific potential of U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)              vessels and polar research ship requirements; polar ice coring                  capabilities; arctic solid geoscience needs; Arctic social science              needs review of ARPA documents and plans; international arctic research         developments, and application of antarctic experience to space                  habitation.  The PRB continues to assure active participation of U.S.           scientists in the work of the SCAR.                                             The PRB is uniquely suited to perform the proposed work.  It is                 government-chartered to provide advice to the government, and its               stature assures access to qualified scientists, engineers, and others           who contribute their expertise and time to approved studies.                    Accomplishments in 1988/1989 included publication of major articles on          polar science issues by PRB members; advice to the USCG and NSF on              polar class icebreakers; reports on priorities in arctic marine                 sciences, arctic social science, physical and chemical oceanography of          the Southern Ocean, and biomedical research.                                    The Program recommends support at $145K from NSF.  The PRB has                  succeeded in reducing its dependance on the NSF from 100% in 1978 to            about 37% in 1987.",
