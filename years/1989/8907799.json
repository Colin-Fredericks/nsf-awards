 "awd_abstract_narration": "This equipment is being used by Professor Mazumder for his research on          problems in IC design.  In testing, problems addressed are parallel             testing, error correction for three dimensional memories, and neural            network optimization techniques for built-in self-repair of VLSI                components.  Physical design problems concern in layout optimization            techniques using genetic algorithms.  Large systems are being modeled           by a hardware description language; and software for verifying                  correctness, compiling the design, determining the Boonlean equations           and implementing them as a VLSI design is being built.  In addition,            the equipment is being used to design specialized chips for a hexagonal         mesh architecture used as an experimental testbed to investigate the            behavior of distributed algorithms for real-time systems.                       This is an equipment grant which will provide Professor Mazumder an             engineering workstation, necessary to research in IC design problems.           The principal investigator is a promising and productive young                  professor who is likely to make significant contributions to the field.         He has a record of useful, innovative ideas in VLSI testing and IC              design.  His research topics have high-priority within the Design,              Tools and Test Program.",
