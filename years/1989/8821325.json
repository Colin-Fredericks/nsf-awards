 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the question of option generation and how               people make use of available information to solve problems and                  formulate decision strategies.  The proposed project will use                   protocol analysis to trace subjects' decision making processes                  and then will use this information to test hypotheses about                     knowledge activation that are considered to be important for                    future developments in decision support systems.  The project is                expected to yield both general insights, concerning the effect of               task characteristics on problem solving, and applied insights,                  concerning the mental modelling and strategy formulation                        processes used by managers.  These topics are of interest to a                  large body of researchers because of their linkages to the study                of cognitive processes and because of their practical                           implications for the development of improved computer-based                     decision support systems.",
