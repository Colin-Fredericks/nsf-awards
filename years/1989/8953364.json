Staff development will be carried out throughout the            academic year and in full-time 2-week summer workshops.  Partners with          the school in the project include the Center for Pre-College Programs at        New Jersey Institute of Technology, AT&T Networks Systems and Bell              Laboratories, the New Jersey Marine Science Consortium, and the Sci-Tech        Center at Liberty State Park.   The teachers and the collaborating              scientists and engineers will develop curricular models and components          to provide a unified, multi-year hands-on science program which will be         tied into the total school curriculum.                                                                                                                          Cost sharing by the partners will total 90% of the National Science             Foundation funding.",
