 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Hudson will undertake four research projects.  The first involves           simulations of active experiments in space.  Particle simulations               including beam density gradients are proposed, using an algorithm               which extends a one dimensional electrostatic particle code to retain           density gradient information.  The second topic is whistler noise               generation near the earth's plasmapause.  A hybrid electromagnetic              code, which includes magnetic field gradient effects, will be extended          to include electron particle dynamics.  The objective is to compare             nonlinear and convective amplification of whistlers in the plasmapause          region.  The third topic is research into two hardware techniques for           extending the size of simulation systems.  The final research project           simulates ion acoustic double layer evolution in an H+ - O+ plasma.             These localized potential jumps, which are thought to contribute to             auroral particle acceleration, are a basic feature of magnetized ion            acoustic turbulence.                                                                                                                                            Interactive activities will include teaching a senor seminar course in          Simulations of Space Plasma Experiments and giving seminars on her              research.  Additionally, Dr. Hudson will organize a series of seminars          on extraterestrial physics in which professional women scientists will          participate.                                                                                                                                                    This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and  (2) to encourage               women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing                 greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in               industry, government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the            participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
