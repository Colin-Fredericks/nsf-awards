 "awd_abstract_narration": "An image analysis system for fluorescence microscopy will be                    developed which incorporates state-of-the-art image acquisition                 technology.  The project will result in the development of                      instruments and techniques for detailed biomass measurements of                 the pico- and nanoplankton components of the microbial food web.                                                                                                While video technology is the most common method of image                       acquisition, it is not particularly well suited for accurate,                   quantitative imaging in the low light environment of fluorescence               microscopy.  Video systems are limited by low sensitivity, non-                 linear response, and a narrow dynamic range. Digital cameras                    incorporating cooled, solid-state charged-coupled devices (CCDs),               however, are now available with excellent characteristics of                    photon sensitivity, spatial and gray scale reolution, response                  linearity and quantum efficiency.  These imaging devices overcome               the major problems of video systems which limit their usefulness                for quantitative image analyzed fluorescence microscopy.                        Development will be directed toward a system capable of ship-                   board use to allow rapid size spectra and biomass measurements of               the bacteria and protists at sea as part of the Global Ocean Flux               Study.",
