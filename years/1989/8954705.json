 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Geological Institute (AGI), the umbrella                           organization for 19 professional earth science societies,                       will conduct a two-week conference of a small group of earth                    scientists and teachers who will write a guide to curricula                     for the K-12 school years which fit the needs of the 21st                       century.  A series of previous conferences sponsored by the                     AGI have provided the background for this final step in                         defining the shape of earth science education appropriate for                   all students today and tomorrow.  Particular attention will                     be paid to preparing realistic guidance for the earth science                   components needed for the education of future K-12 teachers.                    The guides will be written during the conference, edited                        subsequently, and published by the AGI.  They will be widely                    disseminated to educators and scientists through a variety of                   paths, including science teachers' organizations, other                         educators' groups, scientific societies, and the AGI's own                      National Center for Earth Science Education.   Throughout the                   process, the AGI will work closely with other groups involved                   in the reform of science education.                                                                                                                             Cost sharing by the partners will total 60% of the NSF                          funding.",
