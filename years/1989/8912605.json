 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to describe and explain patterns of                         electronic media selection and use in settings where                            individuals have access to two options, voice messaging and                     electronic mail, as well as traditional communication                           channels.  The research will provide an improved                                understanding of the perceived advantages and disadvantages                     (e.g., ease of learning vs. efficiency) of these                                communication media and it will provide new insights into the                   ways in which media selection affects the organizational                        setting.  The project will develop a model of choice between                    media alternatives and it will test this model in an                            ambitious field investigation that will employ both                             quantitative and qualitative methods to examine electronic                      media usage patterns at the individual, departmental, and                       organizational levels of analysis.  The three proposed                          explanations for media choice behaviors (rational choice,                       critical mass, and social influence) are considered to be of                    general interest, in terms of how individuals and groups make                   choices among competing or complementary alternatives, as                       well as of specific interest in the context of media-use                        decisions.",
