 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. David Freidel, Mr. Juan Albarracin-                  Jordan will conduct archaeological research in the Tiwanaku                     Valley to collect data for his doctoral thesis.  For more than a                millennium (ca. AD 100-1200), the northern Bolivian site of                     Tiwanaku was the paramount city of the Lake Titicaca basin which                was, in turn, one of the great demographic centers of native                    Andean civilization.  However, despite Tiwanaku's important                     position in the prehistory of the Andes - it is one of the early                centers of state formation - little is known about its economic                 history and how it rose to prominence, governed an empire, and                  then declined.  Mr. Albarracin-Jordan's research will help fill                 that gap.                                                                                                                                                       One issue of particular concern is how the land, much of which is               unfarmed today, was able to support such a large population.                    What are the crops and the farming strategies which these ancient               Andeans employed?  Mr. Albarracin-Jordan will focus on this                     issue.  Rather than excavate in the city center, he will study                  what likely is the richest agricultural area, conduct a                         systematic survey, make collections of surface materials, and map               and excavate selected sites.  These data should provide important               information on population distribution and landscape use.                                                                                                       This research is important for several reasons.  It will shed                   light on a little understood aspect of South American prehistory.               The Tiwanaku empire rose quickly and extended its influence                     rapidly over a wide area.  This history is little understood.                   Secondly, it will increase our understanding of the more general                question of how complex societies such as our own arise and are                 maintained.  Finally, it will contribute to the training of an                  extremely promising young scientist.",
