 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechanical components ranging from gear trains to belt drives have              been in existence for many decades and their manufacture has                    reached a high degree of refinement.  However, their mechanical                 analysis often has been limited to elementary derivations relating              to their simplest characteristics.  Although these components are               seemingly simple, their mechanical analysis is quite subtle and                 complex.  Generally, such components are developed on the basis of              experience and extensive life and wear testing, and they cannot be              optimized in the design stage.  This project attempts to put                    mechanical component design on a more analytical foundation and                 addresses the related issues of refined modeling and optimum design             of machine components.  It comprises four topics including study                of the efficiency of mechanical components and systems, application             of B-splines to the design and optimization of mechanical systems,              study of the trajectories in noncircular planetary gearing, and                 study of the mechanics of variable ratio drives, including band and             tape drives, timing belts and pulleys.  The first topic addresses               the prediction of power requirements (i.e., the mechanical                      efficiency) of mechanical systems in the design stage.  Much work               has been done in this area for gearing, but not for other                       mechanical system components.  This effort focuses on the computer              aided prediction and optimization of the efficiency of mechanical               components.  For the second research topic, the intent is to                    consider the application of B-splines to various two and three                  dimensional problems, including robotic path generation, selected               problems in the dynamics of high speed cam follower systems and                 others.  The B-spline concept is one that evolved in computer                   science technology, and which provides a very numerically efficient             mathematical method for approximating a function passing through                two end points.  It can be used to optimize the design of the class             of components alluded to previously.  The planetary gearing                     research task, the third one proposed, investigates the algebraic               geometry and nature of gear trajectories generated by noncircular               gears.  This class of gears has been used extensively recently in               numerically controlled machining and in photo chemical etching                  processes, but it is not well understood analytically.  The fourth              topic is related to band and tape drives, basic flexible mechanical             components used in film advance, tape transport, and other                      nonuniform transmission.  The proposed research involves the                    mechanics of variable ratio band and tape drives, timing belts and              pulleys and focuses on investigation of the possibility of                      designing these components with the complete elimination of slack.              Such a design would eliminate the necessity of tensioning devices,              and simplify the overall design.",
