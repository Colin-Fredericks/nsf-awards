 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of                  Professor David Gieseker of the University of California at Los                 Angeles. Dr. Gieseker's investigations will be in the isospectral               theory of difference operators, considering the Picard group of                 the Bloch manifold of a two-dimensional periodic difference                     operator. He will also explore generalizations of the Bloch                     manifold construction to other contexts such as the triangular-                 ization of a surface of arbitrary genus.                                             This is research in the field of Algebraic Geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                     origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from Algebra, but from Analysis and               Topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical Computer Science, Robotics, and                       Physics.",
