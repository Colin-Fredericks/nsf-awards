 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the proposed research are to understand the                   interactions which occur in a synergistic viral infection.                      Proposed experiments focus on the interaction of two                            unrelated (+)-stranded RNA viruses of plants, potato virus X                    (PVX) and potato virus Y (PVY).  In mixed tobacco infections                    with these two viruses the accumulation of PVX is greatly                       increased over that in singly infected plants, while that of                    PVY is unchanged.  The immediate goal of the work is to                         determine the level at which the increased accumulation of                      PVX is regulated.  The steady state levels, time course of                      accumulation and rates of synthesis of coat protein and                         various viral RNAs will be measured in singly and doubly                        infected plant protoplasts.  Later aims are to pinpoint the                     specific sequences on the PVY and PVX genomes which are                         important for the increased accumulation of PVX in co-                          infected cells.  These experiments will use transgenic plants                   expressing subsets of the PVY genome, as well as genetically                    engineered PVX mutants.  Recent studies have shown                              similarities in diverse plant and animal viruses based on                       genome organization,mechanisms of gene expression, and                          sequence homology of virally encoded, nonstructural proteins.                   These results suggest that elucidation of molecular                             mechanisms for virus interactions obtained in one system may                    well apply to a diverse group of other virus systems.                                                                                                           This work should give insight into a fundamental biological                     phenomenon and, particularly if the results are found to                        apply to a number of viral systems, may be of economic                          importance.",
