 "awd_abstract_narration": "The injection of ideas from number theory and algebraic geometry has            brought about remarkable progress in recent years in the study of               primality testing and integer factoring, and in computational number            theory in general.  It is plan to continue the exploration of                   arithmetric and geometric methods as a fundamental tool in the study of         computational problems, particularly those that are related to number           theory.  The goal is to develop efficient algorithms for them, to study         complexity theoretic relation among them, and to explore application to         cryptography, as well as other problems in computational complexity.                                                                                            The primary focus will be:                                                                                                                                      (1) Further investigation into primality testing and integer factoring,         and other fundamental problems in computational number theory.                                                                                                  (2) Development of efficient algorithms for computing with curves and           higher dimensional algebraic varieties, particularly as they apply to           the computational problems mentioned above.                                                                                                                     (3) Application of arithmetic and geometric techniques in the analysis          of security of public key cryptosystems.  Development of new                    cryptosystems based on geometric ideas.",
