 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will study  systems of partial                            differential equations which describe the behavior of elastic                   materials.  Particular emphasis will be on the                                  Reissner.Mindlin theory and related models for the bending of                   elastic plates and shells.  The investigations will include a                   qualitative analysis of the solutions of the plate equations,                   design and analysis of numerical schemes for their solution, and                both analytical and computational studies of the relation between               solutions of the Reissner.Mindlin equations and the equations of                three dimensional elasticity.  Specific goals include an analysis               of the boundary layer for the Reissner.Mindlin model near free                  and simply.supported edges, the implementation of a recently                    developed optimal order finite element method for this model                    which is uniform with respect to the plate thickness, and the                   design and analysis of uniformly optimal order finite element                   methods of higher degree.  In addition the investigator will                    continue work on boundary element methods for the numerical                     solution of time.dependent partial differential equations, with                 an emphasis on applying recent theoretical advances to practical                computation, and will study applications of the boundary element                approach to exact control problems for such time.dependent                      equations.",
