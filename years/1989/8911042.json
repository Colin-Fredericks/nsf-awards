 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  Support is provided for participation by five                     U.S. scientists in the \"Second international Symposium and                      Workshop on Protein Structure and Function,\" to be held in                      Karachi, Pakistan, December 4 to 8, 1989.  The conference is                    to be followed by a ten-day workshop for attendees to have                      hands-on experience with amino acid analyzers, HPLC                             chromatographs, and peptide sequencers.  The conference                         organizer is Dr. Zafar Zaidi of the HEJ Research Institute                      of Chemistry at University of Karachi, with support from two                    eminent chemists, Dr. Salimuzzaman Siddiqui, and                                Dr. Atta-ur-Rahman, Co-directors of the Institute.                              Participation is expected to be from the UK, Germany,                           France, Italy, Japan, India, Phillipines, Jordan, Egypt, and                    Morocco as well as from the U.S. and Pakistan, as was the                       case in the first conference held in January 1988,                                                                                                              Scope:  These conferences provide considerable assistance to                    scientists in developing countries in the advancing science                     of protein chemistry and in the modern experimental                             techniques used for protein analysis.  They provide an                          opportunity for exchange of information and for developing                      joint research activities in the field.  The use and                            maintenance of sophisticated analytical equipment and data                      interpretation is covered in the laboratory sessions                            following the conference.  The HEJ Institute is Pakistan's                      leading center for chemical research, and one of South                          Asia's best, and is very well equipped and staffed.  It is                      quite suitable for hosting the conference and the laboratory                    workshop that follows.  This project meets the objectives of                    the Science in Developing Countries Program.",
