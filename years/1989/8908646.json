 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ROW planning grant develops a plan for the first empirical                 analysis of signalling models in franchising.  Franchise                        contracts generally involve the payment, by the franchisee to the               franchiser, of a constant proportion of the former's sales or                   profits in royalties, as well as a lump-sum franchise fee, in                   exchange for the franchiser's assistance and the right to use his               tradename.  One implication of signalling models is that the more               capable franchisers can signal their potential profitability to                 franchisees by offering contracts that make a large proportion of               revenues dependent on the performance of each individual outlet.                In other word, the contract a \"good\" franchiser should offer                    would involve a high royalty rate and a low franchise fee to the                point where a \"bad\" type would be unwilling to offer the same                   contract.  A franchiser can also make revenues more dependent on                the performance of individual outlets by operating some units                   directly.  Another implication of signalling models is that the                 longer a firm has been in business, the greater the probability                 of being a \"good\" type; hence as time goes by, it becomes less                  important for firms to signal their type through the contract                   that they offer.                                                                                                                                                This project is worthwhile because the results of the research                  will provide data and new insights on franchising.  This                        planning grant permits the investigator to develop and start                    testing a signalling theory using survey data on an average of                  1000 franchisers per year from 1980 to 1988 inclusively.  These                 surveys provide information on franchisers' total number of                     outlets, broken down between those that are company-owned and                   those that are franchised, their sector of operations, the                      royalty rates and franchise fees they ask for, the number of                    years since they began their operations and the number of years                 since they began franchising.",
