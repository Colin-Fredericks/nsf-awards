 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research                 project between Dr. Howard Bryant of the University of New Mexico               and Dr. Janos Bergou of the Central Research Institute for                      Physics, Budapest, is to apply novel experimental methods to                    explore the details of photoionization processes in the simple                  atom H-.  Work will concentrate on four specific-topics of                      interest in photo-atom interactions and collision physics: (1)                  photodetachment of H- near threshold in an energy field; (2) two                electron photoionization (3) production of highly excited Ryberg                states; and (4) multiphoton ionization of H-. Results of these                  collaborative efforts would extend fundamental knowledge of                     three-body (atom) dynamics in the presence of external fields,                  thereby contributing to our understanding of the principles that                govern atomic structure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        This project in theoretical physics fulfills the program                        objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                 experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                      complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of                   strong mutual interest and competence.",
