 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to configure six networked engineering               workstations with high resolution color monitors, two plotters and              a printer to be used as laboratory equipment in support of a                    course in VLSI digital and analog circuit design.  The equipment                will allow undergraduate electrical engineering students to model,              design, and simulate and produce masks for VLSI circuits.                       Fabrication of the circuits through MOSIS will close the design                 loop:  concept-design-layout-simulation-testing.  The project is                significant from several standpoints:  (1) a laboratory with this               equipment and coordinated with lectures around appropriate                      material will quickly teach students how to design rather than                  simply analyze, (2) it will be a good teaching vehicle to bring                 together basic scientific and engineering principles in                         electronics, device physics, digital systems, processing, and                   signal theory that are often taught independent of one another in               other courses, and (3) it will remove the mystery of complex                    designs and be a good mechanism to inspire and build student                    confidence.",
