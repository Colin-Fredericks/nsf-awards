 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at Indiana               University, Bloomington to help introduce computer-aided                        instruction into their curriculum which should provide the                      physical setting required for an intellectual advance in their                  teaching.   Three projects will be completed which are aimed at                 increasing the effectiveness of teaching biology to                             undergraduates.  These three projects are aimed at three                        different levels:  introductory courses for non-majors,                         intermediate level courses for majors, and advanced courses for                 majors.  In the advanced courses for majors, computer-aided data                acquisition and analysis will be introduced into the laboratory.                The other two levels represent a significant departure from the                 standard methods for biology teaching.  In the presentation of                  material any science course, one is constrained to describe the                 material in a sequential manner, first one topic, then the next.                Textbooks are also constrained to this linear presentation.                     However, the material that is discussed is interrelated, such                   that earlier and later portions of the course, and indeed, of the               curriculum, are interwoven.  It is a major hurdle for students to               grasp the connections; yet, it is these connections which help                  students gain a real understanding of the body of scientific                    knowledge.  In order to help students see these connections, the                biology department will introduce into their courses a computer                 lab, in which students will have access to a non-sequentially                   linked information base constructed in the hypertext environment                of Hypercard for the Macintosh.  Access to this system will                     provide students with the facility to explore the relationships                 of various lecture and laboratory topics, and there by illuminate               the connections.  It is believed that this will surmount one of                 the major difficulties in understanding biological material.  The               grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds from                  non-Federal sources.",
