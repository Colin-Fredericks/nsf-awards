 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arizona State Museum, part of the University of Arizona at                  Tucson, houses an excellent archaeological textile collection                   which includes approximately 1200 textiles and textile fragments.               A 1987 conservation condition survey identified ca. 300 items                   which required improved storage conditions and 26 items in need                 of immediate conservation.  With NSF support both goals will be                 achieved.  The project includes examination, photodocumentation,                and historical research on the materials.  They will be carefully               removed from damaging backings, mounts, and supports.  Protective               archival mounts and pads will be constructed, and the textiles                  will be stored in a custom-built oversize cabinet which affords                 protection from fluctuating environments and deleterious                        particulates.  An experienced textile conservator and                           conservation specialist will be hired for this purpose and a                    well-equipped conservation laboratory in the Museum made                        available to these personnel.                                                                                                                                   The textile materials derive from archaeological contexts both in               the American Southwest and the coast of Peru.  It is rare for                   such fragile remains to be preserved, but in both areas the                     extremely dry climates provided protected environments.  Many                   scientists who have worked with these materials have attested to                their importance.  In prehistoric societies textiles served many                functions, and through analysis of them, scientists can gain                    insight into many aspects of prehistoric society.  Analyses                     provide information on status differences and mechanisms of                     production and distribution.  Examination of dyes and weaving                   techniques reveals information on technological advances and                    innovation.                                                                                                                                                     Ironically, archaeological materials are often best protected if                left in the ground.  If museum storage conditions are inadequate,               objects which have survived for thousands of years unattended can               rapidly decompose.  This project is important because it will                   assist in the preservation of archaeologically significant                      specimens and make them available to a wide range of researchers.",
