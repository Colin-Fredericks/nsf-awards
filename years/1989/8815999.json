 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. Grant J. Mathews, Lawrence Livermore                 National Laboratory, and six colleagues to collaborate with Prof.               Ken'ichi Nomoto, University of Tokyo, Japan, and co-workers over a              period of two years.  They will study mechanisms responsible for the            synthesis of the elements which occurs in stellar explosions,                   including the \"big bang,\" proposed as responsible for the birth of              the universe itself.  Measurements of the electromagnetic and                   neutrino spectra associated with the explosion of the well-observed             1987 supernova will be correlated with theoretical models.  An                  additional phase of this research involves the study of a possible              inhomogeneity of baryon distribution in the universe, which can also            help explain mechanisms of element formation immediately after the              initial big bang.                                                                                                                                               The overall purpose of this research is to understand processes                 involved in the formation of the universe.  The many observations of            the 1987 supernova will be used in conjunction with today's best                theories to obtain a scenario for the origin of our universe, which             resulted from the explosive synthesis of particles into nuclei of               elements, and subsequent ejection of the synthesized material into              the interstellar medium.  Contributions to this scenario will also be           made by the obtaining of an improved theoretical understanding of the           processes of baryon diffusion in the universe, which have long-term             implications for the continuing expansion of the universe.  This                research will bring together workers from Japan and the U.S. who have           each developed models for the 1987 supernova, and who will attempt to           reconcile their work.",
