 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wyoming is proposing to conduct an Engineering Summer         Program (ESP).  ESP is designed to stimulate students' interests in             mathematics, chemistry, physics, atmospheric science, and engineering           fields in students who will be entering their senior year of high               school.  These students are targeted because they are in the process of         making commitments to their careers.  The atmosphere of the program will        foster positive interaction between the participants and the staff.                                                                                             Nearly all of the sessions will be conducted as hands-on laboratory             experiments, with an emphasis on open-ended design problems.  The               students will be guided by experienced and exciting faculty to develop          their research methods and problem solving skills.  The sessions will           introduce the students to developing technologies like robotics,                composite materials, and fiver optics as well as more established areas         like digital circuits, materials engineering, and mining operations             research and the basic sciences of mathematics, physics, and chemistry.         The students will also be introduced to professional responsibilities           and ethics by grappling with current problems involving ethical issues.                                                                                         ESP is a residential summer program for twenty-four students.  However,         the geography of Wyoming precludes regular follow-up activities on              campus during the academic year.  The participants will, however, be            expected to share two laboratory sessions with their classmates at their        home high schoolusing either the equipment they employed during the             summer session or videotaped material.",
