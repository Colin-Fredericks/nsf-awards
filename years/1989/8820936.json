 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate engineering curricula in the U.S. require issues of engineering ethics to be addressed.  Engineers and the engineering profession recognize that students need to learn how to use and assess available information in making ethical decisions, and how to test and develop their own perspectives on professional ethics.  They need to develop the thought processes necessary to integrate information with acceptable professional \"norms\" of behavior, to make ethical decisions.  Ethics and Values Studies in Science, Technology and Society is supporting several projects to develop and test new curricula and teaching methods.  This project will convene a panel of experts to develop a plan for programs and strategies to integrate engineering ethics into engineering curricula.  The panel and associated advisors will review materials, programs and strategies and develop a set of recommendations and options by which to further this process.  Results will include a final report to NSF discussing next steps, a number of papers to be presented at technical meetings, and a presentation for the annual meeting of the American Society of Engineering Educators and for publication in its journal \"Engineering Education\".  This project addresses an important issue in a unique way.  The research team and collaborators are interdisciplinary and well qualified to collaborate.  Further effort is likely to continue beyond the duration of this award.  The project is designed well; university support is good.  An award in the amount of $32,687 is therefore recommended.",
