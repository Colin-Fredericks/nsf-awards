An              announcement in response to workshop registrations will be made to              notify participants of the availability of support.  A committee of             six senior researchers in the field will select the candidates for              travel and subsistence assistance awards.  The awards will seek to              encourage innovative research and special consideration will be given           to aiding young researchers in the field.  The following set of                 priorities will be used in making the awards:  First Priority -                 graduate students who are presenting papers; Second Priority -                  researchers less than 5 years beyond their doctorates who are                   presenting papers; Third Priority - researchers having a proven record          of productivity in the area and who can justify a genuine need for              travel assistance.  In order to stretch the available funds, partial            travel grants will be considered.  All support will be used to aid              attendees from the U.S.",
