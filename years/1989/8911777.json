 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work focusses on photo-nuclear physics and a                  study of the photodisintegration of the deuteron at SLAC, where                 earlier work showed that at about 1.4 GeV a quark description                   becomes possible.  The study will be continued to higher                        energies.  A recoil detection technique which is ideally suited                 for use with internal targets has been perfected and will be                    used to measure radiative capture at intermediate energies.                     Several pion production studies have already been made.  The                    technique can be used to full advantage at the Indiana Cooler                   Ring and at GSI and radiative capture experiments are planned                   at both places.  At low energies, a study of radiative proton                   capture on Aluminum showed that direct capture is the dominant                  nonresonant mode below 2 MeV.  An electron induced proton                       knockout experiment at Bates found an anomalously long mean                     free path for 180 MeV protons in nuclei and it is expected that                 these measurements will be extended to higher energies.",
