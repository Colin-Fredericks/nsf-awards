 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dinoflagellates are distinctive among eucaryotes in several                 ways, one being that their chromosomes are thought to be                        permanently condensed except during DNA synthesis or                            fertilization.  This investigation will employ molecular                        techniques (chromosome isolation, restriction enzyme digestion of               the chromosomes and cloning of the released DNA fragments,                      Southern blot hybridization, in situ hybridization,                             autoradiography) to demonstrate that genetically active DNA is                  found in extrachromosomal filaments, not in the bulk or                         structural DNA. Once the techniques are developed,                              dinoflagellates from different from different extremes of a                     proposed evolutionary lineage will be examined and compared, as                 will the resting cysts of these species. The similarities between               vegetative cells and cysts (which must retain low level metabolic               activity while protecting their DNA from degradation during                     prolonged dormancy) should provide valuable insights into                       adaptive mechanisms that might relate to the unique chromosome                  structure of modern dinoflagellates.                                                 This fellowship award will allow Dr. Anderson to accomplish                the research and training at the Laboratory Arago of the                        University of Paris in France. The motivation for an extended                   stay at this lab is to learn cell and molecular biological                      techniques from colleagues who have strong ongoing programs                     focused on the dinoflagellates - an ecologically and                            evolutionarily important class of marine algae that has been the                focus of Dr. Anderson's excellent research.  The vehicle for this               training and transfer of technology will be a project examining                 the unique manner in which dinoflagellates package and transcribe               genetic information, both as vegetative cells and as resting                    cysts.  This project is of fundamental scientific importance on                 its own but also to allow Dr. Anderson to learn new concepts and                tools that can be incorporated into his ongoing research program,               which focuses on the physiological ecology of toxic                             phytoplankton.",
