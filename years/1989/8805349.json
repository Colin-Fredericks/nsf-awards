 "awd_abstract_narration": "Partially molten systems, in which a change of phase between               liquid and solid can occur, arise in a wide variety of settings,                such as in the solidification of magma chambers and the Earth's                 core and in the casting of metallic alloys.  These multi-phase                  systems are often physically complex and exhibit anomalous                      behavior not seen in single phase systems.  The study of such                   systems has bee hampered by the lack of a set of governing                      equations derived from first principles.  This research will be a               systematic attempt to derive such equations and to elucidate some               of their unusual properties.  Also the characteristics of the                   mushy zone which forms as an aqueous solution of ammonium                       chloride is cooled from below will be studied experimentally to                 determine whether the theory can successfully predict the                       occurrence and characteristics of the chimneys or channels which                from spontaneously.",
