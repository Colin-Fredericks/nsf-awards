 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies in Science, Technology and Society (SSTS) supports                      projects that examine the social, economic, political and                       intellectual contexts that influence the development and use of                 science and technology.  Ethics and Values Studies supports                     projects that examine the social values and mutual obligations                  and responsibilities that arise in these interactions.  Recent                  interest in processes of global environmental change has led both               SSTS and the Division of Social and Economic Sciences at NSF to                 encourage research on the human dimensions of these phenomena.                  This project examines these issues in the context of the                        phenomenon of global warming, one of a class of elusive hazards.                Elusive hazards are those which by their nature have effects                    which are difficult to attribute and occur only cumulatively and                after long periods of time.  These kinds of hazards are also                    politically elusive; attribution of cause and effect is difficult               and crosses national boundaries. Addressing global greenhouse                   effects raises two clusters of equity issues:  inter-generational               and intra-generational.  Furthermore, this is an area of                        scientific complexity and uncertainty.  Thus, as nations attempt                to reduce their release of gases that contribute to global                      climate change, they must be convinced that achieving uncertain                 benefits in the future will be worth incurring costs now.  The                  problem requires a consideration of intergenerational                           responsibility; some way of thinking about what kind of                         environment those of us now living owe those who will succeed us.               Second, if a decision is made that preventative or adaptive                     action should be taken, there are issues of intragenerational                   equity; they concern how costs will or should be allocated among                those now living.  This project will consider these normative and               conceptual questions in the context of relevant scientific data                 and realistic policy options, using a number of kinds of                        scientific models and negotiated agreements to assess the                       effectiveness and fairness of different proposed greenhouse                     reduction schemes.  It will analyse different theories about how                to determine economic obligations and moral responsibilities and                how to allocate costs for reduction in rates of change, and                     develop means for testing models to assess those economic and                   social issues.  A review panel will provide advice to and                       evaluate results from the project.  Results are expected to                     include some recommendations for international agreements.  A                   scholarly monograph and other publications, including some for                  public audiences, will result.                                                                                                                                  This study comes from a group of well-qualified researchers.                    Research and dissemination plans are appropriate; institutional                 support is very good; the budget is adequate.  The project has                  important implications for our understanding of equity issues and               the global greenhouse effect, and should help to identify                       fruitful directions for further research.  Support is highly                    recommended.",
