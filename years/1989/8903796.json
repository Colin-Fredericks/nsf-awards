 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a flattened, convoluted sack                 within muscle cells that controls the movement of calcium ions,                 and thus regulates the contraction of muscle.  It has been hard                 to study the properties of this membranous sack directly because                it is so small and inaccessible within the muscle cell, but new                 techniques have removed both problems.  Dr. Eisenberg has                       developed a mechanically skinned preparation of a specialized                   lobster muscle, the remotor of the second antenna, that contains                a large amount of SR (70% of its volume) to control its very                    rapid contractions.   This preparation can be studied with modern               techniques of electrophysiology.  Its membrane potential can be                 recorded directly, and the properties of the individual ion                     channels of its membrane can be measured.  The objective of this                research is a systematic study of the electrical properties of                  the SR compartment, emphasizing the properties likely to be                     involved in the control of the rapid contraction of the remotor                 muscle.  The following features will be studied:  the ions                      responsible for the resting potential of the SR and the effects                 of calcium ions, chloride ions, caffeine, and procaine which are                known to affect excitation-contraction coupling.  The two                       different types of calcium channel found in the SR will be                      studied, and agents that modulate their behavior will be sought.                The resistance and capacitance of the SR compartment will be                    measured.                                                                                                                                                       This research is of great biological interest.  Although it has                 been known for many years that the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)                  controls muscle contraction by regulating the levels of                         intracellular calcium, this will be the first time that direct                  measurements of the electrical properties of the SR membrane and                its individual ion channels have been made in any preparation.                  This specialized, rapidly contracting lobster muscle should                     provide important clues to the general mechanisms of control of                 muscle contraction.",
