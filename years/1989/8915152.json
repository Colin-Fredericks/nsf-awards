This                                        project is being considered for                                                 implementation under the US-Republic of                                         Turkey Joint Cooperative Science and                                            Technology Program.                                                                                                                                             The project involves the installation of an                                     earthquake strong-motion array in Turkey, to                                    record the strong ground shaking from future                                    earthquakes.  Following the installation of                                     the array, instrumented buildings would be                                      constructed near the array, enabling both the                                   free-field motions and the building response                                    to be recorded.  Because of the unexpected                                      nature, both in time and in space, of the                                       occurrence of earthquakes, and the localized                                    influence of major earthquakes, such data are                                   rarely recorded.  Yet it is this full-scale                                     data that is critically needed to advance the                                   state-of-the-art of earthquake engineering.                                     International cooperation is essential in                                       order to speed up the acquisition of this                                       much-needed data.                                                                                                                                               The objective of the proposed cooperative                                       project is to install a strong-motion array,                                    with densely spaced instrument stations, near                                   to the site (within 20 kilometers) in which a                                   major earthquake (Richter magnitude 6 or                                        greater) is predicted to occur within, say, 5                                   years.  Since scientific earthquake                                             prediction is still in its infancy, the                                         prediction of the occurrence is subject to                                      major uncertainty: the prediction of the                                        location and magnitude of the earthquake is                                     much less uncertain.                                                                                                                                            The planning for this array is occurring in                                     stages.  In 1978, an international workshop                                     in Hawaii identified sites in Turkey as being                                   amongst the most likely locations worldwide                                     to record strong ground motions, as defined                                     above.  In 1985 a US-Turkey workshop held in                                    Istanbul, Turkey, examined in greater depth                                     the feasibility of a strong motion array. The                                   conclusion was that the concept was feasible,                                   and specific recommendations were made.                                                                                                                         The objective of this present workshop is to                                    work out the final details of the US                                            contribution to the cooperative project, and                                    to prepare a report of the findings to be                                       presented to a US-Turkey workshop to be held                                    in Turkey in September, 1989.  Detailed plans                                   for the array will be finalized at this                                         workshop, and the recommendations will be                                       presented to TUBITAK (Turkey) and NSF (US)                                      for joint approval and implementation.//",
