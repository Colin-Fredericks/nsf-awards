The lectures and laboratory are             integrated through the use of microcomputers as \"smart textbooks\".  The         student is guided interactively through various phases of the                   laboratory experience, while keeping in focus the fundamental theories          and concepts that govern circuits and systems.  The equipment while             primarily acquired for the circuits and systems courses, is also                available for design projects in the control, communication and digital         systems courses.  This award is being matched by an equal amount from           the principal investigator's institution.",
