 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Deborah Pearsall and Dolores Piperno will collaborate on a                 three year project to develop the application of phytolith                      analysis to archaeological materials.  Phytoliths are small                     bodies of silica which are deposited within plants and are                      usually preserved in soil after death and decomposition occurs.                 Although one species of plant may produce phytoliths of many                    shapes, and very few shapes are restricted to a single species,                 it is possible to examine phytolith assemblages and make some                   species identifications.  Drs. Pearsall and Piperno will conduct                a multistage research project to further archaeological                         application of phytolith analysis.  They will examine taxonomy,                 determine the best methods of soil processing to extract                        phytoliths, develop improved identification criteria, and finally               work on quantification procedures.  The result will be a series                 of tools of direct archaeological use.                                                                                                                          Only under the most unusual conditions are plant remains                        preserved in archaeological sites.  Thus, because plants play                   such an important dietary role, it is extremely difficult to                    reconstruct prehistoric diets.  In tropical areas of the world,                 where preservation is extremely poor, this problem is                           particularly acute.  Phytoliths, because they are so durable,                   provide a potential way around this problem and therefore merit                 attention.  However, because of the lack of one to one                          correspondence between phytolith species, analysis poses                        difficulties.  This research should help to solve this problem.                                                                                                 The project is important because it will provide archaeologists,                as well as paleobiologists, with a valuable tool which should be                useful in many parts of the world and periods of time.",
