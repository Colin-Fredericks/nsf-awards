 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soon after it leaves Cape Hatteras, the Gulf Stream transport                   increases to values in excess of 150 SV, over five times that                   of the Flordia Current and what is necessary for the interior                   Sverdrup balance.  Little is known about the structure of the                   recirculation regime responsible for the transport increase or                  the nature of its variability.  Altimeter measurements at the                   sea surface suggest that the spectrum of variability is brood,                  encompassing rapid, possibly barotropic shifts in the Gulf                      Stream with time scales of order a month or less, to annual and                 interannual variations, which may be both barotropic and                        baroclinic, the latter associated with the field of mass.  We                   propose to investigate this range of time scales by combining                   repeated shipboard measurements of the Gulf Stream, mainly                      using XBT and acoustic Doppler sections, with satellite infraed                 images and GEOSAT altimeter data.  The shipbopard measurements                  will provide some estimates of the rapid variability of the                     Gulf Stream system and its vertical structure to depths of 800                  m with special emphasis on a line from the continental shelfff                  south of the Cape Cod to Bermuda.  Inverse calculations                         combining varying subsets of the shipboard data can assess the                  degree to which the rapid mode of variability affects resulting                 solutions for mass budgets of the region.  Two cruises are                      envisioned, each of 17-day duration, at times of the year when                  the Gulf Stream reaches its climatological exetrmes of position                 and transport.  Together with the altimeter data, each cruise                   will provide an independent estimate of the surface geoid along                 a track coincident with the GEOSAT altimeter as well as the                     three dimensional structure of the Gulf Stream system at the                    time of the cruises.  The altimetric measurements will be used                  to extend the spatial and temproal sampling from the cruises to                 encompass scales of meanders and annual/interannual                             variability.  The methods employed are analogous to those                       envisioned for the Topography Experiment for Ocean Circulation                  (TOPEX and French POSEIDON) and in situ data during the World                   Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).",
