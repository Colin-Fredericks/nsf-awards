 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Effros, Popa, and Takesaki will continue their                  investigations into operator algebra theory and its applications.               Effros will focus on matricial norms and orderings. This is                     expected to lead to new approaches to Fourier analysis on non-                  abelian groups and to the structure theory of non-injective von                 Neumann algebras. Popa will work on the structure of factors,                   index theory for subfactors, amenability, and rigidity. Takesaki                will study group actions on injective factors, and explore the                  relationship between modular theory for von Neumann algebras and                Connes' cyclic cohomology.                                                           The Hilbert space operators that lie at the heart of this                  project may be thought of as a species of enriched numbers. They                obey the same laws of arithmetic as numbers with two notable                    exceptions, namely that the result of multiplication depends on                 the order in which the factors are taken, and not every nonzero                 operator has an inverse. Mathematical analysis knows only two                   number systems, the real and complex, but there is an immense                   variety of operator algebras. Situations unsuitable for numerical               representation can often be represented in some fashion by                      operator algebras, thanks to the greater degree of flexibility                  available with the latter. The price for this is that                           understanding the structure and classification of operator                      algebras requires considerable effort, as for instance the work                 to be undertaken in this project.",
