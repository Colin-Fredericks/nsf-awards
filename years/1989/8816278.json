 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to establish absolute                    chronologies and reconstruct Quaternary climatic and water-                     balance variations in Qaidam Basin, an arid, high altitude basin                in western China.  The study material consists mainly of long                   drill cores retrieved by Chinese scientists at the Qinghai Salt                 Lakes Institute (QSLI), Academia Sinica.  These cores have                      alternating layers of evaporitic salts and clastic sediments laid               down in varied climatic conditions through the entire Quaternary                or longer.  On selected cores, the QSLI scientists have launched                studies of stable isotopes, U-series/14C/paleomagnetic dating,                  pollen and grain-size analyses, Ostracods, and major/minor                      elemental chemistry.                                                                 Detailed geochronological studies will be done using                       accelerator mass-spectrometric measurements of cosmogenic 26Cl                  and 10Be, supplemented with uranium-series dating for the more                  recent sections.  Additionally, 36Cl and possibly 10Be buildup                  dating glacial moraines in the Kunlun Mountains bordering the                   Qaidam Basin will be carried out to provide a framework for                     correlating the glacial fluctuations at the headwaters of the                   hydrologic systems with the lacustrine variations at the                        terminus.  The proposed research will be a joint project with the               Chinese scientists at QSLI in that samples will be shared and all               the relevant data will be pooled to arrive at optimal interpre-                 tations of the paleoclimatic and paleohydrologic history of the                 region.                                                                              Central Asia is one of the last great \"blank areas\" in the                 world with regard to Quaternary climatic change.  It is also an                 area of particular importance, lying, as it does, near the center               of the world's largest landmass.  Therefore, any light this study               will shed on climatic fluctuations would contribute to global                   paleoclimatological science.                                                     ***",
