 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on the growth of pseudo-binary II-VI semiconductors will               be conducted, aimed at the stabilization of convection in the                   fluid phase through application of large magnetic fields as a                   means for controlling the chemical composition of materials grown               from the melt and solution.  A quantitative relationship between                transport processes and chemical composition of the grown                       material will also be established.  The research program will be                based on a two-tier approach of development and application of                  numerical transport models for solution and melt growth process                 applicable to pseudo-binary alloys, and Bridgman and Travelling                 Heater laboratory growth of II-VI alloys in the presence of                     applied axial magnetic fields, followed by characterization of                  the grown material.  The transport process present in the                       Bridgman and Travelling Heater system will be quantitatively                    differentiated, and the potential for increasing the growth rate                while minimizing compositional variations through a hybrid melt-                solution growth process will be explored.  The primary material                 to be studied is HgMnTe, whose properties as an infra-red                       detector material are, in some respects, superior to HgCdTe.  The               study will also be extended to growth of HgFeSe where the higher                electrical conductivity of the fluid phase will allow for                       stronger magnetic effects on convection stabilization.                                                                                                          The performance and yield of electronic devices based upon pseudo               binary II-VI semiconducting alloys are strongly related to their                chemical composition.  There is a need to closely control the                   crystal growth process to maintain chemical uniformity.  Magnetic               stabilization of the transport processes occurring in the melt                  may be a way to produce very high quality crystals without                      resorting to a micro-gravity environment.",
