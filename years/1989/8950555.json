 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field sciences curriculum in the departments of Biology and                 Earth Sciences will be improved by developing a hands-on,                       instrument-based course in experimental design and data analysis.               In addition, laboratories in existing courses will be improved,                 as will the undergraduate student research program, and the                     development of inter-departmental courses.  Environmental                       monitoring systems include sensors for ground and surface water                 monitoring, air quality including particulates, and soil probes.                These will be integrated into a computer workstation and                        terminals.  The systems will be integrated into laboratory                      exercises and activities which expose students to practical use                 of the instrumentation in real experimental situations,                         which will allow them to develop abilities in critical thinking                 and experimental design.                                                                                                                                        The school will provide 50% matching funds.",
