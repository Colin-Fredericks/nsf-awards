 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks a modest level of funding to update and expand an           earlier, highly influential study by this investigator.  The previous           study, completed just over a decade ago, made a major contribution to           the quantitative analysis of risks and to the study of the regulation           of risks by helping to place the health risks of various activities             in perspective.  In particular, reviewers commented on the ability of           the earlier study to inform debates about the willingness of society            to spend money to save a life across a variety of situations.                   However, this earlier study is both outdated (there have been                   important changes in risk management regulations in the past 10                 years) and incomplete (there have been important changes in the                 nature of risky activities in the past 10 years).  Thus the proposed            study will be able to lead to better theory, because it will aid the            study of risk comparisons, as well as better policy, because the                results of the new study should quickly be substituted by decision              makers for the less-relevant results of the older study. The project            is unusual for the DRMS program, but it is highly supported because             it is straightforward, important, and the policy-relevance is                   demonstrably high.",
