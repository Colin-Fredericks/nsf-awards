The aim of the conference is to explore the                   view that rules governing phrase structure are not stipulatory                  but are generalizations, derived from underlying principles.  The               conference will bring together people who have been working in                  this area, and will provide a forum for the interchange of ideas                which should result in a clearer understanding of the issues and                a focussing of research.                                                                                                                                             Particular attention will be devoted to questions about the                nature of categorial structure, and cross-categorial generaliza-                tions and differentiations, and to those properties of phrase                   structure which appear not to be projections of the thematic                    properties of heads.  Exploration of this topic will contribute                 toward understanding the degree to which rules governing prhase                 structure can be considered an autonomous component in the mod-                 ular theory of syntax, as well as toward an understanding of the                rule system itself.  An edited collection of papers resulting                   from the conference will be published.                                                                                                                               The conference focuses on a related set of questions which                 are at the heart of linguistic theory, dealing with the funda-                  mental organization of grammatical systems.  The participants in                the conference are leading theoreticians who have been working                  recently on the topics to be discussed.  The conference can be                  expected to provide valuable direction to their work, and also                  make a substantive contribution to the field in the publication                 of the conference papers.",
