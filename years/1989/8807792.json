 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) coordinated by               the U.S. and Canadian Fish and Wildlife Services provides                       potentially valuable data for assessing the effects of natural                  variation and human activities on the distribution and abundance                of wild organisms.  The BBS consists of standardized censuses of                breeding birds conducted annually for the last 20 years at                      approximately 1,800 local sites in the U.S. and Canada.  The main               reason why the BBS has not been more heavily used by scientists                 is that the sheer magnitude of the data set requires                            sophisticated computer techniques for analysis.                                      This proposed research will begin an intensive computer                    analysis of the BBS to determine: 1) the size and pattern of                    fluctuations in bird populations from year-to-year within a local               census site and among the numerous sites across the North                       American continent; 2) the extent to which these fluctuations are               correlated with and caused by changes in climate, land use, and                 other factors; and 3) the degree to which different bird species                show similar or different patterns of variation in abundance and                distribution.  Special attention will be devoted to identifying                 factors that are associated with declines in abundances and                     contractions in geographic ranges.                                                   The proposed research will provide increased understanding                 of the relationships between animal populations and their                       environment on time scales of decades and spatial scales of an                  entire continent.  The research will also contribute importantly                to assessing the effects of human-caused changes in climate and                 land use on the abundance and diversity of wild species.",
