This acquisition provides students with hands-on experience in using            the instrument and direct experience in identifying the structure of            products they synthesize.  Organic Chemistry I has been modified so             that students are introduced to NMR theory during the last half of the          fall quarter.  Introduction of the instrument in the laboratory                 coincides with the theorectical lectures.  Students verify the identity         of their laboratory product using IR and NMR spectroscopy.  Students            have access to the NMR during approximately 15 laboratory exercises in          three organic chemistry courses.  The institution is matching the NSF           grant with an equal amount of funds.",
