This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic, corporate,               and government cooperation in the support of basic research in                  the mathematical sciences.                                                           This equipment will be used to support three projects in the               Institute for Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computing at                   Indiana University: Analysis and Computation of Turbulent Flows,                directed by Ciprian Foias and Roger Temam; Numerical Studies of                 Collisionless Plasmas, directed by Robert Glassey; and Analysis                 and Computation of Discontinuous Compressible Flows, directed by                David Hoff.",
