 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will compliment and extend the five year old                        Governor's Summer Program in Science and Mathematics at                         Rhode Island College for  highly able and highly motivated                      high school students in the state's fifty public and                            private schools.  A two week residential research                               participation component, added to the four week commuter                        program, will allow twenty-four high school juniors and                         seniors to work with practicing researchers in the design                       and implementation of a  Chemistry/Environmental Science                        project.  An academic-year follow-up component will extend                      and sustain the experience for the participants and provide                     a link to their classmates and teachers by involving them                       in similar local research projects.  Assistance will be                         provided in the  form of guidance and equipment to ensure                       that a significant impact can be made on the schools                            involved.  A significant part of the activity  will involve                     career exploration and the necessary academic preparation                       required for a career in the sciences.  The project also                        focuses on the philosophy of science, the scientific                            method, and scientific ethics in terms of treating data                         effectively.",
