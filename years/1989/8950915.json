 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide for computerized data acquisition and                 analysis in the lower division electricity and magnetism laboratories           for engineering students.  The equipment will provide the ability to            sense temperatures, voltages, and currents directly and read them into          computerized spreadsheets.  Additional equipment will drive the                 experiments (power supplies and function generators) and produce                printed output (printers and plotters).  This will continue an on-going         project of upgrading laboratory facilities and equipment at the                 college.                                                                                                                                                        The software involved in this project will include LOTUS 123, an                integrated spreadsheet, graphics and database package, and LOTUS                Measure, an add-on module for 123 that allows measurements to be                gathered from instruments directly into 123.  LabTech Notebook will             also be used in parallel with LOTUS 123 and LOTUS Measure, to                   demonstrate a slightly different method of accomplishing the same ends          and to give the ability to do real time graphic display of gathered             data.                                                                                                                                                           The College will match the award with an equal amount.",
