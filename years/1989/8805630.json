 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Phaseoleae is the largest taxonomic tribe of the legume                family.  Among the more than 80 genera of the tribe are a number                of familiar food plants including the garden bean, lima bean,                   soybean, hyacinth bean, pigeon pea, cowpea, mungbean, and jack                  bean.  Despite the economic importance of the tribe,                            relationships among the genera are in most cases poorly known.                  Three levels of systematic questions will be addressed by Dr.                   Jeffrey Doyle of Cornell University in this project: 1) what are                the natural grouping of genera? 2) how are natural groups of                    genera related to one another? and 3) is the tribe as a whole a                 natural, monophyletic group?  This third question has important                 implications for the phylogeny of the entire papilionoid (bean)                 subfamily of the Leguminosae, because the tribal taxonomy is                    based largely on a few key morphological characters of dubious                  validity.  Thus to address the third question, groups outside the               Phaseoleae will also be studied.                                                     The characters to be analyzed in the research are molecular                in nature.  Preliminary work has shown that two major structural                mutations of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) will be useful for the                     circumscription of groups of genera at the levels of subtribe                   within the Phaseoleae and of groups of tribes related to the                    woody Millettieae.  An insertion sequence in a storage protein                  gene characterizes the soybean and its close relatives.  A                      duplication for the gene encoding cytosolic glucosephosphate                    isomerase has been silenced in various members of the Phaseoleae.               The first stage of the project, therefore, will be to use such                  rare mutations to delimit groups of taxa, affording at least                    partial answers to the questions posed.  Once natural groups are                defined, precise relationships among genera can be studied by                   such techniques as cpDNA mapping and the sequencing of particular               genes.",
