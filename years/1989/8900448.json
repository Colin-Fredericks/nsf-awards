 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) is in the                    fields of chemistry and biochemistry.  For a three year period                  beginning April 1989, nine (9) undergraduate students will each                 spend ten (10) weeks engaged in \"hands-on\" research under the                   direction of one of 19 faculty members who will be matched with a               student.  The unique aspect of this proposal is its focus on the                very high concentration of minority students enrolled in community              colleges in Los Angeles and other large metropolitan areas.  The                objective of the program will be to provide a comprehensive                     research experience for these minority community college students,              who have little if any prior exposure to research.  Preference                  will be given to those minority students who have already applied               for admission to 4-year colleges and universities.  Each student                will select his/her own research advisor, and the nature and scope              of the research project will be arranged to suit the student's                  level and interests through consultation between the advisor and                student.  The students will be able to select from areas of                     chemistry including biological catalysis, chemical analysis,                    chemistry physics, chemical transformations, separations, ecology,              electrochemistry, reaction mechanisms and microbial conversions.",
