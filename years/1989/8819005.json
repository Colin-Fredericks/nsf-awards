 "awd_abstract_narration": "The killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, naturally spawns in Northeast             Florida salt marshes with semilunar periodicity throughout most of the          year.  In addition, during the biweekly 3-to 4-day periods of spawning,         killifish only spawn once each day coincident with the highest tide.            Since killifish oocytes are periodically recruited, grown, and ovulated         as eggs in preparation for this spawning activity, this animal can thus         serve as a superb model for periodic female reproductive activity.                                                                                              Gonadotropins secreted by the pituitary are thought to directly                 regulate essentially all ovarian activity.  The PIs will purify                 gonadotropins from killifish pituitaries so that they can prepare               antibodies against them.  Then, by using appropriately labeled                  antigonadotropin antibodies, the PIs plan to identify which cells in the        pituitary synthesize and secrete each identified gonadotropin and when          this occurs; the PIs will also be able to measure gonadotropin levels in        the bloodstream and discover whether or not these levels are constant or        cycling.  This should allow the PI to correlate each type of                    gonadotropin with specific ovarian events.                                                                                                                      Specific ovarian events will also be studied in order to better                 understand how the various cells of the ovary respond to circulating            gonadotropin.",
