The new equipment will consist of a MicroVAX II                    computer system interfaced with an IVAS processor and display                   device.  A comprehensive image processing software package for                  the rectification, enhancement, classification, and merging of                  digital image data sets, including future upgrades, will be                     provided by the U.S. Geological Survey.  Improvement of course                  instruction and \"hands-on\" laboratory experience with image                     processing algorithms is the primary objective of the effort.                                                                                                   The addition of this system to the Remote Sensing Program will                  enable students from a variety of disciplines to develop a                      practical working knowledge of digital image processing and                     associative analytical procedures.  This experience, in turn,                   will better prepare the students for graduate studies and                       professional careers when a knowledgeable perspective on digital                image processing is required.  The grantee institution is                       matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.",
