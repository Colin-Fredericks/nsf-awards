 "awd_abstract_narration": "Determination of the direction and magnitude of stresses within                 the oceanic crust to constrain models for the forces driving the                plates is a principal objective of the next ten years of the                    Ocean Drilling Program.  Although observations of stress-induced                wellbore breakouts with ultrasonic televiewer wellbore scanning                 have provided indications of the directions of the maximum and                  minimum principal horizontal stresses in these ODP boreholes, no                direct measurements or estimates of stress magnitudes have been                 made.  Recent theoretical developments applied to sites on land                 can be extended to holes drilled in the oceanic crust to allow                  constraints to be placed on the magnitudes of in situ stresses                  based on the presence or absence of breakouts and other wellbore                failure phenomena, and from constraints imposed by the frictional               strength of the crust.                                                                                                                                          This project will estimate magnitudes of in situ stress by re-                  analyzing existing borehole televiewer data.  Breakouts will form               when the difference between the circumferential stress                          concentration and the radial stress at the borehole wall exceeds                the strength the rock.  Constraints can be placed on the stress                 magnitudes if breakouts occur and if the strength of the rock is                known.  Corrections will be made for thermal effects and pore                   pressure effects.  Laboratory measurements will be made of the                  tensile and unconfined compressive strength for rock from the                   depth at which observations of tensile cracks or breakouts are                  obtained.",
