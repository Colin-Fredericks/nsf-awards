 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrothermal reactions at mid-ocean ridges have a profound                 influence on the chemical and isotopic composition of seawater                  and the oceanic crust, involving chemical fluxes of many elements               exceeding those from global river discharge.  Despite its                       importance, fundamental aspects of these hydrothermal processes                 such as the extent of reaction at various temperatures and fluid                flow paths are not well constrained.  In addition, subduction of                the altered crust results in the reinjection of elements derived                from the hydrosphere back into the mantle.  The bulk chemical                   transfer rates and the chemical signature of these recycled                     materials is poorly constrained.                                                     Recently it has been demonstrated that there are large                     boron isotopic fractionations associated with the alteration of                 the oceanic crust (Spivack and Edmond, 1987).  This exchange                    exerts a primary control on the boron isotopic composition of                   seawater (~40 per mil enriched in the 11B/10B ratio relative to                 continental and oceanic igneous rocks|)  and imparts a boron                    isotopic signature to the crust that should be useful as a                      tracer of subducted volatiles, and diagnostic in evaluating the                 nature of hydrothermal processes including fluid reaction                       histories, temperatures of reaction and flow paths.                                  We propose to conduct a boron isotope study of the Troodos                 ophiolite that is aimed at two goals:  1) establishing a first                  order boron isotope profile for the altered oceanic crust and 2)                developing the background data required for the future                          exploitation of boron isotopes in the study of hydrothermal                     systems.  To these ends we intend to determine (B) and 11B in                   whole rocks and vein separates that are mineralogically and                     chemically well characterized.  Alteration temperatures and                     fluid evolution wii be constrained by oxygen and strontium                      isotope data.",
