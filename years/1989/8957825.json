The theory of Harris recurrent Markov (HRMI) chains                 and processes will be used as the main tool.  These results give                a significant contribution towards the development of a broad                   theory of queues.  Together with the development of regenerative                simulation, it is felt that such a theory will at least                         rigorously justify the standard practice of simulating large and                complicated networks (that cannot be studied analytically) and                  possibly, by taking advantage of the inherent regenerative                      structure, will lead to better simulation methods.                                   Many questions remain unanswered, immediate research plans                 are as follows:  (1)  Solve moment problems for the queues.  The                main objective is to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions                 on the input point process so that the distribution of steady-                  state system quantities have finite moments.  Solving this                      problem should lead to approximations and bounds for these                      (extremely intractable) steady-state quantities and should give                 rigorous conditions for using simulation to estimate them.                      (2)  Generalize much of the present theory to systems that allow                feedback.  The research should show that (under reasonable                      conditions) even if arrivals to an open queueing network have                   paths allowing them to repeatedly attend a given station and/or                 return to previously attended stations, then the queue is                       regenerative if the input is HRMI.  (3) Make the general result                 (with HRMI) more plausible.  Assuming such general results hold,                each node of the network when isolated could be modeled so that                 the moment problems for these networks would fall in the                        framework.//",
