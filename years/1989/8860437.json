 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measurement of displacements and motion during a real or                        simulated earthquake is fundamental in experimental earthquake                  engineering research.                                                                                                                                           This research project investigates the concept of using a                       holographic camera that is capable of producing a motion and                    strain diagnostics picture of a large surface at kilometer                      distances.  The intended purpose of the instrument is to                        monitor surfaces such as the face of a building, a bridge                       foundation, a retaining wall, or a geological structure during                  interaction with real or simulated geological or meteorological                 forces.                                                                                                                                                         In ordinary holography an unmodulated reference wave that                       travels the same distance as the object wave is required.  The                  research extends holographic interferometry to large, distant                   surfaces by deriving the holographic reference wave from one                    of three possible sources, from the object wave, a method                       known as local reference wave holography, from an optical                       delay line, or from a glint on the object.  The recording is                    further enhanced through the use of CCD detectors and light                     amplifiers.  Strain or motion contours and vibrational mode                     structure can then be observed with resolutions of the order of                 0.3 micrometers.                                                                                                                                                The device employs double pulsed holographic interferometry.                    The research will employ both analytical and experimental                       methods to determine feasibility.
