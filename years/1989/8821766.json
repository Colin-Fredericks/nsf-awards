These methods, lumped under the                title \"discontinumm mechanics\" include a geometric analysis                     (block theory) and a numerical analysis (discontinuous                          deformation analysis).  The case histories selected are in                      different types of rocks that contain so many joints that                       continuum mechanics may not be applicable and where, in contrast,               application of discontinuum mechanics is appropriate.  The cases                include an underground powerhouse to be constructed in Mexico, a                vehicular tunnel to be enlarged from a pilot tunnel in Kentucky,                and a shaft to be excavated in Nevada.  Careful geotechnical                    mapping is in progress or has been completed in each case so the                data will be available with which to perform verification                       studies.  Forward modelling predictions will be matched against                 actual behavior.  Actual block movements will be back calculated.               The potential of block theory and discontinuous deformation                     analysis as tools for designers of underground works will then be               enhanced as these approaches are tested and adjusted for the                    \"real work\".",
