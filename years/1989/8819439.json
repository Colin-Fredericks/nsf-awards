 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many cellular processes, including motility, are controlled by               the calcium ion concentration within the cell.  In muscle cells,                the calcium ions used to regulate the state of contraction are                  stored within a membranous reservoir, the sarcoplasmic reticulum.               Release of calcium from the SR results in cellular contraction;                 resequestration of the calcium within the SR results in                         relaxation.  The uptake of calcium is due to a calcium ATPase                   which pumps calcium ions across the membrane.  During pumping,                  the enzyme passes through two intermediate forms which involve                  phosphorylation of the protein.  This laboratory is interested in               how this calcium pump functions, and has been employing as a                    model system a preparation of SR from scallop muscle, which has a               uniquely paracrystalline arrangement of the calcium ATPase which                makes possible electron microscopic diffraction analysis and                    other biophysical approaches.                                                                                                                                   This laboratory has recently found that, in scallop muscle SR,                  the two intermediate forms show a different crystalline                         arrangement in the SR membrane.  One of the implications of this                finding is that the enzyme molecules may rotate in the membrane                 during the pumping cycle.  The laboratory has also found that the               lipid composition of the scallop SR is strikingly different from                rabbit muscle SR, which is the common biological material for                   studies of the calcium pump.  Further exploitation of this unique               model system will be pursued.                                                                                                                                   Transport of calcium across membranes is of universal                           physiological importance in all cells, and results from this work               will have relevance to many aspects of cell biology and                         organismal physiology.",
