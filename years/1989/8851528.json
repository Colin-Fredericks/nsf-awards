 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to establish a design and analysis                   laboratory based on networked engineering workstations for use by               junior and senior year undergraduates in the Civil Engineering and              Mechanical Engineering design courses at the University of                      Vermont.  The major instruments to be purchased are seven                       engineering workstations, a laser printer, and one graphics                     plotter for hard copy output.  The equipment is to be used in                   upper level design and senior project courses for instruction and               practice in modeling, design, analysis and simulation appropriate               to each course.  The project is significant on several counts:  it              is a logical extension of present micro-computer based design and               analysis laboratories used in freshman and sophomore courses;                   upper level courses can coordinate the use of this equipment with               lectures to teach design and evaluation rather than simply                      analysis; it will allow rapid, effective combination of scientific              and engineering principles in areas that are normally taught and                considered independently; and it will promote rapid and effective               assimilation of our graduates into productive contributors to the               nation's industrial base.",
