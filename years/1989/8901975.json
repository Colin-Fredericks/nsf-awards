 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cohomological physics refers to that part of mathematical                  physics, primarily gauge and other field theories, in which a                   variety of cohomological techniques are seeing increasing                       application.  Stasheff's own research is concerned with                         application of those techniques he had earlier developed in                     relation to his study of classifying spaces and rational                        homotopy theory.  Currently he is particularly concerned with                   two classes of problems:  I) the homological aspects of                         reduction of constrained Hamiltonian systems, both classical                    and quantum, as embodied in the BRST formalism and the                          Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky complex and its generalizations, and                 II) homotopy associative differential graded algebras as they                   occur in string field theories and spin n-algebras.                                  Henneaux and Stasheff have generalized the BFV complex to                  handle reducible constraints of first class and now intend to                   apply the construct to physically interesting examples.                              Analogs of associating homotopies have appeared in string                  field theory and have led Stasheff to define a homotopy                         associative convolution algebra and tensor calculus.  With the                  Italian physicist, Cotta-Ramusino, he plans to investigate the                  physical significance of this homotopy and possible higher                      order structures as in his previous work.  Such higher order                    terms are definitely present in spin-n algebras for n bigger                    than 2.  He intends to investigate these higher order                           structures by translating them into the BRST formulism.                              Many of the techniques used in these applications come                     from Homological Perturbation Theory.  This project includes                    further development of that machinery at the theoretical level                  in addition to the applications in theoretical physics.",
