 "awd_abstract_narration": "Focusing on cooperation within the State, the Chemical Sciences                 Consortium is conducting a three year project oriented towards                  enhancement of the chemical science faculties at the Regional                   Universities of Mississippi.  Because of their strength in the                  Chemical Sciences, both in terms of educational and research                    activities, the University of Southern Mississippi has been asked by            the Consortium to function as the lead University in this project.                                                                                              Two one week Chemical Science Conferences are being conducted each of           the three years of the project under the supervision of the                     Consortium's Coordination Committee.  Each of the six week long                 conferences has been organized by co-chairs who are recognized experts          within the topical area of that conference.  Each conference emphasizes         a nationally important new topic in the chemical sciences.  Several of          the topics transverse the traditional boundaries of chemistry. Each of          the programs will feature several nationally renowned invited speakers          who will deliver lectures on vital new aspects concerning that                  conference's topic.  These lectures also will be open to general                audiences.  The remaining activities of each program, i.e.                      demonstrations, topical discussions, laboratory experiments, etc.,              will be available only to the participants.  At least 30% of each               conference is being devoted to hands-on laboratory, using the                   specialized equipment available at the host institution.  The project           also features a unique on-site visit by each of the conference co-              chairs to each of the participants universities to aid their faculty in         implementing inclusion of the new information into their curricula and          \"return\" visits by the participants and selected students to the host           university to use equipment not available on the participant's campus.                                                                                          The host institution and The Institutions of Higher Learning of                 Mississippi are contributing one-third of the cost of the project.",
