 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Museum of History and Science in Louisville will conduct                    an internship program in support of the Jefferson County                        Public Schools' \"Professional Development Model for Science                     Improvement\".                                                                                                                                                   The Teacher Internship Program in Science (TIPS) will involve                   recruiting five talented beginning elementary of middle                         school teachers to Jefferson County Public Schools each of                      the next three tears and teaming them with five mentor                          teachers.  The co-teachers will begin the Internship Program                    with a ten week summer program, eight of material development                   in June and July, and two of in-service training in August                      From September through December, the beginning teachers will                    alternate being at the Museum three days a week while working                   in the school classroom two days per week with their mentor                     co-teacher.  In the second term, the process will be                            reversed; mentor teachers will intern at the Museum three                       days per week while their co-teachers work in the classroom.                    This plan has been developed in direct collaboration with an                    Advisory Team of classroom teachers, the Jefferson County                       Science Supervisor, the University of Louisville, and the                       Museum staff.                                                                                                                                                   The project will offer mentor teachers the reward of a                          sabbatical from normal duties and the opportunity to learn                      both new content and new methodologies.  Qualified new                          teachers will be offered the opportunity to co-teach their                      first year with an experienced mentor teacher, participate in                   a hands-on internship at the museum, and receive leadership                     and in-service training.                                                                                                                                        Using Starlab and other resources such as kits, exhibits, and                   collections, teachers will learn new methodologies,                             experiment with their ideas in new settings, and share a                        professional relationship with new colleagues.  Each intern                     will model successful interactive teaching techniques in                        physics, chemistry, earth science, and life science.  The                       school system assures that each mentor and intern, aided by                     the Museum and University staff, will teach ten other                           teachers in an in-service program.                                                                                                                              This project provides a means of recruiting beginning                           teachers of high academic quality, offers a system of                           induction into the teaching profession, and provides an                         approach to retaining highly qualified experienced teachers.                    Science Museums are particularly well suited to partners in                     these endeavors because of their emphasis on participatory                      learning, their resources, and their position in the                            community.                                                                                                                                                      The Jefferson County Public Schools and the Museum of History                   and Science have contributed an amount equal to approximately                   twice that of the National Science Foundation award.",
