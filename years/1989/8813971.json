 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the most challenging global environmental problems is             the threat that chemical pollution may cause significant                        depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer during the next                      century.  Because of the complex chemical, radiative, and                       dynamical processes that together determine the global budget of                ozone, many physical mechanisms must be understood before a                     comprehensive model can be developed for prediction of the                      evolution of the ozone layer.                                                           The budget of stratospheric ozone is strongly influenced by             global transport within the stratosphere and by transfer of                     various trace chemicals between the troposphere and stratosphere.               Thus an understanding of the mechanisms and global distribution                 of troposphere.stratosphere coupling is essential for an                        understanding of the global circulation of the stratosphere, and                its influence on the ozone layer.                                                       Cumulonimbus convective storms can contribute to                        troposphere.stratosphere coupling through production of                         vertically propagating wave motions that transfer momentum from                 the troposphere to the stratosphere, and through transfer of                    chemical trace constituents into the stratosphere by convective                 overshooting of individual cloud turrets, followed by turbulent                 mixing. Professors Holton and Durran will study these processes                 with the aid of a numerical model designed to simulate the                      dynamical, microphysical, and radiative properties of                           cumulonimbus cloud systems in the tropics. Observations from                    recent field experiments will be used to help specify initial                   conditions, and to validate the model results.  Professors Holton               and Durran will also evaluate the possible role of high altitude                cirrus anvil clouds formed by cumulonimbus convection in                        dehydrating the stratosphere through radiative destabilization                  and resultant ice particle growth and fallout.",
