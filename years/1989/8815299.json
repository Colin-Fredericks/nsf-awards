 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program will support a project in the general area of                 inorganic solution chemistry and in the specific area of the                    chemistry of polyoxometalate anions. Polyoxometallate anions                    are the largest inorganic compounds which can be brought into                   solution, and their solution chemistry is in a region                           intermediate between that of small molecules and that of solid                  metal oxides. This project is expected to help elucidate the                    processes which occur at the surfaces of metal oxides during                    catalysis, and in particular to elucidate the mechanism by                      which acrylonitrile is synthesized using bismuth molybdate as a                 catalyst, a process responsible for the production of four                      million tons of this chemical per year.                                                                                                                         The overall objective of the project is to exploit the                          synthetic methodologies developed recently for organohydrazido                  complexes of polyoxomolybdates in the synthesis of                              polyoxometalates with organoimido ligands. Emphasis will be                     placed on the synthesis of organoimido derivatives which are                    soluble in organic solvents, of polyoxomolybdate complexes                      stabilized by coligands, and of lacunary polyoxomolybdates. The                 complexes will be characterized by x-ray crystallography, by                    multinuclear NMR, and by electrochemistry. Thermal and                          photochemical decomposition of the organoimido derivatives, as                  well as their reactions with allylalcohol and alkenes, will be                  investigated.",
