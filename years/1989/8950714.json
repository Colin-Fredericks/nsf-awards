 "awd_abstract_narration": "Columbia College has a significant tradition of training                   future communications professionals.  The Science Department                    incorporates this tradition into the chemistry curriculum by                    offering courses which examine the impact of chemistry on areas                 of social concern like the environment, drugs and drug testing,                 and consumer product quality.  The results of student research                  projects in these and other areas are integrated with the                       student's communications specialties through the preparation of                 reports as videotapes, films, artwork and other creative                        presentations.  Laboratory experience, which is a strong emphasis               throughout the curriculum, features numerous applications of gas                chromatography component of the laboratory program, and extend it               to its next logical step:  GC/mass spectroscopy.  The new                       equipment, used in conjunction allows students to investigate and               report on a wide variety of realistic problems in the application               of chemistry to the concerns and needs of society.  The                         institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of                   funds.",
