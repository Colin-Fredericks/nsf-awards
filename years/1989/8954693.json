 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mercer University School of Engineering will organize a network of          science and mathematics teachers in rural districts of south and                central Georgia to enhance their understanding of the engineering               field.  The goal is to improve their ability to interest students in            engineering, counsel them about its opportunities and educational               requirements, and insure their courses prepare students well for entry          into engineering colleges.  Through the network the School will                 provide the teachers with workshops in engineering fundamentals,                current technology for incorporation in science curricula, and                  examples of mathematics applications in industry.  The three year               program will include: (1) one-week summer residential institutes on             the Mercer campus; (2) school year visits by engineering educators to           elementary, middle, and high schools for demonstrations, lectures and           counseling; (3) a final one-day working reunion and planning session            for network continuation, and (4) a regular newsletter.  During the             three years at least 100 teachers will have been in the summer                  workshops, and 200 teachers and 6000 students will have been involved           in school year activities.  Particular emphasis will be given to                reaching female and minority students, since they have traditionally            been underrepresented in engineering.                                                                                                                           Cost sharing by the partners will total 8% of the National Science              Foundation funding.",
