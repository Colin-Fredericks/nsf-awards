 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research of this Presidential Young Investigator is in the                  artificial intelligence fields of learning and automated                        reasoning.  Because computers require an explicit model of a                    system to perform reasoning and the character of the reasoning                  depends critically on the nature of the model, great leverage can               be obtained by enabling programs to reformulate their models                    dynamically.  The investigator has pursued reformulation in his                 work on aggregation and the comparative analysis techniques of                  differential qualitative analysis and exaggeration.  He will now                incorporate ideas from machine learning to aid in the                           reformulation task.  One specific project is to generalize                      current schemes for model reformulation.  The limits of                         applicability for each model will be represented explicitly in a                language based on the simplifications implicitly assumed by the                 model.  A second project is a restricted form of theory                         formation:  the automatic construction of world models.  Here the               approach is to generalize previous work on measurement                          interpretation and view application by characterizing the                       program's views with the modeling language described above.",
