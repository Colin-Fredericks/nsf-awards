 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding of how signals and other combinations of waves propagate          through irregular media depends on our knowledge of the interaction of          the waves with the medium.  The direct or local interaction is well             understood, but the cumulative effect upon a long propagation path is           more complicated.  For many purposes of signal evaluation it suffices           to calculate the arrived signal only.  To do so, the signal energy              scattered in other directions is mostly neglected.  In this work, the           effect of the neglected energy is taken into account, as are -in                particular- the ramifications for backscatter and signal attenuation.           Signal attenuation cannot be properly accounted for without these               corrections, backscatter in principle can obscure reflections from a            desired target far into the propagation medium, and source strength             can be severely underestimated when cumulative backscatter is ignored.          The method of this work is based upon a recasting of the wave equation          into two coupled equations for Forwards and Backwards waves, and upon           useful approximations for decoupling the resulting equations for                stochastic moments (averages of powers of the signal strength) from             each other.  Fundamental new results include calculations of the                backscatter losses and provision of a basis for older, heuristic two-           flux scattering models.",
