 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop new algorithms for                 allocation and control of network resources.  The proposal                      focuses on three topics:                                                             1.  Rate based flow control.  The research will concentrate                on the class of algorithms, the researchers call switch-point                   adjustment, in which the switching elements in the network take                 note of the flow currently passing through them, assign a maximum               rate to each flow, and pass that information back to the end-                   points.                                                                              2.  Congestion constraints.  Emphasis will be placed on                    developing specific congestion controlling techniques that place                agreed upon constraints on either the network or the nodes or                   both.                                                                                3.  Buffer management within the network.  Research will                   include the study of the architectural alternative of large                     buffers within the network, and exploration of a possible                       fairness algorithm and transport protocol suitable for sending                  short transmissions that can be constrained rather than                         controlled.",
