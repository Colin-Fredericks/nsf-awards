 "awd_abstract_narration": "As research on global environmental change has advanced in recent          years, scientists have become increasingly aware that humans (acting as         individuals and through institutions) have significant and complex              interactions with natural systems.  Humans alter natural environmental          conditions, and they respond to changes in those conditions.                    Independent research projects examining the human dimensions of global          environmental change have clarified some of the processes of                    anthropogenic change, and a number of conferences and publications have         tried to synthesize information from different disciplines and outline          future research needs.  These efforts have not been well coordinated,           however, nor have many of them involved leading scholars with                   experience in the analysis of human-environmental interactions.  This           award will partially fund the operations of a Committee on the Human            Dimensions of Global Change to be sponsored by the Commission on                Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education (CBASSE) of the National           Research Council.  Through its meetings and commissioned studies, this          committee will (1) assess previous research on the topic, (2) evaluate          extant data sources, (3) consider how collaborative research would              enhance the generation of knowledge and attract more social and                 behavioral scientists to conduct work in this important field, and (4)          develop a research agenda that could be implemented in the near future.         The committee will publish a report with its assessments and                    recommendations by the summer of 1990.                                               This committee will play a crucial role in the evaluation of               research that already has been conducted and in the determination of            research strategies that will be most productive in the analysis of the         human dimensions of global environmental change.  Because of its                stature and its experience in the conduct of studies like this, the             National Research Council will involve more of the nation's leading             scientists in this project and will provide a more effective and wide-          spread means of disseminating the conclusions reached by the committee.         As a result, future research on this topic will be grounded in a more           rationale context than would otherwise evolve.",
