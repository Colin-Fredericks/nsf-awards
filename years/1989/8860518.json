 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of materials chemistry and in               the subfield of organometallic chemistry.  The thrust of this                   experimental activity is the synthesis and characterization of new              molecules as more efficient precursors for the fabrication of thin              metal film devices by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition                    (MOCVD) technology.  Unsymmetrical tellurides (RTeR') represent a               novel alternative to the non-optimal source reagents currently in               use.  These unsymmetrical tellurides will have increased                        volatility while maintaining labile tellurium-carbon bonds by                   appropriate choice of the R and R' groups.  The technical approach              in this Phase activity is the synthesis and characterization of a               series of five compounds of formula RTeR' by modifications of                   literature procedures.  These five compounds will be pyrolized and              the products identified.  The relative role of carbon-based vs.                 tellurium-based radicals on the decomposition rate and growth                   temperature will be studied.                                                                                                                                    Low growth temperatures are essential for the MOCVD of abrupt                   heterojunction devices fabricated from mercury cadmium telluride.               Success in Phase I will result in the identification of new, low                temperature source reagents for the MOCVD of tellurium alloys.                  Upon successful completion of this Phase I research, the utility                of these reagents will be demonstrated in the fabrication of                    mercury cadmium telluride films in a subsequent Phase II effort.",
