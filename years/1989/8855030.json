This program will foster and encourage a                                 multi-cultural participation by Asian, Black, Hispanic,                         Native American and Caucasian junior and senior high school                     students exploring science and technology career options.                       A major impediment to active participation of lower                             social-economic level students has been the inability of                        their parents to support them financially when the local                        school systems cannot pay for external science and                              technologyeducation experiences.  The Young Scholars                            Program Project would enable the New York Academy of                            Sciences to offer cost free to students, the Bridge to                          Environmental  Sciences Careers, a new program and expand                       minority youth participation in our existing Advance Skills                     Internship Program.                                                                  Twenty-five (25) minority 8th - 10th grade students                        selected from New York City junior and senior high schools                      will be involved in  THE BRIDGE TO  ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES                      CAREERS, a new project which provides hands-onexperiences                       in the environmental science and technology related                             occupations.  Participants will be engaged in environmental                     problem solving, conservation  leadership and skill                             development training workshops, fieldtrips and internships.                          Approximately 117 11th - 12th grade students will be                       selected from high  schools in New York City and six New                        York State Counties, to participate in the ADVANCE SKILLS                       INTERNSHIPS component.
