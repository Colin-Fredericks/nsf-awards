 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Exploratorium in San Francisco will develop a new series of                 more than 30 permanent exhibit units on topics in sound, hearing,               and music.  Researchers, educators, musicians and artists will                  collaborate in the process, developing exhibits that provide                    direct involvement with science and technology using the                        interactive techniques for which the Exploratorium is                           internationally recognized.  A number of the units will                         be using new technologies in sound and acoustics and will reflect               recent research results in physiology resulting from their use.                                                                                                 The new exhibits, augmented by refurbished and modified existing                sound exhibits and accompanied by fresh graphics and explanatory                text, will constitute a new theme area on sound perception,                     hearing and music within the Exploratorium.  They will be used by               more than 500,000 annual visitors to the museum and by the                      thousands of teachers that benefit from teacher education                       activities.  In addition, exhibit units will be                                 replicated in other museums through exhibit \"cookbooks\",                        workshops and sale of exhibit copies; the project will generate                 more than $200,000 in support from private sources.",
