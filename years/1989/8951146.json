 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vassar College will purchase a computer-controlled cryogenically                cooled CCD imaging system which will be mounted on the existing Fecker          15-inch Cassegrain reflector.  With this configuration students will be         able to observe approximately 20th magnitude stars with a five minute           exposure.  To take advantage of faculty expertise, work will                    concentrate on the structure of galaxies.  Specific student projects            will examine local spiral structure in the Milky Way through star               counts in the direction of molecular clouds and accurate color-                 magnitude diagrams of galactic clusters.  The structure of other                galaxies will utilize near-infrared imaging to determine the                    distribution of late-type stars with respect to the prominent blue              structure.  In carrying out these projects, students will learn the             important modern techniques of data acquisition and reduction, acquire          a realistic understanding of astronomical measurements, and be better           prepared to enter graduate programs.  Those students who do not become          professional astronomers will benefit from their first-hand                     participation in a serious effort at scientific discovery.                                                                                                      The University will contribute an amount equal to the award.",
