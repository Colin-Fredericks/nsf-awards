 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal grant in the Organic Dynamics Program provides                     support for the research of Dr. Gene Wubbels of Grinnell                        College. The project will engage six undergraduates in organic                  synthesis, photochemistry, isolation and characterization of                    reaction products and measurement of reaction kinetics and will                 take place in a well-equipped, non-graduate department that has                 been a significant baccalaureate source of Ph.D.'s in                           chemistry. The theme of the research is  catalysis of                           homogeneous photochemical reactions and mechanisms of                           nucleophilic aromatic photosubstitution.                                                                                                                        The research will continue to explore the novel subject of                      catalysis in photochemistry by determining the nature of                        Bronsted Catalysis Law plots, obtaining definitive evidence for                 electron hole transfer catalysis involving hydroxide ion, and                   elucidating the structural requirements governing a case in                     which base catalysis competes with quenching. Intermediate                      structures involved in intramolecular photodisplacement of                      hydrogen on an aromatic ring will be elucidated and the                         \"element effect\" on nucleophilic aromatic photosubstitution                     will be measured for the first time.",
