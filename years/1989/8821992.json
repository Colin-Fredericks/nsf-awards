 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the interesting aspects of the organisms inhabiting                 our planet is their obvious non-random distribution.  Giraffes,                 for example, are found in Africa, and not South America.  This                  non-random distribution represents a by-product of biotic                       evolution coinciding with the earth's geological development.                   Dr. Jay Savage, at the University of Miami will study the causes                of present distributions of the Central and South American biota                in general, and of four groups of amphibians and reptiles in                    particular, using specialized biochemical and analytical                        techniques.  By determining the evolutionary relationship among                 closely related species that have restricted ranges, and then                   comparing the pattern of these relationships to hypothesized                    patterns determined by the geological history of the region in                  question, the relevant causes of their distributions can be                     determined.  Specifically, Dr. Savage will determine the                        historical relationship between Middle and South American.  As                  such, this study will lend important insights into the evolution                of this region, both biologically and geologically.",
