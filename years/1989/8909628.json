 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research has shown that the principal cause of errors on               some digital data networks is due to cycle slips that occur                     during clock recovery, instead of erroneous decisions made at the               detector.  Conventional codes are unable to tolerate cycle slips,               and can make the problem worse.  The objectives of this project                 are to develop new and efficient coding algorithms that can                     correct slips.  In addition, the coding algorithms studied will                 have a limited error correction capability, so that the                         occasional error can be corrected and so that the resulting                     algorithms are not sensitive to errors.                                           The research has two different directions.  Previous research                 in the area has led to the development of some fairly efficient                 codes that can tolerate cycle slips at the boundary between                     codewords, but nowhere else.  The research examines ways to                     extend or modify these codes so that they can correct cycle                     slips that occur anywhere in the codeword.  Another direction for               the research is the study of novel coding methods for correcting                cycle slips, including source coding and convolutional code                     structures.***//",
