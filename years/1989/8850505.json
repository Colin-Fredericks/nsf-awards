 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project will enable twenty professional                           development teams from around the country to improve the                        teaching of middle school mathematics in their home school                      districts.  During the first summer, the teams will participate                 in a three-week workshop in which they will familiarize                         themselves with outstanding instructional materials, study the                  history of mathematics, and develop plans for curriculum reform                 in their own schools.  Materials to be examined for possible                    inclusion in the curriculum include the Middle Grades                           Mathematics Project (Michigan State University), the                            Mathematics Resource Project (University of Oregon), the                        Quantitative Literacy Project (American Statistical Association                 and NCTM), the Harvard Middle School Mathematics Project,                       Estimation in a Modern Society (University of Missouri), Math                   and the Mind's Eye (Math Learning Center), and Getting Ready                    for Algebra (Ohio State University).                                                                                                                            Academic-year activities include visits to the participants'                    schools by the project staff and written reports from the                       development teams.  During the second summer, the teams will                    return for a two-week follow-up workshop to discuss their                       experiences in implementation and to share ideas.  A book                       documenting the results of the project will be produced.                                                                                                        The school districts will contribute an amount equal to 42% of                  the NSF award as cost-sharing.",
