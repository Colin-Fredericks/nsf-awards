 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the preceeding decade, the general area of chaotic                  behavior in complicated dynamical systems has received a great                  deal of attention in a variety of fundamental and applied                       scientific disciplines.  Closely related subjects are fractals,                 phase transitions, nucleation, and the renormalization group                    approach.  The recognition of the existence of deterministic                    chaos raises important questions about the role of causality,                   chance, and the prospects for deterministic prediction of                       physical processes, such as earthquakes, in the earth sciences.                 Only a small number of earth scientists are actively working in                 these areas.  This award contributes support to a small workshop                - format conference, which will be invaluable in stimulating                    interest and developing expertise in this area.  20 - 30 earth                  scientists will informally meet with 10 - 20 nonlinear                          dynamicists to explore how these newly developed ideas might best               be used in understanding the complexity seen in the dynamics of                 the earth's crust.",
