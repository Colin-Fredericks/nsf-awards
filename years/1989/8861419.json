 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of Very Large Scale Integrated Circuit technology                 demands innovative and fast submicron lithography which could                   replicate more densely packed integrated circuits at a high                     throughput.  The proposed Hypocycloidal Pinch (HCP) light source is             considered to be an intense x-ray source suitable for submicron and             high throughput lithography.  This device has a novel geometry which            utilizes the plasma dynamics hyocycloidally pinched into the radial             direction and eventually resulting a very stable, high energy, and              highly dense plasma in its axial center.  The emission spectra from             this highly compressed and stable plasma composes mainly of a waveband          of intense soft x-ray.  The size of pinched plasma is so small in               diameter that the penumbra effect can be also minimized in the                  photolithography.  This stable and highly compressed plasma guarantees          the reproducibility of the soft x-ray emission and its intense                  emission ensures the fast throughput.  The proposed HCP soft x-ray              light source is an inexpensive system, so that it is ideal for the              small business entities and university laboratories.",
