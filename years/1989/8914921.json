 "awd_abstract_narration": "The coastal bays plays a critical role in the transport                    and transformation of land runoff to the ocean.  Drs.                           Hollibaugh and Smith will consider the role of bays and                         estuaries in the net flux of Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorous                  between the land and ocean.  The system of interest (Tomales                    Bay, California) is hydrographically simple, has a long water                   residence time, is sufficiently compact that it can be studied                  as a single unit, and has low inorganic nutrient pollution.                     The system functions metabolically like numerous other coastal                  marine ecosystems.  External sources of organic matter which                    support food chains in this system are simple to characterize                   and have strong seasonal and interannual signals.                                    These investigators will address the following questions                   by means of a multi-investigator field and laboratory program:                  1) What is the relative importance of coastal upwelling versus                  terrigenous runoff in delivering oxidizable organic matter and                  nutrients to this system?  2) What are the responses of system                  metabolism and the metabolism of major system components to                     seasonal and interannual variations in these forcing functions?                 3) What is the relationship between net system metabolism and                   non-conservative fluxes of nitrogen?  4) Can rates derived from                 stoichiometric arguments be validated by \"direct\" biochemical                   assays?                                                                              It is anticipated that the outcome of this research                        can be extrapolated to other systems which may be applicable to                 management of the nations resources.  This effort is being                      funded as a Land Margins Ecosystem Research project which is                    jointly supported by the Directorates of Geosciences and Biotic                 Systems and Resources.",
