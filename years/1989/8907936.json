 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wixted's research project is designed to enhance our                        understanding of memory in animals and to advance the comparative               analysis of animal and human memory.  Specifically, this project                will investigate how well pigeons can remember a series of visual               images presented in rapid succession.  This procedure is                        analogous to one often used in human-memory studies in which                    people are asked to remember a list of words.  Of primary concern               is whether animals, like humans, remember items at the beginning                or end of a series better than they remember middle items.  In                  studies with human subjects, these \"primacy\" and \"recency\"                      effects are so commonly observed that they may be regarded as                   lawful properties of human short-term memory.  In studies with                  animals, however, some researchers have obtained a robust primacy               effect while others have reported its conspicuous absence.                                                                                                      One explanation of these inconsistent findings appeals to the                   concept of \"interference.\"  According to this view, animals                     become confused when given many lists to remember in a single                   session because some of the items appear over and over again on                 different lists.  Indeed, the only study to observe a primacy                   effect in birds arranged the experiment in such a way that items                were never repeated within a session.  An alternative explanation               for the inconsistent findings appeals to differences between                    studies in temporal variables, such as delay of reward.  Dr.                    Wixted will independently vary interference and delay of reward                 in an effort to clarify the conditions under which a primacy                    effect may be observed in animals.                                                                                                                              In addition to the immediate goal of helping to resolve                         apparently conflicting empirical findings, the results of Dr.                   Wixted's investigation may eventually facilitate the study of                   short-term memory disorders in humans by establishing the                       groundwork for relevant animal models.",
