 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Prof. Leslie R. Berger of the University of              Hawaii at Manoa to collaborate with Professor Yoshihiro Taniguchi of            Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan over a period of one year.               They will study the activity of malate dehydrogenases, MDH, to                  determine how barophilic, barotolerant and barophobic enzymes with              the same catalytic activity and structure are different.  MDH enzyme            samples will be prepared in the U.S. investigator's laboratory, and             subsequently studied in Kyoto.  Fluorometry will be used to determine           the total protein in each enzyme.  The immediate activity, and                  changes in activity of each enzyme system will then be measured as              functions of time, pressure, and rate of pressure change.  The                  effects of pressure on dissociation and reassociation will also be              studied.                                                                                                                                                        The U.S. investigator has long been involved in the characterization            of hydrostatic pressure as an environmental parameter in biological             systems.  The Japanese collaborators have similar long experience in            studying the effects of pressure on chemical systems.  The complemen-           tary interests and equipment of these workers will greatly increase             the productivity of this research.  These studies should have                   important implications in the understanding of the adaptation in                molecular structure which has taken place in deep-sea organisms.",
