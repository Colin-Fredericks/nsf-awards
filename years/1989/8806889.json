 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morphological differentiation in plant species is correlated               in general with reproductive isolation and genetic differences.                 Very different-looking species are usually also reproductively                  incompatible (hybrids cannot be made, or if obtained, are                       sterile).  Nevertheless, some plant species which are closely                   related in the genetic sense that they are completely                           interfertile may look very different morphologically.  This                     situation has compelled plant evolutionists to hypothesize that                 these exceptional plant species must have undergone rapid                       morphological evolution.  They have changed greatly in appearance               in a period of time that was too short to allow them to evolve                  mechanisms of reproductive isolation.  Cultivated maize is one                  such exceptional species, compared to its wild progenitors, the                 teosinte corns of Mexico.                                                            The genetic basis of such rapid morphological change may                   depend upon two contrasting modes:  changes at a very small                     number (one to four) of genes with major effects, or numerous                   changes of many genes, each with small effects.  Dr. John Doebley               is beginning to test these two hypotheses in his study of genetic               effects on morphological changes in the ear of corn, Zea  mays                  subspecies mays.  The ear of corn is remarkably different from                  that of its ancestor, Mexican teosinte, despite the fact that                   corn and teosinte are completely interfertile and are thought to                have diverged only 10,000 years ago under Indian domestication.                 Tests will be conducted on progeny between corn and teosinte                    races, analyzing associations between molecular markers on the                  chromosomes and genes controlling morphological features in corn                and teosinte ears.  By these means it should be possible to                     determine the minimum number of genes controlling key                           morphological differences between corn and teosinte, the                        chromosomal location of these genes, the mode of action (dominant               or recessive), and the percentage of phenotypic variation for                   which each gene accounts.  The data will allow discrimination                   between two competing theories on the morphological steps                       involved in the recent origin of the corn ear.",
