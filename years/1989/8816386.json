 "awd_abstract_narration": "A powerful approach to the investigation of terrigenous                    sedimentary rocks is through combined study of petrography,                     major and trace element geochemistry, mineral chemistry and Nd-                 isotopic study.  Such data provide critical evidence regarding                  the composition and mean age of he provenance.  Using this                      approach, important constraints are provided for models of                      crustal composition, growth and evolution.  Questions of tectonic               setting and recycling history of sedimentary rocks can also be                  addressed.                                                                           Isotopic evidence indicates that an important period of                    crustal growth occurred during the early Proterozic of North                    America at about 1.9-1.7 Ga.  Evidence from Australia and Europe                suggests this episode of crustal growth may have been of global                 significance.  It is here proposed to examine the petrographical,               geochemical and Nd-isotopic composition of two sedimentary                      sequences which were deposited at about this time, including the                Chelmsford Formation (ca. 1.85 Ga) of the Sudbury region, Ontario               and the Vadito - Ortega Groups (ca. 1.7 Ga) of northern New                     Mexico.  The Chelmsford Formation is a proximal turbidite unit                  deposited in response to early development of the Penokean                      Orogeny. The Vadito - Ortega Groups are representative of                       sedimentary rocks deposited during crustal growth in southwestern               U.S.A. at about 1.9 - 1.7 Ga.  From this study, it will be                      possible to place important constraints on the nature of crustal                growth and evolution during the early Proterozoic.  Comparisons                 with crust-forming events at other times in earth history                       (particularly at the Archean - Proterozoic boundary) will help to               test current models of crustal evolution.",
