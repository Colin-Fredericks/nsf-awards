This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long and                Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                     program is designed to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                  conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the conduct                of joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary                facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign                    countries.                                                                                                                                                      Awards are selected on the basis of scientific criteria relevant                to the applicant's field of science, the prospective potential of               the applicant for professional growth, as well as criteria                      relevant to the furthering of international cooperation in                      science and engineering.  The program is particularly directed to               scientists and engineers who are embarking on their research                    careers.                                                                                                                                                        The proposed research will trace the development of the Mouride                 Islamic brotherhood from its origins as an anti-colonial movement               in Senegal to its present position as an international                          organization with followers in cities in Europe, America, and                   Africa.  The project will be based in Paris, the European center                of the Mouride migration, and will examine the transformation of                a rural-based religious movement to an urban organization which                 provides an economic, social and spiritual framework for                        immigrants from many countries.                                                                                                                                 The project is under the direction of Dr. Victoria Ebin,                        Department of Medicine, New York University School of Medicine,                 New York, New York, 10012, in cooperation with Dr. Gerard                       Althabe, Director, Equipe de Recherche en Anthropologie Urbaine                 et Industrielle, Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales,                  44, rue de la Tour, 70015 Paris, France.                                                                                                                        The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,               international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents                  allowance, if applicable, language training, if required, and a                 flat administrative allowance of $250.00 for the U.S. home                      institution.",
