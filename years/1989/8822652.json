 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides infrastructure support for ten research projects,           with the primary research areas being parallel and distributed                  processing, and programming languages.  Other significant research              areas are fault-tolerant programming, algorithms and software for               molecular genetics, graphical user interfaces for scientific                    visualization, and object-oriented and deductive database systems.                                                                                              Specific research projects in the general area of parallel and                  distributed processing include:                                                      1. development of tools to aid in designing and developing                 algorithms for parallel and distributed systems, with emphasis on high-         level tools for relatively naive users,                                              2. research on language mechanisms and implementation techniques           to facilitate programming computations that execute efficiently on              shared-memory multiprocessors,                                                       3. development of techniques for compiling concurrent programs             written using shared variables into programs that execute on                    multicomputers or on multiprocessors with non-uniform memory access             time,                                                                                4. research on a configurable operating system kernel, called the          x-kernel, in which communication protocols define the fundamental               building block, and                                                                  5. development of analytic methods for evaluating performance of           parallel asynchronous algorithms and applying the methods to the                analysis of particular parallel algorithms running on various                   multiprocessor architectures.                                                                                                                                   The research on programming languages includes:                                      1. development of the Icon programming language, a high-level              language with facilities for processing nonnumeric data, and                         2. development of effective compilation techniques for logic               programming languages.                                                                                                                                          Equipment to be obtained for the research includes a Hypercube upgrade,         a shared memory multiprocessor, high-end graphic workstations, and              optical disks.",
