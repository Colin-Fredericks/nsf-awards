 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on problems in two areas of                       martingales and their applications.  First, the project will be                 study of laws of the iterated logarithm for harmonic functions                  and related questions.  Second, the research will involve                       analysis of the inequalities for martingale transforms and                      projections of martingale transforms with applications to Riesz                 transforms and determination of the best constant in an                         inequality for the Haar functions.                                                   This research is in the general area of statistics and                     probability and consists of applying probabilistic techniques to                problems in analysis.  The work involves finding optimal or near                optimal constants in a number of classical inequalities.  Ten                   years ago such problems would have appeared unsolvable.  Today                  the situation has changed completely and a number of important                  problems in several fields have been shown to reduce to the                     determination of certain constants in analytic inequalities.",
