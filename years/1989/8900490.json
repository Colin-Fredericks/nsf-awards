 "awd_abstract_narration": "An REU site project will be conducted under this award                     focusing on problems of mathematical modeling in the area of                    population biology.  Students will be introduced to techniques of               dynamical systems theory, scientific computing and statistical                  methods applied to problems of current interest in mathematical                 biology.                                                                             Specific activities include studies of the dynamics of                     simple interacting populations, including predator-prey systems                 and evolutionarily stable strategies. Several systems such as                   those studied in laboratory chemostats will be introduced.  Work                on the dynamics of single and interacting age-structured                        populations, including simple host-parasite systems, will also be               carried out.                                                                         Other students will be involved with epidemiological models                for animal and human disease transmission.  Based on basic                      assumptions about the transmission of infectious disease agents                 in a homogeneous population, SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed)                 models will be developed.  A picture of the global behavior of                  the resulting nonlinear ordinary differential equations systems                 will be built up using phase space analysis.                                         Work will also be done on resource management and optimal                  harvesting strategies.  The main object of this research area is                to develop continuous population models for a single species                    under different harvesting strategies.  At the beginning, a study               of the species in the absence of harvesting will be made to show                how one attempts to find a model that is biologically realistic                 and mathematically tractable.  Then various harvesting                          strategies will be introduced into the model and tested.                             The projects will be selected to involve the students in                   formulating an original mathematical model or modifying an                      existing one, doing qualitative analysis and statistical                        estimation of the parameters where possible, devising a numerical               scheme and performing the numerical simulations.  Understanding                 the numerical results in the framework of the model and modifying               the model where necessary will follow.",
