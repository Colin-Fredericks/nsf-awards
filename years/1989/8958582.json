 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is concerned problems associated with                     reasoning about change.  On the practical side, means of                        supporting changes in an Engineering Information System (EIS),                  that is a repository of information about an engineering artifact               such as a VLSI circuit or software system will be investigated.                 It is now widely recognized that information management is                      crucial to the success of large scale design efforts.  Near term                projects in this area include construction of a main memory based               data manager for high level synthesis of VLSI circuits;                         investigation of performance issues for updates in EIS,                         particularly as different aspects of the same design are updated                in parallel by different engineers, leading to problems of data                 consistency and task coordination that are critical in large                    engineering projects.  From a more theoretical perspective, there               is interest in formal means of reasoning about changes in logical               theories.  For example, when a new piece of information about the               world is discovered, how can one decide what old pieces of                      knowledge and data to keep, and what to discard in the light of                 the new information?  This work is relevent to problems in                      databases (updating databases with incomplete information),                     philosophy (belief revision, revision of scientific theories),                  and artificial intelligence (planning, diagnosis, reasoning                     about the effects of actions, etc.).  The studies of theory                     revision will emphasize problems from AI, such as reasoning about               the location of objects in a room, as applications for revison                  techniques.  Recent studies of the relationship of theory                       revision to circumscription and reasoning about action have                     proven particularly fruitful, and these will be pursued further.",
