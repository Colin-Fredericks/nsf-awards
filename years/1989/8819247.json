 "awd_abstract_narration": "In hydra, the somatic cells and gametes arise from a population                 of multipotent stem cells, interstitial cells (I-cells).                        Although this population was thought to be uniform, recent                      evidence suggests that there are subpopulations of I-cells with                 different developmental potentials.  One subpopulation has been                 isolated that is restricted to sperm differentiation. 97% of the                cells in this subpopulation label with a monoclonal antibody,                   AC2, which is specific for cells of the spermatogenic pathway.                  The 3% that do not bind the antibody are thought to be the                      precursors to the AC2-binding cells. The importance of this                     subpopulation in determining sex has been demonstrated during the               previous award. The focus of this study will be: 1) to determine                if AC2- sperm precursor cells are the only source of the AC2-                   binding cells. 2) to determine where in the egg lineage pathway                 suppression of egg production occurs in the presence of male-                   derived I-cells. This requires isolating markers specific for                   cells of the egg pathway. 3) to determine if the same I-cell that               produces eggs in a female can be induced to make sperm in a male.               Finally, 4) to begin looking for a molecular basis for the                      suppression of egg formation by male I-cells. This will involve                 producing cDNA libraries containing male or female specific                     sequences.                                                                      %%%                                                                             The main objective of this work is to elucidate the extent to                   which cell-cell  and cell-environment interactions control the                  determination of sex during development. Dr. Littlefield will use               the simple organism Hydra as a model system to address these                    questions.",
