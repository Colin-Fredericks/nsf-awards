 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nature of the interface between the fiber and matrix in fiber-              reinforced polymers greatly influences overall performance of the               composite material.  The details of the interactions at this interface          are not well understood, however.  It is firmly established that                modifying the interface can greatly improve performance, the                    underlying physicochemical mechanisms of adhesion and their                     relationship to performance have not been established.  The three main          mechanisms believed to underly the adhesive interaction are mechanical          interactions, intermolecular interactions, and chemical binding.                Preliminary work by the investigator has shown that a small number of           pendant chains covalently attached to a fiber surface significantly             increases adhesion between fiber and matrix.  An experimental program           has been designed to examine the exact cause of the increased adhesion          by systematically modifying the surface of Aramid Fibers with pendant           groups whose chemical structure provides varying potential for                  physicochemical interaction with the matrix.  A key phase of the                research is experimental determination of the exact state of the                surface and the pendant groups by means of quantitative dye analysis,           nonradiative fluorescence energy transfer, and continuous wetting               force measurements.  Results will be correlated with adhesion data to           delineate the relation between molecular level interfacial details and          interfacial adhesive bonding.                                                                                                                                   There is no more important area of research, relative to the future             international competitiveness of American industry, than the area of            advanced composite materials.  The properties of a fiber composite are          determined by the matrix, the fiber, and the interface at which they            interact.  Obtaining understanding and control of this interface is             crucial to our ability to engineer composite materials so as to                 realize their full potential.",
