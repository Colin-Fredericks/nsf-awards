For a three-year period beginning                   April 1989, eight (8) undergraduate students will spend ten (10)                weeks engaged in basic research in chemistry and, in one case, in               a joint chemistry-physics project under the direction of nine                   faculty members from the chemistry department and one from                      physics.  The program has two main objectives:  (a) to develop                  basic research skills, and (b) to strengthen interest in research               and graduate studies.  Each student will be supervised by a                     faculty mentor and will work on an appropriate research project in              that faculty member's laboratory, under the direct supervision of               graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  In order to encourage              student-student interactions, students will be housed together in               University dormitories and will be offered formal and informal                  group activities.  All students will take an \"Introduction to                   Research\" course, and will present the results of their research                at a meeting held at the end of each annual 10-week session.",
