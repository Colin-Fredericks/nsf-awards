 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long range goal of this laboratory is to be able to detail                    the events that occur during the initiation of transcription of                 protein coding genes class II genes through the                                 characterization of the proteins involved and their various                     protein:  DNA and protein:protein interactions with the intent                  of formulating and understanding some of the mechanisms that                    operate in the regulation of expression of class II genes.  The                 specific aims are to understand the mechanism(s) by which a                     transforming gene such as Ela can regulate the expression of                    other viral and cellular genes.  These include studies on the                   isolation of the factors required for transcription of genes                    whose expression is regulated by the products of the Ela gene.                  The factors will be purified from adenovirus infected and                       uninfected cells using functional transcription assay.  The                     interaction of the gene specific factor with Ela protein, other                 transcription factors and promoter sequences will be analyzed                   through the use of techniques.                                                                                                                                  Understanding the mechanisms by which transcription is                          regulated is extremely important.  A number of studies report                   obtaining putative transcription factors on the basis of DNA                    binding assays.  While this approach has yielded important                      information continued progress is going to depend on detailed                                                                                                   biochemical analysis of functional in vitro transcription                                                                                                       systems.  Because of the complexity of eucaryotic pol III                                                                                                       transcription and the myriad of protein factors involved in                                                                                                     modulation there must be a large number of purified or                                                                                                          partially purified components.
