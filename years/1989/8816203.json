 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports research that will characterize the                       structure and assembly of the mitochondrially localized feedback                sensitive enzymes of arginine biosynthesis in Neurospora crassa                 and investigate the regulatory implications of this localization.               The first seven biosynthetic enzymes, including the feedback-                   sensitive enzymes, acetylglutamate synthase and acetylglutamate                 kinase, are localized in the mitochondria.  The structure and                   membrane topology of acetylglutamate synthase will be determined                to test various hypotheses concerning the mechanism by which                    cytoplasmic arginine feedback inhibits this mitochondrial enzyme.               The structural and functional relationships between                             acetylglutamate synthase, acetylglutamate kinase and                            acetylglutamyl phosphate reductase will be investigated to                      evaluate various models for coordination of feedback inhibition,                enzyme synthesis and assembly.  The specificity, kinetics,                      energetics, and regulation of metabolite trafficking and the                    possible relationships between mitochondrial, plasma and vacuolar               membrane transport systems will be investigated.  The components                of the transport systems will be identified by conventional                     biochemical methods or by labelling with photolabile amino acid                 derivatives.  Attempts will be made to isolate and characterize                 mutations affecting their function.                                                                                                                             The results will be of significance in understanding metabolic                  regulation and the assembly of the mitochondria (and other                      organelles) in eukaryotic cells.  Organelles such asmitochondria,               lysosomes, and peroxisomes carry-out specialized functions.  In                 some cases, they also serve as localized sites of specific                      metabolic processes which do not have any obvious relationship to               the specialized functions of the organelle.  Thus, a variety of                 amino acid biosynthetic reactions take place in the mitochondria                of certain fungi and some reactions of the urea cycle occur in                  this same organelle in mammals.  Although some general hypotheses               have been advanced to explain this compartmentation phenomenon                  (e.g. conservation of solvent capacity; isolation of potentially                reactive intermediates; or separation of potentially competing                  reactions), its exact physiolocial significance is not fully                    understood.",
