 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although it is widely accepted that plant characters such as               secondary chemistry, trichomes, and tough leaves have evolved                   primarily as defenses against herbivores, particularly insects,                 little direct evidence exists indicating that herbivorous insects               impose natural selection on such resistance traits.  the goal of                the research proposed here is to determine whether insects exert                natural selection on genetic variation for resistance in the                    morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea.  The basic technique will be to                examine how the experimental removal of four types of insects                   (the corn earworm, flea beetles, tortoise beetles, and generalist               folivores) affects the magnitude of selection these insects                     impose on resistance to herbivory.  In addition, whether                        resistance is due at least in part to tolerance or compensation                 (the ability of a plant to maintain a constant seed production                  despite herbivory) will be determined.  Finally, the                            physiological and morphological characters that are responsible                 for resistance in insects in I. purpurea will be identified.                    Once these characters are known, whether and how insects exert                  selection on such characters will be examined.",
