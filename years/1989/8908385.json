 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the design of a controller for active                   suppression of vibration produced by unknown disturbing forces                  which cannot be measured directly.  The design procedure                        comprises two stages including the design of an observer to                     reconstruct the system state and the disturbance based on the                   system outputs, and the design of a controller which cancels or                 minimizes the effect of the disturbance.  The proposed approach                 for the design of the observer does not assume any a priori                     information about the disturbance such as statistical data or                   waveforms of the disturbance.  The idea here is to design an                    observer which includes an additional term to account for the                   disturbance.  The controller itself will be designed to cancel                  external force entirely, provided the disturbing force can be                   reconstructed by the observer.  This research is intended for                   application to vehicle active suspension systems, and for active                vibration absorbers for manufacturing machines such as forging                  hammers, press machines, etc.",
