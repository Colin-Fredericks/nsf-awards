 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growing attention focused on accelerating processes of global          environmental change have highlighted the need for increased                    understandings of the role of humans as initiators of and respondents           to rapid changes in natural environmental conditions.  Many independent         research projects have begun or are being planned by social and                 behavioral scientists, but these inquiries have heightened the need for         coordination of multi-disciplinary analyses of the human dimensions of          global environmental change.  This project will foster and integrate            research on six important aspects of this topic:  (1) development of a          theory and methodology for studying worldwide changes in land-use               patterns, (2) development of an epidemiology linking human health with          global environmental change, (3) examination of how institutions                manage global change, (4) analyses of how national and international            security concerns are related to global change, (5) empirical                   definition and measurement of \"sustainable development,\" and (6) study          of how science and society identify and respond to environmental                problems, expand knowledge about the processes producing these                  problems, and make that knowledge more useful.  The award recipient,            the Social Science Research Council, will form a new committee on               Research on Global Environmental Change to oversee this effort.  That           committee will commission and respond to review articles from experts           on these six issues.  Committee members will prepare synthetic articles         for inclusion in a volume to present the group's findings, and the              committee will sponsor working groups to develop research projects              related to each of the issues.                                                       This project will provide a number of tangible benefits.  The              volume containing review and integrative articles on the six issues             should furnish scholars with excellent summaries of present knowledge           about these critical topics and outline general approaches that are             likely to yield substantial contributions to knowledge.  By                     coordinating the development of research projects, the committee will           reduce duplication of effort and enable more effective generalization           from independent research efforts.  Furthermore, the committee's and            working groups' efforts should directly involve a much larger number of         the nation's leading social and behavioral scientists in analyses of            this critical issue than otherwise would become involved.",
