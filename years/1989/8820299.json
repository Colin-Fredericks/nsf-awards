 "awd_abstract_narration": "The understanding of processes involved in species, sex,                        individual and kin recognition are of fundamental importance to                 virtually all multicellular animals.  Among many mammals,                       chemosensory signals provide one of the most important channels                 of communication for such recognition.  Dr. Johnston will examine               the ways in which animals recognize others of their species by                  chemical cues and investigate the neural mechanisms underlying                  such recognition.  His research involves the development of                     innovative habituation paradigms to measure individual                          discrimination and individual recognition.  He will utilize the                 behavioral information to determine the roles that the two main                 olfactory pathways, the main olfactory system and the vomeronasal               system, play in mediating the recognition processes.  Not only                  will this multidisciplinary approach provide information towards                our understanding of animal communication systems but will                      contribute to our understanding of (1) recognition mechanisms in                general, (2) the functions of the sense of olfaction, (3) the                   organization and functions of the neural pathways of the                        olfactory system, and (4) the processing of olfactory information               in different brain regions.  The understanding and treatment of                 clinical disorders associated with taste and olfactory                          dysfunctions in humans can only benefit from advances in basic                  knowledge of animal olfaction and chemical communication                        research.",
