 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work of the previous three years involving dynamic-pressure-                dependent studies of collective modes in 3He, novel schemes to                  excite collective modes, sound propagation in UPt3, the                         development of a polarized 3He cell, sound propagation in oxide                 superconductors, the installation of a new-Oxford cryostat, and                 the superconducting properties of thin-film superlattices is                    summarized.  Of particular importance was the characterization of               an acoustic anomoly in the field dependence of the ultrasonic                   signal attenuation in UPt3 which may signal a new kind of phase                 transition.  They propose continuing studies of the collective                  mode spectrum of 3He involving very short path lengths, novel                   excitation schemes, nonlinear effects, and the polarized liquid.                The importance of microwave absorption studies in the dilution                  refrigerator region is noted and studies of UPt3 directed at the                observation of collective modes are proposed.  A top loading                    magnetometer alteration of our Oxford cryostat is proposed, again               with the major emphasis on UPt3.",
