 "awd_abstract_narration": "The flat-plate floor system is generally recognized as an                       unsuitable structural system for resisting high-intensity lateral               loads.  Nevertheless, in regions of high seismicity in the U.S.                 this structural system is still one of the most widely used                     systems in multistory buildings braced by stiffer ductile frames                of structural walls.  Recent research has shown that even in                    these braced structures the conventionally-reinforced flat plate                is susceptible to failures if gravity shear stresses on the floo                and lateral drifts are not controlled to acceptable values.                     Performance of the unbonded post-tensioned flat-plate floor in                  a similar situation is not well known.  This research studies                   the behavior of this structural system.                                                                                                                         The research involves design, construction, experimental                        testing, retrofitting, and analysis of unbonded post-tensioned                  flat-plate construction subjected to gravity and reversed cyclic                lateral loads simulating earthquake effects.  Both isolated                     connections and a three by three bay model floor are studied.                   Effects of gravity load intensity, lateral load intensity, and                  retrofitting techniques are the primary variables in the study.                 The experiments determine the suitability of this structural                    system to support gravity floor loads when subjected to cyclic                  lateral drifts typical of those occurring in buildings during                   intense ground shaking.  One of the primary objectives is to                    establish guidelines for design of this structural system.",
