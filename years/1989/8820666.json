 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Studies in Science, Technology and Society program supports                 research that examines the structures and processes that                        influence the direction and use of science and technology in                    their social, political, and economic contexts.  Ethics and                     Values Studies supports research that examines the social,                      professional and individual values and mutual obligations and                   responsibilities that arise in interactions of science,                         technology and society.  This project addresses a very important                issue for EVS ..whether and how assumptions in scientific                       disciplines contain unexamined ethical and value implications.                  For instance, notions such as \"objectivity\" and \"subjectivity\"                  may be used in scientifically unjustified ways, as a rhetorical                 and political strategy to advance a questionable assumption,                    method, or conclusion.  This project uses new developments in                   feminist theory and thought as a means to examine these issues                  for sciences that study organizations and organizational                        behavior.  Thirty six people including feminist scholars,                       organizational scientists, other social scientists and                          philosophers will gather for a three day conference, October 19.                21, 1989 at Alta Lodge in Utah. Prior to the conference,                        background papers will be distributed so that participants can                  come prepared to discuss gender assumptions in organizational                   science and their ethical and value implications for its                        direction and use.  Products from the conference are expected to                include published papers, a book and follow.up activities in                    professional societies and at their meetings.                                                                                                                   This project will contribute to advancing professional discussion               of normative implications of unexamined research assumptions in                 organizational science.  Since organizational science wishes to                 understand organizations better, and thereby to provide advice                  that can improve them, this conference can make an important                    contribution to these ends.  The co.investigators are very                      well qualified; they have assembled a very impressive list of                   participants; results from the project are likely to be                         stimulating and useful.  Institutional support is very, very                    good; the project budget is most reasonable.  Therefore, support                in the amount of $18,760 is recommended.",
