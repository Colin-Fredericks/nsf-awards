 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Michael Donoghue of the University of Arizona, working                 initially with colleague Dr. Kenneth Sytsma at University of                    Wisconsin, plans to study evolutionary relationships within the                 flowering plant genus Viburnum and relationships to other groups,               emphasizing characters obtained from chloroplast DNA.  The                      chloroplast genome will be digested with a battery of restriction               enzymes, each of which cleaves the molecule at specific sites,                  and the exact position of these sites on the molecule will be                   determined.  Comparison of nucleotide site similarities and                     differences among the species will allow determination of the                   evolutionary pattern of mutations separating taxa.  In assessing                more distant relationships, between genera and families, complete               nucleotide sequences of chloroplast genes will be obtained and                  compared, using computer-aided methods.                                              Phylogenies derived from molecular data will be compared to                trees obtained previously based on morphological characteristics,               and the nature and extent of congruence will be evaluated.                      Molecular data are likely to resolve relationships that remain                  equivocal based on morphology alone.  Further, resolved                         phylogenetic trees will provide a framework for study of the                    evolution of particular morphological traits of interest.  This                 will be especially vaulable in the case of fruit characters,                    because these have recently been studied in detail by Dr.                       Donoghue and developmental data are available for these.  The use               of phylogenetic information to analyze developmental changes will               contribute to emerging analyses of the evolution of form and                    function in organisms.",
