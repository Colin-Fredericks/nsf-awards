 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Boyer will investigate the representation theory                 of classical groups associated to operator algebras. The emphasis               will be on inductive limits of compact groups, which are the next               order of complexity after finite dimensional groups. The analysis               to be undertaken will use the framework of approximately finite-                dimensional C*-algebras (especially the K-functor and its order                 structure), dynamical systems and their ergodic measures, and the               combinatorics of the approximating groups. One specific objective               is to classify the representations of the inductive limit unitary               group which generalize the well-known quasi-free representations                of the canonical (anti-) commutation relations.                                      This project is part of an effort now underway in many                     quarters to extend concepts and results long familiar in the                    study of Lie groups (named after the eminent Norwegian                          mathematician Sophus Lie) to objects of a much more exotic sort.                An example of a Lie group in the usual sense is the group of all                rotations of a sphere, where the group operation consists of                    following one motion by another. Detailed knowledge of the                      rotation group is extremely helpful in the analysis of any                      mathematical or physical situation where spherical symmetry is                  present. It is an important feature of this group that we need                  only a finite number of parameters (in this case three) to                      specify any of its members. Likewise, we can consider the                       rotation group in higher dimensions. No truly new phenomena occur               as long as the dimension remains finite, but if we let it                       increase without bound and so to speak take the limit, we obtain                a kind of infinite-dimensional Lie group. Many of the same                      questions make sense for this inductive limit rotation group as                 for the ordinary three-dimensional one. Professor Boyer will work               on the new methods that are needed to answer them in this more                  difficult setting.",
