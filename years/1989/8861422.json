 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research addresses the development of a computer-based                 model to perform concurrent life-cycle analysis for the design of               advanced launch system concepts.  The motivation for this effort                stems from the high cost of manufacturing, operating, and supporting            current Earth-to-orbit vehicle designs.  Presently, design,                     manufacturing, operations, and support domains are addressed                    serially with little integration; thus, results from one area tend              to drive up costs in other areas.  The lack of a defined set of                 procedures and functional relationships makes it difficult to trace             high cost drivers.  The proposed research will develop a methodology            and subsequent computer model to concurrently address each of the               four domains to reduce the life-cycle cost of the overall system.               This work will consist of concurrent life-cycle analysis methodology            development, computer model architecture definition, and                        proof-of-concept model demonstration.",
