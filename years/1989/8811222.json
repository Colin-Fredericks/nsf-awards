 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nature of polymer motion at elevated concentration is a                     matter of current scientific interest.  The diffusion of charged                (\"polyelectrolyte\") polymers through solutions of other polymers                occurs in several contexts, including intra-and intercellular                   protein transport and in methods for isolation of recombinant                   DNAs.  The investigators will undertake a systematic experimental               study of polyelectrolyte-polymer interdiffusion under different                 conditions.                                                                     Light-scattering spectroscopy will be used to study diffusion of                polystyrene sulfonate, both in simple solution and in the                       presence of a second (\"matrix\") polymer.  The matrix polymer and                solvent will scatter no light because they will be isorefractive.               Experimental variables to be varied systematically include the                  concentrations and molecular weights of the two polymers, and                   solution's ionic strength.  By measuring polarized as well as                   depolarized spectra, the probe's self-diffusion coefficient as                  well as its rotational diffusion coefficient will be obtained.                  These will be compared with predictions of the available models                 of polymer dynamics, thereby testing these models and clarifying                understanding of how polymers move in solution.",
