 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PUPS Tutoring Architecure enables exploration of new issues                 involving the tutoring of introductory programming courses.  Its unique         features are that it allows one to tutor any programming language and           its performance is not significantly affected by the complexity of the          program that is being tutored.  The proposal is concerned with three            different applications of the PUPS Tutoring Architecture.  The first            concerns increasing the low level of transfer from a first programming          course to other programming languages.  The effectiveness of                    simultaneous instruction in multiple languages and the use of data-flow         representations to plan algorithms will be explored.  Research under            this topic will explore issues of how to get students to represent              knowledge in a transferrable way.  Thus, this research has implications         well beyond transfer across programming languages.  The second topic            concerns use of the architecture to tutor larger programs.  Here the            concern is both with transfer between a subject domain like mathematics         and programming and with issues intrinsic to larger programs such as            data structures and algorithm efficiency.  The goal here is to begin to         understand the relationship between an introductory course and other            intellectual activities it is supposed to facilitate.  The third                application concerns developing training material and utilities to              facilitate use of the tutoring architecture by non-Al specialists.  A           tutor will be developed for use of the production system core of the            tutor and a set of authoring aides.  This system will be tested with            local teachers of introductory programming courses.//",
