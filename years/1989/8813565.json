 "awd_abstract_narration": "In support of the GOFS Northeast Atlantic Spring Bloom Experiment               measurements will be made of primary productivity rates, and                    POC/PON and DOC/DON concentrations on the April and July transect               cruises.  Also logistical support will be provided for                          free-floating particle trap arrays that will be deployed and                    recovered three times at Sta. 47 (continuous coverage will be                   provided for approximately 100 days, April 10-July 25).                                                                                                         Much of this effort concentrates on dissolved organic carbon                    (DOC).  Background information is presented indicating that the                 oceanic DOC pool (1,000 Gt) is about the same size as the                       atmospheric CO2 (-700 Gt), terrestrial living plant (560 Gt)                    and soil humus (1500 Gt) reservoirs.  Considering the size of                   this pool, little is known.  For example, this reservoir                        appears to be large enough to easily accommodate the -170 Gt of                 C withdrawn from the atmosphere during recent glacial maxima;                   perhaps it also represents a repository where anthropogenic CO2                 is currently sequestered.  Nevertheless, in spite of the                        potential importance of DOC in the global carbon cycle, only two                foreign scientists appear to have the current capability for                    accurate measurement.                                                                                                                                           Thus the overall objectives are to :  (1) refine  DOC analytical                procedures; (2) measure seasonal DOC inventories along the 200                  West transect; (3) relate these levels to C02, 02 changes; (4)                  measure rates of DOC formation in association with phytoplankton                growth and senescence; and (5) relate these findings to                         complementary studies involving aspects of the oceanic POC cycle.",
