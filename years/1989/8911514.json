 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central issue of brain development is how the intricate                       patterns of nerve connections are formed by incoming sensory                    nerve cell processes, called afferent axons, on central target                  nerve cells.  In rodents, the afferents for touch from the                      facial whiskers form a pattern of discrete units at every level                 in their pathway from the face to the sensory cortex of the                     forebrain.  In the cortex, the central terminal patterns of                     these aligned axons form structures called barrels, from their                  shape.  This project will analyze how the cells called glial,                   which surround nerve cells in the brain, may assist in forming                  the pattern of the axons into these barrels.  Anatomical and                    biochemical techniques, including antibody binding, will be used                to assess the developing patterns under a variety of conditions.                Experiments will compare glial antigens with cell-adhesion                      molecules, will correlate distribution of afferents between                     normal and abnormal development using mutant mouse strains, and                 use lesion studies to establish how boundaries change and/or                    reform during subsequent regeneration.  This work pursues a novel               and potentially important issue for developmental neuroscience,                 and results will have an impact on developmental biology as well.",
