 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant application seeks funds to carry out the second phase                of a joint project between Portland State University and the                    University of Oregon on the development of a photoelectron                      microscope (PEM) of advanced design and higher resolution                       (theoretically 1 nm to 2 nm, as compared with the present 10 nm).               The project will achieve this resolution by incorporating an                    electron mirror to correct for chromatic and spherical                          aberrations.  The first phase of this project was funded by a                   private foundation in the Northwest (the M. J. Murdock Chawitable               Trust).  The first phase covered the design and construction of                 an electron mirror and the electron lenses and other components                 used in studying the mirror, and theoretical and experimental                   investigations of the mirror properties.  The second phase,                     planned for three years, focuses on further research on                         aberration correction, on mirror design, deflector design, and on               instrument design and construction.  Specific goals include a                   detailed study of the aberration correcting properties of the                   mirror in combination with the electron optical components of the               photoelectron microscope in a vacuum optical bench, and the                     design and construction of an experimental test column in which                 the resolution of the corrected electron optical system can be                  evaluated.  The successful demonstration of a corrected system                  would represent an advanced in the field of electron optics.  The               correction method would also be applicable to a range of other                  instruments which require aberration correction and improved                    resolution (e.g., electron or ion probes and advanced                           photoelectron microscope, when completed, will be valuable in                   studies of organic and biological specimens, semiconductors, and                other surface studies where high resolution and low specimen                    damage are important.",
