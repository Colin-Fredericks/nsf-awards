Problem 2:  Prove (or disprove) that the Diophantine theory of                  the field of rational functions, in a letter t with                             coefficients in the field of complex numbers, is undecidable in                 the language of rings with constant symbols 0, 1 and t.                         Problem 3:  Consider a machine M which can add or multiply                      integers.  Let f(x) be a polynomial with integer coefficients,                  X=(X1,...,Xk).  Let n(f) be the least number of multiplications                 required for the evaluation of f at an arbitrary integer input                  X by M.  Prove (or disprove) that the function which associates                 n(f) to an arbitrary polynomial f is recursive; in other words                  determine whether one can effectively find the necessary number                 of multiplications for the evaluation of a given polynomial.                         These problems, particularly the last, are of interest to                  computer scientists as well as mathematical logicians.  In some                 sense the existence of this project is a demonstration that                     recursion theory has returned to its roots and is capable of                    addressing practical problems.",
