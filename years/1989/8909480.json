 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an international workshop on desertification                to be held in La Serena, Chile at the University of La Serena in                October, 1989.  The U.S. organizer is Walter Whitford of New                    Mexico State University and the Chilean organizer is Julio R.                   Gutierrez of the University of La Serena.  The participants                     include eight U.S. scientists who represent the areas of plant and              animal ecology, microbial and physiological ecology, soil science,              system modeling and nutrition.  In addition, six Chilean and two                Brazilians will attend.  Their fields are similar except for some               representation of remote sensing, biometeorology, climatology and               geomorphology.                                                                                                                                                  The workshop will consist of prepared papers and oral presentations             resulting in published papers in spanish and english.  All                      workshop participants will benefit by broadening their knowledge                and perceptions of ecosystem ecology and arid ecosystems in                     particular.  The Chilean scientists have generally had experience               in U.S. deserts; this workshop will afford the U.S. scientists the              opportunity to become familiar with southern desert systems.                    Also, the Chileans will be introduced to new conceptual frameworks              and simulation models.  In this way and through the initiation of               graduate student training, this workshop is a good example of the               fulfillment of the goals of the Science in Developing Countries                 program.",
