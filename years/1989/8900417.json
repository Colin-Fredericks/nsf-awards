Proposed is                      research on pitting corrosion in copper tubing related to the                   presence of biofilms of mixed bacteria on the surface.  Biofilms                of mixed bacterial populations excrete a variety of substances at               the metal surface which contribute to the formation of                          irregularly spaced pits that penetrate the walls of the tubing.                 In this research attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform                 infrared spectrometry (ATR/FT-IR) is used to identify specific                  biofilm bacteria species and their adhesive exopolymers which                   promote deterioration of the underlying copper and copper/nickel                surfaces.  A reflectance-absorbance cell will be designed for the               FTIR in order to identify chemical species that accumulate at the               metal surface beneath the biofilm.  A spectrochemical approach is               used to determine how the rate of biofilm development and                       microbial-influenced corrosion vary as a function of the applied                potential.  The identity of inorganic reaction products                         accumulating in the pits and around specific bacterial colonies                 will be confirmed by Auger and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.                Reactions involving the microbial metabolites and inorganic                     corrosion products accumulating at the metal surface will be                    identified from the experimental results.  A better understanding               of these reactions should result in improved measures to combat                 this form of corrosion.",
