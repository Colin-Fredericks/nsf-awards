 "awd_abstract_narration": "Past research in atmospheric chemistry has been largely                    concerned with \"homogeneous\" chemical processes occurring among                 gaseous substances occurring in trace amounts.  Much less                       attention has been given to \"heterogeneous\" processes, defined                  as those physical and chemical processes occurring at, or                       across, boundaries between the solid, liquid, or gaseous media.                 There is a growing awareness among atmospheric scientists,                      however, that the heterogeneous processes play important roles                  in chemical transformations occurring in both natural and                       polluted atmospheres.  A recent example is the crucial role of                  heterogeneous chemistry on the ice particles of polar                           stratospheric clouds in the depletion of springtime Antarctic                   ozone.                                                                               This project will measure mass accommodation of gaseous                    species, such as dimethysulfide and organoperoxy radicals, on                   surfaces, including carbonaceous soot material, sulfuric acid,                  and sea salt.  Gaseous and surface reaction products will be                    determined by mass spectrometry and thermal desorption.  These                  experiments are designed to yield data required for developing                  mathematical models of chemical transformations in the                          troposphere, especially in regions of high aerosol loadings.",
