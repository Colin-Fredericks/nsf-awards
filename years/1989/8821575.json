 "awd_abstract_narration": "All the lines of contemporary research on American attitudes toward the         issue of race converge in raising fundamental questions about the               commitment of white Americans to the value of racial equality.  In              particular, skepticism about white racial attitudes raises two                  questions.  First, how pliable is the commitment of Americans to the            value of racial equality?  Do Americans who support the value of                racial equality at the level of principle stand behind it in practice?          The second, concerns the issue of discrimination.  To what extent do            Americans remain likely not only to hold negative attitudes toward              blacks, but also to treat them differently and worse than whites?                                                                                               These two questions were out of reach until just recently, since there          was no way to study either directly in a conventional public opinion            survey.  A principle contribution of this research investigation is to          develop and apply specific new methods for the direct assessment of             racial discrimination and policy commitment.                                                                                                                    To assess discrimination the researchers ask all respondents about              whether people are entitled to various forms of government assistance,          with one half the time the person in need of assistance being black,            the other half not black.  The objective is to determine if there is            more support for helping people who are not black than for helping              people who are.  It may be considered proof of discrimination if there          is, since the question versions are identical except for one                    identifying the person in need of assistance as black and the other             identifying him or her as not black, and since respondents, by virtue           of being randomly assigned to question versions, are themsleves                 identical in all relevant respects, chance variations aside.  To assess         commitment to the value of racial equality, respondents are first asked         their opinion about a racial policy proposal and once they have taken a         position, they are presented with a counter argument.  The test of              commitment is the willingness to maintain a position even after hearing         an argument for the other side.                                                                                                                                 In addition to measuring discrimination and policy commitment, the              investigators also measure an array of attitudinal and demographic              variables, using standard measures to enhance the comparability of the          data set.  The aim is to be able to determine not only if there is              racial discrimination, but what social conditions and social ideas are          most effective in preventing it.",
