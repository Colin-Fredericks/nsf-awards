 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the basic sedimentology and taphonomy of limestone                    buildups known in the Fort Payne Formation, a detailed systematic               study of the crinoid fauna (Phylum Echinodermata) will be made.                 The Fort Payne Formation is Lower Mississippian (late Osagean;                  approximately 350 million years old), and this study will be                    conducted in rocks from south-central Kentucky.  Where these                    rocks are in the subsurface, they are oil and gas producers.                    Because crinoidal remains are the dominant component in the                     limestone buildups, it is vital to document fully their diversity               and to understand their paleoecologic distribution.  This will                  result in a better understanding of the origin and distribution                 of these limestones.                                                                 Specific objectives of the proposed research include 1,                    species-level systematics of the Fort Payne crinoid fauna,                      including documentation of within-species variations from the                   large collections available; 2, determination of the crinoid                    species composition of Fort Payne paleocommunities; 3, evaluation               of the faunal role in the differential development of limestone                 buildups; 4, integration of these data with crinoid species                     distributions throughout the midcontinental U.S. in order to                    understand better the regional distributional controls on late                  Osagean crinoids.  This research will result in the most                        thoroughly documented paleontologic study of the enigmatic Lower                Mississippian Walsortian facies.  Further the resulting knowledge               of late Osagean crinoids will be one of the most comprehensive                  data sets available for Paleozoic macroinvertebrates.  The                      resulting regional synthesis of systematics, facies distribution,               paleogeography and community paleoecology will be a rich source                 for future research to which fundamental evolutionary and                       paleoecologic questions can be addressed.",
