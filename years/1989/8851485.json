 "awd_abstract_narration": "Equipment and instrumentation necessary to implement experiments                in fermentation, centrifugation, distillation, and control into a               senior-level chemical engineering laboratory are provided.  The                 equipment will mimic the major unit operations in the regionally                important industry of fermentation of agricultural products to                  produce ethanol as a gasoline additive.  The four major pieces of               equipment are:  a bench scale stirred-tank bioreactor                           (fermenter), a bench scale continuous centrifuge, an eight-tray                 bubble-cap distillation column, and the data acquisition                        instrumentation and microcomputers used to monitor and control                  the distillation column. Currently, there is significant                        industrial interest in the application of chemical engineering                  principles to biotechnological processes.  Also, with the advent                of the microcomputer, new supervisory control algorithms and                    data acquisition systems are being developed and used by                        industry.  The equipment will allow the students to gain                        important hands-on experience in both of these significant areas                of chemical engineering.",
