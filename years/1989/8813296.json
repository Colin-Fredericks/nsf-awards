The research will be                 done using a two-layer baroclinic model on the beta-plane and a                 spherical coordinate barotropic model.  The two-layer model                     will allow the PIs to examine baroclinic, barotropic and                        topographic processes and to assess their combined role in                      determining the regional character and time variability of the                  zonal flow and wave disturbances.  The research with the                        barotropic model will assess the impact of using spherical                      geometry in simulating these types of flows.  In cases of weak                  nonlinearity, model solutions will be obtained analytically                     using asymptotic expansions and multiple space and time scales.                                                                                                 Outside this limit, spectral transform methods will be used to                  obtain solutions numerically.  These investigations may provide                 further insight into such observed atmospheric features as                      regional cyclogenesis, blocking, and low frequency variability.                      This project is being carried out in collaboration with                    Dr. Arthur Loesch, SUNY-Albany, under NSF grant ATM-8813621.",
