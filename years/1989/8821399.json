 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the estimation of a labor demand model which              includes both fixed and quadratic variable adjustment costs.  The model         will be estimated with existing, monthly data for seven durable goods           plants and existing data for airline firms and with new, monthly data           for fast-food outlets.  The goals are to examine whether the fixed              adjustment costs that appear to characterize the durable-goods plants           describe adjustment elsewhere and to infer whether they reflect costs           stemming from:  1) Disruption of arrangements among workers;  2)                Complementarity of groups of workers with lumpy capital;  and 3)                Implicit labor contracts that specify maximum employment with layoffs           when demand is low.  In addition, a simulation general equilibrium              model will be constructed to examine the dynamic effects of taxes and           subsidies, noting the incidence of small changes in payroll tax rates,          given discrete demand dynamics.  The relative impacts of marginal and           standard employment subsidies will also be examined when labor demand           adjusts discretely.                                                             &&The purpose of this research is to examine the how employment is              affected by changes in wages and product demand.  While there has been          a large amount of research on this general issue, no one has examined           this using data at the level of the individual plant.  As result it has         not been possible, up to this point, to infer the true structure of the         costs that determine how employment reacts to changes in output and             wages.  This is regrettable because knowing the nature of these costs           would allow us to infer the probable impacts of policies that could             affect adjustment costs such as advanced notice of layoffs and plant            closings, mandatory listing of job vacancies, and others.  This                 research is important because it should increase our ability to better          infer the potential consequences of such policies.",
