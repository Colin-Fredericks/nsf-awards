 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the next three years, this group of scientists will work directly           with 80 teachers to develop, test, and prepare for dissmination a               teacher enhancement plan for inservice development to improve science           education in the elementary school.  They expect the ideas and materials        produced to have an impact on the way science and technology are                presented in college courses for future teachers as well as on in               service staff development.  The theoretical position and practical              experience of the staff, under the direction of Dr. Seymour Papert              indicates that the problem of preparing elementary teachers for science         education cannot be reduced to training teachers in facts and skills,           nor even to helping them to devlop the cognitive underpinnings of               scientific knowledge.  More subjective and experiential aspects of the          learner's relationship to science requires much specific attention.  The        project has been attentive to affective and social issues as well as the        cognitive aspects of learning science.  The central objective is helping        teachers appropriate science--which means making it one's own, in one's         own way...integrating into one's own personal thinking.  Most important,        the success of the teachers in learning science will encourge a                 conviction that children can, and should, experience science in a               similarly personal experiential way.                                                                                                                            In year one, teachers will attend a three-week, intensive, hands-on             summer workshop using information technologies to enhance their                 understanding of science, to develope strategies for the integration of         new science content and technology into their own teaching.  This group         of forty teachers will come from ten schools in the Boston area.  Mentor        teachers will work with these teachers during the school year, at the           conclusion of which they will attend a one-week workshop-seminar to             consolidate what they have learned.  During year two, a similar                 experience will be available to teachers in the Hartford, CT area.              Teachers will then be encouraged and supported to work with their peers         in their own schools.  This design is modeled after a successful                experience in working with Costa Rican teachers who had virtually no            experience with computers.                                                                                                                                      An amount equivalent to 52% of the NSF request is being cost-shared by          MIT and the participating schools.",
