 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liver disease is a major cause of morbidity                                     and mortality.  Renal dialysis, which                                           revolutionized the treatment of renal                                           failure, does not have a successful hepatic                                     counterpart.  The goal of this proposed                                         research is to develop the technology for an                                    effective hepatodialylsis system using                                          cultured hepatocytes to function as a                                           \"bioartificial liver\".  The P.I.'s are                                          developing a new hollow fiber bioreactor in                                     which hepatocytes are entrapped in a matrix                                     gel within the lumen of the hollow fibers.                                      Simultaneous and continuous provision of                                        nutrients to the hepatocytes also occurs                                        within the hollow fiber lumens while blood                                      continuously bathes the outer surface of the                                    fibers.  This design allows dialysis of water                                   soluble toxins -- including drugs -- and                                        facilitates the metabolism of others by the                                     hepatocytes with conversion to metabolic                                        forms that are then removed with the luminal                                    nutrient flow.  The proposed research will                                      develop the engineering knowledge necessary                                     for the design of a clinically applicable                                       \"bioartificial\" liver.  The research plan                                       consists of three phases: 1) Defining                                           environmental and engineering conditions                                        which maintain optimal bioreactor function;                                     2) Adapting the system to large scale using                                     syngeneic hepatocytes; 3) Large animal trials                                   of the developed technology using allogeneic                                    hepatocytes.  The research team includes                                        individuals with engineering expertise in                                       developing successful bioreactor technology                                     as well as biological expertise in hepatocyte                                   cultivation and function.",
