 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal of this project is the development of a method                for the design of compliant mechanisms, systems which are composed              partially or entirely of elastic elements and which undergo large               deflections.  Traditionally, the area of mechanisms design has been             dominated by the mechanics of rigid body analysis and synthesis.                It is beginning to incorporate advantages of large displacement                 elastic elements.  However, formalized treatment of the design                  process for this type of mechanism has been lacking.  Heuristic                 means are often inadequate as predictive tools for design, and                  trial and error prototyping as a design approach can be prohibitive             in cost.  This research constitutes an effort to develop a                      methodology for compliant mechanism design which will allow the                 designer to create desired mechanisms systematically and                        economically.  The research comprises three phases of activity                  including a development phase, a formulation phase, and an                      evaluation phase.  In the first phase, the objective is to develop              a nomenclature or terminology, and kinematic concepts for compliant             mechanisms.  Some work has already been done in this area and the               intent is to extend it.  Specifically, the compliance number                    concept, which is related to the number of mechanism degrees of                 freedom will be refined.  Other parameters will be defined as                   necessary.  The formulation phase consists of two activities.  The              first is an effort to categorize compliant mechanism synthesis                  types by structure, function, or other criteria.  The second                    activity attempts to systematically establish rules and guidelines              for design conceptualization of compliant mechanisms.  The third                research phase is also a two part activity.  The first includes                 mathematical modeling, development of efficient numerical                       algorithms, and use of computer simulation and optimization                     techniques in arriving at design solutions for compliant                        mechanisms.  The second part of the evaluation phase consists of                validation of prediction techniques, design procedures and                      kinematic concepts through extensive prototyping and testing.",
