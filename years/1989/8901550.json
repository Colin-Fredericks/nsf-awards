 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Alexander terrane has the longest and most complete                    Paleozoic stratigraphy of the Alaskan suspect terranes, with a                  stratigraphic and fossil record extending back to the early                     Ordovician.  It lies outboard of several younger terranes and it                is one of the key sections in understanding the accretionary                    history of northwestern North America.  Many workers believe it                 began its long history in the western \"Protopacific\" and only                   arrived in the vicinity of North America in late Mesozoic time.                 Faunal evidence gained from ongoing studies does not support this               view but suggests that the Alexander terrane was more closely                   associated with the continent of North America than with                        Australia or Asia.  The faunas belong to the Old World Realm and                show mainly Cordilleran Region affinities that contrast with the                affinities of faunas in eastern Australia and China.  However,                  the affinities are not wholly Cordilleran and there are some                    Siberian aspects that need further explanation.                                      P.I. will collect and describe brachiopods of Devonian,                    Mississippian, and Pennsylvanian age to see if these also show a                North American affinity or if they indicate a continuing Siberian               influence.  The gaps in knowledge of Asiatic faunas are being                   rapidly filled by workers in China and the USSR so that                         comparisons are possible once we have collected adequate material               in our own sections.  The work will concentrate on brachiopods,                 because these are benthic and sensitive to biogeographic factors,               but will make use of our recent work on donodonts from                          southeastern Alaska because these provide the best available age                control in these calcareous sections.",
