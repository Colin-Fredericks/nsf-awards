 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves two related empirical projects aimed at examining         the dynamics of employment, hours, and compensation in U.S. labor               markets.  The link between the studies is the presumption that the              costs of hiring and training new workers encourages firms to retain             workers once they have been hired. The first study examines expected            patterns in union contracts when there are costs associated with                adjusting employment.  This analysis will be undertaken with data on            major bargaining agreements in the U.S. from 1965 to 1985.  The second          study focuses on measuring cyclical movements in labor costs taking             into account workers' turnover behavior.  A major component of this             analysis is to match industry data on employment and hours to                   individual data on employment turnover in order to estimate the impact          of firms' decisions on labor turnover.  This project is important               because it will provide a better understanding of the behavior of the           labor market and the impact of labor contracts on labor mobility.",
