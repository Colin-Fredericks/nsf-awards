 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University will buy an instrument to measure optical                   intensities in the junior level course in geometrical and                       physical optics at the University of Puget Sound.  The sensing                  element of the instrument consists of 1020 photo diodes arranged                in a line, making it possible to measure the intensity of light                 as a function of one space dimension.  It will permit the                       quantitative study of some classical experiments in wave optics,                such as interference and diffraction patterns, and strengthen the               connection between the mathematical description of these                        phenomena and observed behavior.  It will also provide a suitable               sensor for new experiments, such as the Zeeman effect, a study of               laser modes, and a study of the resolving power of the Fabry-                   Perot interferometer.  Equally important is the experience will                 give students with modern instrumentation.                                                                                                                           The University will match the award with an equal amount of                funds.",
