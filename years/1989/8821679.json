 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recognition of the microbial loop in marine and freshwater ecosystems is        changing the view of trophic dynamics and energy flow in these                  environments.  This project will focus on the structure and grazing             impact of microbial food webs in arctic aquatic systems of the Toolik           Lake region and its response to nutrient and predator manipulations.            During the first year, samples will be taken for determination of               seasonal microplankton abundance in both control and experimental lakes.        Fluorescently labelled algae will be used to assess trophic links within        the microbial loop.  During the second year of the study, grazing rates         of microplankton will be assessed by uptake of algae in control and             experimental lakes.  During both years, epilithic protozoan communities         in control and experimental reaches of an arctic river will also be             monitored.  All research will be coordinated with the Toolik Lake Long          Term Ecological Research (LTER) group for synoptic sampling.  This study        will provide insight for a tropic component which is fundamental for an         understanding of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems but is not               currently being addressed in the Toolik Lake LTER study.",
