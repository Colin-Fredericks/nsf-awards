 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Drs. H. H.               Stroke and O. Redi, New York University and Dr. Liberman and                    colleagues at the Laboratoire Aime Cotton, Orsay, France.  The                  objective of this research is to study the systematic effects in                nuclear structure as the neutron number is varied.                                                                                                              The extended magenetic structure of the nucleus is manifested                   when one compares the interaction of the nuclear magnetization                  with a uniform magnetic field to that in the inhomogeneous field,               produced by the atomic electrons (Bohr-Weisskopf effect or                      hyperfine structure anomaly).  The effect can be used to explore                nuclear magnetic properties and wave functions.  In practice, the               nearly total lack of systematic experimental data has limited                   this possibility.  By extending the measurements to long chains                 of radioactive isotopes obtainable at the CERN isotope separator                with on-line-detection (ISOLDE), the two research groups will                   carry out studies that are expected to lead to magenetic                        structure data comparable to that already obtained for the                      systematics of the nuclear charge distribution from isotope                     shifts.  An atomic beam magnetic resonance machine at N.Y.U. is                 being adapted as a prototype for the final apparatus to be built                by the group in France, where much of the required laser systems                are also under development.  The results of this research should                lead to valuable new and systematic data on electric and                        magenetic properties of nuclei.",
