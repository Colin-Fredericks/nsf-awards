 "awd_abstract_narration": "The composition of the earth's early atmospheric will                      be studied using a one-dimensional photochemical model.  Three                  specific questions will be addressed.  The first is whether                     impacts could have converted a CO2-dominated atmosphere into a                  CO-dominated one during the first several hundred million years                 of the earth's history.  The oxidation state of the atmosphere,                 and the C/O ratio in particular, is an important boundary                       condition on the origin of life.  The second question deals                     with the coupling between ammonia, methane, and sulfur in the                   early atmosphere.  Elemental sulfur vapor could have provided                   an effective screen against solar near-UV radiation if the                      early earth was warmer than today.  By shielding ammonia and                    methane from photolysis, such a screen may have allowed much                    higher concentrations of these gases to exist in the prebiotic                  atmosphere.  This, too, could have affected the origin of life.                      The third question concerns the transition from a reducing                 to an oxidizing atmosphere.  The photochemical model will be                    used to simulate atmospheres containing low levels of O2 (about                 10-10 to 10-5 times present) and to determine where the oxygen                  concentration would have stabilized once photosynthesis had                     overwhelmed the supply of reduced gases.",
