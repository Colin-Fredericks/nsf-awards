 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, collections of workstations interconnected by high-            speed communication devices have come into widespread use.  Though such         collections often have considerable computing capacity, much of it is           generally inaccessible, because only primitive means currently exist            for offloading work to idle or lightly-utilized workstations when back-         logs of work develop.  This failure to take advantage of unused                 computing capacity reduces performance to a fraction of what it might           be.                                                                                                                                                             The objective of the project is to tap the latent capacity of a network         of workstations by designing and implementing distributed scheduling            algorithms that are suited to the unique features of this environment.          The approach, which combines measurement, analytic modeling, simulation         and implementation, includes several advances over previous approaches.         First, the availability of computing capacity is increased by                   exploiting capacity at under-utilized, as well as idle, workstations.           Second, the robustness of distributed scheduling is improved by                 adapting the strategy pursued to changes in the system environment.             Third, robustness is further promoted through the use of fully                  decentralized distributed scheduling algorithms.  Finally, utilization          of latent capacity is increased by shifting the responsibility for              determining which processes can be advantageously transferred to other          workstations from the user to the distributed scheduler.",
