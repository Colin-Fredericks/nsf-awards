 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a seminar on \"Chemistry of Metal-Polymer                Systems,\" organized jointly by Prof. James N. Demas, University of              Virginia, and Prof. Hitoshi Ohtaki, of the Institute for Molecular              Sciences, Okazaki, Japan.  Participants will meet in Lawrenceville,             N.J., from July 23 to 28, 1989, to discuss the roles of metals in               polymer synthesis; electron transfer in macromolecular systems;                 interactions between metal complexes and macromolecules; and molecular          assemlies, polymer films and surfaces involving metal complexes.  The           state of polymer science is at a high level in both Japan and the               U.S.  This seminar will bring together experts from both countries in           various areas of macromolecule metal complexes.  A balance between              basic and applied aspects of each of the chosen topics will be                  sought, and the discussions are expected to contribute importantly to           progress in the chemistry of metal/polymer systems in both countries.                                                                                           Questions to be addressed in the seminar should help clarify the                detailed mechanism of catalysis in the production of man-made                   polymers using organometallic compounds; mechanisms of electronic               conduction in polymers; the use of microprobes to study microscopic             interactions of metal species with polymers; and the role of surfaces           in chemical reactions involving polymers.  Understanding of these               questions may have important implications in polymer production and             the fabrication and use of organic electron                                     devices.",
