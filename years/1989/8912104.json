 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation enhancement proposal outlines an approach                     to understanding factors underlying the risk amplification                      process and the ways in which expert opinions on risk                           perception combine with views of the public.  Although the                      influence of risk perceptions on public policy has been a                       popular topic for researchers over the past decade, most of                     the analytical work has employed a small set of methods                         (e.g., factor analysis) and has emphasized descriptive rather                   than prescriptive elements of the attitude formation process.                   The proposed research will attempt to use alternative data-                     interpretation methods, such as partial least squares and                       covariance structure models, to review existing data sets;                      these methods are thought to provide a stronger basis for                       developing general structural models that could provide                         useful theoretical insights.  In addition, the project will                     collect additional data from an applied setting that will be                    used to test alternative hypotheses about the risk                              amplification process.",
