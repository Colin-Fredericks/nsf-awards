 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Phillips will continue his ongoing study of the                  homotopy theory of inverse limits of operator algebras. This                    includes a noncommutative version of the Bott periodicity theorem               describing the iterated loop spaces of the infinite unitary group               up to homotopy, and the search for noncommutative classifying                   algebras for K-theory and other cohomology theories. Another                    facet of his project involves proper actions of noncompact groups               on noncommutative operator algebras, where it is hoped that the                 theory will develop along the lines of the topological case of                  groups acting on spaces.                                                             The mathematical research for this project falls under the                 heading of noncommutative algebraic topology. Topology is the                   study of shape, the overall conformation of objects (called                     topological spaces when one looks at them from this point of                    view). Topology becomes algebraic when one systematically                       computes invariants (numbers, say, or slightly more complicated                 mathematical objects) that are defined for classes of topological               spaces. For instance, algebraic topology assigns invariants that                count numbers of holes of various dimensions in topological                     spaces, useful when the space is itself too high-dimensional to                 permit a pictorial rendering. One popular topological procedure                 is to take a standard space, like a circle or a sphere, and look                at how it maps into the space under examination, two such                       mappings being considered identical if one can be continuously                  deformed into the other; this is homotopy theory. Topology                      becomes noncommutative when you replace the space by an                         appropriate algebra of complex functions on it, and then forget                 about the space and allow the algebra to be more or less                        arbitrary. One result of this is to be able to count holes, so to               speak, in objects entirely outside the traditional purview of                   topology, objects such as operator algebras that have heretofore                been of interest mainly to functional analysts. The more general                framework also yields some insights on the older subject matter                 by providing more elbow room for constructions. Professor                       Phillips' project is concerned with certain facets of this work                 of extending the machinery of topology into new domains.",
