 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project provides living expenses for four                    Indian scientists and graduate students to participate in a                     multi-institution experiment at Fermi Laboratory.  The                          experiment E706 is designed to study interactions of protons,                   pions and kaons in a variety of targets, triggering on high                     transverse momentum (> 5 GeV/c) electromagnetic showers.  It                    is a second generation fixed target experiment using high                       energy beams (800 GeV protons from Fermilab Tevatron) and with                  a wide acceptance spectrometer, intended to reach                               approximately 10 GeV/c.  The primary goal of this experiment                    is to obtain iformation on quark and gluon interactions by                      studying the yield of direct photons and their accompanying                     hadrons in collisions of positive pions, negative pions and                     protons with nucleons.  The Indian scientists participation                     includes designing and building detectors, setting up                           multi-processor systems for data analysis and associated                        software.                                                                                                                                                       Scope:  This is a renewal for work done by the same Indian                      team under                                                                      Dr. R. Shivpuri of the Physics Department, University of Delhi                  and by the U.S. team under Dr. Lederman of Fermi Lab and Drs.                   Tom Ferbel and                                                                  P. Slattery of the University of Rochester, under NSF grants                    INT-8514766, and INT-8500817 respectively.  The collaboration                   is proving to be highly successful and of great value to the                    two sides.                                                                                                                                                      Funding:  This project is being funded under 2 grants:                          (1) INT-8815082 to Dr. Leon Lederman, Fermi Laboratory for                      three years.  Each year U.S. $60,000, plus $8,900 in Indian                     Currency.                                                                                                                                                       (2) INT-8905213 to Dr. R. Shivpuri, University of Delhi, for                    three years, in Indian rupees equivalent to $138,514 first                      year and $80,000 each of second and third years.",
