The first is                  the                                                                             unusual dynamics of managed domestic farm-animal populations,                   which                                                                           requires detailed investigation to understand the extreme                       volatility of                                                                   this important component of our food supply.  More realistic and,               thus,                                                                           more complicated models based on reproductive technology and                    demographic considerations will be specified, simulated, and                    estimated.
