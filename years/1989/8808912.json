 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is in the area of crystallization and precipitation                of sparingly soluble salts to develop expertise in the study of                 the precipitation and processing of ceramic powders.  The programs              is complemented by collaboration with staff at Sandia National                  Laboratories in the development of novel experimental techniques.                                                                                               The objective of the research program is to develop a fundamental               understanding of the mechanisms involved in the precipitation of                ceramic precursor powders for the manufacture of electronic                     components.  The electronic properties of ceramics are critically               dependent on the chemical and physical properties of the precursor              powder.  Precipitation from solution is proposed as the chemical                method for obtaining the desired powder properties.  In order to                fully exploit this type of processing and control the end use                   properties of the ceramic, the mechanisms of precipitation are                  studied.  The focus of the work is on the preparation of doped                  zinc oxide powders for ceramic varistors, but the techniques and                analyses developed may be generally applied to other compounds and              other ceramic material types.",
