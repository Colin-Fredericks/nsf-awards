 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Marine Studies at the University of Delaware                     will acquire several items of oceanographic instrumentation                     to be placed in a pool of shared-use equipment.  This                           equipment is maintained for use on or in association with the                   R/V CAPE HENLOPEN, a research vessel owned and operated by                      the University.  A substantial part of the ship's operating                     schedule during 1989 is in support of NSF-sponsored research                    projects.  The instrumentation will also increase the                           capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support                      research and engineering activities.  The instrumentation                       includes:                                                                                                                                                       -an optical disk drive for the shipboard computer,                              -profiling fluorometer for use in several environmental                           studies, and                                                                  -an acoustic command unit for remotely activating                                 instrumentation on the seafloor.                                                                                                                              The instrumentation described above will increase the                           capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored                         research and engineering projects.",
