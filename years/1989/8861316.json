 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past decade there has been an increase in the design and             complexity of compound semiconductor devices and systems.  For these            devices and systems to operate effectively, robust device and system            designs are needed.  Unfortunately in the case of gallium arsenide              devices, design engineers use workstation tools that describe the               complex conduction paths within devices by highly approximate                   algorithms that are limited in their predictive abilities.                                                                                                      The principle Phase I research objectives are:  (1) to utilize the SRA          physically based drift and diffusion equation algorithm to develop              parameters allowing an equivalent circuit representation of gallium             arsenide field effect transistors to be used in nonlinear device                circuit analysis for large signals at high frequency.  (2) Use the              nonlienar circuit differential equations in the design of a power FET,          and verify the design using the drift and diffusion equations.  (3)             Couple the SRA generated nonlinear circuit differential equations to a          general circuit algorithm, in this case the Harmonic Balance Method.                                                                                            The innovative feature of SRA's Phase I approach is to obtain the               coefficients for the nonlinear circuit representation of a compound             semiconductor from the solutions to the nonlinear governing partial             differential equations.  Success in this program would create a                 device/circuit design tool useable by a broad range of design                   engineers that is applicable to GaAs and other modern semiconductor             materials.  Under the Phase I program the design tool shall be                  implemented for the problem of designing high power gallium arsenide            FETs.  Under the Phase II part of the program the drift and diffusion           code and the Harmonic Balance Method circuit analysis will be put into          a workstation with a user interface that circuit and device designers           can use.",
