 "awd_abstract_narration": "The frame problem is one of the most fundamental problems in                    Artificial  Intelligence.  The frame problem may be generally                   defined as the problem of finding a representation form                         permitting a changing, complex world to be efficiently and                      adequately represented.  Since its introduction by McCarthy and                 Hayes in 1969, the frame problem has been the object of much                    fascination and debate (Shoham, 1987).  Researchers from a                      variety of disciplines, such as computer science (AI), cognitive                science (psychology), and philosophy are actively assailing the                 frame problem from widely differing perspectives.  This workshop                will be useful in bringing together proponents of these various                 perspectives for a focused exchange of ideas that should lead to                progress through increased interdisciplinary cooperation.",
