 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research is to gather DNA sequence                information from modern and ancient Hawaiians that will help                    anthropologists model the growth of Hawaiian populations,                       calculate lineage extinction rates, and understand migration,                   dispersal, and replacement in a well-documented cultural context.               Genealogies for modern donors reconstructed from mitochondrial                  DNA (mtDNA) will be compared for accuracy to those constructed                  with vital statistics and census information stored in the Cancer               Center registry for the State of Hawaii.  Data from modern and                  ancient samples will be combined to produce a mitochondrial tree                for Hawaiian maternal lineages, and mtDNA sequences from                        Hawaiians will then be compared with those obtained from other                  areas of the world.  This information will complement data on                   population relacement in the Pacific gathered by linguists,                     physical anthropologists, archaeologists, historians,                           epidemiologists, and previous geneticists limited to indirect                   studies of the genome using protein polymorphisms.                                                                                                              The proposal represents an effort to integrate information about                modern and ancient Hawaiian populations within the context of an                historical experiment that resulted in the near extinction of one               complete culture on contact with a dominant economic and                        technological force.",
