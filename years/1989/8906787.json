 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research problems to be studied belong mainly to four                  areas: Bayesian comparison of experiments and optimal designs,                  hierarchical models in robust Bayes studies, stochastic                         optimization, and statistical aspects of file-merging                           methodology. The statistical theory for file-merging methodology,               which is used heavily in evaluating policy implications by                      federal agencies, will be developed.  To provide a solid                        theoretical foundation for usage of multi-stage probability                     models the area of hierarchical models for robust Bayes analysis                will be studied. The goal of a stochastic optimization project is               the development of a mostly automated and possibly fast converging              algorithm for finding the global minimum of a complicated                       function.  In the Bayesian comparison of experiments area, new                  tools and theories will be investigated for choosing the better                 of two experiments.  Optimal experimental design theory will be                 applied to a number of models for which popular designs exist                   but little is known concerning their optimality properties.                     Research will also be conducted on adaptive Bayesian designs for                quantal response under a variety of assumptions which will be                   very useful for biostatistical applications.  If adopted in                     clinical trials, they should lead to time savings.  Problems in                 robust design, process design and design of computer experiments                will be analyzed through the application of optimal design                      theory.",
