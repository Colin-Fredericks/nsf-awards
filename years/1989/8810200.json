 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animal eggs of many species including those of echinoderms,                 amphibia, and mammals, have extracellular coats that play an                    important role in fertilization.  Each coat represents a cell                   surface-anchored extracellular matrix which is elaborated during                oocyte maturation, which is directly involved in cell-cell                      recognition between the egg and the sperm, and which is                         structurally modified at fertilization in an organized, and                     apparently stepwise manner, to form a physical barrier to                       polyspermy.  Structural modifications are accomplished by enzymes               and structural proteins released by cortical granule exocytosis                 just after fertilization. In this proposal Dr. Chandler aims to                 study the structure of the vitelline layer in the sea urchin egg,               of the vitelline envelope in the Xenopus laevis egg, and their                  conversion the fertilization envelopes. To accomplish this he                   will prepare high resolution platinum replicas of eggs that have                been deep-etched.  His aims in sea urchin eggs are: 1) to                       visualize the intermediate stages that occur during                             transformation of the vitelline layer into the fertilization                    envelope, 2) to localize the envelope crosslinking enzyme                       ovoperoxidase, and its binding protein proteoliasin, by                         immunogold labelling, and 3) to study the mechanism of                          paracrystalline protein coating during fertilization envelope                   assembly.  His aims in Xenopus laevis eggs are: 1) to visualize                 formation of the vitelline envelope (VE) during oocyte growth and               meiotic maturation, 2) to view modifications of the VE just after               fertilization resulting from interactions of cortical granule                   secretions with the envelope, 3) to identify by immunogold                      labelling the 69kD and 64kD components of the vitelline envelope                which undergo hydrolytic processing at fertilization, and 4) to                 study the structure and developmental role of the \"M\" layer, a                  newly discovered component of the Xenopus fertilization envelope.               %%%                                                                                 These studies are the beginning of a longer term goal which                 is a comparative study of structure-function relationships in the               extracellular matrices of the eggs of several species                           (echinoderms, amphibians, and mammals). These extracellular                     matrices are important to fertilization in all these species.",
