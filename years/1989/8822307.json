 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will assemble information on a range of matters that are           central to our understanding of voting and party competition in Western         democracies.  It is the first stage in the construction of a                    comprehensive database on the policy preferences of key political               actors in a large number of representative democracies.  This phase of          the research involves a major survey of approximately 1,000 country             specialists and is designed to establish the preferred positions of             party elites on a range of policy dimensions.  Most of these aspects of         party policy have not before been the subject of comprehensive cross-           national research.  In addition, the study will estimate differences            between the policy preferences of party leaders and those of other key          sections of the parties concerned, including legislators, activists and         voters.  It will also estimate the importance attributed by leaders to          particular policy dimensions; the number of policy dimensions that are          important in each party system; the extent to which party leaders trade         off the desire to get into office against the desire to affect policy           outputs; and the extent to which the leaders of each party have control         over party policy.  The overall results will bring theoretical and              empirical analyses of voting and party competition much closer                  together.  They will also open up new approaches to the understanding           of party competition that have hitherto been closed off because of even         the vaguest estimates of a number of key variables.",
