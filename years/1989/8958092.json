 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Timothy Rowe of the University of Texas at Austin will devote               his time during the five years of this Presidential Young                       Investigator Award to using phylogenetic systematics to explore                 the evolution of mammalian ontogeny.  This work logically follows               from previous research, which analyzed skeletal evolution in the                major groups of Mammalia and the closest extinct relatives within               Synapsida (early reptilian forms ancestral to true mammals).                    Nearly 1,000 historic transformations of the skeleton were                      summarized as a result.  It is now possible to refer to this                    information while examining skeletal development in living                      mammals.                                                                                                                                                        Cladistic methods will be used to analyze skeletal development                  in selected mammalian and tetrapod species, phylogenetic                        transformations and sequences of transformations that                           recapitulate in ontogeny, and disruptions or deletions in                       transformation sequences.  To accomplish these goals, it will be                necessary to acquire developmental information from cleared and                 stained embryos of extant mammal species; serial sections, and                  images (from nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, from rare or                endangered species) will also be processed and incorporated into                the data set.                                                                                                                                                   The research described above has exceptional potential for                      generating new data and for syntheses with previous observations                to solve long-standing problems in evolutionary biology.  In                    addition, it highlights the importance of systematic biology in                 supplying a unifying theme to threads from the disparate fields                 of molecular and developmental biology, comparative anatomy, and                paleontology.",
