 "awd_abstract_narration": "Study of the stratigraphy of dinoflagellate and small                      acritarch species in sediments of Campanian, Maestrichtian and                  early Danian ages is proposed for sections occurring in outcropin               the U.S. Coastal Plain Province and in cored ocean basinsections                available from the Deep Sea Drilling Project/OceanDrilling                      Program.  The purpose is to stratigraphically date this                         interval, to prepare dinoflagellate and acritarch zonations which               can be connected to those previously published for the                          olderretaceous and to determine the nature of the dinocyst                      record at the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary.  It will be                   necessary to calibrate the dinoflagellate-acritarch stratigraphy                byinvestigating sections on land, e.g. sections at Braggs,                      Alabama, and in the ocean basins, e.g. sections at D.S.D.P. Site                577, for which there is established independent and                             concordant-multidisciplinary evidence of age provided by polarity               reversalmagnetostratigraphy, chemostratigraphy (iridium,                        Carbon-13), and the biostratigraphy of calcareous fossils.                      Previous study of wells in the Atlantic Coastal Plain (Late                     Cretaceous) and in the Utah/Wyoming Overthrust Belt (Middle                     Jurassic) suggests that dinoflagellate species abundance                        andpalynologically-defined organic facies reflect episodes                      oftransgression and regression.  Evidence of transgression                      indifferent lithological settings is indicated by a                             multipleoccurrence of biostratigraphic datums (FAD, LAD) which is               succeeded by an interval of amorphous debris and increased number               of dinoflagellate species.  Regression is characterized by fewer                dinoflagellate species in an organic matrix of landplantdetritus.               Investigation of outcrops and wells of the easternU.S. Coastal                  Plain will provide a test of the palynologicalevidence.  Study of               sites in the adjacent western North Atlantic will test the                      palynological evidence of sea level change in thedeep sea facies.",
