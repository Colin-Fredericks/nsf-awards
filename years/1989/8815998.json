 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to generate many different                     peptide sequences in defined secondary structures through the use               of specifically positioned disulfide bonds, and to use such                     peptides to test the relationship of the activity of the peptides               with their secondary structure.   Dr. Wemmer will determine                     structures of small, naturally occurring, cystine containing                    peptides using two dimensional NMR spectroscopy.  Based on the                  peptides studies, he will then select specific cysteine \"basic\"                 positions, and investigate the degree to which changes in the                   surrounding peptide sequence can be made, while still retaining                 the secondary stucture of interest.                                                                                                                             Proteins are typically very complex biological structures which                 have evolved to meet specific structural requirements for                       activity, regulation and stability.  Natural proteins result from               simultaneous selective pressure along all of these lines.  In                   these proteins only a small part of the complete sequence may                   really be required for one aspect of the multiple functions.                    Therefore it is possible to duplicate some of the activity of the               protein using only a fraction of its amino acids.***//",
