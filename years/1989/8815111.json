The U.S. Coordinator is Dr. Russell R. Dynes,                     Chairman, Department of Sociology, and Co-Director, Disaster                    Research Center, University of Delaware.  Dr. Brian A. O. Ward,                 Director, Asian Disaster Preparedness Center, Asian Institute of                Technology, Bangkok, will be Co-Director of the Seminar.                        Scientists from the ASEAN countries, Bangladesh, India, Korea,                  Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka will be invited to participate.                                                                                                  The major themes of the seminar will be an assessment of the                    current status of research within the Asian Pacific region; the                 current status of research on socioeconomic aspects of disaster                 in developed countries; exploration of high priority research                   for developing countries; research opportunities created by                     different types of disaster agents; development of cooperative                  research projects; development of a sustaining network of help                  and advice to researchers isolated from other research                          colleagues; and consideration of development of research                        \"technical assistance\" based at the host institution.                           The coordinators of this international conference are highly                    respected  scientists with extensive experience in organizing                   international cooperative activities. This project is relevant                  to the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries (SDC)                  Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between                U.S. scientists and engineers and their counterparts in                         developing countries through the exchange of scientific                         information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through                          collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Under the SDC                     Program, conferences may be supported to explore the application                of science and technology to development problems.  This project                supports the SDC Program in each of these areas through the                     scientific exchanges and cooperative activities proposed.",
