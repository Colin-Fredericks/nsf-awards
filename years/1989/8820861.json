 "awd_abstract_narration": "During development neuroblasts acquire a spectrum of ion channels               that gives each type of neuron its special electrophysiological                 characteristics.  Developmental signals combine with genetic                    programs to specify ion channel types, number, and cell-surface                 distribution.  For some classes of neurons an important                         developmental signal is the polypeptide Nerve Growth Factor                     (NGF), a trophic agent for developing sympathetic neurons.  The                 general aim is to use patch clamp techniques and microinjection                 of DNA and proteins to test the ion channels through                            phosphorylation pathways such as those involving cAMP, GTP-                     binding proteins, or phosphoinositide breakdown products.  Using                the PC-12 neuronal cell line in tissue culture, The investigators               will compare NGF effects with those caused by artificially                      enhanced phosphorylation activity to determine whether they share               common biochemical pathways.  The specific objectives are:   (1)                to determine at the single channel level changes that occur in                  Na channels and several classes of voltage-sensitive Ca and K                   channel after NGF treatment and after introduction of                           phosphorylation-enhancing agents, phosphorylation blocking                      agents, or agents that promote phosphoinositide breakdown or                    stimulate phospholipase A2;j (2) to study the biophysical                       properties, pharmacology, and metabolic regulation of ion                       channels in the growth cone of developing neurites; and (3) to                  identify any characteristics of these ion channels, such as                     their distribution or metabolic regulation, that might give                     growth cones their unique behavior.  The long-term goal is to                   gain information about the process underlying the selection,                    distribution, and metabolic regulation of ion channels in                       developing neurons.  This information will likely contribute to                 our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying nervous                system behavior, both in health and disease.",
