 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Yale Gravitation Physics Group proposes to study a                     number of important problems in theoretical General Relativity                  and relativistic astrophysics.  In particular Professor Moncrief                plans to continue his investigations of the properties of                       singularities of large classes of solutions of Einstein's                       equations.  Using both exact analytic and higher order                          perturbative techniques, he hopes eventually to treat the general               case of completely non-symmetric cosmological spacetimes near                   their curvature singular boundaries and to classify the different               types of singularities that may occur.  Moncrief has also been                  studying the dynamical properties of hypothetical self-                         gravitating cosmic strings and has proposed a numerical method                  for computing their interactions.  He is also continuing to                     develop a perturbational approach to treating the gravitational                 radiation produced by astrophysically realistic models of                       rotating stellar core collapse and studying the possibility of                  overcharging a magnetically (or dyonically) charged black hole                  and thereby violating the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture.",
