 "awd_abstract_narration": "State governments are an important part of the United States'                   fiscal system.  States exhibit considerable diversity in the                    structure of both their tax and spending systems.  The lessons                  learned in the \"laboratory\" of the states are a good model for                  the design and execution of fiscal policy at the federal level.                 States are also important in their own right.  In 1986, states                  spent $1,424 per capita or 31.7% of the federal level.  States                  levied per capita taxes totalling $1,039, or 33.2% of the federal               government per capita tax burden of $3,131.  States have an                     important role in intertemporal fiscal policy as well.  In 1986,                states had accumulated per capita debt outstanding of $984 and                  individually states display considerable diversity in the use of                \"rainy day funds\" to substitute spending and revenues across the                business cycle.                                                                                                                                                 The contribution of this project is to construct detailed data on               the allocation of private capital by state and to combine this                  new data with existing data to form a longitudinal data set                     covering both private sector and public sector capital stocks,                  investment, employment, and output.  Using these data, the                      investigator will undertake empirical analyses of the beneficial                production externalities generated by state and local government                capital stocks, of the incentive effects of corporation taxation                on the accumulation of private capital, of the effects on wage                  taxation on equilibrium employment, and on the role of sales                    taxes in the determination of output.                                                                                                                           This project assembles a valuable new data set for the study of                 state fiscal policy.  The results of the empirical studies will                 provide a useful guide to the efficiency and equity of different                tax policies at both the state and federal level.  For example,                 states have a long experience with the design and administration                of sales taxes.  The results of this research could provide                     new information on the economic consequences of a national value                added tax (VAT).",
