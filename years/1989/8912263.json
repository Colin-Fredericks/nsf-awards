 "awd_abstract_narration": "As more women move into administrative positions                                traditionally held by men, the often resulting strains they                     encounter attract wider notice and research on the reasons                      for greater or lesser strain becomes all the more important.                    This research focuses on a case (female administrators in a                     religious denomination) where many of the duties and                            expectations incumbent on those in administrative positions                     are associated with the traditional prerogatives reserved to                    men. When women step into such positions, even though a                         long-term labor shortage of interested males makes that                         necessary, the strains in working relationships on the job                      are apparently increased. This research will explore in depth                   the ways these strains develop and the means developed to                       deal with them, using a combination of observational and                        interviewing methods. The findings from this research should                    offer insights into strains encountered as women enter other                    new roles now open to them.",
