In this renewal of their earlier grant, the investigators                       propose to continue their research on the kinetics and                          mechanisms of O-atom transfer reactions to CO of a metal                        carbonyl, extending it to other O-atom transfer reagents and to                 attempt to understand better the properties responsible for a                   good O-atom transfer reagent.  The investigators will conduct                   experiments to understand why (CH3)3NO is such a strong                         nucleophile of the carbon atom of CO in certain metal                           carbonyls.  Since these types of reactions are often used in the                syntheses of organometallic compounds and in their use as                       homogeneous catalysts, the knowledge gained on this project                     should be of value to research chemists in industry working on                  more applied related problems.",
