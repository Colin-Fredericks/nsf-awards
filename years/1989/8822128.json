 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Drs. Stephen G. Nelson,                  Valerie J. Paul, and Steven Amesbury, Marine Laboratory,                        University of Guam, to pursue with Dr. Hansa Chansang, Phuket                   Marine Biological Center, Thailand, for a period of 24 months,                  a program of cooperative research on the chemical ecology of                    marine plant-herbivore interactions.  Metabolites of marine                     plants will be screened to determine whether they serve as                      chemical defenses against tropical herbivorous fishes.  The                     biologically active metabolites will be isolated, chemically                    defined, and further studied for useful properties.  The                        collaborators will test the hypothesis that those organisms                     that are most deterrent toward feeding by reef fishes are the                   richest sources of natural products.  Those metabolites that                    show such deterrence will be studied further to determine                       whether they possess properties which are of interest to the                    biotechnological industries.                                                                                                                                    The field of chemical ecology has yielded valuable biological                   and ecological information about plant-herbivore and other                      predator-prey interactions in terrestrial habitats, but much                    less is known about the natural functions of plant metabolites                  in the marine environment.  Investigations of the role of                       these metabolites as antimicrobial, antifouling, and/or                         predator deterrent agents may provide a rationale for                           developing future applications for these compounds.  Many                       unique metabolites isolated from marine organisms may be a                      resource for future biotechnological applications.  The                         scientists will compare chemical and biological results                         already obtained on Guam with results of these proposed                         studies in the more diverse coral reef habitats of Phuket,                      Thailand.  The collaborators are highly respected scientists                    in the field of this research.  The present project will allow                  them to combine their talents and interests for mutual                          benefit.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the                     Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks to                          increase the level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and                   engineers and their counterparts in developing countries                        through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills,                  and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                  benefit.",
