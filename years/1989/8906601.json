 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new type of semiconductor switching device appears to have great              potential for power system applications.  It is called the                      photoconductive circuit element or PCE.  It can be switched rapidly,            will conduct large currents and hold off very high voltages.  It is             also a bilateral device, and the power rating of a single unit can be           easily scaled to meet the application.  The main objective of the               proposed research is to investigate the feasibility of this device for          circuit interruption in ac power systems.                                                                                                                       The project will conduct research along three basic fronts:  (1)                semiconductor design concepts, (2) device fabrication and testing, and          (3) system simulation studies.  In the first area, basic research will          be conducted to develop more accurate transient and steady-state                photoconductive device models.  A finite difference approach will be            used to develop a precise reference model for the device, from which            simpler reduced models will be formulated as equivalent circuits.               These will be useful in future system simulation studies for improved           evaluation of the proposed power applications.  In the fabrication              area, low-voltage, scaled-down prototype devices will be fabricated             and tested for verification of theoretical design concepts, as well as          for validation of transient and steady-state device models.  In                 addition, these devices will be used in scaled-down (but accurate)              replicas of power circuit applications, for direct experimental                 verification of full-scale simulation results.  The equipment                   requested in this proposal represents a key ingredient for the                  necessary experimental testing of this new power switching concept.",
