 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of six U.S. scientists in a           U.S.-Australia seminar that will focus on problems associated with              development in fire-prone forest environments.  Human development in            the U.S. and Australia, as well as other regions of the world, is               progressively extending into essentially wild forested environments.            People are frequently drawn to these areas seeking closer interaction           with nature and wildlife, as well as enjoyment of natural scenic                beauty, quiet, and solitude.  However, in temperate forest environments         where fire is an important component of natural ecological processes,           development can prove hazardous to human property and lives.                    Scientific understanding of forest ecosystems and forest fire                   behavior has progressed considerably in the U.S. and Australia.                 Less, but significant, progress has also been made in research on               human perception of environmental quality and of natural hazards.               Models have been developed that predict forest development, others              that predict forest fire behavior, and still others that relate forest          characteristics to public perceptions of natural scenic beauty.                 However, these separate areas of study have not yet been integrated             into a model that can effectively guide design and development in               fire-prone forest areas.  This seminar, under the U.S.-Australia                Cooperative Science Program, will serve as a vehicle for bringing               together researchers from both countries who have separately addressed          these relevant problem areas.  The goal is to complete initial steps            toward the creation of an integrated scientific information base for            the design and management of forest developments that can provide               the natural environmental amenities that people seek, without                   unacceptable risks to lives and property.  Discussion will be                   directed toward identifying opportunities for mutually beneficial               binational cooperation.  The seminar organizers are Professor Terry             C. Daniel, University of Arizona, and Professor Ian Ferguson,                   University of Melbourne, Australia.  Co-organizers are Professor                Michael M. McCarthy, Texas A&M University, and Professor Ian P.                 Williamson, University of Melbourne.",
