 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator Award will support a                       research program in the physics of regions of star formation and                the relationship between star formation and the structure and                   evolution of galaxies.  The next couple of decades hold the                     potential for great advances in the study of star formation,                    since the technology and facilities required for definitive                     observations will first become available during that time.                      Aspects of star formation of particular interest include:                       studying the coalescence of diffuse atomic clouds into molecular                clouds by determining of the thermodynamic state of galactic and                extragalactic diffuse clouds; assessing the impact of massive                   star formation on the molecular cloud environment by studying the               interaction of ionization fronts and outflows from young stellar                objects with molecular clouds; searching for true protostars,                   still in the process of collapse by identifying the spectral                    signatures of collapse in low-luminosity, low-mass objects in                   nearby molecular clouds; obtaining strict constraints on the form               of the initial mass functions of starbursts, by high resolution                 observations that determine the intrinsic (de-reddened)                         luminosity, colors and internal dynamics of the nuclei of                       starburst galaxies; shedding light on processes which were of                   importance in past epochs of star formation, and which led to                   \"metal\" enrichment of the interstellar medium, by making precise                determination of the relative abundance of elements in spiral                   galaxies.  Like many studies of the physics of star formation,                  these problems are best or exclusively addressed with                           observations of molecular, atomic or ionic spectral lines at                    infrared and submillimeter wavelength (1-1000 microns).  There                  remains a great need for better detectors and astronomical                      instruments at these wavelengths, and the Principal Investigator                will continue his work in developing gar infrared detector                      arrays and spectroscopic instruments which use these devices.  He               plans to employ detector array technology in constructing a high                resolution echelle spectrometer for the 4-14 micron wavelength                  range.  These devices represent substantial extensions of the                   present capability of infrared spectroscopic instrumentation, and               in particular would be of great value in the astronomical                       projects mentioned above.",
