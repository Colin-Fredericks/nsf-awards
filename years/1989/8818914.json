 "awd_abstract_narration": "Differentiation in fungi is a direct consequence of de novo                     synthesis of carbohydrate polymers and their subsequent assembly,               forming a cell wall. All available information clearly shows that               cell wall assembly is the key morphogenic determinant for these                 organisms. in filamentous fungi, cell wall assembly occurs at                   each hyphal apex resulting in polarized growth and extension.                   Although the general features of cell wall structure are known,                 only a few details of cell wall assembly have been elucidated.                  This is due, in part, to the lack of appropriate mutants for                    genetic dissection. (1-3)-beta-D-glucan synthase activity                       catalyzes the formation of a linear (1-3)-beta-glucan. Glucan                   synthase activity is essential for normal cell wall assembly and                resulting growth and development of a large number of diverse                   yeasts and filamentous fungi. Dr. Selitrennikoff proposes the                   detailed characterization of glucan synthase of a filamentous                   Ascomycete, Neurospora crassa. This includes: i) The purification               and characterization of solubilized enzyme activity. ii) The                    characterization of glucan synthesis of isolated enzyme activity.               iii) The analysis of glucan synthase mutants.                                   %%%                                                                             This combination of biochemical and genetic approaches will lead                to significant gains in our understanding of (1,3)-beta-glucan                  synthase and its role in development and morphogenesis.",
