 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves the undergraduate curriculum at all levels of             instruction by providing our students with experience and training in           state of the art techniques for several areas of psychological                  research.  Experimental stations are set up in the undergraduate                laboratory at which students, working in pairs, conduct experiments in          learning, cognition, perception and psycholinguistics.  Each work               station consists of a computer with a color monitor capable of                  presenting good quality graphics, an interfacing unit that allows the           students to use the computer to control and sense events in the                 environment, and add-on boards and devices that make it possible to             present auditory and visual stimuli.  These experimental work stations          enable the students to perform experiments on the most current areas of         psychological research.  In addition, more advanced undergraduate               students are trained, not only to use the computer in conducting                experiments, but to program these experiments and use the peripheral            devices.  In the current curriculum the experimental psychology course          is, for many of our psychology majors, their only laboratory                    experience.  The improvements made possible through this grant enable           the expansion of laboratory facilities enhancing the current                    experimental course as well as adding laboratory components to                  undergraduate courses in Sensation and Perception, Learning, and                Psycholinguistics.  Such revisions will increase students interests in,         and appreciation for, modern psychological science.                                                                                                             The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of               funds.",
