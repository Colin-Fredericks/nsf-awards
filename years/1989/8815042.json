 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to examine the electrostatic                   potentials on the production of second messengers.  The                         hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a                   lipid located on the cytoplasmic surface of cell membranes,                     produces inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol                   (DG).  IP3 induces the release of calcium; DG activates a protein               kinase C.  Dr. McLaughlin will carry out a number of projects                   including:  1)  studying the binding of polyvalent cations like                 neomycin to PIP2; 2) labelling the hydrocarbon tails of PIP2 and                making fluorescence energy transfer measurements; 3) studying the               effect of electrostatic potentials on the ability of calcium to                 activate a polyphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C; and 4)                continuing theoretical and experimental studies of the role of                  surface potentials and cooperativity in the binding of polyvalent               cations to monovalent anionic lipids in bilayer membranes.                                                                                                      Although very few biophysicists are working in this area and                    little information is available about the physical factors that                 influence the production and mechanism of action of these second                messengers, there is a great deal of evidence present for                       believing that one of these factors is the electrostatic                        potential produced by charged lipids such as phosphatidylserine.",
