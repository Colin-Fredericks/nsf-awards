Carmichael of Wright State                       University and Professors Yu Min-Juan and Li Shang-Hao of the                   Institute of Hydrobiology Exploration is jointly sponsored by                   NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.                                                                                                                        This joint research project will perform a more rigorous                        investigation of the ecology of toxic cyanobacteria and their                   role as agents of water-based disease in the increasingly                       eutrophic lakes of China.  The research will build on                           preliminary studies by the Chinese investigators in 1985, and                   both the Chinese and American investigators in 1986, which                      established the presence of toxic cyanobacteria in several                      eutrophic lakes and ponds near Wuhan.                                                                                                                           The investigators propose to study the occurrence and                           distribution of waterbloom forming toxic cyanobacteria                          (blue-green algae) in selected lakes, ponds and other water                     bodies of central and southern China.  They will isolate toxins                 and characterize them chemically; culture clonal isolates of                    toxic species to study toxin production, including environmental                factors which select for the presence of toxic strains; and                     compare toxic strains and their toxins with other cyanobacteria                 which the American principal investigator collected from North                  America, Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.",
