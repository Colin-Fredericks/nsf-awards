 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is a unilateral action and is being funded with the                  remaining funds from the Structural Systems program.  The                       balance of the requested amount will be given in FY 90.                                                                                                         This project studies the dynamic response of rotating machines                  such as motors, generators, pumps, and turbines subjected to                    seismic loads.  The proper functioning of such machines is                      critical for the safety operation of an industrial facility.                                                                                                    Because of the presence of gyroscopic effects and special                       characteristics of their bearings, the analysis of these                        machines for earthquake induced ground excitation is a very                     challenging analytical problem.  The complexity of the problem                  is further increased by the dynamic interaction between the                     machine and its support structure and other attachments such                    as piping.                                                                                                                                                      A response spectrum approach will be used to calculate the                      design response of these systems, explicitly including the                      special characteristics of the system and ground motion.  This                  study will lead to the development of rational determination                    of design responses of rotating machines and the design forces                  in the structures of machine foundations.  In practice, it                      will help the designers of rotating machines to evaluate the                    performance and prevent the malfunction of these systems                        during a strong ground shaking.",
