 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stomata regulate gas exchange in leaves, thus affecting                         productivity and the water balance of the plant.  Stomatal                      control depends on sensory transduction by guard cells of                       internal and external stimuli, translating information about                    prevailing conditions in the leaf environment to modulation of                  the size of stomatal apertures.  The overall objective of this                  research program is to understand the signal perception,                        metabolic transduction, and aperture regulation during the                      movements of stomata in response to light.  Recent studies have                 shown that light activates proton pumping at the guard cell                     plasmalemma via two different transduction pathways, one                        activated by a blue light photoreceptor and the other by the                    guard cell chloroplast.  The aim of this proposal is the detailed               characterization of the sensory transduction steps involved in                  pump activation.  Using the electrophysiological technique of                   patch clamping, metabolic and photobiological features of the two               pathways will be investigated, including critical concentrations                of ATP and other cofactors, fluence-rate dependence, specific                   pharmacological properties, and interactive features between the                two pathways in connection with the guard cell response to solar                radiation.  The identity of the blue light photoreceptor will be                investigated by spectroscopic analysis at low and room                          temperature.  Gas exchange techniques with intact leaves will be                used to correlate resolved features at the subcellular and                      cellular level with stomatal performance under physiological                    conditions.                                                                                                                                                     Stomata are pores in the surface of a leaf which regulate the                   passage of water and gasses into and out of the leaf's tissue.                  Proper traffic through the stomata is vital for the plant's                     ability to conduct photosynthesis and maintain its water balance.               The stomata open and close in response to environmental stimuli.                The results of this research will enhance our understanding of                  the cellular mechanisms which regulate the movements of stomata,                and more generally, will increase basic knowledge of the                        mechanisms of sensory transduction and ion transport in plant                   cells.",
