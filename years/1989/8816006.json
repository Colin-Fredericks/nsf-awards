 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concentration and chemical speciation of volatile components                in the Earth's upper mantle play an important role in geologic                  processes.  Despite their importance, we know little about their                actual modes of storage in the various geochemical reservoirs.                  Previously, infrared spectroscopy was used to establise that                    variable quantities of OG occur in pyroxenes, garnet and olivine                brought to the Earth's surface as xenoliths in alkalic magmas.                  Preliminary indications are that the OH concentration of these                  minerals is correlated with their environmmet of formation and                  may thus reflect ambient hydrous volatioe activity.  The PIs plan               to determine the actual OH content of important mantle minerals,                concentrating on the subcontinental mantle of southern Africa.                  They will calibrate the IR method using a variety of methods.                   This will allow them to quantify in absolute terms the abundance                of inter-mineral partitioning of OH in these rocks and perhaps to               provide D/H ratios.  In order to relate the observed OH contents                of the samples to volatile activity of the sources, they will                   measure the OH contents of garnets grown synthetically under                    controlled conditions of pressure, temperature and volatile                     activity in a piston cylinder apparatus.  The results are                       expected to have an important bearing on understanding how                      volatiles are distributed in the upper mantle as well as how they               behave int eh processes of melt generation and subduction.",
