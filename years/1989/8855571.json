 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Support Program for Instructional Competence in Astronomy                   (SPICA) project proposes a unified, national support program                    for teachers interested in teaching astronomy by developing a                   cadre of 32 expert high school teachers each year for three                     years through intensive summer institutes each of four-week                     duration. The institutes will provide the participants with a                   variety of experiences necessary for the participants to give                   short workshops to less well-prepared elementary, junior high                   and high school teachers.  This project follows the model                       established by American Association of Physics Teachers as                      the Physics Teacher Resource Agent program.                                                                                                                     At the summer institutes, the participants will hear                            presentations from those scientists who are involved with                       current optical, radio and x-ray research, building the next                    generation of observational instruments, and developing the                     theoretical models which will direct the course of future                       astrophysical research.  Teachers will be able to talk with                     these scientists informally as well.  Participants will work                    with optical and radio telescopes.  Teachers will be trained                    in the latest science education methods and will have hands-                    on experience with a wide range of astronomy education                          materials previously developed under Project STAR, the                          Lawrence Hall of Science, and the Education Development                         Center.  They will learn how to most effectively work with                      those who teach at grade levels other than their own.                                                                                                           These expert teachers will return to their home schools as                      \"agents-of-change.\"  They will conduct local, area and                          regional astronomy education workshops in their home areas                      during the three years following their workshop                                 participation.  The project will evaluate not only the                          institute participants' experiences, but the effectiveness of                   their workshops and the resultant impact on student learning                    and attitudes.                                                                                                                                                  The institution will cost-share the project in an amount                        which represents about 34% of the National Science Foundation                   request.",
