 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative            research project in solid and geomechanics between Antun Szavits-Nossan         at Zagreb University's Faculty of Civil Engineering and Robert L.               Schiffman, University of Colorado is to develop and validate a theory           for multidimensional, nonlinear, finite strain consolidation of soft            soils by testing physical models in the laboratory and field.  This a           trilateral project, involving the expertise of the Zagreb, Colorado             research teams and an Italian team at the University of Rome and                Naples.  The U.S. team will develop an uncoupled theory and centrifuge          model tests (laboratory). Field data and soil samples will be provided          by the Italian group; and the coupled theory, soft clay testing, and            computer program will be devleoped by the Yugoslav group.  Field                verification will take place at test fills at the Leonardo Da Vinci             airport at Rome.  Finite strain consolidation of soils has a major              impact on the behavior of offshore structures, highway embankments and          protection of deltaic lands (Mississippi delta, for example) by sea             dikes.                                                                                                                                                          This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is funded through a joint             fund of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments.          The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of State.          No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to the principal Yugoslav           institution.  Dollar funds are included for U.S. scientist travel to            Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.             The Italian research component of this grant will be supported from             other sources.",
