 "awd_abstract_narration": "An acousto-optic approach to two-pupil synthesis in a pupil                     interaction regime has been proposed to synthesize bipolar point                spread functions (PSFs) in incoherent image processing.  The method             consists of simultaneously scanning the input with the impulse                  responses corresponding to the two pupils which are offset in temporal          frequency via acousto-optic diffraction.  Subsequent heterodyne                 detection demodulates the synthesized PSF.                                                                                                                      It has been pointed out that, when the processor is operated in an              out-of-focus mode, i.e., the scanning beam is not focused onto the              input exactly, the applications of the processor can be extended to             include holographic recording, somewhat reminiscent of side-looking             radar.  In the project proposed here, this novel approach to optical            scanning holography is investigated.  Also, the potential applications          of the processor, while operated in the out-of-focus regime, are                investigated further in the context of two-pupil processing.  The               potential significant applications of such a processor are in the area          of optical holography for large-scale objects as well as that of                television transmission of a hologram for two-dimensional objects.              The results of this work could also lead to better 3-D information              processing.",
