 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant aims to replicate a pilot study, by the PI, of              graduates of historically black and predominantly white colleges and            universities.  Probability sampling techniques were use to collect and          analyze income, labor market, and quality of life data on a sample of           graduates of HBCUs and PWCUs in the Atlanta Metropolitan area.  In the          present study the PI proposes to identify and spell out the                     appropriate sampling methodology for a survey that will include HBCUs           and PWCUs from other states and regions of the US.  The aim is to               increase the reliability of the survey estimates without resorting to           a census.                                                                                                                                                       During the planning period the PI proposes to:                                    1) Confer with survey research experts including senior                         statisticians at ICPSR, the Bureau of the Census and other Federal              agencies regarding the appropriate sampling technique.                          2) Develop sampling procedure.  Revise survey instrument and                    determine optimum sample size.                                                  3) Identify database requirements including software, hardware and              programming support requirements.  Establish procedures for creating            storing and retrieving database.                                                4) Meet with Presidents and Academic Deans of sampled colleges and              universities and obtain permission to sample alumni records.                    5) Draft MRI grant proposal.",
