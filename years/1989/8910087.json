 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will seek to elucidate the interaction between the                biophysical chemistry of proteins and the adsorption surfaces used in           ion-exchange separations.  The study will take a structural,                    molecular-scale approach through the use of genetic engineering to              produce charge-altered forms of a single test protein of known                  structure.  The variation of adsorption isotherm and adsorption                 thermodynamics resulting from each systematic change in charge groups           on the surface of the protein will provide a direct test of the                 involvement of each protein residue in the adsorption of the protein.                                                                                           Ion Exchange chromatography has already emerged as an important tool            in biotechnology.  Many of the phenomena related to the adsorption of           proteins on ion exchange resins are poorly understood, however,                 including the tendency of the adsorption process to partially damage            the protein, which reduces its usefulness.  By using genetic                    engineering to modify only small regions of the surface of the                  protein, this project should make a major contribution to the                   fundamental understanding of the ion exchange of proteins.",
