 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on specification driven design of custom hardware.             The P.I. is working with three consultants: Richard Fujimoto of Georgia         Tech, Graham Birtwistle at Calgary, and Paliath Narendran of GE                 Corporate Research.  The group is developing a uniform theory for               describing mixed synchronous and asynchronous IC systems, as well as a          theory for deriving implementations from specification written in a             purely asynchronous style.  The research is based on the \"HOP\" family           of hardware description languages.  The language being investigated is          HOP-COP, which is a semantically simple, well characterized language.           It specifically addresses description of mixed synchronous and                  asynchronous designs.  Research topics include: identifying a minimal           primitive basis for HOP-COP; developing verification techniques based           on the language; finding algorithms for IC design tools; developing             proof of correctness algorithms and tools; and exploring                        implementations of the research ideas.                                          The research is on specification driven design of custom hardware, an           aspect of high level design, which is a high priority in the DTT                program.  The P.I. proposes a group effort with himself and three               consultants: Richard Fujimoto of Georgia Tech, Graham Birtwistle at             Calgary, and Paliath Narendran of GE Corporate Research.  The latter            two are wise choices for the theoretical development, and Fujimoto is           the \"engineer\" who can develop implementations of the theoretical ideas         and experimentation with them.  Professor Gopalakrishnan, who was an            EIA awardee in FY87, has made very good progress in his research in a           difficult subject, and shows potential for worthwhile contributions to          the field.",
