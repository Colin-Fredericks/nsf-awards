 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding transient behavior of engineering systems is                      becoming increasingly important in designing, optimizing, and                   controlling high technology products.  As such, engineering                     programs should provide opportunities for undergraduate students                to learn about the significance of dynamic phenomena and the tools              that the engineer uses to examine them.  This plan will focus on                dynamic measurements of phenomena in fluid dynamics and                         hydraulics, vibrations, and combustion engines.  To initiate the                laboratory development plan it is necessary to establish three lab              computer workstations which can perform high speed data                         acquisition, conduct extensive data analysis, and present                       graphical and tabular results in a flexible manner.  These                      workstations will be used to illustrate the theory of dynamic                   instruments discussed in experimental methods courses and will                  allow dynamic phenomena to be routinely studied in undergraduate                laboratory projects.  Possible topics include investigation of                  wing tip vortices on wind tunnel models to gain insight into ways               of controlling the accompanied induced drag, selection of                       structural members with acceptable damping characteristics, and                 comparison of burning rates in diesel engines fired with various                biomass fuels.",
