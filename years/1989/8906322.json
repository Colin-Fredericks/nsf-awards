 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been a pronounced upsurge in                                          interest in food colorants of natural origin.                                   The anthocyanins are well known but they are                                    unstable and sensitive to pH.  Recently a new                                   group of anthocyanins show good promise as                                      food colorants.  Pigments from Tradescentia                                     dracaenoides have multiple acyl groups on the                                   molecule which lends stability on storage when                                  formulated into foods.  In effect, these                                        pigments show high coloration at high pH values                                 whereas conventional anthocyanins are nearly                                    colorless at pH values above 4.  Purified                                       pigment extracts will be formulated into                                        sugar, citrate/phosphate model beverages and                                    pectin gel preparations for storage studies.                                    Color will be monitored by tristimulus                                          colorimetry.  A new method of analysis will be                                  developed to monitor anthocyanin degradation,                                   since conventional methods do not work.  A new                                  method of purifying the crude pigment extracts                                  will also be developed.  The pigment will be                                    isolated and identified using resin columns,                                    HPLC, paper chromatography and                                                  spectrophotmetry.",
