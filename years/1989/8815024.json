 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a group of investigators headed by                      Professor George Smoot of the University of California-Berkeley in              collaborative work with Professor Giorgio Sironi of the Universita              Degli Studi di Milano in Milan, Italy.  The investigators plan to               carry out improved measurements of the cosmic microwave background              radiation (CMBR) temperature from the Amundsen-Scott South Pole                 Station.  The Italian group will make measurements at frequencies               of .8 and 2.5 GHz, while the U.S. team will make measurements at                frequencies of 1.5, 3.8, and 7.5 GHz.  Already, measurements taken              by 2.5 and 3.8 GHz radiometers have yielded scientifically                      significant results; with upgraded equipment and the more                       advantageous South Pole site, it is expected that more accurate                 results will be obtained that will supplement, verify, and extend               previous measurements by the collaborators.  In addition,                       atmospheric measurements in the 90GHz range will be done, using                 existing instruments.                                                                                                                                           In combination with current measurements at higher frequencies and              with very accurate high frequency data from the Cosmic Background               Explorer (CoBE) satellite, these measurements will more accurately              determine the shape of the CMBR spectrum and thus provide useful                information about the thermal history of the early universe,                    significantly affecting theories of galaxy formation and particle               physics.  In addition, the atmospheric measurement could help test              existing models of atmospheric emission by providing valuable data              taken with a single set of instruments over a wide range of                     atmospheric and meteorological conditions.",
