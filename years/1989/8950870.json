 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inherent speed of computers means that geographic research or               experiments which used to take days or weeks to complete, can now be            done in minutes or hours.  The speed of computer mapping and spatial            analysis has meant that topics, experiments, and procedures which were          impractical for laboratory activities in the past, can now be added to          the undergraduate curriculum.  Furthermore, a knowledge of computer             technology specific to geography is becoming essential for employment           in the field and entry into graduate education.                                                                                                                 A comprehensive plan has been developed for a Computer Mapping/Spatial          Analysis Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.  The lab                contains the microcomputer resources which are specific to the                  discipline of geography.  As part of this plan, the expertise, data             bases, map boundary files, documentation, exercises, statistical                packages, and telecommunications networks required to fully integrate           this technology into all our specialized courses for majors and minors          have been acquired.  Some of the necessary hardware has also been               obtained through extramural funding.  This proposal provides enough             microcomputer hardware and software to make the technology readily              available to all students throughout their entire undergraduate                 careers.  The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal               amount of funds.",
