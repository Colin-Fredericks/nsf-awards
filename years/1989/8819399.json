 "awd_abstract_narration": "Legumes form a unique subcellular compartment to house nitrogen-                fixing endosymbiotic bacteria (Rhizobium species).  Integrity of                the membrane enclosing this compartment, the peribacteroid                      membrane, is essential for the maintenance of the symbiotic                     state.  However, little is known about the nature, function and                 biogenesis of this membrane.  Originally derived from the plasma                membrane, the peribacteriod membrane incorporates a number of                   nodule-specific proteins (nodulins) which play new roles imposed                on this subcellular compartment.  Several soybean genes that                    encode peribacteriod membrane nodulins have been identified and                 characterized.  The peribacteroid membrane nodulins are                         specifically targeted to this compartment and are not integrated                into the plasma membrane of the infected cells.  The goal of this               research is to identify sequences and the properties of the                     peribacteroid membrane proteins necessary for correct targeting                 of nodulins to the peribacteroid membrane.  Deletion analysis of                soybean nodulin sequences followed by fusion to reporter genes                  and transformation of a heterologous legume, Lotus corniculatus,                will be used to determine the mechanism of targeting.  The effect               of integration of complete soybean peribacteroid membrane                       nodulins into the Lotus peribacteroid membrane will be studied                  using specific antibodies raised against individual nodulins,                   either synthetic peptides or nodulins from cDNA clones expressed                in E. coli.                                                                                                                                                     This study will shed light not only on the cellular mechanisms                  that permit nitrogen fixing bacteria to live in nodules on the                  roots of legumes, but more generally on the mechanisms by which                 cell membranes differentiate to allow compartmentalization of                   vital cellular functions.",
