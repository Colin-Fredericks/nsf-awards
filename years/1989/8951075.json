 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the deficiencies of the undergraduate chemical                      education is a lack of emphasis on current laboratory experiments               that directly relate to frontier chemical research.  This project               implements several surface chemistry experiments to study gas                   adsorption on oxide-supported metal catalysts, a student research               project to study the mechanism involved in the hydroformylation                 of olefins and two new experiments in organic chemistry                         phenomena, surface science and ultra vacuum techniques as well as               insights into several fundamental chemical concepts.  This                      instrumentation, which includes a FTIR, a vacuum-gas line                       specially designed for surface chemistry studies and a                          temperature controller for temperature-dependant studies,                       provides undergraduate the much needed exposure to some current                 major direction is chemical research and some hands-on experience               in state-of-the-art instrumentation.  The institution is matching               the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
