 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from the University of Wisconsin.Milwaukee requestssupport        to enhance the planning of a Science and TechnologyCenter for Growth and        Characterization of Artificial LayeredMaterials.  Faculty researchers           from four departments in twocolleges of the University , as well as the         Laboratory forSurface Studies at Milwaukee, are involved in                     thisinterdisciplinary effort.  It is anticipated that leadership inhigh         technology research will increasingly rely on the ability todesign and          synthesize new layered materials with novel andtargeted properties.  The        goals of the proposed Center are thefabrication, characterization, and          modelling of such materials.                                                                                                                                    The Planning Grant activity will enable the institution tocomplete the          assimilation of a group of qualified personnel,identify the most                important scientific issues, plan theadministrative and scientific              structure of the Center, andestablish effective University Government           Research Laboratory .Industrial Research Laboratory linkages.",
