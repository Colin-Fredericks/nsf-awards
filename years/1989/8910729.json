 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonmonotonic reasoning and logic programming are both areas of                  crucial and growing significance to artificial intelligence and                 to the whole field of computer science.  Nevertheless, despite                  the close realtionship between the two areas, they have been                    developed largely independently of each other.  However, the                    recent discovery of the equivalence between the perfect model                   semantic of logic programs and natural forms of all four major                  formalizations of nonmonotonic reasoning establishes a closer                   link between the two areas and paves the way for using efficient                computation methods, developed for logic programming, as                        inference engines for nonmonotinic reasoning.  The problem of                   finding efficient inference mechanisms that can reason in a                     commonsense manner in the absence of complete information is one                of the major research and implementation problems in artificial                 intelligence.  To permit the use of logic programming as such an                inference engine, the investigator will develop effective                       procedural mechanisms for efficient execution of such methods,                  and will implement an experimental nonmonotonic reasoning                       system, based on logic programming.",
