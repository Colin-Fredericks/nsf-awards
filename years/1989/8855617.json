 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current trends in curricular thinking reflect the recognition that              working with real-world data can add richness, relevance and                    concreteness to the study of mathematics and the sciences.  However, the        current poor state of student abilities in data organization and data           analysis suggests that we need ways of helping students develop the             skills and concepts of data modelling -- that is, designing, collecting,        organizing, interpreting and critiquing data.                                                                                                                   New computing technologies make possible a class of highly visual,              highly interactive tools for working with \"attribute data, \" an                 important class of data for which database programs are currently the           primary available tool.  These new tools can (1) portray differences            among categorical, ordinal and numerical data; (2) let students interact        more direcly with the structures in which the data are embedded; and (3)        put unprecedented analytical power at the disposal of students of all           ages.  This project pursues the conjecture that such tools can support          students' learning of data modelling concepts and open up new                   opportunitites for the development of world-situated, inquiry-based             curricula of mathematics and science which so many are noow advocating.                                                                                                                                                                         This project will (1) identify conceptual challenges relating to data           modelling, and (2) develop and test software facilities and pedagogical         approaches targeted to these challenges.  Research and formative                evaluation will be carried ouot in clinical settings, primarily at the          middle school level but with some attention to younger and older                students.",
