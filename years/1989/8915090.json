 "awd_abstract_narration": "Circadian rhythms are a universal feature of eucaryotic                    systems.  They are typified by a daily oscillation in some                      physiologic response, usually to a light/dark cycle, that                       persists even in the absence of such an external cue.  Such                     rhythms include thermoregulation, cell division, cellular                       response to applied drugs, and the levels of several mRNA                       species, such as opsin and vasopressin.  While many such cyclic                 phenomena have been detected, the underlying mechanism                          responsible for the \"clock\" has remained elusive.                                    This fellwoship research will deal with the mechanisms of                  translational control of circadian bioluminescence in the marine                dinoflagellate Gonyaulax polyedra.  A luciferin/luciferase system               is responsible for the generation of time-dependent expression of               bioluminescence.  A luciferin-binding protein (LBP) is required                 to stabilize the high energy substrate prior to photon release.                 This protein is expressed only during a brief period at the onset               of night phase, as a result of rapid synthesis, and is                          selectively degraded several hours later.  Northern blot analysis               of LBP mRNA levels indicate that the transcript for the LBP is                  constitutively expressed, indicating the increased expression of                the LBP is a result of activation of latent mRNA (translational                 control), rather than increased gene activity (transitional                     control).  This project will serve the dual purpose of broadening               knowledge of dinoflagellate gene expression and elucidating the                 mechanism of circadian regulation of specific proteins.",
