 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will continue to develop the use of the ciliate                   protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila as a model system for the study               of eukaryotic phospholipid metabolism.  The research focuses on                 the interrelationships between the pathways of                                  phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis,                  with particular emphasis on elaborating the newly-discovered                    cross-regulation between ethanolamine kinase and choline kinase                 in which choline phosphate has been shown to activate                           ethanolamine kinase.  The possible role of this regulation in                   vivo will be investigated by examining levels of the                            intermediates in the pathways (ethanolamine, ethanolamine                       phosphate, CDP-ethanolamine, choline, choline phosphate and CDP-                choline) under normal growth conditions and under conditions in                 which the levels of these intermediates may be perturbed (by                    using analogs of choline and ethanolamine.)  The results will                   elaborate the potential for metabolic channelling of                            intermediates in the phospholipid biosynthetic pathways.  Enzymes               from bovine liver, such as the ethanolamine kinase and choline                  kinase will also be examined in order to elaborate similarities                 and differences in phospholipid biosynthesis between Tetrahymena                and higher eukaryotes.                                                                                                                                          The role of lipids in the structure and function of biological                  membranes has been of major interest for a considerable period of               time.  Modifications of the physical state of lipids and of the                 types of lipids in a given membrane have led to some                            understanding of requirements for membrane fluidity, surface                    charge and polar head groups.  All of these aspects appear to be                important to normal operation of a given membrane system.  The                  phospholipid composition of eukaryotes varies from tissue to                    tissue, from cell type to cell type within a given tissue and                   even between membrane types with in a given cell.  How these                    differences in phospholipid composition in eukaryotes arise has                 been of considerable interest and relates to such clinical                      problems as defects in formation of the surfactant                              dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine in the human lung.  This research                explores the first reactions in phospholipid biosynthesis                       (ethanolamine and choline kinases) which exhibit great                          variability in structure and properties between various tissues                 and between organisms.  These differences suggest possible                      additional regulation at this step in the phospholipid                          biosynthetic pathways in some tissues.  This possiblity will be                 examined in Tetrahymena (a unicellular eukaryote) whose pathways                for pospholipid biosynthesis are the same as those in mammals.                  The research will extensively involve undergraduates and will                   expose them to the intensive laboratory experience which they                   will encournter in their funther scientific careers.",
