 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing countries exhibit wide differences in their fiscal and               monetary policies, particularly with regard to inflation and                    fiscal deficits.  The purpose this project is to explain these                  differences by formulating and testing alternative theories of                  fiscal and monetary policies.  One of the major questions to be                 address is whether the observed policies are in accord with                     optimal government behavior.  Preliminary empirical results                     suggest that, for most part, developing countries adopt policies                which are far from optimum.  The main focus of this research is                 to develop and analyze alternative explanations for why different               countries deviate from optimal policy behavior in the way they                  do.  A political model of reputation that associates the                        effectiveness of reputational incentives to observable                          characteristics of the political system will be developed and                   tested.  In addition, a political theory of tax reform will also                constructed and tested.  This project is important because it may               suggest opportunities for institutional reform and how                          international organizations should deal with developing                         countries.",
