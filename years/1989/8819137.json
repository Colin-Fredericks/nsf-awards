 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract Blue Light irradiation of etiolated pea seedling                       strongly reduces the capacity of a 120 kD plasma membrane-                      associated protein for subsequent in vitro phosphorylation by                   added ATP.  Experiments are described that will a) provide a                    complete photobiological characterization of the light reaction;                b) investigate the correlation of its photobiological properties                with known physiological responses to blue light; c) characterize               the phosphorylation change biochemically; and d) characterize the               protein itself.  The measureable changes in phosphorylation occur               in seconds, and the PI will show that progress in these four                    areas will elucidate early steps in one or more                                 signal-transduction chains from blue light photoperception to                   final physiological response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Plant growth is controlled by light, both the amount and kind of                light it receives.  Certain plant growth responses are regulated                by high energy blue light.  This research will examine the                      mechanism by which plants perceive light and transform that                     energy into plant functions.",
