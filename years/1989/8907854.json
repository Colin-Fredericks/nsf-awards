 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of                  Professors Ziv Ran and Mei-Chu Chang of the University of                       California at Riverside. Dr. Ran plans to work on problems                      related to generalized linear systems and their applications,                   higher Noether-Lefschetz loci, deformations of maps, and secants                and projections of projective varieties. Professor Chang plans to               work on problems related to the slope of moduli spaces of curves,               and codimension-2 subvarieties of, and vector bundles on,                       projective spaces. For the first year of this award, the                        postdoctoral associate Dr. Angelo Lopez will continue his                       research on Noether-Lefschetz theory and the Hilbert schemes of                 space curves.                                                                        This is research in the field of Algebraic Geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                     origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from Algebra, but from Analysis and               Topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical Computer Science and in Robotics.",
