 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a seminar, \"Evolutionary Studies on Plant               Breeding Systems,\" organized jointly by Prof. Douglas Soltis of                 Washington State University and Prof. Kunio Iwatsuki of the University          of Tokyo, Japan.  Participants will meet in Tokyo July 18-20, 1989,             to discuss the evolution of plant mating systems and various aspects            of sexual reproduction in plants.  Progress in this field has been              particularly rapid in recent years, largely due to the development of           new enzyme and DNA technologies which facilitate analyses of plant              mating systems and their evolution.                                                                                                                             This research field has traditionally been of interest to geneticists,          evolutionary biologists, systematists, ecologists and plant population          biologists, and this seminar will bring together researchers from all           of these fields.  They will discuss the evolution of sexual and asexual         reproduction; polyploidy and its influence on sexual expression and the         evolution of breeding systems; evolution of inbreeding and outbreeding          of plants; and sex allocation theory and evolution of sexual systems            in plants.  The seminar may be expected to indicate directions for              the rapid progress in research in this area that will be made                   possible by intelligent application of new genetic-engineering                  technologies.",
