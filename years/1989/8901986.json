 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research of John Welch is supported by the Synthetic                        Organic Chemistry Program.  Welch, associate professor of                       chemistry, is studying new ways to make organic compounds that                  contain fluorine.  His approach is characterized by the goal to                 prepare small, simple molecules that contain fluorine that also                 have the unique ability to be readily incorporated into larger,                 more complex molecules.  Welch is also developing methods by                    which chiral fluorine containing molecules can be prepared.                                                                                                     General methods for the diastereo- and enantioselective                         synthesis of monofluorinated materials by using simple,                         inexpensive, achiral monofluorinated compounds will be                          developed.  Asymmetry and functionality are introduced using                    the carbon-carbon bond forming reactions or rearrangements of                   these fluorinated building blocks.  The fundamental utility of                  \u01313,3!-sigmatropic rearrangements of fluorinated ketene acetals                  will be explored.  Novel new chemistry of fluorinated enamines                  will be investigated as means to prepare allyated fluorinated                   ketones.  Organometallic chemistry of chromium fluorinated                      carbene complexes as a means to prepare fluorinated lactams                     will be examined.",
