 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the              subfield of trace analysis.  The thrust of this experimental                    effort is the rational design, synthesis, and characterization of               macrocyclic molecules for use as stationary phases in concentrator              columns with which trace level concentrations of cations and                    anions of interest can be monitored.  Macrocyclic molecules having              high affinities for association with cations of significant value               or concern will be synthesized and attached to silica gel.  Once                attached, the binding constants for a broad range of test cations               will be determined.  Also, the association of anions of interest                with cations bound in these macrocycles will be characterized.                  These systems will be evaluated using potable water samples and                 various acid matrices.                                                                                                                                          There is a need for a device to continuously monitor cations and                anions in the ppb range in the presence of other more concentrated              matrix species.  This need exists in relation to species that are               toxic, valuable, or otherwise of interest.  Such a device is                    needed in municipal water treatment plants, industrial plants, and              other places where these species should be monitored with high                  accuracy and in real time.  Macrocycles interact strongly and                   highly selectively with many species or groups of species of such               interest.  The innovation of this research lies in the ability to               attach these macrocycles and other ligands in a permanent bond to               silica gel while maintaining their solution complexing abilities.               Such materials can then be incorporated in a concentrator column                for use in a continuous analytical procedure.  The feasibility of               the material synthesis and concentration procedure will be shown                in Phase I.  In a subsequent Phase II activity, concentrator                    columns containing these materials will be incorporated into an                 automated analysis system using any one of a number of                          conventional analytical instruments allowing for accurate, real                 time analysis of a wide range of specific cations and anions in                 typical potable water and industrial process and waste streams at               the ppb level.",
