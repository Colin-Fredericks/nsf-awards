 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a 4 year research program to elucidate the mechanism                    of regulation of enzymes controlling photosynthesis.  One                       pivotal mechanism is the cytosolic fructose-2,6-bisphosphate                    system that regulates sucrose synthesis and breakdown in                        leaves.  The objectives are to:  (1) purify and characterize                    at the protein and gene levels newly identified leaf enzymes                    that synthesize and degrade fructose-2,6-bisphosphate; (2)                      determine whether these same activities of nonphotosynthetic                    (sink) tissues containing amyloplasts reside on enzymes                         similar to those of leaves.  In parallel, studies will be                       continued on the chloroplast ferredoxin-thioredoxin system, a                   protein-mediated mechanism that links light to the regulation                   of enzymes functional in photosynthesis and related                             processes.  These studies will (1) deduce the importance of                     catalytically active thiols in the photoregulation of target                    enzymes in isolated chloroplasts and leaves, and (2)                            characterize the remaining poorly understood component of                       this system--the novel enzyme ferredoxin-thioredoxin                            reductase (FTR)--with respect to mechanism of action, crystal                   structure, and EPR/redox properties.                                                                                                                            This research will increase our understanding of how plants                     synthesize and store starch and sucrose, the major reservoirs                   of edible carbohydrate.***",
