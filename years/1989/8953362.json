 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal combines a number of goals and activities which are among         those sought in projects funded under the Private Sector Partnership            program.  It involves industrial scientists, university faculty,                experienced high school teachers as teams of presenters in workshops for        72 precollege teachers. This series of 2-three day workshops extend over        two academic years.  The first year focuses on applications of science          and technology in local industries, and will serve primarily classroom          teachers who will develop materials to use in their classrooms.                                                                                                 In the second year the emphasis will expand to include aspects of               biotechnology, molecular biology in related industries, and the                 participant pool will be expanded to include science coordinators and           science specialists in order to have a broader impact throughout the            participating school districts.                                                                                                                                 From these workshops will come a continuing relationship between                participants and their industrial mentors from the \"focal companies.\"                                                                                           Cost Sharing by the partners will total 170% of the National Science            Foundation grant.",
