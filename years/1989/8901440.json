Bifurcation mechanism of forced emision of solitary                  waves - to determine by analytical and computational efforts,                   the basic mechanism underlying the new phenomena of periodic                    emision of solitons by critical excitations steadily applied to                 a nonlinear dispersive system at resonance.                                                                                                                          (2).  The KdV (Korteweg-de Vries) model with boundary                      forcing - to develop, by computer-aided investigations, the                     theory of initial-boundary-value problems of the KdV equation,                  a new challenging field which is nearly all open. This study                    will explore various inverse transform methods and  asymptotic                  approximation techniques.

Forced three-dimensional nonlinear wave theory - to                   develop efficient numerical methods for evaluating the                          generation, scattering and diffraction of three-dimensional                     nonlinear waves with external forcing at resonance and to                       analyze the criteria of periodic bifurcation of solutions in                    various cases.
