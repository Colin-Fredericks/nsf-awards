 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Lloyd W. Gay of the University of Arizona         to collaborate in research with Professor Inge Dirmhirn of the Institute        of Meteorology, Climatology and Applied Physics, Agricultural University        of Vienna.  The goal of their research is to improve the techniques for         measuring the natural transfer of thermal energy between the surface of         the earth and the atmosphere, and, thereby, to improve our understanding        of the processes that control this transfer of heat.  Part of the               challenge is that techniques which work reasonably well on smooth               landscapes do not provide reliable results over rougher environments            such as forests.  They will evaluate sensible heat flux using three             different methods at two locations that offer contrasting aerodynamic           roughness.  Their research sites will be a uniform, relatively smooth           agricultural site in Arizona, and a rougher oak forest site (the                Hochleitenwald) in Austria, where the Austrians have built an elevated          tower for research on the surface of that 19 meter-high forest.  The            collaborators bring to the research complementary strengths in                  methodology as well, since Dr. Gay is an expert in the Bowen ratio              method and the Austrians are very experienced in eddy correlation; both         groups have experience with aerodynamic models, which is the third              technique they will use.                                                                                                                                        The exchange of momentum, energy and mass between the surface and the           atmosphere is extremely important to a variety of environmental                 phenomena that affect humans.  Efforts to expand our knowledge of               meteorological, hydrological and ecological processes from local to             global scale require improved tools for evaluating these exchanges.             The rather complex Bowen ratio and eddy correlation techniques for              surface exchange are currently the methods of choice.  However,                 interpretation of surface exchange from air and space-based remote              sensors has generated renewed interest in simple, aerodynamic exchange          models, even though early promise of these models did not hold up well          in applications to rougher surfaces.  The proposed experiments, drawing         upon the substantial advances in instrumentation and experimental               techniques of the past decade, will refine our understanding of surface         exchange processes, and provide guidance for application of exchange            models to aerodynamically rough, complex surfaces.",
