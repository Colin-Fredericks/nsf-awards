The specific areas are ill-posed problems,                          isoperimetric inequalities and maximum principles, St. Venant                   and Phragmen-Lindelof problems, stability studies, and                          overdetermined systems.  Among other problems, the principle                    investigator will study the question of convergence of the                      steady flow of a viscous flow in a pipe to fully developed pipe                 flow under relatively arbitrary entry conditions.  He also                      plans to derive St. Venant type results in classical elasticity                 that are meaningful in the neighborhood of the Poisson's ratio                  equal to 1/2.  A third investigation will deal with stability                   studies in a convection problem for a thermomicropolar fluid,                   and still another will attempt to derive an explicit rate of                    convergence of the flow of a micropolar fluid to Navier-Stokes                  flow as the interaction parameter tends to zero.  He will                       continue his attempts to stabilize ill-posed problems against                   errors in geometry (a necessary prerequisite to the numerical                   treatment of such problems), and will apply a new approach to                   the study of overdetermined systems to an assortment of                         problems for which the maximum principle is inapplicable.",
