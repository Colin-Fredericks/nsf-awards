Pignolet of the                      University of Minnesota will investigate the synthesis,                         reactivity and characterization of mixed transition metal-gold                  and silver cluster compounds. Bimetallic alloys of these metals                 are known to be important commercial catalysts. The reactions                   of discrete cluster compounds may be useful as models for alloy                 surfaces and therefore in understanding the fundamental                         reaction mechanisms at the catalytic metal surfaces.                                                                                                            Recent advances in the systematic synthesis of bimetallic                       clusters will be used as a starting point for the formation of                  new trimetallic clusters. Emphasis will be placed on gold and                   silver clusters which also contain platinum or palladium. A                     preliminary procedure which allows a third unligated metal to                   add to the external edge of an existing bimetallic cluster will                 be developed and the resulting complexes will be examined for                   catalytic activity. In addition, a procedure will be developed                  for the attachment of the metal cluster compounds to silica and                 phosphinated polymers, which may have potential use as easily                   recoverable catalysts.",
