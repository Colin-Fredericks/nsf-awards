 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Xia's project will focus on situations in which                  operators on Hilbert space almost satisfy various algebraic                     relationships, where almost means up to perturbation by compact,                trace class, or other suitably small operators. He is                           particularly interested in almost Lie algebras of operators, and                in n-tuples of operators almost satisfying identities of                        Schrodinger type. Formulas explicitly giving the trace of                       operators known in such contexts to be trace class will be                      sought, and powerful generalizations of trace formulas involving                the pairing of cyclic cohomology with K-theory will be explored.                     This is mathematical research in the theory of operators on                Hilbert space. Operators may be thought of as enriched numbers,                 obeying the same laws of arithmetic as ordinary numbers with two                notable exceptions: multiplication of operators depends upon the                order in which the factors are taken, and not every non-zero                    operator has an inverse. For finite-dimensional operators, i.e.                 square matrices of numbers, these phenomena account for the                     richness of the subject of linear algebra. In the infinite-                     dimensional setting of Hilbert space, there is furthermore the                  phenomenon of operators obeying the laws of arithmetic for                      numbers except for error terms that are small in an appropriate                 sense and that contain important information about whatever                     situation gave rise to the operators. In a broad sense, Professor               Xia's project is concerned with how one can extract this                        information efficiently.",
