 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is an extra-nuclear, maternally                  inherited set of genes assumed to be selectively neutral; that                  is, their distribution within populations is subject only to                    chance events, and not to differences in evolutionary fitness                   conferred by these genes.  The goal of this project is to detect                effects, if any, of mitochondrial genes on an organism's                        morphology or nuclear genetic makeup.  This is a first step                     towards understanding how mitochondrial and nuclear gene                        interactions may affect development, and , thus, how mtDNA                      genotypes may be subject to evolution by natural selection.                          Populations of wild trout, known to be hybrids between                     evolutionarily divergent groups, will be studied.  Randomly                     mating hybrid swarms formed from such distinct taxa are rare in                 nature.  They will permit statistical tests for association                     between mtDNA genotype and nuclear genotype, sex, and morphology                (number of vertebrae, fluctuating asymmetry, etc.).                                  Demonstration that mtDNA is subject to natural selection                   would have important implications for the widespread use of mtDNA               as a marker for studies of genetic variation and population                     structure.  Also, wild populations of trout are an important                    natural resource, the integrity of which is seriously threatened                by hybridization with introduced species.  This study will add to               our understanding of the dynamics of interspecies hybridization                 in salmonid fishes.",
