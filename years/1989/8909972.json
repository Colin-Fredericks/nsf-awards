 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will investigate scheduling control problems of                   queueing networks that arise in production systems, and computer                and communication networks.  Despite much attention, a systematic               approach to the scheduling control of general structured networks               is not available.  The investigator should solve the scheduling                 control problems by using a simple and highly aggregated model,                 namely, a fluid model.  The viewpoint taken is that the simple                  model often provides the insight to the complicated problem, the                solution to practical problems, and the basis for studying more                 complicated models.  Recent work has shown that the fluid model                 approach can reduce a scheduling control problem to solving a set               of linear programming problems, and in some cases the solution                  when properly interpreted can be optimal for the queueing system.               Research will be performed in four steps: (1) modeling queueing                 system by fluid model, (2) solving the scheduling control problem               of the fluid model, (3) interpreting the solution into the                      control rule for the original queueing system, and (4) testing                  the solution by simulation.",
