 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops the Multigrid Machine (MGM), a highly parallel            VLSI architecture for the solution of partial differential equations            (PDEs) using the multigrid methods.  The mutigrid methods are one of            the most efficient solution methods for PDEs and are inherently                 parallel.  The MGM is developed using the super-copresser methodology,          which has been applied to realize special-purpose VLSI architectures            for sorting, matrix multiplication, and the solution of PDEs using              finite difference methods.  The MGM is a synchronous architecture               highly suited for VLSI implementation and is able to solve problems of          arbitrary dimensions.                                                                                                                                           The MGM developed with cost-effective supercomputer performance will            influence many domains which require high-speed solution of PDEs.  Its          development will allow new knowledge to be gained in the use of                 synchronous parallel arrays to implement asynchronous iterative                 algorithms and the design of new parallel multigrid algorithms for VLSI         implementation.  The flexible software emulator and timing model for            the MGM will be useful for studying many other domains in which multi-          level algorithms are effective.",
