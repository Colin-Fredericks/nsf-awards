 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern techniques of stable isotope analysis produce routine               high precision analysis of bulk samples, but few studies have                   successfully determined isotopic ratios with spatial resolution                 below 5000 pm for silicates or 500 pm for carbonates.  Recent                   developments in laser and ion microprobe techniques allow                       analysis at the scale of 0.1-50 pm (+ 1 %) and refinements hold                 promise of precision of + 0.2%.  Theoretical considerations and                 preliminary analytical results predict that sub-millimeter                      isotopic zonation will be found in many rocks and that analysis                 of zoning patterns will provide important new evidence regarding                fluid migration, recrystallization and diffusion.                                    I propose to use laser microprobe and ion microprobe                       techniques to study micron-scale zoning in high grade                           metamorphic rocks.  The recently completed (Aug, 1988) laser                    microprobe system at the University of Wisconsin will provide                   relatively rapid analysis of samples for O, C, and S isotope                    ratio at 30-50 pm spatial resolution.  I propose to spend my                    sabbatical (1989-90) using the newly installed (Jan, 1988)                      Cameca ims/4f ion microprobe at the University of Edinburgh for                 detailed oxygen and carbon analysis at 0.1-1.0 pm resolution.                   The principal rocks and to elucidate the causes of such                         heterogeneity.   Samples have been chosen so as to restrict                     theories of fluid migration in the deep crust, granulite genesis,               and cooling/uplift rates.",
