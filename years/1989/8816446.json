Y. Tien of the                      University of Michigan the investigators will study the                         microstructure of silicon nitride ceramics.  Silicon nitride                    ceramics are considered important materials for high                            temperature, chemical and mechanical engineering systems.                       The investigators will study the relationship of silicon                        nitride powders to the development of improved heat and                         shock resistent ceramics. The U.S. investigator will prepare                    samples and measure mechanical properties; the Yugoslav                         investigator will carry out experiments on structural                           characteristics.                                                                                                                                                This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board                      on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported                       through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions                       from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia.                       The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department                    of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to                       the principal scientific institute in Yugoslavia, but                           include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia                    and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
