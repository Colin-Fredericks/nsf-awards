 "awd_abstract_narration": "High resolution scanned images are difficult to work with for several           reasons:  they require large amounts of storage and bandwidth, they are         prone to aliasing artifacts when scaled or rotated, and operators               cannot work directly and naturally on the objects depicted in the               scene.  We propose decomposing an image into 'surface patches' where            each patch is described by an algebraic intensity function and a                mathematical contour description.  These patches will tend to                   correspond with objects in the scene, and are a compact and resolution          independent representation of the image.                                                                                                                        The proposed work will investigate the feasibility of developing and            implementing an algorithm to perform raster to object (image surface            patch) conversion using present day or near future hardware technology.         This will be done by conducting studies to characterize the image               intensity functions and contours in a sample set of pictures.                   Candidate algorithms will be examined and promising ones prototyped to          determine their potential for high fidelity image reconstruction and            image compression.",
