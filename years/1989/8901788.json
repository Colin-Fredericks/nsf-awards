 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is in the general area of analytical and surface                  chemistry and in the subfields of atomic spectroscopy and mass                  spectroscopy. The goal of this research is to develop and                       evaluate radio frequency (RF) powered glow discharge as an                      atomization/excitation/ionization source for direct solids                      elemental analysis. This approach in combination with mass                      spectrometric and atomic emission detection should allow for                    direct analysis of insulating materials such as glasses and                     ceramics. This research focuses on examining the analytical                     utility of this approach, particularly for the analysis of                      insulating materials.                                                                                                                                           This research involves the use of a new method of direct solid                  analysis. A new type of sampling source, which is modulated at                  radio frequency, is to be used for direct sampling. This                        research should provide a new and improved approach to the                      analysis of materials such as glasses and ceramics.",
