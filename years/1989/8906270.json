 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hispanics comprise the second largest minority ethnic group                     in this country and the fastest growing. The 1980 was the                       first U.S. census to explicitly track Hispanic individuals                      and families as such, distinguishing the largely white                          Hispanics from non-Hispanic whites. Yet Hispanics remain the                    most important ethnic group not now covered by longitudinal                     surveys capable of following the same individuals and                           families over three or more calendar years. A major cost                        posing obstacles to this development is that of drawing the                     initial sample. This proposal would take advantage of a                         sample of 2000 Hispanic respondents, recently drawn and                         currently being surveyed about their political participation,                   by adding follow-up surveys of the same sample in successive                    years to the current and influential Panel Study of Income                      Dynamics. Intergenerational and intragenerational social                        mobility, labor force participation and unemployment,                           movement into and out of poverty, usage of welfare, and the                     changing demographics of the Hispanic population are among                      the subjects that can now be studied over time with this                        sample.",
