The goal of the project is the synthesis of iron compounds                      which bind and carry atmospheric oxygen without being destroyed                 by reaction with the oxygen. Such compounds are important as                    models of the proteins which transport oxygen, such as                          hemoglobin and myoglobin, and also for possible practical use                   in the separation and storage of oxygen.                                                                                                                        Totally synthetic substances will be designed which reproduce                   the functions of heme proteins. Emphasis will be on modeling                    those heme proteins which form iron-dioxygen adducts as they                    function. Ongoing studies have yielded rare examples of                         iron-based dioxygen carriers that do not utilize the porphyrin                  ligand, and structural refinements have yielded examples that                   are fully functional under ambient conditions. Further studies                  are expected to generalize the structural principles that have                  evolved and lead to predictive control over oxygen affinities.                  Kinetic and mechanistic studies will provide insight into the                   fundamental processes of binding and dissociation of oxygen and                 the autoxidation of iron oxygen carriers.",
