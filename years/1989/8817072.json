 "awd_abstract_narration": "Specific sequences of DNA which can move within the genome have                 been identified in bacteria and eukaryotes.  These transposable                 DNA elements not only move themselves but also facilitate a                     variety of spontaneous mutations which can alter the structural                 organization and often the expression of a cell's genetic                       information.  While the resulting genetic diversity may prove                   beneficial in an evolutionary sense, some transposon-induced                    mutations may be quite detrimental as when oncogenes are                        activated and cells become transformed to a neoplastic state.                   Among the simplest transposable elements are the bacterial                      insertion sequences (IS elements).  This laboratory will focus                  studies on one such element, IS2, which is present in the                       chromosome of Escherichia coli K-12 but absent from E. coli C.                  IS2 can transpose to new sites causing either decreased or                      increased expression of genes adjacent to the newly inserted IS2                element.  Our studies have identified two regions within IS2 that               encode factors required for, or regulating, both transposition                  and excision of IS2.  These results suggest that IS2 may                        transpose by a conservative mechanism involving excision (with                  survival of the donor \"chromosome\") and reintegration of IS2 at a               new genetic locus.  We will focus our studies on testing this                   hypothesis: to identify the presumptive protein products and the                role for each in IS2 excision and/or transposition.  In addition                we will examine how the relative level of expression of the IS2                 encoded proteins may be regulated at transcriptional or                         translational levels.",
