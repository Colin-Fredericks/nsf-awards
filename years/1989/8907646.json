 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terrorism is the premeditated, threatened or actual use of force                or violence to attain a political goal through fear, coercion, or               intimidation.  By deliberately choosing victims at random,                      terrorists seek to create an atmosphere of fear, in which                       everyone feels at risk.  The problem of terrorism shows no sign                 of abating.  The U.S. Department of State recorded 477                          transnational events in 1982; 485 in 1983; 598 in 1984; 785 in                  1985; 774 in 1986; and 832 in 1987.  During the first six months                of 1988, 515 international events took place.                                                                                                                   The objective of this project is to use methodologies drawn from                game theory, bargaining theory, and dynamic programming to                      analyze the plausibility and optimality of the never-to-negotiate               strategy of precommitment, adopted by many modern-day governments               to deal with hostage-taking terrorist incidents.  The project                   also employs these techniques to identify successful negotiation                strategies between sovereign governments when they seek to form                 terrorist-thwarting agreements.  In addition, the project                       investigates the efficacy of pre-emptive and retaliatory                        strikes, frequently mentioned as an effective means for                         inhibiting terrorism.  Interrupted time series analysis is                      applied to a 1968-1987 data set of terrorist incidents to examine               the efficiency of retaliatory strikes, diplomatic agreements, and               technological devices in curbing terrorism.  Other empirical                    procedures, e..g, time-to-failure regressions, Tobit, logit,                    etc., are employed to study the determinants behind the                         resolution of a hostage-taking crisis.  The project also analyzes               the best government response when terrorists can choose the                     country to stage their incidents.  In particular, the project                   examines the governments' choice of deterrence expenditures as                  well as other choice variables when the location of the attack is               uncertain.                                                                                                                                                      This project should be supported because it develops new                        theoretical tools for studying terrorism and the empirical                      research should provide new evidence about the efficacy of                      different ways of dealing with terrorists.",
