 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is focused on the study of recombinant                    cell kinetics and protein production in both free and                           immobilized cell bioreactor systems.  Building on previous                      work on lac gene expression, a Bacillus subtilis strain has                     been chosen with a plasmid for constitutive expression of a-                    amylase.  The plasmid, pBD214, contains both the structural                     gene and the promoter and signal sequences for enzyme                           secretion.  Experimental design and data gathering procedures                   are integrated with mathematical modeling aspects to uncover                    a unified picture of gene expression in recombinant cells in                    prototypical bioreactors.                                                                                                                                       Development of products from the new biotechnology will                         require efficient bioreactors and an understanding of the                       kinetics in these reactors.  The kinetics of cell growth,                       plasmid replication and shedding and gene expression are                        complex and highly coupled processes.  Given the state-of-                      the-art, it is necessary to examine recombinant cell kinetics                   in different bioreactor systems to decide optimization of                       cell growth and product formation in a given process.                           Accurate, unified models would guide and accelerate process                     development in numerous cases but such models are currently                     lacking in the field.  This work addresses such limitations.",
