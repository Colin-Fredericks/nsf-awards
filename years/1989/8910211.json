 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal develops an empirically-based approach to                         understanding differences between risk perceptions and risk                     attitudes.  The distinction is important to understanding                       decision making because little is known about the measures                      used by individuals to assess the riskiness of options and                      the criteria used to select between objective measures (e.g.,                   the variance of the alternatives) and subjective measures                       that may be more relevant for personal decision making.  The                    proposed study will employ a series of experiments to first                     refine a general model of risk attitudes and then to test                       this model on two real-world situations, financial markets                      and medical diagnoses.  Pilot data, discussed in the                            proposal, suggest that knowing more about individuals' risk                     perceptions may provide substantial support for understanding                   their general risk attitudes. The proposed studies extend                       earlier work of the investigator and should provide important                   insights for a large body of work that focuses on the effect                    of perceptions of riskiness on both decision processes (e.g.,                   information search and acquisition) and behavior (e.g.,                         individual choice).",
