 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to accumulate more knowledge                leading to a better understanding of the structure of bounded                   linear operators acting on a complex Hilbert space of infinite                  dimension. In the past ten years much progress has been made in                 this direction by employing the concept of the dual algebra                     generated by a single operator. Professor Pearcy and others have                made an extensive analysis of the predual of such a dual algebra,               and this has led to considerable progress on the dilation theory                of contraction operators, and on the invariant subspace problem.                Professor Pearcy plans to continue this program of mathematical                 research, focusing now on the the class of contraction operators                having spectral radius one.                                                          The kind of mathematics to be pursued here is operator                     theory. Operators may be thought of, very roughly, as enriched                  (real or complex) numbers. One can do arithmetic with operators                 just as with numbers, except that multiplication of operators                   depends in general on the order in which the factors are taken,                 and not every non-zero operator has an inverse. Furthermore,                    numbers are inherently one-dimensional, whereas operators                       generally act on an infinite-dimensional space. The notion that                 physical quantities are more realistically represented by                       operators than by numbers lies at the heart of quantum mechanics,               a subject whose development provided much of the original impetus               to operator theory.",
