 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in video imaging technology in the medical sciences have led           to the wide-spread use of computed tomography (CT) scanners, magnetic           resonance (MR) imaging, ultrasound imaging, and chest radiography.              However, similar broad-based progress in video imaging technology for           optical microscopy has not occurred, partly because the high                    resolution color images of ordinary microscopes cannot be easily                duplicated by ordinary video means.  The objective of this research is          to show the feasibility of an advanced-concept, three-color video               microscope suitable for both routine analysis and research                      applications.  Features will include real-time, three-color video               images, instantaneous zoom, very low illumination power, selective              contrast enhancement, and highly linear densitometry.  Data resolution          matches the diffraction limit of the optics over a wide range of                magnification.  Operation in a confocal mode will also be possible.             The instrument would be valuable in many areas of medical and                   industrial analysis that currently use optical microscopes--including           hematology, cytology, pathology, textiles, and microelectronics.",
