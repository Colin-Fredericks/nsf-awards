 "awd_abstract_narration": "the (18th) Hampshire College Summer Studies in Mathematics will                 actively engage 68 talented and high motivated high school students and         9 faculty in the creation of a lively, rigorous environment in which            mathematics is created, shared, and enjoyed.                                                                                                                    Faculty and students will live together, eat together, and work together        in small workshops, classes, and problem seminars (which meet for 37            hours each week).  Participants will receive personal mathematical and          career guidance on a daily basis, and will cone to see themselves as            full members of a productive mathematical community.                                                                                                            Challenging problems, significant and active branches of mathematics,           and substantial applications from outside the usual secondary and               college curricula will be intensively investigated, but emphasis will be        placed on the methods of discovery and proof.  Visiting mathematicians          and users of mathematics, computer labs, films, and other activities are        designed to enhance participant's understanding of the nature of                mathematics, the range of its influence, and the opportunities open to          those who do it.",
