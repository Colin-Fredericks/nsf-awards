 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will examine the ecological and evolutionary                  consequences of a microorganism that affects reproductive                       incompatibility in its flour beetle host, Tribolium confusum.                   Males infected with this particular microorganism cannot produce                progeny when mated with females that are not infected.  The                     microorganism is transmitted from mothers to their offspring.  If               the microorganism is introduced into an uninfected population, in               the absence of sufficient negative effects on its host, it is                   expected to spread through the population.  Dr. Stevens will                    examine how the reproductive incompatibility affects host                       fitness, sperm utilization, and sperm competition.  She will also               determine if there is variation in sensitivity of the cytoplasmic               factor to curing by high temperature.  This research is important               to basic scientific research because it will shed light on how                  interactions among such infective microorganism and their host                  are important in the process of evolution.  The results may also                have potential applications in pest management; the flour beetle                itself is a major stored products pest.",
