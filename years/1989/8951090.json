 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physics department at Wells College will buy Data Acquisition               Instrumentation for acoustic Spectrum Analysis.  The equipment will be          used primarily in an undergraduate interdisciplinary course in musical          acoustics, for laboratory demonstration instruction in harmonic                 analysis of sound.  Other uses include undergraduate research in                harmonic analysis of musical instruments, in conjunction with the Music         department; demonstration and lab work in microprocessor interfacing            and experiment control, in conjunction with the Computer Science                department; and demonstration of principles of the physics of signals           and waves, and the Fourier transform, in mainstream introductory                Physics courses.                                                                                                                                                The instrumentation is IBM PC-based, and so is versatile, reasonably            priced, and representative of current technology.                                                                                                               The University will contribute an amount equal to the award.",
