 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Biological Sciences, University of                          Minnesota, proposes an eight week High School Summer                            Science Research Program.  The program is designed for                          twenty high ability, high achieving students, grade 11.                              Each student will select a faculty mentor and the                          majority of the student experience will occur in the                            process of pursuing a research topic within the problem                         area being investigated by that research team.  However,                        all students will attend seminars dealing with scientific                       methodology, ethical issues in  science, philosophy of                          science, and careers in science.  In addition, they will                        be participating in a program of lab safety.                                         The students are expected to assume responsibility for                                                                                                     a full work week of forty hours, accepting the demands                          placed on a regular member of a research laboratory team.                       The academic load is rigorous with considerable background                      reading required by the individual mentors.  Evidence of                        progress in the lab issurveyed in the student seminar at                        the midpoint of the program and the final results of the                        project is displayed and discussed at an end-of-term                            symposium.",
