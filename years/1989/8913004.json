The major goal of this series of                                         conferences is to integrate what is known                                       about technological risk assessment with                                        social risk acceptance within a common set of                                   multiobjective water resources planning                                         problems, among them, coping with floods and                                    droughts.  Another goal is to determine what                                    the topics are which need further                                               investigation.  The main themes to be                                           addressed during this conference are:  1) the                                   difference between risk analysis conducted as                                   part of planning and that of engineering                                        reliability analysis during design; 2) the                                      issues facing the engineering profession                                        related to risk analysis and legal liability,                                   the use of engineering design standards, and                                    the overall usefulness of risk analysis to                                      decisionmaking; and 3) the usefulness of case                                   studies and practical examples of risk                                          analysis application to water resources                                         engineering problems.",
