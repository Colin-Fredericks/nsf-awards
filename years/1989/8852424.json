 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently our undergraduate Unit Operations Laboratory                          successfully demonstrates the principles of heat transfer in                    tubular heat exchangers, momentum transfer in fluid flow through                pipes, fittings and beds of solids, mass transfer in distillation               and solvent extraction, and reaction kinetics in integral and                   well-mixed reactors.  The deficiency is that have an experiment                 which is capable of demonstrating several principles at once is                 not available.  This laboratory improvement program is intended to              remove that deficiency by allowing the study of heat, mass, and                 momentum transfer simultaneously in a highly-instrumented agitated              vessel.  The vessel is to be 60 gallons in volume, and be                       instrumented to allow determination of heat transfer coefficients               between the jacket and fluid, momentum transfer between the                     impeller and the fluid, and mass transfer rates of oxygen in and                out of solution.  The simultaneous effects of gas sparging, liquid              viscosity, and liquid temperature on heat, mass and momentum                    transport rates will be studied.",
