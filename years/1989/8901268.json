 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work will be done on mathematical problems arising in the                  field of several complex variables and certain partial                          differential equations which occur naturally in this context.  In               all, five areas will be treated.  The first concerns a reflection               principle analogous to the classical one.  One is given a                       holomorphic mapping defined on one side of a surface within the                 space of several complex variables and would like to extend the                 map across the surface to a full neighborhood.  Recent results in               two complex dimensions completely resolve the question for non-                 Levi-flat hypersurfaces. This condition is not sufficient in                    higher dimensions and efforts will be made to find the additional               conditions necessary on the surface to ensure the reflection                    principle.                                                                           A second line of investigation concerns properties of                      holomorphic mappings between hypersurfaces which are related by                 means of a holomorphic map from one into the other.  Two main                   questions to be addressed concern conditions in which the map is                essentially finite and the determination of conditions under                    which one can decide whether one given hypersurface can be                      holomorphically mapped into another (in some nonsingular                        fashion).                                                                            Work will also be done on holomorphic extensions of                        functions defined on generic manifolds or, equivalently: can one                identify restrictions of holomorphic functions along sector of                  the boundary of a domain, for example, when the domain is a wedge               and the boundary is the edge of that wedge?                                          It is known that under certain restrictive conditions                      CR-mappings between pseudoconvex smooth hypersurfaces which are                 diffeomorphisms are actually infinitely differentiable.  Work is                continuing in an effort to obtain smoothness information on such                mappings under the weakest possible conditions, both on the                     manifolds and                                                                   the mappings.  Considerable progress has been made during the                   past year in this regard.                                                            The final theme of this research concerns a boundary                       analogue to the well-known result that a holomorphic function                   which vanishes to infinite order at an interior point of a domain               vanishes throughout the connected component of the point.  This                 need not be the case at a boundary point, although the same                     phenomenon obtains at boundary points for a large class of                      functions.  It will be one objective of this project to determine               precise conditions where this property of \"unique continuation\"                 can occur.",
