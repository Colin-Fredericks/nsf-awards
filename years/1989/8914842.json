 "awd_abstract_narration": "The secure, reliable, and economic operation of the national electric           power systems is of great importance to the national economy.                   Increasing power systems complexity, coupled with the need to reduce            production costs, results in escalation of complexity of the problems           facing the power industry.  Consequently, it is necessary to                    continuously reevaluate present methods in operations and planning,             and to define research needs in order to pave the way for the                   innovative approaches required by the increasingly challenging                  problems.                                                                                                                                                       The scope of this workshop is to bring together researchers in Power            Systems Operations and Planning and to provide a forum for discussions          of research needs.  It is expected that the workshop will define                present state of the art and research needs.",
