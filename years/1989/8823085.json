 "awd_abstract_narration": "The adrenal medulla is involved in the control of cardiovascular                functions, especially during stress reactions.  Epinephrine and                 norepinephrine are the hormones by which it exerts these effects.  This         picture has changed drastically with the discovery of adrenomedullary           peptide hormones, called enkephalins, that act like opiates when given          via injections.  The function(s) of these hormones, when released by            the adrenal, are unknown though it has been speculated that they have           euphoric and analgesic effects.  However, being peptides, these                 enkephalins do not have access to several regions of the central                nervous system (because of the presence of a blood-brain barrier).  To          make matters more confusing, it is now clear that even true opiates,            codeine and morphine, are produced by the adrenal gland.  These true            opiates have access to many regions of the central nervous system.              Obviously, an understanding of the interactions of these three                  different types of substances, which seem to be released simultaneously         during stress, is of utmost importance for basic scientific and                 potentially therapeutic reasons.  Unfortunately, mammals have rather            low levels of circulating opiates, and are therefore only of limited            value for pertinent research.  However, the American eel is an ideal            model for work on plasma opiates.  Its adrenal medulla equivalent               contains high concentrations of all three types of hormones, and it can         be studied easily in vivo and in vitro.  In addition, the plasma levels         of codeine and morphine are several times higher than in mammals.               Furthermore, the eel is much hardier under experimental conditions than         warm-blooded animals, and its central nervous system is much easier to          study than that of the latter.  In this proposal the eel is employed            because this species has unique features for research on the functions          and interactions of the three types of secretions of the adrenal                medulla.                                                                                                                                                        Experimental approaches include:(a) measurement of hormone release in           vivo and in vitro; (b) analysis of the possible physiological effects           of enkephalins and opiates on cardiac, respiratory, osmoregulatory,             metabolic and endocrine functions, and on agonistic behavior.  These            studies should (1) help to clarify the functions of the chromaffin              secretory cocktail, particularly during stress responses; (2) help to           understand pathologies related to the chromaffin cell; and (3) provide          basic insights for the understanding of the chromaffin cell system of           the human embryo/fetus, which is similar to that of Anguilla rostrata.",
