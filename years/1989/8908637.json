 "awd_abstract_narration": "Myelin is a fatty substance found in the brain where it is                      closely associated  with the axons of neurons.  The function of                 myelin is to speed up and facilitate the conduction of the                      electrical current generated by neurons.  Normal function of the                nervous system depends upon adequate myelination.  This statement               is based upon the many human diseases associated with inadequate                myelination.  A conference under the auspices of the New York                   Academy of Sciences has been planned to bring together                          investigators studying the cellular and molecular aspects of                    myelination.  The major focus of the meeting will be the myelin                 mutants, since they have provided new insights into the normal                  developmental process of myelin formation.  These mutants are                   mammals ranging from rodents to canines, and some of them can be                considered models for certain human leukodystrophies.  Within the               last five years the genes for the major myelin proteins have been               cloned and sequenced, and the genetic basis for several of the                  myelin mutants has been identified.  Modern cellular technologies               have helped to identify the sequence of events leading to normal                and/or abnormal myelination. It is now possible to trace the                    pathway from an identified genetic defect to its cellular                       expression in the nervous system.  The intent of this conference                is to integrate the information obtained from molecular and                     cellular studies about myelination into a coherent model, to                    identify the gaps in our understanding of this process and to                   plot future directions of research in the area of                               myelinogenesis.",
