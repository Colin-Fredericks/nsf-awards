 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed research will construct a valuable data set of annual             national indicators of political democracy across nations; and using            statistical modeling methods considered 'state-of-the-art' in                   sociology, it will analyze the degree to which systematic bias and              random 'noise' are present in the various measures, attempt to                  undercover the sources of systematic bias (e.g., political influence of         the country, or perhaps its size) and then correct the original data            for such bias. Advances toward a more adequate measurement of political         democracy across very different nations that are promised by this work          would benefit theoretically grounded studies of the relationship                between democratization and economic and social inequality, as well as          economic growth and development. The same advances would set important          measurement standards and enhance the very substance of human rights            determinations currently mandated as a condition of continuing or               renewing both foreign aid and trade relationships. The PI is a                  sociologist well known both for his previous contributions to work in           this area and for his statistical and methodological skills with the            methods to be used.",
