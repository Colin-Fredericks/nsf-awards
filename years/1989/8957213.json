Kevrekidis under the National Science Foundation's                              Presidential Young Investigator Awards program.                                                                                                                 Dr. Kevrekidis' research is centered around the study of the                    dynamic behavior of physicochemical and engineering processes.                  His work is focused on the development, implementation and                      exploitation of computational tools at a realistic modeling                     level.  Specifically, his work is in two areas:                                      (1) Nonlinear dynamic behavior and control of lumped                            reacting systems--In this area his work is aimed at                             obtaining a better fundamental understanding of the                             nature of non-steady-state behavior in reacting systems,                        the development of methods for the systematic detection                         of transitions, and the characterization and analysis of                        fully developed time-dependent dynamics.                                        (2) Instabilities, transitions, patterns and complex                            dynamics in transport processes--In this area he is                             concentrating on the systematic study of low dimensional                        (not fully turbulent) dynamic behavior in a class of                            reaction/flow problems described by partial differential                        equations.                                                                 His long term goal is to use the computer to do fundamental                     modeling of physical and chemical processes, analyze, and                       ultimately design them based on this modeling.",
