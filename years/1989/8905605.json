 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed that the PI be Kenneth Poeppelmeier (Northwestern)               and an executive committee consisting of J. M. Honig (Purdue),                  Jeremy Burdett (Chicago), Robert McCarley (Iowa State) have the                 major responsibility of administering the grant.  The funds from                this grant would be made available to cover travel and living                   expenses of student and faculty participants during the entire                  period of the program, and travel and subsistence for scientists                chosen as lecturers during the first week of the program.  Funds                also would provide for travel of all student and faculty                        participants to return to Northwestern at the end of the summer                 period, when each participant can present a report on the results               of his or her project in a symposium format.  This symposium                    would be held over two day period, and would be vital in                        furthering the participant's overview of the program, their                     ability to organize and report research results, and to impart a                professional orientation to further work in the field of solid                  state chemistry.",
