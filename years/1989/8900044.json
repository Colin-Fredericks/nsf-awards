The title of the                symposium is Genetics of Pattern Formation and Growth Control.                  Topics will include; the establishment of polarity, the                         involvement of growth hormones and oncogenes in early                           development, and the genetic control of lineage determination,                  among others.                                                                   %%%                                                                             There has been enormous progress recently in understanding                      genetic mechanisms active in controlling pattern formation during               embryonic development. This meeting brings together researchers                 working in a wide variety of organisms that have been at the                    forefront of this progress. The speakers have also been chosen as               those able to present this work to the somewhat more general                    audience of developmental biologists that attend this meeting. It               therefore serves a valuable educational purpose for the field.",
