They                   also cooperate in the search for food, communicating their funds                to tentmates via chemical trails.  Their social organization                    both the question of how this cooperative system evolved the                    eastern tent caterpillar is the only non-eusocial insect known to               employ a complex chemical communication system for corperative                  foraging the origin of which poses some problems for classical                  selection theory based on individual fitness.                                        Taking advantage of the ease with which colonies can be                    sampled in the field and studied in the laboratory, genetic                     relationships between and within colonies and behavioral                        preferences of individual caterpillars for tentmates and tents                  will be measure.  The patterns observed should some light on the                likely made of evolution of the eastern tent caterpillar social                 system.",
