 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamical heat transports by mid-latitude, baroclinically                  unstable waves interact with a variety of physical processes to                 control the climatic state.  Classical instability analyses and                 numerous case studies of storm evolution indicate an essential                  contribution by latent heat release to the development of                       baroclinic waves.  In addition, the transport of latent heat                    associated with transient baroclinic eddies is known to have a                  significant effect on climatic balances of heat, momentum and                   moisture.  Previous studies of moist baroclinically unstable                    waves from a climatic perspective have been limited to a few                    cases where only the aggregate effect of a spectrum of waves                    have been simulated.                                                                                                                                                 This research will investigate the effects of moisture                     condensation on the life cycles of baroclinically unstable waves                using a spherical, primitive equations model.  The study will                   emphasize the mechanisms that affect the dynamics of climate,                   filling the gap between studies of individual storms and studies                of the hydrological cycle in general circulation models.  It will               seek insight into the climatology of eddy flux structure, its                   interaction with the zonal mean state and the influence of                      surface fluxes.  Because it emphasizes climatic processes, the                  study will concentrate on synoptic and planetary-scale waves,                   which emerge with the largest amplitudes when a spectrum of waves               are perturbed in baroclinically unstable flow.                                                                                                                       This research is important because it should improve our                   understanding of interactions between atmospheric circulation and               the hydrological cycle.",
