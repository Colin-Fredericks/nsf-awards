 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research                           project in polymer materials between Radivoje Vukovic of INA                    Research and Development in Zagreb and Frank Karasz of the                      University of Massachusetts, the investigators will continue                    to study the relationship between polymer miscibility (the                      capacity to blend and combine) and chemical structure.                          Polymers and new copolymers prepared by the Yugoslav group                      will be analyzed for structure and those properties which                       promote blending and compatibility.  The goal of the project                    is to develop new and improved polymer blends.  This is an                      excellent international match.  The Yugoslav group, highly                      experienced in polymer synthesis, will prepare the new                          copolymers while the U.S. group will analyze its properties                     and characteristics.                                                                                                                                            This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board                      on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported                       through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions                       from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia.                       The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department                    of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to                       the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia, but                         include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia                    and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
