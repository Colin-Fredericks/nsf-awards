 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Project Jason Museum Network, comprising a group of some 10 science         museums throughout the United States and represented in this proposal by        the Franklin Institute, requests partial support of a major experiment          in the use of electronic field trips organized by Dr. Robert Ballard and        associates at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.  Over a two week          period in May 1989, a series of satellite television transmissions will         provide more than 150,000 students at some dozen museums with live, two         way interactive TV coverage of a significant underwater archaeological          expedition in the central Mediterranean Sea carried out by Dr. Ballard's        group.                                                                                                                                                          The research expedition will be widely publicized, with public interest         and attention similar to that obtained during his explorations of the           Titanic.  A variety of  archaelological, oceanographic, and                     technological programs will be provided to museums through a Project            Jason Satellite Network established for the purpose; participating              schools, teachers and school children will already be familiar with the         project and its methods through curriculum materials developed by NSTA          with support from NSF's Instructional Materials Development program.                                                                                            An extensive evaluation program will accompany the first year's effort,         and the Network plans to continue providing material from Project Jason         for several additional years.  In addition, other forms of distance             learning will be investigated and developed using the infrastructure            developed for Project Jason.  Overall, more than a million individuals          will view programs provided by the network in live presentations or             later videotapes.  Direct cost sharing by the Network Members is more           than $3 million, with similar amounts contributed by Dr. Ballard's group        at Woods Hole.",
