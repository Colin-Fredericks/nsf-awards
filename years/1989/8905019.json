 "awd_abstract_narration": "In aquatic crabs, maintenance of salt balance and excretion of waste in         the form of ammonia, are performed by the gills.  For those crabs which         have taken to living on land, it was assumed that the gills could not           serve these functions.  Previously it was shown that, although no longer        swimming in fluids, land crabs are able to provide sufficient salty             water to the gill surface, in the form of their own urine, to allow             excellent regulation of salt concentration, a prerequisite for life in a        variable habitat.  Besides salt balance, nitrogen excretion presents a          hurdle to successful colonization of land.  Proposed research examines          whether urine recycling also promotes excretion of nitrogen wastes by           the gill.  The amount and form of nitrogen excreted by the possible             routes--urine, feces, fluid in the gill chamber, stored internally as           uric acid, and air will be measured to locate the routes used by crabs          to get rid of nitrogenous wastes.  The amount and salinity of the water         available to the animals will be varied, since this appears to affect           the amount and form of the wastes released.  A backpack has been                developed which allows the collection of urine directly from its point          of release and substitution for urine solutions of known composition.           The composition of urine under different conditions of salt and water           availability will be studied, and carbon dioxide and ammonia levels             measured in the natural habitat.  The ability of the gills to reclaim           salts and excrete wastes under the changing environmental conditions            will also be examined.                                                                                                                                          This research will contribute to a basic understanding of the physiology        of land crabs, and their ability to adapt an essentially aquatic body           plan and physiology to a terrestrial environment.  In addition, land            crabs are economically important in the Caribbean.  They grow slowly and        are subject to local extinction from overharvesting.  Low nitrogen              levels in the plant diet limit growth rates.  The current research will         result in a better understanding of the nitrogen budget of the crabs,           information which is vital to the success of proposed crab farming.",
