 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from Rice University, in collaboration with the                   California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Argonne National                  Laboratory, and Los Alamos National Laboratory requests funds to                establish a Science and Technology Center for Research on                       Parallel Computation.  The Director of the Center will be                       Professor Ken Kennedy of Rice University.                                                                                                                       The principal goal of the Center will be to make parallel                       computing systems easier to use.  To achieve this goal, the                     Center will attack this problem on many levels by taking                        advantage of the unique skills of individuals from each of the                  participating institutions.  The complementary areas that will be               brought to bear on all aspects of use/application of parallel                   systems are computer architecture, programming systems,                         computational mathematics, and scientific applications.                                                                                                         In particular, the Center will attack the problem of parallel                   programming at all levels:  application, algorithm, compiler, and               machine.  Experience must be gained in parallel programming by                  designing and building new application programs that solve                      important scientific and engineering problems on parallel                       machines.  New, inherently parallel algorithms must be developed                for the fundamental problems of computational mathematics.                      Programming systems must be developed that permit the computer                  user to solve problems at a high level of abstraction without                   compromising efficiency by involvement of the scientist in the                  architectural details of the system.  Finally the technological                 base in parallel architectures must be continued by engineering                 shrewd compromises between designs that make use of the                         underlying components, designs that simplify the task of                        generating efficient code, and the algorithms that are                          incorporated within them.  This effort will involve researchers                 and scientists from many different areas resulting in the cross-                fertilization of all involved in this truly multidisciplinary                   Center.",
