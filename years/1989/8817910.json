 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dams and their attendant reservoirs are built for various                  purposes, including flood control, power generation, water                      storage, navigation, etc., all of which involve the operation of                the dam.  Decisions about operations accompany the existence of                 dams.  In this regard, reservoirs are essentially different from                natural lakes, however, phenomena similar to natural lakes occur                in them.  The degree to which these phenomena are significantly                 influenced by the riverine character of reservoirs is significant               and, therefore, of limnological interest.                                            Changes in operations which might carry additional benefits                are now being addressed more seriously as the limits of dam                     construction are approached, as water quality issues become of                  higher priority and as demography, economics and law alter the                  legal standing of water users.                                                       Thus, the influence of dam operations on the reservoirs                    themselves and on downstream reaches of the impounded river                     unavoidably links the basic (science) and the applied                           (management).                                                                        A workshop is proposed which will focus on reservoir science               with interactions among several disciplines interested in aquatic               ecosystems.  These include:  (1) the physics based modelers, (2)                the biology based modelers, (3) empirical earth scientists                      (geochemistry, ecology, hydrology), and (4) experimental                        ecologists.  A draft of the proceedings of this meeting will                    document the status of the science and identify gaps in                         information from the perspective of the scientists.  Results from               this interdisciplinary meeting of reservoir limnologists and                    basic scientists will be published in a volume which will be                    easily accessible for those interested in this major aquatic                    community.",
