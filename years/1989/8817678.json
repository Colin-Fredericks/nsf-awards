 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effects of ultraviolet radiation (UV) on microalgae will be assessed        with a rapid and sensitive method intended for use on natural samples,          even in extreme environments such as the Antarctic, where UV effects are        of great interest.  The method will be developed in a program of                research on cultures of marine phytoplankton.  The central hypothesis is        that short-term tolerance to UV varies within and between species due to        the presence of inducible UV-screening pigments.  Tolerance may also            vary due to the activities of recovery mechanisms.  Polar and temperate         phytoplankton will be grown under four regimes of UV plus visible               radiation.  Subsequently, the sensitivity of photosynthesis to UV will          be determined by measuring the uptake of   C-bicarbonate during or after        exposure to a range of UV fluence rates in 6 wavebands between 250 and          400nm.  This will yield an action spectrum of the inhibitory effects of         UV on photosynthesis.  The shapes of action spectra will be compared to         spectra of absorption and related to the possible effects of UV-screens.        The technique will be modified to assess recovery of photosynthesis from        UV-induced inhibition and to measure action spectra of UV effects during        exposure to visible light.  This new method for measuring the spectral          sensitivity of microalgae to UV will be rapid, sensitive and                    particularly appropriate for comparisons of planktonic and sea-ice              microalgae.  It should be useful in assessing the effects of UV on polar        primary producers and for comparing plankton over latitudinal gradients.",
