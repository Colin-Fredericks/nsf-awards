 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growing economic interdependence of the world economy,                      including the internationalization of markets for goods,                        services,  factors of production, and financial assets is                       creating increasing demands for measuring and monitoring economic               influences from beyond a country's borders.  The substantial                    impact on the U.S. economy of the foreign oil shocks during the                 1970s and the international repercussions of sharp policy shifts                and structural change in the 1980s have clearly rendered obsolete               any lingering conventions of closed-economy measurement and                     assessment.  As efforts to consult on and coordinate policies                   across countries mount in response to changing patterns of trade,               growing external imbalances,  and fluctuating exchange rates,                   there is a further impetus for each country's mneasurement and                  monitoring of international transactions to be comparable to that               of other countries.                                                                                                                                             This proposal is to convene a two-day conference in Washington,                 D.C. in the Fall of 1989 on international economic transactions.                The project commissions papers that advance measurement,  policy                assessment  and knowledge in this substantive area.  Each paper                 is empirical,  and each attempts to answer an important research                question using data from a choice of sub-areas.  Finally, each                  paper assesses the quality of data in one of these sub-areas:                   prices and costs of traded goods and services;  relations among                 trade,  output and consumption;  trade in services;  direct                     investment and embodied trade in primary inputs;  cross national                stocks and flows of financial capital;  and measurement of                      policy.  Illustrative of research questions addressed are how to                compare price indexes of traded goods and correct them for                      quality change,  how to identify determinants and size of trade                 and direct investment in services,  and how to measure non-tax,                 non-tariff policy initiatives and their effects.                                                                                                                Concern is increasing within the broader scientific community                   that international economic data are in need of critical                        asssessment and significant overhaul.  The time is ripe for                     drawing together researchers,  policy analysts,  and statistical                staff of the highest professional reputation ,  with proven                     commitments to measurement and research of outstanding quality.",
