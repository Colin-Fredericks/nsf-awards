 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teams of four Presidential Awardees (PA) in Science teaching                    will work with a university professor in 3-week summer                          institutes for middle school teachers.  The summer institutes                   will be offered at the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) and                    Southeastern Massachusetts University in 1989 and 1990.  A                      third site, to demonstrate transportability will be added in                    1990.  Each institute will serve 30 teachers.  Reflecting the                   breadth of science taught in middle schools the institutes                      include content classes in physics, chemistry, biology and                      earth science.  The morning sessions using a hands-on                           approach to teaching science content are complemented with                      methodology classes in the afternoons, and evening lectures                     on leading-edge scientific topics.  Teachers will receive                       three hours of graduate credit.  Each team of PA mentors will                   include a physics, chemistry, biology, and middle school                        teacher.  The principal of each participating teacher will                      spend one day at the institute.                                                                                                                                 Lead teachers within the group will be identified and invited                   to return to a follow-up workshop in the succeeding year and                    then be given assistance in planning and conducting in-                         service sessions in their geographical region.  The intent of                   the program is to provide a middle/junior high school science                   education leadership cadre composed of PAs and teacher                          participants.  This cadre, with support from their                              administrators, will replicate the peer coaching model with                     their colleagues on the local level.                                                                                                                            Dr. Clifford Schrader, a Presidential Awardee, is the project                   Director.  Ms. Marily DeWall of the National Science Teachers                   Association (NSTA) and Dr. Roy Saigo of UNI are Co-Directors.                   The NSTA will coordinate the summer institutes and follow-up                    sessions at NSTA area conventions.  It will also facilitate                     promotion of the program, supervise dissemination of                            applications and help with all reports.  UNI will compile the                   proceedings of each institute with the help of the NSTA                         editor.  A Central Planning Committee will develop the final                    program agendas, provide leadership training for PAs and                        select materials for the institutes.                                                                                                                            The strength of this project is the cooperative partnership                     of NSTA, the universities, and the PAs who are outstanding                      science educators.  The model is consistent with                                recommendations which have been formulated by recognized                        educators of the Holmes Group.  It uses master teachers in a                    discipline to help with science instruction of their peers in                   a university setting.                                                                                                                                           There is cost sharing in an amount equal to 6% of the NSF                       award.",
