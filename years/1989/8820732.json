 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present application is a request for renewal of funding on a                two-year Biological Instrumentation Grant for the construction                  and testing of a Confocal Differential Polarization Scanning                    Microscope.  The basic optical and electronic design and building               of this instrument has been completed in our laboratory.  This                  microscope has already shown its enormous potential as an                       analytical tool in the study of complex Biological systems                      in-situ.  Using this instrument, we have been able, for the first               time, to resolve spatially the long-range chiral domains in which               the Light Harvesting Complex II is organized in the chloroplast                 grana.  We request funding for an additional period of three                    years to extend the capabilities of the present instrument to                   carry out:                                                                                                                                                      a) Microspectro-polarimetric measurements at a given location in                the object.  Presently, the microscope can spatially resolve the                optical (linear and circular) anisotropy of the object to within                the diffraction limits of the light, at a fixed wavelength of                   illumination.  The building of the proposed instrumentation will                allow us to locate a microscopic domain of interest in the                      studies object and to obtain the Circular Dichroism and linear                  Dichroism spectra of that localized domain:                                                                                                                     b) Luminescence Depolarization Imaging.  Using the advantages of                confocal epi-dillumination optics and the extended sensitivity of               polarization modulation and synchronous demodulation, we propose                to develop the instrumentation to spatially resolve the molecular               dynamics of luminescence-labelled species.  This instrumentation                will be applied first to imaging the rotational dynamics of IgE                 receptors in mast cells.",
