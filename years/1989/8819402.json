 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this research is to elucidate the signal               transduction pathway leading to differentiation as indicated by                 activation of the kappa light chain gene in a pre-B like                        lymphocyte cell line, 70Z/3.  It has been shown previously that                 lymphokine-induced differentiation of 70Z/3 is preceded by a                    number of membrane events which include alterations of ion                      fluxes.  The immediate goals of this project are to examine the                 relation of ion fluxes to activation of the kappa gene in 70Z/3                 cells.  Wild type and mutant 70Z/3 cells will be used.                          Differentiation will be assessed by measuring the levels of                     transcription factors using gel retardation, kappa mRNA levels by               cytoplasmic dot hybridization, and surface immunoglobulin                       expression by flow cytometry.  Ion fluxes and intracellular ion                 concentrations will be assessed by atomic absorption                            spectrophotometry, radiolabeled tracers, and fluorescent dyes.                  It is expected that some ions may serve as transducers while                    others may serve as modulators of the 70Z/3 differentiation                     response by interacting, directly or indirectly, with the DNA                   binding proteins that regulate kappa gene expression.                                                                                                           The proposed studies should provide important information about                 the relationship between lymphokine-triggered ion fluxes, kappa                 gene specific DNA binding proteins, and kappa light chain gene                  expression in this cell model for B lymphocyte development.  The                results obtained in this system should also shed light on signal                transduction pathways in other cells in which specific                          extracellular signal molecules initiate a chain of events leading               to changes in gene expression.",
