 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the area of organometallic chemistry                    and is part of the Research in Undergraduate Institutions                       activity. The research will provide an excellent introduction                   to organometallic chemistry for undergraduate chemistry majors.                                                                                                 The aim of the project is to establish the intimate mechanisms                  and determine the scope of two classes of organometallic                        reactions. The first of these is the selective reduction of                     nitroaromatic compounds by the irontetracarbonyl hydride anion,                 a reagent which reduces the nitro group selectively even in the                 presence of such reducible groups as aldehydes and acid                         halides. The second class of reactions is the oxidation of                      alkoxides by mu-hydridodecacarbonyldichromium or -ditungsten                    anion. The latter class of reactions involves formation of a                    transition metal alkoxo intermediate complex, which                             subsequently undergoes beta-hydride elimination to give an                      aldehyde or ketone. Detailed kinetic studies will be made in                    order to establish the stoichiometry and the rate law for                       numerous specific examples of each class of reaction.                           Systematic variations in the oxidant and reductant will be used                 to establish the scope of each class of reaction.",
