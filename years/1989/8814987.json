 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extended red emission (ERE) is a dust luminescence process which                has recently been attributed to photoluminescence by hydrogenated               amorphous carbon.  If its presence can be demonstrated on a                     galactic scale and, in particular, in dust forming environments,                ERE must be considered direct observational evidence for the                    presence and physical structure of an important dust compound,                  that is, amorphous carbon.  Planetary nebulae are recognized as                 one of the major sources of new interstellar dust, and there is                 some evidence that ERE is very likely to be present in many of                  these objects.  Planetary nebulae also exhibit evidence for                     substantial dust grain processing.                                                                                                                              Dr. Witt will carry out observational studies of the optical                    continuum in the wavelength range of 3200 to 10,000 Angstroms of                24 planetary nebulae.  His aim is to investigate the strength and               the spectrum of ERE as a function of the carbon to oxygen ratio                 in these nebulae and as a function of the size distribution of                  the dust grains present.",
