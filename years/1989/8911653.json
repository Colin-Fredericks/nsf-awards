 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on dispute transformation over the past decade suggests                that disputes are reconceptualized as they pass through the legal               system.  Studies of legal negotiation and lawyer-client                         interaction indicate that lawyers play a central role in this                   transformation process.  Yet we know very little about the ways                 that lawyers carry on this work and about the factors that                      influence the variation in their practices and legal outcomes.                                                                                                  Drs. Mather, Maiman, and McEwen are collaborating on a unique                   project to address these issues.  Using divorce law practice as                 the empirical base, their objective is to understand the varying                ways in which lawyers intervene between clients and the legal                   system and the consequences of their influence on the outcome of                divorces.  The investigators will examine the work of divorce                   lawyers in two states with different legal procedures for                       divorce--mandatory mediation and infrequent voluntary mediation.                Through extensive interviews with 150 lawyers, the character of                 and variation in divorce lawyering in six counties will be                      examined.  The investigators will identify how much variation                   can be attributed to differences in legal procedures or to                      characteristics of individual practitioners, their practices and                clients, or to the local legal cultures in which they operate.                  The degree to which variations in lawyer behavior bear on the                   substance of legal outcomes will also be tested.  The cross-                    sectional data among lawyers and across courts and states will be               complemented by investigation of changes in divorce procedures                  and outcomes over the past decade as they are reflected in court                records of samples of cases from 1980, 1984, and 1988.                                                                                                          This research draws from and contributes to several rich                        traditions of sociolegal research involving the court system, the               legal profession, dispute processing and transformation, and                    theories of legal change and implementation.  The study of                      lawyering--the goals, strategies, tactics, and practices of                     working lawyers--in the context of legal and institutional change               will help draw these traditions together.  Because the study                    examines lawyer conduct within the context of a variety of                      related constraints, its scientific value is enhanced beyond                    simply understanding the divorce phenomenon.  From a policy                     perspective, a study of divorce lawyers' roles as rights                        advocates and dispute settlers is timely because legal                          entitlements are being expanded and redefined simultaneously with               strong encouragement and expansion of divorce mediation.  Since                 there is some evidence that levels of child support and levels of               satisfaction of divorcing women are lower after mediation, the                  study could have far reaching practical impact.   //",
