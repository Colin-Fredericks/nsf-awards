 "awd_abstract_narration": "The projects and strategies that UMES will consider for a five-year             plan are divided into five categories:                                               * enhanced faculty/student research                                             * enhanced teaching methodologies                                               * enhanced faculty development                                                  * enhanced hardware/software facilities                                         * exploration of new linkages                                              The establishment of a centralized resource center to accommodate the           research interest and projects of all the Computer Science faculty and          students would contribute immensely toward creating a research-friendly         environment.  A unique way of implementing this idea is through the             establishment of a research conference laboratory.  This special                laboratory would be available to faculty and graduate students in               Applied Computer Science to implement research activities.  It would be         equipped with a conference room for small group meetings, cubicles for          individual study, special equipment such as personal computers and              peripherals, and a sophisticated graphical workstation (e.g.:a SUN or           and IRIS).  Consolidating faculty research coverage in the areas of             artificial intelligence and computational mathematics would encourage           greater cooperation and sharing of available facilities thereby making          research efforts more cost effective.                                                                                                                           Student comprehension can be significantly increased by supplementing           the traditional lecture with specialized laboratories for each of the           Computer Science courses.  This coupled with specialized support                laboratories for the preparation of media and analyzing research                results seems to be a good strategy for enhancing teaching                      methodologies.  These specialized laboratories are to be utilized in            conjunction with the ongoing research.  In building an adequate                 computer facility, they will consider:  acquisition and maintenance of          a state-of-the art mainframe computer system, an adequate number of             workstations in terminal rooms, a terminal and/or a PC in each CS               faculty office, a local area network (LAN) to accommodate software              development and exchange among faculty, access to global networks and           the installation of several computer graphics work stations.                                                                                                    Several linkages to Universities, HBCU's, governmental agencies,                private industries and foundations will be attempted for the purpose of         obtaining helpful suggestions and advice on maintaining a program of            excellence in computer science.  This program will be one that answers          the challenge and impact upon the Nation's ability to attract                   sufficiently talented youth to major in computer science.  Moreover, it         will serve as a magnet to attract women and minorities to enroll at             UMES in advanced degree programs in computer science",
