 "awd_abstract_narration": "Qualitative modeling and simulation methods provide the ability                 to express incomplete knowledge of the structure and initial                    state of a mechanism, and to derive useful predictions about its                possible behaviors.  This capability is of major significance for               model.based reasoning in diagnosis, design, and decision.making.                The proposed work builds on the investigator's prior development                of the QSIM representation and algorithm for qualitative                        simulation.  In the model.simulation area, the new work focuses                 on these problems:  (1) the interpretation of quantitative data                 in terms of qualitative predictions; (2) representing qualitative               behaviors as trajectories in a qualitative phase space, allowing                application of more powerful mathematical methods; and (3)                      hierarchical structuring methods, such as abstraction of                        mechanisms by relative time.scale, to deal with complex                         mechanisms.  In the model.building area, the investigation                      concerns automatic methods for building qualitative models,                     focusing on two major issues:  (1) the selection, from                          potentially vast library of tangentially relevant descriptions,                 of a small set of descriptions to incorporate into a useful                     model; and (2) reasoning with the limits of the model, to know                  when it is useful, and combining conclusions from multiple                      models.",
