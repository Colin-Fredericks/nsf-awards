 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most current models of how people perceive the 3-D shape of                     moving objects are capable of determining shape when only a                     single object is present.  However, in the real world we usually                encounter scenes in which many objects are moving.  This research               will develop a new model of the perception of the shape of                      objects when several objects are moving in a scene.  The research               will study scenes in which overlapping objects cannot be                        distinguished in a static view, but can be distinguished when the               observer or the objects are in motion.  Three sets of experiments               will determine the limitations of human observers in perceiving                 multiple moving objects.  The first set of experiments will study               people's ability to determine the number of objects that are                    moving in a complex scene.  The second set of experiments will                  study how people identify the shapes of objects moving in a                     scene.  The third set of experiments will study how people judge                the amount of depth between objects in the scene.  These results                will facilitate the three-stage development of the model.  The                  first stage will use results from the first set of experiments to               derive mathematically the number of independent objects that are                moving in a computer-generated scene.  The second stage will use                results from the second set of experiments to describe                          mathematically the shape of small regions of each object.  The                  third stage will use results from the third set of experiments to               specify a quantitative value of the distance between objects in a               scene.                                                                                                                                                          An understanding of how the visual system determines the shape                  and depth of multiple moving objects will have important                        implications for the design of computer-generated displays used                 to train pilots, for the development of visual aids for the                     blind, and for the development of robotics vision systems.",
