 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fifty-five high school science teachers will be given coursework                sufficient to certify them to teach physics.  The curriculum has been           planned as a result of collaboration between five University of                 Wisconsin campuses (River Falls, Green Bay, Waukesha, Eau Claire, and           Platteville), administrators from 54 Wisconsin school districts and             several physics master teachers.  Most teachers will take eleven or             twelve semester credits of physics over a period of two summers and the         intervening academic year.  The program is flexible enough to                   accommodate teachers who need more or fewer credits.  Academic year             courses will be given at several locations within commuting distance of         most teachers' homes. Master teachers, Physics Teaching Resource Agents         (PTRAs), will be part of the instructional staff in order to help the           participating teachers identify with their peers and encourage their            participation in Wisconsin physics teachers networks.                                                                                                           This program addresses the most important science education problem             identified in a 1986 needs assessment done by the Wisconsin Department          of Instruction.  The targeted school districts were identified in 1987          as the program was being planned.  The districts have committed                 themselves to implementing more and/or more rigorous physics courses in         their schools, and the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction has           promised continual support for the program following funding by the NSF.        (Women and Minority participants will be recruited vigorously.)                                                                                                 An amount equal to approximately 20% of the NSF request for funding has         been cost-shared by the University of Wisconsin, the State Department of        Education and the individual school districts.",
