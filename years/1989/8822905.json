Holt, Professor of Chemistry, Oklahoma State                       University, and Dr. A. Boukhari and his graduate student, Mr.                   Ahmed Alaoui of the Department de Chemie of the Mohammed V                      University of Rabat, Morocco.  As background, Morocco possesses                 the largest reserves of phosphate of any country in the world.                  This proposed research into phosphates continues research                       collaboration began in 1986 between the solid state laboratory of               Mohammed V University and OSU.  The Moroccan investigators have                 been carrying out in their laboratory a systematic study of a                   binary system of phosphates.  It is proposed to bring Mr. Alaoui                to OSU for six months to learn single crystal diffraction methods               and to carry out X-ray diffraction studies on a number of                       crystalline phosphates, which are previously unknown materials.                 Near the end of the six months, Dr. Boukhari, Mr. Alaoui's                      research director, will visit OSU to evaluate the progress of                   research and to determine the course of their future research.                  In addition, he will familiarize himself with the high                          temperature synthesis research being conducted by Dr. Holt.                     After the completion of the research by the visiting Moroccan                   investigators and their return to Morocco, Dr. Holt will visit                  the solid state laboratory of the Mohammed V University to use                  the dielectric equipment capabilities of that laboratory to                     complete the final phase of this proposal.  The visit will                      provide an opportunity for planning further collaboration.                                                                                                      Scope:  This proposal brings together investigators from                        universities of two countries working in the field of the solid                 state chemistry of phosphates.  The investigators have differing                but complementary knowledge and experience in the chemical                      research of phosphates.  Their laboratories have distinct and                   valuable technical capabilities that may assist them singly or                  collectively to higher levels of scientific achievement.  This                  proposal does meet the objectives of the Science in Developing                  Countries Program of advancing the international exchange of                    scientific knowledge and does contribute to the enhancement of                  science in the developing country.",
