The                 purpose of the magazine is to provide enrichment opportunities in               creative thinking and problem solving to attract these students                 to science and math related careers.  The magazine, to be called                Quantum, will be patterned after the successful Soviet student                  magazine, Kvant, which contains physics and mathematics articles                and numerous problem-solving activities.  According to the Letter               of Understanding with the Quantum Bureau in Moscow, the Kvant                   editors will provide translations of articles and original copies               of accompanying artwork.                                                                                                                                        Two editors-in-chief, one for math and one for physics, and an                  advisory board made up of outstanding science and math teachers                 and professors will determine the content of Quantum, review all                articles for the publication, and solicit articles from U.S.                    scientists and mathematicians to supplement those from Kvant.                                                                                                   The first year of this three-year project will be devoted to the                publication of two premiere issues of the magazine, the first in                November of 1989 and the second in April of l990.  Recipients of                the first issue will return a response card evaluating the                      publication in order to receive the second issue.  A marketing                  survey will be conducted following distribution of the second                   issue.  Sales of subscriptions and advertising space, as well as                corporate donations, will help support the cost of producing                    Quantum.",
