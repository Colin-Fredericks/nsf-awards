 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory and research design for this research represents an effort           to uncover the psychological underpinnings of candidate evaluations.            The goal of the research is to integrate previous findings on candidate         evaluation into a new theoretical framework which treats candidate              evaluation as information processing.  The research occurs in two,              inter-related waves:  First, a series of three studies will be                  undertaken to discover regularities in the content of information about         political candidates.  These initial, base-line findings will then              serve as the basis for the second part of the study - - an attempt at           constructing, by way of specific psychological and political                    frameworks, evaluations and images of political candidates designed for         the investigation.                                                                                                                                              The first step of the research project requires an indepth study of             what political information means to individuals.  In particular, the            researchers will investigate various facets of information about                specific political issues, as well as that for personal characteristics         of the candidate and relevant political groups.  To what extent is              certain information about a candidate \"salient,\" or important to                people?  Would they be very much interested in knowing one particular           thing about a candidate, but not another?  Next, the researchers will           ascertain whether this information has certain connotations,                    implications, or interpretations that reach beyond the simple, surface          meaning of the information.  For example, does one particular type of           information lead people to believe that the candidate has other                 relevant characteristics?                                                                                                                                       Having thus obtained data about what information tends to be important          and \"meaningfully rich,\" the second part of the study deals with how            information, which differs in terms of its importance and                       interpretation, is combined into a candidate evaluation.  A crucial             factor at this stage of the study is the order in which the candidate           information is presented.  Results will indicate how different orders           of information is integrated into an evaluation, as well as how \"on-            going\" evaluations of the candidate alters the extent to which                  subsequent information influences a final evaluation.                                                                                                           Altogether, this study will disentangle three influences of information         upon candidate evaluation:  salience, interpretation, and order.  The           design of the research project requires two related studies;  the first         to ascertain the importance and interpretations of candidate                    information, the second to systematically manipulate the order in which         individuals receive the pre-tested information.  The study will not             only indicate how information salience, interpretation and order                jointly influence the impact of one another upon candidate evaluations,         but also how importance and interpretation can be altered to \"fit\" a            person's prior evaluation of the candidate.",
