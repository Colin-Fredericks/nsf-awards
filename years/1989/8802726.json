 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has often been suggested that comets which are in orbits that                bring them into the vicinity of the inner Solar System for the                  first time may be compositionally different from periodic comets.               Specifically, these so called \"Oort comets\" may have a larger                   abundance of ices which are more volatile than water ice.                       Compositional differences between \"fresh\" and periodic comets                   could suggest that the Oort comets are more primitive and                       therefore more representative of the conditions at the time of                  their formation.                                                                                                                                                This research project will focus a concerted effort on the                      investigation of the composition and activity of a sample of Oort               comets over a large range of heliocentric distances.                            Observations of comets at large distances will be compared to                   sublimation models for various ices in order to understand the                  type of activity found in Oort comets at large distances.                       Observations at small to moderate heliocentric distances will be                used to help constrain the parameters used in the sublimation                   models.  In addition, the continued observations of these comets                will keep the orbits current so that they may be observed to                    extremely large heliocentric distances.
