 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. DeMar               Taylor of Old Dominion University to conduct collaborative research             with Dr. Yasuo Chinizei for one year at Mie University in Japan.                They will investigate vitellogenesis (egg yolk protein precursor                synthesis) in ticks.  Dr. Chinzei's lab has recently found an active            septide from the tick brain which induces vitellogenin synthesis in             the insect's fat body.  The goals of this research are to isolate the           active septide, elucidate the mechanisms of regulation of vitel-                logenesis, and to identify, the important morphological, physiological          and biochemical processes involved.                                                                                                                             Many species of ticks are of medical importance worldwide as vectors            of diseases.  An understanding of vitellogenin synthesis might enable           the blockage of egg protein production by hormonal regulation, thus             reducing the number of offspring produced and ultimately controlling            tick populations.  Dr. Taylor's research has concentrated on sex                pheromones of disease trnasmitting ticks.  This will be complemented            by Chinzei's expertise in vitellogenesis in ticks.",
