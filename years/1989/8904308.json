 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this research are to understand the intrathymic                    events leading to the production of mature T lymphocytes in the                 developing and adult stages of life.  It is proposed to analyze                 extensively the maturation of CD4-8- precursors from the murine                 adult and fetal thymus.  These studies will be carried out in                   vivo utilizing the technique of intrathymic injection to create                 chimeric mice.  The possibility that phenotypic subsets of adult                and 14 day fetal CD4-8- thymocytes produce different types of                   progeny will be tested.  For this purpose, differentiation                      antigens on peripheral progeny produced by adult and fetal CD4-8-               subsets will be examined.  To study the differentiation of                      subsets independent of phenotype, thymic progeny produced by                    individual CD4-8- precursors in clonal repopulations will be                    analyzed.  Moreover, to understand the dynamics of the                          intrathymic precursor pool during development, the phenotypes of                peripheral T cells arising from CD4-8- thymocytes of different                  gestational ages (fetal days 14-19) will be analyzed.                                                                                                           A better understanding of the differentiation of T lymphocytes in               the fetal vs adult stages of life will provide a major                          contribution to our knowledge of the development of the immune                  system.  Dr. Adkins' proposed new appoach should provide a unique               perspective on this important problem.",
