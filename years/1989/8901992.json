 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemostat is a piece of laboratory apparatus that is                   used in ecology to study exploitative competition.  (It is a                    model of a simple lake.)  It is one place where both the                        mathematics and the biological experiments are tractable .. all                 of the needed coefficients are measurable in the laboratory.  The               basic model does not allow for the delay between nutrient uptake                and reproduction (cell division).  A model which does allow for a               delay does so in a way which tries to capture the complicated                   physiology involved in a single constant.  This project will                    develop new mathematical methods wich incorporate the cell cycle                (or cell growth) and will analyze their behavior.  The models                   will be either functional differential equations (cell cycle) or                partial differential equations (cell growth).  Another                          modification of interest is to remove the well stirred hypothesis               of the chemostat and let the nutrient and the cells move by                     diffusion or convection .. resulting a reaction diffusion                       equation or (in the discretization) a gradostat.  The project                   includes an analysis of these models as well.                                        The notion of persistence captures the ideas that all                      components of a model ecosystem \"survive\".  Recent results extend               this idea to asymptotically smooth semi.dynamical systems which                 includes delay equations and some partial differential equations.               Professor Waltman will investigate the applications of this work                to meaningful biological problems of this type, particularly                    those describing competition.",
