 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last decade legal services geared to individuals have been               transformed.  Two key developments have accounted for the                       transformation--advertising legal services and marketing prepaid                plans.  Ever since 1977 when the Supreme Court opened the way to                explore new avenues for getting legal business by ruling that                   lawyers may advertise prices at which services are performed,                   notable changes have taken place.  These developments have given                entrepreneurial attorneys the opportunity to discuss a business-                oriented approach to the delivery of legal services.  Today, the                legal needs of individuals are being met through a variety of new               forms of private legal services such as legal insurance, store-                 front legal clinics, mass-market legal clinics, and non-for-                    profit services.  This has resulted in major changes in the                     nature of work for the lawyer of individual clients in solo and                 small firm law practices.  Many of these small firms have been                  eclipsed by a variety of these new mechanisms for delivering                    legal services to individuals.                                                                                                                                  This project is designed to address the question of what the                    implications of these developments are for the professional                     organization of law.  The purpose of the study is to analyze the                impact of advertising, business, and other managerial techniques                on the professional work setting of lawyers.  Two broad questions               will guide the study: (1) What is the depth, range, and                         penetration of these new trends in the context of the legal                     profession at-large? and (2) What are the implications of these                 developments for understanding professional work in the late                    twentieth century?  Multiple methodologies will be used in the                  project including surveys of a random sample of practicing                      attorneys, in-depth interviews, and observation of selected sites               in the New York metropolitan area.                                                                                                                              Emerging forms of law practice suggest that the older status                    professions, like newer occupational professions, are engaged in                a paradoxical response to shifting economic realities.  In the                  quest to maintain control over the market for service, these                    occupations may \"re-professionalize\" economic and political                     relations into new forms and into new settings, while, at the                   same time, \"de-professionalizing\" the tasks of employees in order               to maintain that power and position.  In the process,                           associational ties are transformed and a professional calling is                re-constructed.  This project will fill in the empirical pieces                 of this complex theme in one professional arena.  Not only will                 the project make significant theoretical advances in our                        knowledge of legal professionalism but the changes taking place                 in the market structure, professional ideology, and internal                    organization of small-firm practice will have considerable                      importance to theories of organizations and professionalism in                  general.",
