 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Initiation Award project will study the                           electromagnetic scattering and radiation from impedance                         surfaces in the presence of dielectric materials and                            analyze some new antennas and scatterers.  The proposed                         study will be based on the use of the surface                                   integro-differential equations to generate different                            formulations.  While exact boundary conditions will be                          applied on the dielectric surfaces, the concept of the                          impedance boundary conditions will be introduced                                on the impedance surfaces.  The use of this concept                             provides the means for modeling different surface types                         of practical significance such as complex composite                             objects.  The solution will be carried out numerically                          using the method of moments.   The solution accuracy will                       be established through comparison with other available                          analytical and numerical results as well as new                                 experimental data.  Many problems will be investigated                          such as the internal resonance problem.  The proposed                           approach is particularly useful in studying the radiation                       and scattering from axisymmetric complex composite                              objects such as the new microslab antenna.  the microslab                       antenna is similar to the microstrip one except that the                        conducting patch is replaced by a physically thin disc of                       high dielectric constant to reduce the conduction losses                        from the radiating conducting patch.  The study of the                          radiation characteristics of microslab antennas will be                         carried out numerically and experimentally.  Different                          excitation techniques are also under consideration for                          economic use in the phased array antennas.",
