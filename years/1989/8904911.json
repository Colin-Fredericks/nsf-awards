The error of the approximate solution lies within the                           theoretical bound for the global error, yet the cost of                         computation is proportional only to the number of unknowns in                   the discretized equations.  Until recently, most of the                         research in this area concentrated primarily on nested                          conforming finite element spaces.  However, nonconforming                       finite elements are often used in applications because they are                 easier to program.                                                                  In previous work, results on full W-cycle multigrid                         convergence for nonconforming finite elememts have been                         obtained by the principal investigator in the study of P1                       nonconforming finite element applied to the Poisson equation                    and the Morley finite element applied to the biharmonic                         equation on polygonal domains.  In this project, these results                  will be applied to the stationary Stokes equations and extended                 to domains with smooth boundary.  Multigrid algorithms will be                  developed for nonconforming methods in linear elasticity and                    plate bending and also for mixed  methods that are equivalent                   to nonconforming methods.  The convergence of V-cycle                           nonconforming methods will be investigated.  Numerical                          experiments will be performed for each of these problems.",
