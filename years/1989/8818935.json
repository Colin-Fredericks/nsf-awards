 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to study the Hydrogen-Molybdinum-Disulfide and                   HxWS2 systems.  The variation of x with P will be determined at                 various temperatures and conditions sought where equilibrium can                be achieved in reasonable periods of time.  Thermodynamic                       quantities will be deduced for these favorable circumstances.                   Advantage will also be taken of conditions where desorption is                  severely kinetically limited to study structural characteristics                of these phases by neutron and/or x-ray diffraction, vibrational                and NMR-spectroscopies, ESCA, electrical conductivities and                     electrode potentials, all as a function of x.  If warranted,                    means will be found to supplement these data with EPR                           measurements.  Both single crystals and amorphous high surface                  area preparations will be used and relationships sought between                 these systems with the well documented behavior of known                        hydrogen-bronzes.  The effect of variation in x on catalytic                    properties will be explored and comparison will be made with                    presently not understood effects of a similar \"activated                        adsorption\" (characterized as HR) found with reduced molybdena-                 alumina catalysts.  Other transition metal sufides may be tested                for similar behavior.",
