 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator (PYI) Award will be devoted                to computational engineering, in particular, the following three                areas will be examined: algorithmic enhancements, applications to               computational fluid dynamics and other convective-diffusive                     systems, and implementation on parallel supercomputers.                                                                                                         For field problems with in two or more dimensions, domain decom-                position is a natural way to partition operations across proces-                sors and to partition data across memories, since both the data                 structures and the algorithms employed in a proven serial code                  can be carried over to the parallel case with special code to                   treat the artificially introduced partitioning boundaries.  The                 principal bottleneck to parallelizing iterative schemes is the                  preconditioning.  The goal of preconditioning in domaindecom-                   position is to create independent or nearly independent threads                 of execution and optimal memory management of problems too large                to fit in active core.                                                                                                                                          Some of the issues to be examined under algorithmic                             include:                                                                                                                                                          1. adaptive gridding and transition between levels of                         refinements occurring at subdomain boundaries.                                                                                                                    2. adaptive updates of preconditioning and active control                          of local convergence rates.                                                                                                                                  3. transitional regions between subdomain boundaries for                           three dimensional problems.                                                                                                                                The implementation issues to be addressed are:                                                                                                                    1. complex domain geometry.                                                                                                                                     2. characterizing the performance of supercomputers (Cray, etc)                    on domain-decomposed applications.                                                                                                                           3. comparison between domain-decomposed out-of-core solution                       techniques with traditional techniques.                                                                                                                    Some of the test problems for which domain decomposition will be                applied are: aerodynamics modeling. oil reservoir modeling, semi-               conductor device physics modeling, and detailed kinetics                        combustion modeling.",
