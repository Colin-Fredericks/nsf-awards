The student's transition from dependent to independent status                   will be guided by two seminars per week on general research                     concerns common to all projects (experimental procedure, research               organization, report writing).  The student will prepare a                      research paper intended for publication.  Research opportunities                are in five thrust areas within civil engineering: (1) mechanics,               (2) environmental engineering, (3) structural engineering, (4)                  geotechnical engineering, and (5) transportation and planning.                  Specific undergraduate research projects include: (1) unstable                  regimes of earthquake and creep events for earthquake prediction,               (2) effect of concrete material properties on fracture                          propagation, (3) acoustic emission analysis for use in                          nondestructure surveillance, and (4) policy-oriented modelling of               land use and regulated housing market.",
