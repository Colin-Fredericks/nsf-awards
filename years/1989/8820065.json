 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most mammals are promiscuous, only a few species forming                        monogamous pair bonds, but in birds monogamy is by far the                      commonest pattern.  Natural selection favors individuals that                   reproduce most rapidly and efficiently and, especially for males,               monogamy places great restrictions on the numbers of offspring                  that can be produced in an individual's lifetime.  Therefore, to                understand why monogamy is so common in birds, the costs and                    benefits of this mating system to males and females must be                     investigated.                                                                                                                                                   Although monogamy is generally considered to be the typical                     mating system of waterfowl, recent studies have shown that                      variations on strict monogamy can occur in these birds.  In some                species of ducks, paired males court and copulate with females                  other than their mates, and some males are able to hold two mates               simultaneously.  In species where males help their mates protect                the ducklings, such bigamous behavior leads to complex conflicts                of interests among the members of breeding trios.  Dr. McKinney                 will investigate how such relationships are formed, and how they                affect the reproductive success of the males and females                        concerned, in the South American speckled teal.  Dr. McKinney has               studied this species in captivity for several years, and it is                  ideally suited for detailed analysis because males are variable                 in their contributions to parental care.  A combination of field                and aviary techniques will be needed.  Therefore, individually                  marked birds will be studied in Argentina and Peru to complement                intensive long-term monitoring of relationships among the birds                 in a captive flock.                                                                                                                                             Dr. McKinney's careful combination of captive and field studies                 will provide insights into both the proximate mechanisms and the                functional significance of departures from strict monogamy, and                 thus will contribute a great deal to our understanding of complex               social systems in general.",
