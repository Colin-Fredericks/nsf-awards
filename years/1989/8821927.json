 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current six degree of freedom robot systems can meet the                        requirement of accessing a broad range of locations and                         positions in a workspace, but they frequently have the                          disadvantage of doing this in a suboptimal way.  In                             particular, actuator overspeeding effects are often                             encountered in an attempt to maintain a constant speed during                   a particular class of operations or maneuvers, i.e., arc                        welding.  Failure to maintain constant speed can result in                      reduced performance, i.e., degraded weld quality.  Professor                    Davidson has designed a class of seven degree of freedom                        robots which have the potential of avoiding the overspeeding                    singularities.  This project exploits that class of robots and                  develops the design and synthesis of workcells which use such                   robots.  Workcell is defined as a unit comprising a robot, one                  or more tools placed at some angle and position on the end                      effector link of the robot, and a fixture.  The research is                     accomplished through five steps including (1) developing the                    equations for algebraic dimensional analysis of the                             manipulators, (2) exploring alternative formulations of the                     synthesis equations to expand the number of design variables,                   (3) determining the maximum number of precision locations used                  to approximate a task, (4) prescribing the manipulator                          workspace in terms of manipulator dimensions and excursion                      ranges at the joints, and (5) extracting additional design                      conditions to enable maximizing the volume of workspace for                     the class of robots considered in this study.  The research's                   impact will be in the area of future industrial robot                           technology.  Specifically, the results could reduce the                         engineering time required for manufacturing setup, provide for                  the development of computer automated procedures of design for                  the placement of tools and fixtures in workcells, and                           constitute an important step in the computer automated                          programming of a robot to accomplish a specific manufacturing                   task.                                                                           *",
