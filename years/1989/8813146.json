 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an evaluation of the possibility of developing semiconductor-           based photocatalysts for multielectron reductions.  The hypothesis is           that conduction-band electrons produced by band-gap irradiation of              semiconductor (titania) colloids                                                may be transmitted to catalytic molybdenum sites on the colloidal               surface.  The ability of reduced monomeric (from molybdate), dimeric            (from molybdenum(V)), and trimeric (from molybdenum(VI)) forms of               molybdenum to perform multielectron reduction of substrates is                  investigated by product analysis.  Acetylene reduction is used as a             test reaction; reductions of dinitrogen and of carbon dioxide may also          be investigated.  The effect of derivatization of the colloidal                 titania surface with molybdocenium dicarboxylate on the efficiency of           electron transfer is studied using flash photolysts and luminescence            techniques.  Time permitting, the work will be extended to zinc oxide           and cadmium sulfide colloidal semiconductors.                                                                                                                   A successful photocatalytic multielectron reduction system could be             applied in many areas including synthetic fuels production, fertilizer          production, pollution control, polymers, and specialty chemicals.",
