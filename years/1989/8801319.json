 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Index to Plant Chromosome Numbers is a compilation of                  all the original plant chromosome numbers reported in the                       scientific literature throughout the world, covering algae,                     fungi, bryophytes, ferns, and seed plants.  Indexes are compiled                annually but are usually published in volumes covering at least                 two years at a time.  The chromosome number is an important                     attribute of a plant species, and the literature reporting these                data provides important information for plant breeders,                         geneticists, and scientists who study the classification and                    evolution of plants.  The Index to Plant Chromosome Numbers is                  the only worldwide index of this type and is thus the primary                   information source for chromosome data about plants for the                     world's scientific community.  Indexes also function as a general               bibliography for current studies in plant systematics.                               The scientific literature is reviewed voluntarily by the                   approximately 25 contributing editors for the project, who are                  spread throughout the world and are assigned responsibility for                 particular scientific publications.  The data are forwarded to                  the editors Dr. Peter Goldblatt and Dr. Dale Johnson of the                     Missouri Botanical Garden, who coordinate the reviewing                         activities of the contributors and supervise the preparation of                 the published indexes.  The chromosome information is sorted by                 computer alphabetically by plant family, genus, and species name,               in which form it is published.  All entries are cross-indexed to                the original publication.  Information from the Index will be                   available on-line via computer from Missouri Botanical Garden's                 TROPICOS system starting in 1989.",
