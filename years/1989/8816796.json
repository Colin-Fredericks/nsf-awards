 "awd_abstract_narration": "By comparison with C3 plants, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and                     other unicellular algae exhibit unusual photosynthetic                          characteristics.  It has been proposed that these                               characteristics result from the operation of a CO2-                             concentrating system, which increases the intracellular CO2                     concentration to a level which suppresses photorespiration by                   competitive inhibition of RuBP oxygenase.  One of the                           principal components of the proposed system is a protein                        which catalyzes the active transport of inorganic carbon                        across either the plasmalemma or the chloroplast envelope.                      However, direct, physical evidence for the existence of this                    transporter, or any other component of the CO2-concentrating                    system other than carbonic anhydrase, is lacking.  Activity                     of the CO2-concentrating system is under environmental                          control.  Cells grown at limiting CO2 concentrations (air-                      adapted) show activity, but cells grown at elevated CO2                         concentrations (CO2-enriched) show no activity of the CO2-                      concentrating system.  We have identified 7 polypeptides                        which increase in abundance during adaptation to limiting CO2                   concentrations or are specific for cells grown under such                       conditions.  We will continue to extend these observations to                   comparisons between wild-type and mutants of Chlamydomonas                      deficient in the CO2-concentrating system to help identify                      which polypeptides might be involved directly in inorganic                      carbon accumulation.  Using antibodies generated against one                    or more of these \"air-specific\" polypeptides, we expect to:                     (1) determine whether appearance of the \"air-specific\"                          polypeptides during \"induction\" of the CO2-concentrating                        system correlates with the appearance of the capacity for                       inorganic carbon accumulation, (2) determine the                                intracellular location of the corresponding antigens, (3)                       determine whether Chlamydomonas mutants deficient in the                        capacity for inorganic carbon accumulation contain                              polypeptides immunologically cross-reactive with these                          antibodies, (4) investigate the appearance of translatable                      mRNA for \"air-specific\" polypeptides during the \"induction\"                     of the CO2-concentrating system.  Genes differentially                          expressed during adaptation of CO2-enriched cells to limiting                   CO2 will be identified by differential screening of a cDNA                      library and, if time permits, by molecular cloning of the                       genes corresponding to the \"air-induced\" polypeptides.                          Attainment of all objectives will allow us to better assess                     the potential for transferring the CO2-concentrating system                     into higher plants.                                                                                                                                             Some algae can take up carbon dioxide dissolved in water and                    photosynthesize sugars.  How they concentrate the dissolved                     gas is unknown but could be an important trait to introduce                     into higher plants.  This work investigates the mechanism of                    uptake and its subsequent enhancement of photosynthesis.***//",
