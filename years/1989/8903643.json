 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emm gene of group A streptococci exhibits a unique type of                  molecular evolution.  One half of the gene is genetically diverse               and the other half is strictly conserved when different alleles                 of the gene are compared.  The divergent amino-terminal half of                 the gene is characterized by a series of tandem repeats of 21 to                105 base pairs.  The sequence and number of the repeat units are                sites of observed diversity.  These sequence differences are                    translated into antigenic differences in the M protein.  To                     discover the molecular mechanisms of emm genetic diversity,                     isogenic, antigenic variants will be isolated on the basis of                   their immunological diversity.  A simultaneous positive and                     negative selection using two monoclonal antibodies that recognize               different antigenic determinants on the same M molecule will be                 used.  The genetic changes will be determined by sequence                       analysis.  These findings will provide a measure of the type(s)                 of gene changes that result in antigenic diversity.  Protein                    fusions which fuse the variable repeats into an easily selectable               marker gene will be constructed.  The fusions will be used to                   measure recombination frequencies among tandem repeats in both E.               coli and group A streptococci, and to begin to identify the                     enzymatic pathway leading to variation.",
