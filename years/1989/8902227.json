 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in quadratic forms of                     Professor Donald James of the Pennsylvania State University. Dr.                James's project is to study quadratic and Hermitian forms over                  integer rings of number fields, with special emphasis on the                    theory of classification, diagonalization, and representation.                       Except for counting, number theory, which is the study of                  the properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of                    mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have                     furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the               fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most                recent and most astonishing applications of number theory have                  appeared in theoretical computer science and coding theory. The                 theory of quadratic forms is an aspect of number theory that is                 almost as ancient as the whole field itself, and was advanced                   especially far by the great nineteenth-century mathematician C.F.               Gauss. This subfield of number theory retains its vitality even                 today, and has proved to have applications both in physics and in               many branches of mathematics.",
