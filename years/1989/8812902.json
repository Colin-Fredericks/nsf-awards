 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is being conducted to develop and evaluate algorithms that             exploit the properties of randomly modulated sine-wave and pulse-train          signals to accomplish detection and time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)           estimation, phase-array direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and               beam/null-steering signal extraction, and periodically time-variant             signal correction.  Both single-platform and multiple-platform                  reception is being considered.  The properties being exploited include          the spectral self-coherence that results from cyclostationarity, and            periodic or constant modulus properties.  The algorithms being studied          perform blind adaptive signal processing which circumvents the need for         training signals, pilot signals, preambles, knowledge of DOA, and so            on, which are typically required for conventional adaptive processing.          The detection and TDOA algorithms under investigation use FFT-based             measurements of auto- and cross-spectral correlation to perform signal-         selective detection and TDOA estimation.  The phase-array algorithms            use singular-value-decomposition and projection of cyclic correlation           matrices to accomplish signal-selective DOA estimation and to                   accomplish beam/null-steering signal extraction by performing spectral          self-coherence restoral.  The signal correction algorithms use both             carrier-modulus and base-band-modulus restoral to adapt periodically            time-variant (frequency-shifting) filters for cochannel interference            rejection, and correction of multipath and other distortion.  Some              algorithms employ both self-coherence restoral and modulus restoral.            The a priori information required by all the algorithms being                   investigated is knowledge of at least one frequency of                          cyclostationarity - typically for the signal of interest - such as a            baud rate or carrier frequency and, in some cases, knowledge of such            frequencies for both the signal of interest and interfering signals.            The research being conducted is based on both theoretical analysis and          computer simulations.                                                           This research focusses on significant problems and is being conducted           by a well qualified researcher.  Support is highly recommended.",
