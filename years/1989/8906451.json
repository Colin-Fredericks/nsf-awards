 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long range goal of the research is to gain an                          understanding of the genetic basis of evolutionary change in                    salmonid fishes (trout, salmon, grayling, char, and whitefish).                 Dr. North will continue his study of the phenotypic effects of                  differences in the liver-specific expression of a                               phosphoglucomutase gene in rainbow trout and on the developmental               genetic basis of morphological variation.  Two new studies will                 be initiated.  The objective of the first study is to test the                  assumption that mitochondrial DNA genotypes do not have                         phenotypic effects, and therefore, are selectively neutral.                     Demonstration that mtDNA is subject to natural selection would                  have important implications for the widespread use of mtDNA as a                marker for studies of genetic variation and population structure.               The second new study will test if previously observed effects of                multiple locus heterozygosity is caused by the loci examined or                 by closely linked chromosomal segments.                                              The major significance of this work is increasing our                      understanding of the phenotypic effects and evolutionary                        importance of genetic variation in the regulation and expression                of genes.  Furthermore, the studies with multiple locus                         heterozygosity will provide an important test of the significance               of genetic variation in natural populations.  Results will be                   applied to the management of trout and salmon populations, as                   well as to the conservation of biological diversity.",
