 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dung beetles are ecologically important in recycling                       nutrients present in various types of animal feces.  Dung not                   only makes up the bulk of the diet of the adults but is also the                resource adults use to provision their young in underground                     burrows.  Dung removal decreases resources available to pest                    species such as dung-breeding flies, thus lowering population                   densities of these species.  Burial of dung also increases growth               of grasses and other forage for livestock and wild animals.  In                 this project, the PI's will study the reproductive biology of a                 native North American dung beetle, Phanaeus difformis, which                    utilizes feces of cattle and other large mammals.  This research                will contribute to our understanding of the role that dung                      beetles play in rangeland ecology.                                                   The goals of this research include documenting how                         morphological and behavioral variables influence the reproductive               biology of P. difformis under a range of ecological conditions.                 Investgations will involve observations of naturally breeding                   adults and controlled field experiments.  Field experiments will                consider how adult population density and sex ratio influence the               reproductive potential of different individuals in the                          population.",
