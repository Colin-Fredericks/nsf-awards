 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an international workshop on the                            mathematics of dynamical systems to be held at the                              Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA) in                             Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from July 20-31, 1989.  The                              U.S. organizer is Sheldon Newhouse of the University                            of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Brazilian                              organizer is J. Palis of IMPA.  The participants                                consist of seven leading mathematicians from the U.S.,                          the same number from Brazil and five Europeans.  The                            workshop will bring together experts in the field of                            dynamical systems to discuss results and progress on                            significant problems in this area.                                                                                                                              There has been important progress in this field in the                          last twenty years with impact in many areas of                                  science, particularly in physics, biology, economics                            and chemistry.  Therefore, this workshop is an                                  opportunity for the exchange of recently developed                              knowledge and ideas, important for the goals of the                             U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Research Program.  In                                   addition, it will further develop the strong                                    background of cooperation between these two countries                           in dynamical systems.",
