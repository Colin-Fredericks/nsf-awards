 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to describe the state of the oceanic sea            ice cover and to understand the physical processes that combine to              produce the observed distribution of open water, first-year, and                multi-year sea ice.  The project will integrate satellite-based                 microwave data from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer              (SMMR) and the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), and ice                 drift and deformation data from the Arctic Buoy Program data set, in            a quantitative estimate of the sea ice mass budget and the arctic               ice balance.  On the scale of the Arctic Ocean, the quasi-permanent             sea ice cover is not uniform, but rather is composed of a mixture of            ice types which differ with respect to age, thickness, salinity,                surface roughness, and snow depth.  The various ice types also                  determine the surface radiation budget and the rates at which heat              and momentum is transferred between the atmosphere and the                      ocean.  The nature of the sea ice cover therefore becomes a                     significant geophysical variable in the polar climate.  The                     satellite microwave data carries information about ice type, and                open water areas, while the buoy data provides data on surface                  temperatures and ice motion and deformation fields.  The combined               data set removes ambiguities present in the microwave signatures and            provides an overdetermined data set for presently used ice thickness            distribution models.",
