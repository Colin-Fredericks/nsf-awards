 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a renewal of the 2 year award made to the                    Southeastern Universities Research Association to implement a                   regional network in the southeastern section of the country                     comprising 13 states and the District of Columbia.  SURAnet                     became operational in March 1987 and has grown to 44 nodes,                     including 30 universities and 14 federal research sites.                          The SURAnet Phase II proposal specifically solicits                           participation by the widest possible community of users and                     servers.  In addition to the SURAnet Operations at the Network                  Operations Center (NOC), which is attached to the NSFNET Backbone               network and which provides nationwide connectivity for the                      region, SURAnet will coordinate the localized operations and                    services of Smart Nodes or key sites in each state.  These Smart                Nodes will be connected by a high speed backbone net (1.5 million               bits per second).  Other nodes or institutions in the state will                be connected to the Smart Nodes via line speeds of 9.6Kbs, 56Kbs,               or 1.5Mbs depending on local needs.                                               Cost sharing is offered by each institution participating in                  the network through implementation of local area networks,                      network information services, and the payment of annual                         membership fees to the SURAnet Operations Center.***",
