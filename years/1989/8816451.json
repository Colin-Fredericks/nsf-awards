 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Prof. Rama Bansil and Prof. William Klein               of the Center for Polymer Studies of Boston University in a                     research collaboration with Prof. A. Coniglio of the University of              Naples.  The objective of the collaboration is to seek a better                 understanding of how basic physical laws are altered on random                  materials and also of the physics of inhomogeneous media.                                                                                                       In order to carry out this objective, the researchers propose to                study 5 general topics:  Topic I, the phenomena of multifractality              in random materials, whereby an infinite hierarchy of exponents is              sufficient to characterize virtually any system near its critical               point.  Topic II is concerned with applications of modern methods               of statistical mechanics to physical processes on disordered media              and to how a random material is fractured under sufficiently high               stresses.  In Topic III the researchers plan to address questions               concerned with one specific class of random materials, linear and               branched polymers.  Topic IV is concerned with the relation between             geometric clusters and thermal phase transitions, while Topic V                 will involve experiments using dynamic light scattering techniques              to investigate the problem of probe diffusion in polymer gels.                  This work will continue a highly productive collaboration that has              led to useful concepts and applications to problems like                        irreversible growth, resistor networks and many others.",
