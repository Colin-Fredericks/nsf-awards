 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to design and implement an                   optimizing C* compiler for hypercube multicomputers and distribute the          compiler to the hypercube user community.  The compiler will translate          C* into C.  The use of C as a target language takes advantage of                existing C compilers to reduce development time and expense.  It also           makes the compiler more portable.  To move the compiler to other                hypercubes or shared memory multiprocessors, only the routing library           must be reimplemented.                                                                                                                                               Preliminary results are encouraging.  Hand-compiled C* programs            have achieved reasonable speedup on a commercial hypercube.                                                                                                          The long-term goal of the research is to investigate the power of          the synchronous, data parallel approach to parallel algorithm                   development.  Many numerical and nonnumerical algorithms can be                 expressed in an elegant fashion using this methodology.  If C*                  compilers can be written that allow for the reasonable efficient                execution of parallel algorithms on the Connection Machine,                     multicomputers, and shared memory multiprocessors, then there would be          a whole class of algorithms for which no reprogramming would be                 necessary in order to move an application from one parallel                     architecture to another.",
