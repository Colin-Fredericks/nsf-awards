 "awd_abstract_narration": "A sequence of platform carbonates and phosphorites in                      southwest China, near Kunming, contains the Precambrian-Cambrian                boundary and is well studied in terms of lithologies and faunal                 content.  It has been proposed as a global stratotype for the                   boundary.  We have obtained preliminary magnetostratigraphic data               which show eight reversals and yield a paleopole which is unlike                any paleopoles thus far observed for the South China block for                  any Phanerozoic rocks.                                                               This proposal requests funds to collect an additional 1600                 paleomagnetic samples over several parallel sections, in order to               test the preliminary magnetostratigraphic polarity                              determinations.  The promising preliminary data suggest that this               section could provide a standard for the magnetostratigraphy of                 the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary, with which other sections                    could be compared (e.g., in Siberia, Australia, Mongolia, North                 America, Europe or Morocco).  Given that the boundary is                        associated with the first appearance of diverse shelly fossil                   assemblages, it is a feature of primary importance in                           stratigraphy and earth history.  A reliable reversal record for                 the Chinese boundary section would be of great value in internal                correlation.",
