 "awd_abstract_narration": "This five-year Presidential Young Investigator Award will permit                Dr. Diane L. Marshall of the University of New Mexico to maintain               a highly productive activity level in her scientific research.                  Within an evolutionary ecology framework, she is continuing                     studies of plant population biology.                                                                                                                            Her principal work examines patterns of variation in plant                      reproduction and fitness (the term \"fitness\" refers to                          reproductive success and the relative differential effects                      brought about by natural selection).  For the past several years,               the wild radish, Raphanus sativus, has been the subject species                 of interest for exploring questions pertaining to plant mating                  systems (i.e., pollination, sexual selection, and paternity).                   Results demonstrate effects due to genetic identity of pollen                   donors, as well as variable responses on the part of individual                 pollen recipients.  This work has been an important contribution                in quantifying gene flow in plants.  Future endeavors with                      another species will combine field work at the Sevilleta Long-                  Term Ecological Research site with greenhouse results.                                                                                                          Apart from this work is that which has been done on a legume,                   Sesbiana.  Recent investigations reveal that this species shows                 plasticity in response to stresses such as water or nutrient                    limitations, and that seed size is only one of several                          components of yield response.  Future research will document the                nature of plastic responses across a range of habitat types and                 plant species.                                                                                                                                                  Beyond allowing expansion of pilot studies of variation in plant                secondary chemistry and its linkages to plant demography and                    herbivore pressure, this award will also guarantee that                         Dr. Marshall is able to supplement her mastery of electrophoretic               techniques by developing expertise in the newer, more powerful                  ones such as \"DNA fingerprinting,\" using restriction fragment                   length polymorphisms.",
