 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-scale planetary waves and circulations in the extra-                 tropical atmosphere are known to have important low-frequency                   variability, which affects weather and climate.  In this project,               the emphasis will be on studying the various mechanisms that can                possibly couple the tropics to the extra-tropics and their role                 in affecting the year-to-year changes in the extra-tropical                     circulation and wave dynamics.                                                       The existence of the phenomenon of extra-tropical Quasi-                   Biennial Oscillation provides a focus for this theoretical study.               Newly available observational analyses on this phenomenon also                  provide critical checks on the relevance of the proposed                        mechanisms of tropical-extra-tropical coupling.  The approach                   will be one of hypothesis testing.  Several essentially two-                    dimensional and some three-dimensional mechanisms have been                     proposed so far:  through induced change in the mean meridional                 circulation (Hadley and Brewer-Dobson circulations), through                    transport of tropical perturbations by the preexisting                          circulation, and through modulations in the wave guide for                      planetary waves in the extra-tropics.  The relevance of each                    will be tested with mechanistic model studies and by critically                 comparing the model results with available observation.                              This research is an important component of the basic                       theoretical studies required as an underpining for the                          development of prediction models for low frequency weather and                  climate phenomena.",
