 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                         research of Dr. Richard Caldwell at the University of Texas at                  Dallas. Specifically, the structure, lifetime and energetics of                 photochemically-generated reaction intermediates will be                        explored both experimentally and by computational methods. A                    better understanding of the behavior and properties of                          transient reaction intermediates will provide a fundamental                     basis for their role in the outcomes of photochemical processes.                                                                                                Alkene triplets and triplet biradicals will be photochemically                  generated and studied by conventional organic mechanistic                       methods to determine the reaction products and infer the                        identity of the intermediates; by laser flash photolysis to                     determine transient lifetimes and intersystem crossing rates;                   by time-resolved photoacoustical calorimetry to determine                       energies of transients; and theoretically by CAS-MCSCF                          computations of spin-orbit coupling in small model species.                     The combination of these methodologies will allow a fundamental                 understanding of intersystem crossing as well as the energy                     surfaces of these intermediates.  Arylalkene triplets, Norrish                  II and other 1,4-biradicals, triplet state di-pi-methane                        biradicals and some unusual trans-cyclohexenes and                              -cyclopentenes resulting from the alkene triplets, will be                      studied.",
