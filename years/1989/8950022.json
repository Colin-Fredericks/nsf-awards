 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two week workshop is being held at the U. S. Geological Survey                Training Center in Denver, CO, in conjunction with the State                    University of New York College at Brockport.  The workshop is for 25            faculty who teach courses with a Hydrology and Water Resources                  Content.  The workshop is bringing participants up-to-date on the               science of hydrology and those technologies used to measure, analyze,           and calculate hydrologic flows, surface and groundwater resources, and          pollutant loadings and consequences.  The workshop is providing the             faculty with the latest in water resources information and                      instructional materials for their classroom and encouraging them to use         this information.  The workshop is actually producing resource                  materials suitable for students of introduction college courses in the          earth sciences.  In addition, the faculty are being made aware of the           extensive hydrologic data base available through WATSTORE and                   electronic data sources that can be used for both faculty and student           research.                                                                                                                                                       The U.S. Geological Survey is contributing its facilities and staff in          support of this workshop.",
