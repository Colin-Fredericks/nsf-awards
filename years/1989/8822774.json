 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on three dimensional modeling methods for predicting           performance and characteristics of VLSI-ULSI circuits and devices.  The         focus is on: (1) efficient computations of capacitances and inductances         in three dimensional configurations of on-chip and off-chip                     interconnection lines; and (2) feasible and accurate computations of            threshold voltages in three-dimensional simulations of MOSFETs.  The            former computations are needed for assessment of delay times in off-            chip interconnection lines.  The latter computations are needed when            modeling pulse propagation through MOSFET circuits.  The approach is to         use infinite electrical network theory to simplify the computation of           coupling between interconnection lines and adjacent devices.  This              theory leads to efficient numerical methods, including domain                   contraction techniques, which yield more powerful computation                   algorithms.                                                                     Professor Zemanian is an outstanding researcher with a solid record of          accomplishment over the past decade in both applied mathematics and             electrical network theory.  His approach to difficult problems in IC            design is novel and backed by solid theory and mathematical results.            He is very likely to continue first class research.  The research               approach to the topic of modeling electrical properties in VLSI-ILSI            circuits, is high-risk, high-payoff for an important problem.  The              problem is a high priority within the Design, Tools and Test Program.",
