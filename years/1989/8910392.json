It will be a                        linguistically oriented work making use of the latest advances in               historical linguistic studies of the Mon-Khmer language family.                                                                                                      The Lexicon will present all Khmer words for which cognates                can be found elsewhere in the Mon-Khmer family, to list these                   cognates and distinguish them from borrowings, and to indicate                  the linguistic arguments which support these claims.                                                                                                                 Each entry will contain:  the meaning of the Khmer word,                   with culturally and historically relevant comments; a reconstruc-               tion of the Proto-Khmeric form; the form found in Angkorian                     inscriptions; the Khmer script form; the pronunciation; several                 Khmer dialect forms; a list of Mon-Khmer cognates classed by                    branch; a list of borrowings from Khmer, especially into the                    unrelated Thai and Cham languages, but also into related lang-                  uages; and notes discussing the relevant historical questions.                                                                                                       One purpose of the Lexicon is to place the language of                     theAngkor civilization, and its profound influence on mainland                  Southeast Asia, in the proper historical perspective, as a                      medieval transition between prehistoric Mon-Khmer times and the                 modern Cambodian period.",
