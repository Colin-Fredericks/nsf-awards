 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide opportunities for undergraduates to                be active participants in laboratory and space physics research.                These opportunities include the special advantages of a high-                   technology environment in a NASA laboratory with guidance                       provided by researchers who are, in addition, committed to                      education.                                                                           The research team is engaged in experimental and theoretical               nuclear physics studies, detector development, and high-energy                  solar flare investigations.  This balanced program of laboratory                measurements, observations, analysis, and interpretation is                     focused on addressing questions about the fundamental physical                  nature of mechanisms responsible for energetic particle                         acceleration, confinement, and transport.  The key team members                 are each associated with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the                  institution will be the REU Site providing the proposed research                environment, The Catholic University of America, the institution                through which the students will be employed.                                         Nine specific research topics in the aforementioned fields                 that are appropriate for undergraduate participation are                        available.  Twenty undergraduates have worked with the group                    since 1983.  Eight of the ten with baccalaureates have pursued                  advanced degrees in the sciences and in mathematics.  This will                 provide a firmer foundation on which to base student involvement                and will provide the opportunity to actively recruit students                   from a much broader range of backgrounds, especially those from                 groups underrepresented in the scientific community.",
