 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of incinerators involves a conflict between two important            goals:  completely destroying the toxic organic materials which are             fed to the incinerator and avoiding the emission of heavy metals which          will also be present in the waste material.  If the incinerator                 temperature is excessive, the organics will be completely destroyed             but heavy metals can be vaporized, subsequently condensing to form              submicron particulates which are discharged to the atmosphere.                  Decreasing the incinerator temperature can solve this problem but can           also cause less than complete destruction of the toxic organics.  The           research program will demonstrate a solution to this dilemma which is           created by a threshold for oxidation resulting from the fact that the           last remaining traces of the toxic organics oxidize much more slowly            than one would expect from their measured oxidation rates at higher             concentrations.  Accordingly, to restore a high oxidation rate, small           amounts of a clean fuel such as natural gas are injected during the             final stages of the incineration process.                                                                                                                       The research will demonstrate that the oxidation of toxic organics at           trace levels is more difficult than previously believed but that a              simple inexpensive means can overcome this difficulty.  This will make          incinerations both easier to run and reduce their local environmental           impact, translating into lower                                                  costs and easier siting.",
