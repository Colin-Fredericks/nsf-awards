 "awd_abstract_narration": "Analog interface circuitry often limits the performance of DSP based            signal processing systems.  Since analog circuitry will not shrink as           much as digital circuitry with device scaling due to performance,               matching, and noise considerations; schemes for digitally correcting or         adjusting for analog circuit errors are very attractive in submicron IC         technologies.  In this work, techniques to improve MOS analog interface         circuitry are being investigated.  Parallel switched-capacitor filter           architectures, which will achieve an increase in sampling rate with an          increase in silicon real estate, are considered.  Additionally, digital         techniques for realizing small shifts in the frequency response of              switched-capacitor filters are researched.  Oversampled delta-sigma             modulation data converters are investigated.  The goal is to achieve            increased sampling rates and improved performance using new switching           schemes.  And since shrinking device dimensions for a reduction in the          power supply voltage, analog circuits operating off a 3-Volt supply are         also explored.                                                                                                                                                  The proposed architectures are evaluated using specially written                computer programs and available circuit simulators.  Extensive                  simulation of the most promising architectures and design and layout of         experimental test circuits are carried out.  Suitable circuits are              fabricated using MOSIS facility.",
