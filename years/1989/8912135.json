 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1986, public interest in Antarctica has increased dramatically.           In response commercial tour operators have expanded their antarctic             operations, particularly in the Antarctic Peninsula region.  Because            many of the tourists are U.S. citizens, the demand for visits to U.S.           Antarctic Stations also has increased.  The National Science                    Foundation, as manager of the U.S. national program in Antarctica, is           attempting to meet the demands of taxpaying tourists without                    significant impact to the research program.  Because the National Park          Service has extensive experience in planning and managing tourists at           parks and other sites throughout the United States, NSF has sought              their assistance to develop programs that will provide tourists with            informal access to U.S. stations without increasing pressures on                limited U.S. resources in Antarctica.                                           Under the terms of this interagency agreement, the National Park                Service will help NSF formulate, plan, and present interpretive                 programs and other visitor activities and will provide NSF with the             following:                                                                      o    a video tape (approximately 15 minutes long) to be shown to                     tourists visiting Palmer Station.                                          o    interpreter services at Palmer Station between January and March                1990.                                                                      o    planning and other services as determined by both agencies.",
