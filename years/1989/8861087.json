 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is to commercialize a competitive system using woody biomass          as feed-stock for conversion to calcium acetate, an alternative road            salt.  This new organic road salt will prevent corrosion of bridge              decks, underground cables, and rusting of cars and trucks.  Calcium             acetate from woody biomass will reduce costs, compared to petroleum             and natural gas for making this material.  The process is based on a            \"packed bed\" fermenter to produce acetic acid from woody biomass, as            well as liquid ion exchange to recover acetic acid from the fermenter           broth prior to the final production step which occurs with passing the          acetic acid over limestone.  In Phase I:  a) percent bioconversion and          kinetics of woody biomass to acetic acid will be confirmed in small             batch fermenters; b) partition coefficients for acetic acid recovery            will be documented; and c) rates of conversion to calcium acetate will          be determined.                                                                                                                                                  This investigation will show that woody biomass can be readily                  bioconverted to CMA.  No organic waste, such as whey, or a primary              crop such as corn, exists in such large quantities as does woody                biomass, in order to produce the vast amounts of road salt used each            year.  Commercialization will be in the areas of the \"frostbelt\"                states where economic vigor will be welcomed.",
