 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Gary L. Haller of the Department of Chemical                Engineering, Yale University, in a research collaboration with Johannes         A. Lercher, Institute for Physical Chemistry, Technical University of           Vienna, Austria.  These scientists share an interest in the surface             chemistry of bimetallic catalysts, particularly platinum/nickel and             platinum/cobalt which vary significantly in their catalytic and other           chemical properties.  The goal of their collaborative research is to            understand the role of support effects on stabilization of non-zero             valent metal species and on hydrogen absorption-desorption                      equilibrium.  Several supports will be used.  Catalysts will be                 characterized by chemical methods and by physical methods such as x-ray         diffraction, extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis,         time resolved Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, etc.  The         rates of hydrogen absorption/desorption, the equilibrium isotherm and           several hydrogenation reactions will be used as chemical probes.  The           collaborative arrangement expedites this work by bringing to bear               complementary expertise in physical characterization (EXAFS on the US           side and time resolved FTIR spectroscopy on the Austrian side) as well          as a division of labor in carrying out different reaction studies on            the same catalysts in the two laboratories.                                                                                                                     Although transition metals are among the most frequently used catalysts         for hydrogenation reactions, the reasons for their high activity and            for particular selectivities in hydrogenation of more complex organic           molecules are, at best, only qualitatively understood.  Numerous                concepts have been proposed to explain their selectivity, including             work carried out independently by these collaborating scientists which          showed that support effects on hydrogen absorption equilibrium and the          presence of non-zero valent metal sites may greatly affect the                  selectivity of hydrogenation reactions.  One of the objectives of the           joint research is to establish the relative importance of these two             factors.  Understanding and manipulating these properties may lead to           significant improvements in the activity and selectivity of the                 hydrogenation reactions.",
