 "awd_abstract_narration": "An equipment proposal is submitted to the NSF UNIDATA                      program for the purchase of a microcomputer system capable of                   running the PC-McIDAS software developed by the University of                   Wisconsin.  The PC-McIDAS hardware/software system will provide                 real-time visible, infrared and water vapor satellite imagery                   in an animated form in color on an IBM color graphics screen.                   Applications of this system to teaching, research and the                       meteorological community are described in the proposal.  This                   system will be integrated with our current MASSCOMP mini-                       computer, which presently handles data from the FAA-604 data                    line, to permit our students to fully diagnose and analyze                      weather systems down to mesoscales of motion.  In addition,                     this system will broaden our areas of research potential in                     mesometeorology, severe storm prediction, tropical meteorology,                 satellite meteorology and radiative processes.  Finally,                        examples of developed lab-menus and other meteorological                        software are given to demonstrate ways in which St. Louis                       University may contribute to the total UNIDATA effort.                               Overall, the goal of this proposal is to update St. Louis                  University's weather receiving equipment and create an                          interactive graphics computing environment for the education of                 future meteorologists.  The proposed system will help us                        maintain a strong, relevant meteorology program necessary for                   the training of meteorologists in the 1990's.",
