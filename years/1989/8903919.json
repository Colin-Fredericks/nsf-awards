 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most difficult problems in stratigraphy is that of                   developing a global biostratigraphic framework based on zonations               involving different faunal groups, different depositional                       environments, and different geographic regions.  One way to deal                with this problem is to find a stratigraphic marker horizon to                  link the different zonations.  At the present time, the only                    common, global and non-time-transgressive phenomena in the                      geological record are reversals of the earth's magneticf field.                 The unique structure of the Magnetic Polarity Tiume Scale in the                vicinity of the Santonian/Campanian boundary makes this boundary                a particularly convenient place to use magnetostratigraphy to                   establish a global marker horizon.  PI will conduct                             magnetostratigraphic studies of sedimentary sequences that cross                the Santonian/Campanian boundary in Europe and in the Western                   Interior of North America.  The sequences in Europe include the                 stratotype for the boundary as well as other sections which are                 believed to be equivalent to it.  Those in North America                        represent marine, marginal marine, and terrestrial sequences, all               of which are believed to contain the boundary.  By studying these               sections, PI will be able to establish a correspondence between                 Santonian/Campanian biostratigraphic zonations on two different                 continents and involving a variety of different fossil groups.                  In addition, the sections in the Western Interior contain                       bentonite beds that will be used to obtain an absolute age for                  the Santonian/Campanian boundary.  The proposed project                         represents a continuation of work conducted under a prior NSF                   grant, which looked at the magnetostratigraphy of sedimentary                   sequences that crossed the Santonian/Campanian boundary on the                  West Coast of North America, and it represents the next step in a               systematic program to study the magnetostratigraphy of the                      Santonian/Campanian boundary in sedimentary sequences throughout                the world.",
