 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrothermal circulation at spreading centers is governed               by the thermal regime and permeability structure of young ocean                 crust; thus, it is inextricably coupled to the volcano-tectonic                 processes along spreading centers. For virtually all spreading                  centers the interrelationships between hydrothermal, magmatic,                  and tectonic processes are poorly known because fine-scale                      mapping of the sea-floor has been restricted to very small                      segments of ridge crest. The present recommended award will                     rectify this situation for a major segment of the East Pacific                  Rise.                                                                                   Using the ARGO deep ocean search vehicle, the project will              acquire both side-scan sonar and bottom photography from a one                  hundred mile long segment of this spreading center. This region                 has already been intensively studied using surface geological and               geophysical techniques and the overall crustal structure is                     therefore well known. Objectives of the present project are: 1)                 to map the location of hydrothermal vents, 2) relate vent                       distribution to faulting and recent volcanic activity, and 3)                   determine the effect of ridge discontinuities on volcanic and                   hydrothermal activity. Data acquired during the survey will also                be critical in locating sites for deep sea drilling to sample                   ocean crust.",
