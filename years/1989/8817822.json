 "awd_abstract_narration": "The association between insects and their food has major                   evolutionary, ecological, and economic implications.  This study                is the first to bring a broad, comparative and genetic approach                 to the analysis of prey specificity in insect predators.  In                    doing so, it broadens the basis for the evolutionary                            interpretation of food specialization, adaption, diversification                and speciation, and it forms a paradigm for similar evolutionary                work with other predators.  A sound knowledge of insect-host                    associations is fundamental to both pest management  and                        biological control.  The essence of pest management is to disrupt               the association between pests and their hosts (e.g.,)                           economically important crop plants).  Whereas, the goal of                      biological control is to enhance the action of natural enemies on               their hosts (e.g., arthropod pests or weeds).  In this regard,                  this project is the first to concentrate on the genetic basis for               the host association in an insect predator.  Ultimately, the                    knowledge of the mechanisms involved will help enhance the use                  and manipulation of predaceous insects in biological control and                integrated pest management.  For example, the genetic analysis of               host specificity could lead to the development of improved                      natural enemies, via genetic engineering, for use in biological                 control.",
