 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study, by Dr. Sites at Brigham Young University and Ira               Greenbaum and Scott Davis at Texas A&M University, has three                    major objectives relating to the evolutionary history of the                    mesquite lizard, Sceloporus grammicus, in central Mexico.  First,               several molecular techniques (protein and recombinant DNA) will                 be used to test a chromosomally-based hypothesis of the                         evolutionary relationships of seven known chromosome races                      (populations of morphologically similar lizards with different                  chromosome numbers) from central Mexico.  Reconstructing the                    patterns of chromosomal evolution in these races depends upon                   knowing their relationships from data sets independent of the                   chromosomes--hence the reason for the molecular markers.  A                     closely related second objective will be to assess the amount of                gene flow within two of these races, again using the molecular                  markers, to determine the likelihood with which a new chromosomal               mutation may persist and eventually be spread throughout the                    range of the chromosome race.  The third aspect of this work will               be the detailed study of patterns of gene flow between two                      chromosome races that meet and hybridize in a limited part of                   their range.  The second objective will also provide an internal                \"control\" for this hybrid zone study.  By comparing chromosome                  behavior in the sex cells of hybrid animals relative to that in                 pure \"parental\" chromosome races outside of the zone of                         hybridization, we can determine the role played by chromosomal                  differences in causing partial sterility in the hybrids and                     thereby contributing to a reduction of gene flow.  If this                      occurs, the chromosomal changes may foster genetic divergence to                the point that the chromosome races become distinct species.",
