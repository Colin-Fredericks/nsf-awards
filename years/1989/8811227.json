 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research seeks to elucidate the biochemical                        mechanisms by which cells acclimate to changes in the osmolarity                of their external environment.  The focus of the work will be on                the regulation of proline accumulation in response to salinity                  change in an intertidal marine crustacean which frequently                      encounters such environmental changes.  Previous work has shown                 that proline is synthesized by the organism only in response to                 salinity increases; experiments will now determine the metabolic                step at which this regulation is exerted and the mechanism by                   which the regulation is achieved.  While many marine organisms                  are known to accumulate proline in response to elevated salinity,               the metabolic site and mechanism of the regulation of this                      response has never been demonstrated.                                                                                                                           A second aspect of the research focusses on the influence of                    genetic variation on salinity response.  Previous work has shown                that some of the enzymes involved in synthesizing free amino                    acids during salinity response are genetically variable.  By                    studying the physiology of different enzyme genotypes experiments               will determine if this genetic variation is important in the                    adaptation of organisms to different salinity environments.                     Potential applied aspects of the project involve the use of                     genetic variation at specific enzyme encoding gene loci for the                 development of salt tolerant crustaceans for aquaculture.",
