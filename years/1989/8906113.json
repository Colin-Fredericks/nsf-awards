 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observations have shown that orography significantly                      affects atmospheric fronts - their strength, propagation and                    precipitation - but the dynamics of the interaction between a                   front and orography are still not well understood.  In                          particular, the interaction of the mountain and a front in the                  presence of a developing baroclinic system has not been                         investigated.  Under this grant, the principal investigator                     will use a primitive equation numerical model to explore the                    dynamics of this interaction and to isolate the physical                        processes involved.  The cold front will be forced by the                       shearing deformation associated with the nonlinear evolution of                 a baroclinic wave.  The inclusion of temperature gradients                      provides a more realistic scenario than has been explored                       previously.  The effects of mountain size and atmospheric                       stability, both in the presence and absence of moisture, will                   be investigated as well as the role of boundary processes and                   their effect on the vertical motion field.  Finally, the                        principal investigator will study the effect of the mountains                   on precipitation associated with the front.***",
