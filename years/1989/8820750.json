 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acquisition of a wide bore 9.4 Tesla magnet for the assembly                    of a solid state NMR spectrometer is proposed.  This research                   is directed toward the structural and dynamic                                   characterization of protein complexes (collagen), protein                       lipid complexes (Gramicidin A in a lipid bilayer) and DNA                       liquid crystalline phases.  Further use of the instrument                       will be made by individuals in a wide range of disciplines as                   time permits.                                                                                                                                                   Solid state NMR is beginning to play a major role in                            biophysics, especially in the realm of dynamics.  The other                     approaches to dynamic characterizations do not yield the same                   sort of detail that is possible with solid state NMR.  It is                    possible from specific site labeled biomolecules to determine                   a model for molecular motions with atomic resolution.  This                     model includes a description of the axis about which the                        motion is occurring, the type of motion, whether it be                          diffusional or discontinuous, the amplitude of the motion and                   finally the frequency of the motion.  With such                                 characterizations of the dynamics the potential for                             obtaining correlations between dynamics and function is very                    high.                                                                                                                                                           Many of the specific experiments described herein would not                     be possible on the present relatively low field (4.7 Tesla)                     solid state NMR instrumentation in the FSU facility, not only                   because of the low field but also because of the severely                       limited time available on it.  A detailed justification for a                   high field (9.4 Tesla) instrument is given, based on improved                   sensitivity (Boltzman distribution), improved resolution (by                    minimizing field dependent 14 N line broadening effects on                      the 13 C spectra), observation of low gyromagnetic ratio                        nuclei, reduced acoustic ringing (for 2 H spectra), and                         observation of quadrupolar nuclei with nonintegral spin.",
