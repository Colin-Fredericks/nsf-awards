 "awd_abstract_narration": "Petrological studies in southern California have revealed                  middle to upper crustal portions of two juxtaposed Mesozoic                     magmatic arcs one being a native terrane of the Cordilleran                     orogen and the other \"exotic\" Tujunga or San Gabriel terrane.                   Crystallization thermobarometry of successively intruded and                    dated plutons and their thermal aureoles have provided \"crustal                 nails\" to track the variable depth history of orogenic crust in                 both terranes.  Deep Mesozoic crust is now exposed at the surface               by virtue of two contrasting tectonic settings - lower plates of                extensional detachment faults in Tertiary metamorphic core                      complexes and upper plates of Mesozoic basement-cored thrust                    faults.                                                                              The goal of this proposal is to document the nature of                     Mesozoic are development as a function of crustal depth across                  the terrane boundary and to utilize this information to constrain               the accretionary history of this region of the Cordillera.  This                proposal outlines a petrological investigation of the plutons and               host assemblages in both terranes.  The approach is field based                 but includes petrologic, chemical, isotopic, and mineralogic                    studies to evaluate evolution of the plutonic suites from their                 inception at the source region to the condition of their ascent                 and emplacement.  Work to suggests that the two terranes were                   accreted by mid-Cretaceous, if not by the middle Jurassic.  Much                of the apparent \"exotic\" nature of the Tujunga terrane stems from               its partial derivation from the middle crust.  Work to date has                 identified crustal sections that one resided at depths to 16 to                 30 km.  These middle crustal rocks exhibit several distinct                     characteristic differences from that at shallower crustal levels                including the occurrence of Proterozoic anorthosite + charnockite               and an abundance of Mesozoic plutons ranging from unusally calcic               two-mica granitoids to a variety of intermediate igneous suites                 including diorite, quartz diorite, and tonalite.",
