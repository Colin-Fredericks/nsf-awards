 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project consists of a series of                                   electrophysiological and psychophysical studies of certain                      aspects of spatial vision.  In studies of the striate cortex                    (cortical area V1), the investigators propose to examine the                    arrangement of cells tuned to various orientations and spatial                  frequencies in relation to the cytochrome oxidase blobs marking                 the cortical modules.  The investigators also plan to examine how               the spatial frequency tuning and phase-specificity of striate                   cells vary with eccentricity.  In studies of cells in the second                cortical visual area (V2), it will be determined how these cells                respond to simple patterns which well characterize V1 units, and                to somewhat more complex patterns, to explore possible                          transformations occurring in information processing at this                     level.                                                                                                                                                          In the psychophysical experiments, the investigators will examine               certain aspects of human ability to localize patterns independent               of the characteristics of the patterns, and to study some                       problems of pattern discrimination which depend on ratio                        judgments.  Both of these problem areas were chosen to explore in               perceptual experiments certain issues which have arisen in                      considering the possible roles of cells in cortical areas V1 and                V2.  The results of this research project will contribute                       important information to our knowledge of visual information                    processing by the brain.",
