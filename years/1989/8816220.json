 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a seminar on \"Solidification Processing of              Advanced Materials,\" organized by Prof. Merton C. Flemings of the               Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Prof. Takateru Umeda of the           University of Tokyo, Japan.  Participants will meet in Sendai, Japan,           May 22-25, 1989 to exchange recent research results and promote                 future joint research projects.  The seminar will deal primarily with           the technology and principles of alloy, ceramic, and electronic                 material solidification, including rapid solidification processes;              computer-aided analysis and design of high-integrity castings; metal            matrix composites; innovative casting and solidification techniques;            and relations between structure and properties of advanced materials.                                                                                           This seminar will continue a series of such U.S.-Japan joint meetings.          In the five years since the last meeting, there have been many                  advances in new materials, solidification processing, and the use of            computers to enhance related technologies.  Japan and the U.S. are              the world centers for research on solidification science, and the               joint discussion of the latest results from these countries could               have important implications for high-technology castings as used, for           example, in turbine blades, continuous-cast materials, the casting of           intricate shapes, and casting of advanced materials.",
