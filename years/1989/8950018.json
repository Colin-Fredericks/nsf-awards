 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many institutions of higher learning that provide instruction in                astronomy do not possess modern, well-equipped facilities.  Further,            many introductory astronomy courses are taught by persons with                  professional training in another field.  The three week workshop is             focussing on these individuals, particularly those in community                 colleges, for participation in the program.  The workshop will include:         observing with an astronomical telescope, using portable telescopes and         other relatively inexpensive devices that can be used to stimulate              student interest in the cosmos, and illustrating a variety of                   additional activities that focus on the methods of astronomy and that           can be used to enhance undergraduate teaching programs.                                                                                                         Participants are residing on Tufts residential campus and are using the         facilities of the Whitin Observatory of Wellesley                               College during the first week.  The major part of the remaining two             weeks is being devoted to involving participants in the types                   of\"laboratory\" exercises they might use with their students.  Other             activities include a field trip to a radio observatory, discussion of           classroom techniques, and discussion of current research in relevant            fields.",
