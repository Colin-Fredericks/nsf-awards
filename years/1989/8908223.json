 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intent of this passive noise control project is to develop a                method for predicting sound absorption characteristics of                       heterogeneous fibrous materials such as needle punched nonwoven                 substrates.  The research will be useful in producing more                      efficient sound absorbent materials and in designing materials for              low frequency sound absorption.  This is a three phase project                  comprising three objectives: 1) the development of an empirical                 model for predicting the effects of needle punched nonwoven                     substrate characteristics on sound absorption; 2) the theoretical               determination of the mechanisms involved in the absorption of sound             by heterogeneous substrates such as needle punched nonwoven                     fabrics; 3) the determination of the substrate design criteria                  necessary for low frequency absorption.  The model development task             is accomplished by systematic measurements of the sound absorption              coefficients for a large number of needle punched fabrics.  The                 model is an empirical relationship obtained by fitting a parametric             expression to the measured sound absorption coefficient data using              stepwise multiple regression analysis.  The second objective is                 achieved through a three stage process comprising development of                structural model of the needle punched nonwoven fabric, development             of a dissipation model including a pore size distribution function,             viscosity correction factor and flow resistance function for needle             punched fabrics, and development of an acoustical model for needle              punched fabrics.  The third project objective is met by varying the             model parameters to predict the maximum sound absorption at low                 frequencies.",
