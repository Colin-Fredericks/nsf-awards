 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stability describes the tendency of a dynamical system to                  return to its desired performance after being disturbed by                      external forces.  For systems with controllable input channels                  stabilizability indicates that inputs can be chosen in such a                   way that a (possibly unstable) system becomes stable.  For                      systems with linear dynamics the basic questions of stability                   and stabilizability are settled, while for nonlinear systems a                  variety of sufficient criteria is known, without a general                      theory emerging.  This project is to study the precise                          exponential growth behavior of control systems, based on the                    theory of Lyapunov exponents, geometric control theory and                      infinite time optional (periodic) control.  The results will                    enable one to                                                                                                                                                   - characterize stabilizable and destabilizable systems,                                                                                                         - determine a measure for the stability or instability margin                   of a system,                                                                                                                                                    - compute exact stabilizability diagrams depending on the                       system parameters,                                                                                                                                              - pinpoint the design parameters that are crucial for                           stabilizability of a system,                                                                                                                                    - design stabilizing controllers.                                                                                                                                    Bilinear systems will be analyzed as prototypes of general                 nonlinear systems, concentrating on developing a general theory                 for necessary and sufficient conditions along with numerical                    procedures necessary to compute exact exponential stability and                 stabilizability diagrams.",
