 "awd_abstract_narration": "The economy and subsistence practices of the aboriginal                         Belyuen tribe of Northern Territory, Australia are changing as                  the group becomes more integrated with the national Australian                  economy.  However, Belyuen women continue to gather bush foods                  even though market foods are available.  In this project, the                   researcher will establish why women continue to concentrate on                  food gathering activities by analyzing the local ethnobotanical                 and ethnozoological system within an ecological framework and                   seeing how food-collecting has been affected by local and                       national policies.                                                                                                                                              In addition to extending our knowledge about tribal                             societies as they become more integrated in the national socio-                 political system, this project will increase our understanding of               how gender systems interact with economic and ecological systems.               This project has implications for developing societies and for                  industrial societies with non-industrial subpopulations                         throughout the world.",
