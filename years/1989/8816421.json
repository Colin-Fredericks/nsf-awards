 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of Earth history consists of long intervals of time                   dominated by gradual changes in climate and life.  These quiet                  intervals are occasionally punctuated by brief episodes of rapid                change.  Event stratigraphy is the study of these geologically                  brief and interesting periods of time in which rapid and                        sometimes violent changes have occurred.                                             The event stratigraphy approach to the sedimentary record is               multi-disciplinary, and involves a variety of laboratory                        procedures in conjunction with careful field stratigraphic                      studies.  Using this approach, we previously discovered iridium                 anomalies at the Cretaceous-Tertiary and Eocene-Oligocene                       boundaries, leading to the formulation of the impact hypothesis                 and generating a great deal of interest and research on the                     importance of rare events in Earth history.  Using a new                        analytical technique for rapid iridium measurements developed by                our research group, we are in a position to extend this approach                to the rest of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, and have already found                a new iridium anomaly in the middle Miocene.                                         We will do the following: (1) a systematic search of the                   stratigraphic record for new iridium horizons, (2) resolve of the               impact vs. volcanism debate over the cause of the Cretaceous-                   Tertiary mas extinction, and (3) study of the Eocene-Oligocene                  boundary to resolve discrepancies between iridium peaks, tektites               and extinction horizons.",
