 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between U.S. and                 Irish physicists on classical topology and quantum symmetries.  The             U.S. investigators, all from Syracuse University, are Dr. A. P.                 Balachandran, Dr. Rafael D. Sorkin and Dr. William McGlinn.  The                Irish investigators are Professor L. O'Raifeartaigh (Dublin                     Institute for Advanced Studies), Dr. S. Sen (Dublin University) and             Dr. C. E. Nash (St. Patrick's College, Maynooth).                                                                                                               Topological concepts and symmetry principles play a significant                 role in many branches of theoretical physics.  The investigators                will study the role of topology, and its interplay with quantum                 mechanics and symmetry principles in quantum gravity, conformal                 field theories (CFT's) and the theory of magnetic monopoles.  In                gravity, they will examine the rich topological features of three               dimensional spaces, the structure of associated quantum theories                and its influence on symmetry principles.  The properties of                    certain particle-like excitations called geons, associated with                 these spaces, will also be studied.  Other topics include:  1) the              properties of symmetry groups underlying CFT's and 2) the possible              restoration of certain symmetries at the quantum level, which                   classically are \"broken\" for topological reasons in monopole                    theories.  Both groups of U. S. and Irish physicists involved in                this joint project have extensive expertise in the proposed subject             area.",
