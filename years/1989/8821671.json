 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project will investigate the issue of                ethnic identity in pluralistic nation-states by studying how                    migrants from French Antilles promote their ethnic identity in                  France.  The project investigates how political legitimacy (in                  particular, citizenship) relates to defensive claims of ethnic                  independence.  A student in cultural anthropology will study                    Antillean migrants in France for a year, using ethnographic                     interviews, participant observation and consulting archives on                  Antillean and other immigrant cultural organizations.  The                      interaction of citizenship, race, class and cultural legitimacy                 or \"Frenchness\" will be analyzed as they impact the groups'                     activities in defensive ethnic independence activities. The                     student will also study the home base of the immigrant                          organizations through fieldwork in the Antilles.                                                                                                                This research is important because ethnic group immigration is a                fact of life in all countries, and an increasing fact in the                    Basic social-scientific understanding of the issues that impels                 ethnic groups to protest their ethnic-cultural independence is                  important if policies are to be formulated that satisfy                         legitimate goals.",
