More specifically                         Mischaikow is concerned with deriving algebraic invariants                      which describe invariant set, determining how they can change                   through bifurcations, and determining which geometric                           structures are imposed on the invariant sets by the algebraic                   invariants.  The guiding philosophy in this development comes                   from the fact that many differential equations that arise as                    models of biological, chemical, or physical systems share the                   following three characteristics:   (1) they are derived from                    idealized descriptions of complicated phenomena, (2) they are                   parameterized systems and the exact values of the parameters                    are not known,  and (3) they are non-linear.  Thus, from an                     applied point of view describing the global and robust                          structures of the solutions to these differential equations is                  of great importance.                                                                 Mischaikow's research makes extensive use of the Conley                    index and, in particular, of a relatively new tool called the                   connection matrix.",
