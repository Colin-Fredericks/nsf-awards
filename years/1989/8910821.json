 "awd_abstract_narration": "Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program is supporting the research                  of Dr. John D. Faulkner of the Ocean Research Division of the                   Scripps Institution of Oceanography, a part of the University                   of San Diego.  Dr. Faulkner will be studying the nature of the                  compounds used by marine organisms in controlling their                         interactions with one another.  In particular he will be                        studying the Mollusca phylum.  This will improve understanding                  of the impact of man's activities on the marine biosphere.                                                                                                      The observations of marine biologists and ecologists have                       implicated chemical messengers as an important means of                         communication in the marine environment.  Many soft-bodied                      marine animals rely upon chemical defense mechanisms for their                  survival.  Within the phylum Mollusca there exists a wide range                 of defensive strategies.  The majority of molluscs are                          protected by hard shells into which the animal can retreat.  At                 the other end of the range, the dorid nudibranchs have a                        dietary-derived chemical defense mechanism that has compensated                 for the loss of the shell.  Molluscs living in the intertidal                   zone require a shell for protection against physical damage but                 may also have a chemical defense against predators.                                                                                                             This research will continue on the structural elucidation of                    marine natural products from marine molluscs, particularly                      those from unusual environments and relatively unstudied                        locations.  There is strong support for the hypothesis that                     nudibranchs concentrate only the most effective chemical                        deterrents from dietary sources.  In addition, they may modify                  dietary metabolites to obtain deterrents with increased feeding                 inhibitory activity or, in a few instances, perform de novo                     synthesis of feeding inhibitors.  This research will                            characterize the structure of the novel feeding inhibitors from                 nudibranchs and to investigate structure-activity                               relationships.  The detection and selective acquisition of                      chemicals from dietary sources, their storage and functions                     will be investigated.                                                                                                                                           Molluscs that have a shell and produce a chemical secretion                     will be further studied with the goal of defining the relative                  importance of physical and chemical defenses to marine                          molluscs.  In particular, specimens of Bullomorphs and                          Lamellariids in addition to the Siphnoariids will be examined                   further.",
