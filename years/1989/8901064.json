 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation is a continuation of work on computations in the             theory of modular functions of one and several variables.  The                  principal investigator's recent work highlights several related areas           in which the use of computers, particularly, the use of computer                algebra systems has provided both clues and limitations to                      investigations in modular function theory.  For modular functions of            one variable there is a renewal of explicit computations of modular             equations relating j (z) and j (nz).  Computer algebra has been used to         increase the range of values of n for which the computations can be             carried out explicitly.  The purpose of these computations is to study          the singular moduli, where j (z) and j (nz) are numerically equal.              Likewise for Hilbert modular functions, it is now possible to find              modular equations.  Here the singular moduli are more important, since          they provide a clue to the manner in which ring class field theory              extends beyond the rational base field.  Indeed these modular equations         determine a manifold which has to be treated by its ideal.  The                 application of resultants to finding singular moduli is a practical             computer algebra problem.",
