 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal develops a well-known case study, the Sacco-Vanzetti              trial, as a vehicle for introducing the use of statistical language and         reasoning into the analysis of historical and political events. The             project is interesting from a theoretical perspective because of its            ability to offer insights about the source of a disagreement and the            use conflicting information concerning facts and values.  Very little           is known about how to conduct decision analyses in the face of                  conflicting interpretations of facts: this proposal should shed some            light on this important topic. The project also is interesting from an          applied perspective because of its ability to inform historians and             legal scholars about an innovative and rigorous approach to assessing           probabilities and structuring people's thinking about events.  There            has been very little use of structured probability assessment                   procedures to settle important legal and historical disputes: this              proposal should provide information about the use of Bayesian                   assessment procedures in this context.  Both the qualifications of the          investigators and the importance of these topics suggest that the               results of the project should prove to be interesting and stimulating           to researchers from a diverse set of disciplines.",
