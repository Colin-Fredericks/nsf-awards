 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation will test and refine a model of \"robust science              instruction\" based on current research on learning and instruction and          will also design and refine promising activities and technological tools        for instruction in thermodynamics.  A key feature of the proposed               approach to science instruction is the use of dynamic simulations and           real-time data collection to help middle school students (grades 7-8)to         analyze naturally-occurring problems dealing with heat and temperature.                                                                                         The approach has four main components. First, these investigators               proposed to identify and teach an appropriate, qualitative level of             explanation for thermodynamics based on expert explanations.  Second,           they propose to create and refine dynamic simulations for the Macintosh         and to engage students in analyzing naturally-occurring problems.               Third, they intend to help middle school and college student in                 integrating information by such techniques as creating a \"community of          scholars\" in the classroom, engaging students in predicting outcomes and        helping teachers model complex problem-solving techniques, and                  motivating students to seek a few explanatory principles for a large            class of events.  Fourth, these researchers propose to tailor their             approach to the needs of diverse populations including women, Hispanics,        Blacks, and the learning disabled by in-depth longitudinal study of             selected students.                                                                                                                                              Significant contributions to this project are being made by Apple               Computer, Inc. and the Foothill Middle School.",
