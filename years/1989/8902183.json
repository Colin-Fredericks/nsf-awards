 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in computer                            systems to be conducted by Richard Muntz and Mario                              Gerla of the University of California at Los Angeles                            (UCLA) together with Prof. Edmundo de Souza e Silva at                          the Federal University in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and                            Prof. Roberto Boisson de Marca of the Catholic                                  University, also in Rio.  They will develop an                                  environment for modeling and performance/reliability                            analysis of distributed computer communication                                  systems.  The goal is to give the analyst the ability                           to test new ideas, incoporate new techniques and build                          interfaces tailored to particular application areas.                            New solution methods will be developed to be                                    incorporated into the environment.  State-of-the-art                            solution techniques will be implemented as well.                                Analytic studies of distributed system problems will                            be performed using the new environment which will help                          guide its design in addition to having their own                                independent interest.                                                                                                                                           The two universities in Rio are currently building a                            Laboratory for the Study of Distributed Systems.  It                            will incorporate powerful work stations linked by a                             local area network.  At UCLA a large project is                                 underway to develop modeling environments.                                      Theoretical modeling developed in the U.S. will show                            directions to be followed in Brazil in building tools                           to perform modeling and analysis so that this                                   cooperative effort will combine the complementary work                          of two active and productive groups and be beneficial                           to both.  Software development efforts will be carried                          out in both countries, libraries of objects and                                 analytical solvers will be be built up and there are                            plans to advise Ph.D. students from both Brazil and                             the U.S.",
