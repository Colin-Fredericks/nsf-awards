The Director of the Center is Professor James                      E. McGrath.                                                                       The Center for High-Performance Polymeric Adhesives and                       Composites focussess on the performance of these new materials                  by investigations into synthesis and characterization,                          processing (the development of adhesive bonds and the preparation               of composites), interfacial phenomena (both fundamental surface                 science issues and tribology), and mechanical behavior of the                   composite structures.  The integration of these major areas is                  designed to permit a concerted attack on major scientific                       problems, the goal being to provide the basis for developing                    improved materials with superior performance or manufacturing                   characteristics.                                                                  Approximately 20 senior researchers from four academic                        departments at VPI&SU - namely Chemistry, Chemical Engineering,                 Engineering Science and Mechanics, and Mechanical Engineering -                 participate in the Center activities.                                             Chemists, engineers, and materials scientists work                            collaboratively in the Center to develop methods to understand                  and predict the performance of adhesively bonded and composite                  systems.  A major goal is to provide a connection among                         molecular, interfacial, and micromechanical phenomena in                        polymeric systems and their macroscopic mechanical properties.                  Emphasis is being placed on new types of thermoplastic matrix                   materials for composites, which have the potential of providing                 better properties and facilitating the automated production of                  composites.  Quantitative relationships between mechanical                      properties, interfacial chemistry and microstructure are sought                 to deal with the failure and fracture of adhesively bonded                      materials and predict their performance.                                          Vigorous outreach programs with industry and with other                       colleges and universities, including minority institutions, form                an important part of the Center's activities.",
