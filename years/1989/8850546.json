 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative effort is a direct result of discussions initiated at        the U.S.-Japan Seminar on Mathematical Problem Solving in July 1986.  At        that conference, several directions for future collaborative research           were identified and discussed, and there was unanimous enthusiasm and           support for undertaking cross-cultural collaborative research related to        the modeling of mathematical situations and the solution of nonroutine          mathematical problems.  The project represents a collaborative effort by        five researchers from United States, and at least five researchers from         Japan to study the teaching and learning of nonroutine problems solving         by Japanese and American students.                                                                                                                              The specific focus of the work in this initial phase of the                     collaboration will be nonroutine, \"open-ended\" mathematics problems.            The proposed work would relate directly to the \"open approach\" teaching         methodology studied and used by Prof. Nobuhiko Nohda and his colleagues         in Japan.  This teaching methodology (Nohda, 1983, 1986, 1987) focuses          on engaging students in mathematical inquiry through the use of an              open-ended mathematics problem.  Though their individual work on the            problem and through class discussion of various approaches and                  solutions, often during an entire class period or longer, students              develop an appreciation for the depth and complexity of the mathematics         involved as well as an appreciation of the various strategies                   available for its analysis and solution.  This approach has been used           experimentally in some schools in Japan.",
