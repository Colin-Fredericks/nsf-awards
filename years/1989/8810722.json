 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grasping in the pigeon is a stereotyped, morphologically                   unambiguous visuomotor behavior involving a functional                          relationship between quantifiable stimuli and response variables                (jaw opening amplitude/target size).  It may be readily elicited                and measured under controlled conditions, is modulated by                       motivational states and is influenced by experiential factors.                  The behavior serves a prehensile function but is also a component               of the pigeon's ingestive behavior.  Grasping in this species                   approximates the complexity of primate grasping but is mediated                 by a much simpler effector system (the jaw), involves movements                 confined to a single plane and produced by a small number of                    muscles.  The jaw movement system is amenable to experiments                    involving the correlated recording of movement and neural                       activity in awake behaving animals or Philip Zeigler will examine               neural activity in jaw muscles during grasping, develop a                       procedure for eliciting the behavior in the immobilized pigeon                  and utilize this preparation for studies of motoneuron activity                 during jaw movement.  This work is important because the pigeon                 gives us a model system from which we can study motor control and               fine movement even at the cellular level.",
