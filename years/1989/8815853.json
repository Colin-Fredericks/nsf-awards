The object of both the symposium and               the short course is to acquaint paleontologists with the latest                 research, methods and techniques in molecular evolution and                     computer assisted manipulation of phylogenetic data, so that                    these can be incorporated immediately into their own programs of                teaching and research. Both the short course and symposium will                 be augmented by take-home, \"hard-copy\" computer programs that                   will introduce them, on their own computers, to some of the                     phylogenetic programs presented during sessions. The conjunction                of short course and symposium will bring molecular evolution and                computer assisted techniques to a wide range of paleontologists.",
