Co-organized by Professor Jonathan N.                  Baskin of California State Polytechnic University and Professor                 Naercio Menezes of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, the                     workshop will serve to bring together ecologists, geologists,                   paleontologists and others to promote the exchange and                          development of ideas.                                                                                                                                           The importance of understanding and conserving the Neotropical                  biota is widely appreciated by both scientists and the public,                  but the diversity and complexity of the freshwater fishes is at                 best only beginning to be understood.  By bringing together a                   sizable number of researchers in the field from Latin America                   with their U.S. counterparts, this award serves to fulfill the                  goals of the Science in Developing Countries Program.",
