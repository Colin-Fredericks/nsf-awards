 "awd_abstract_narration": "Following a preliminary season of NSF sponsored investigation,                  Dr. Boone and his colleagues will conduct an intensive                          archaeological investigation at the site of Alcaria Longa, an                   abandoned medieval village site in the Lower Alentejo region of                 southern Portugal.  In addition to excavation, the team will also               conduct limited survey to find other sites and examine                          comparative materials from other locations.                                                                                                                     The fundamental question Dr. Boone wishes to address is how rural               communities respond socially and economically to cycles of                      economic and demographic growth and decline associated with                     succeeding regimes of conquest and administration.  In Portugal,                these include the Romans, Visigoths, Muslims, and Christians and                cover the period from approximately 100 to 1500 A.D.  An                        ancillary issue to be addressed is the problem of ethnicity and                 the social organization of medieval populations inhabiting the                  dry upland areas of the Iberian Peninsula where irrigation was                  impossible.  These populations are known to have been distinct                  from groups in better watered regions.                                                                                                                          This research is important because it will provide insight into                 how relationships develop and are changed over time between urban               and rural areas.  The conditions which held in medieval Portugal                still apply today to many areas in the Third World, and the                     complex relationships which exist between rural inhabitants and                 the ruling urban elite (who are often culturally distinct)                      complicate regional politics and developmental efforts.  Thus,                  the work may have practical relevance.  Archaeology has a unique                contribution to make in such studies because it can examine such                relations over long spans of time.",
