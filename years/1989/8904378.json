 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this project is to understand the                         nucleotide-protein interactions that are essential for activity                 of 2 enzymes:  the dsRNA-dependent 2-5A synthetase and the 2-5A-                dependent RNase L.  These enzymes play an intriguing role in the                antiviral and antiproliferative defense mechanisms of mammalian                 cells.  Phosphorothioate-substituted ATP and 2-5A molecules have                provided beochemical probes of these two key enzymes and have                   permitted the separation of the binding and activation processes                required for enzyme catalysis.  Photoaffinity labeling technology               is being used to examine the nucleotide-protein interactions                    occurring during binding and activation of 2-5A synthetase and                  RNase L.                                                                                                                                                        This project investigates 2 enzymes which regulate levels of                    oligonucleotides in cells and play a role in the cell's defense                 mechanisms.  In addition to the role of the 2-5A synthetase/RNase               L system in defense against virus infection, it has been                        suggested that the system may also be involved in the control of                cell growth, proliferation and differentiation.  Fundamental                    questions remain and are being addressed.",
