 "awd_abstract_narration": "During social interaction, people must devote considerable                      attention to the execution and regulation of their own                          behavior, and thus are often \"cognitively busy\" while drawing                   inferences about others.  Past research suggests that cognitive                 busyness makes people temporarily unable to use certain kinds                   of important information .. despite the fact that they have                     noticed, understood, and stored this information in memory.  As                 such, cognitively busy perceivers are particularly likely to                    draw erroneous inferences about others (the so.called                           \"undercorrection error\").                                                                                                                                       The undercorrection error results when people fail to use                       information that they do, in fact, possess; as such, the error                  should be reversible.  This research addresses four basic                       questions regarding the reversibility of the undercorrection                    error.  First, precisely what cognitive mechanism enables the                   error to be reversed?  Second, how can the prospect of future                   interaction with the person about whom one has made an                          erroneous inference sometimes activate and sometimes inhibit                    this mechanism?  Third, are there factors that render the error                 truly irreversible?  Finally, are there effects other than the                  undercorrection error that result from being cognitively busy                   and that are also irreversible?                                                                                                                                 Social psychologists consider the undercorrection error to be                   the most fundamental and pervasive mistake that people make                     when trying to understand each other.  Such errors often serve                  as the grounds for interpersonal and inter.group conflicts, and                 it is important for us to learn how they can be corrected or                    undone.  This research will clarify the mechanisms by which the                 undercorrection error may be reversed, and will explicate the                   situational factors that facilitate or inhibit such reversals.",
