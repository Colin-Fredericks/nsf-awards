 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graduate student Cornejo proposes to study the tropical                    columnar cactus genus Stenocereus using protein electrophoresis                 methods in order to reconstruct species-level evolutionary                      relationships.  Flies of the genus Drosophila and species of                    yeast are associated with particular cactus species, and this                   cactus-fly-yeast system has been the subject of previous                        ecological and evolutionary study.  Approximately 20 species of                 these cacti are distributed on both sides of the Panamanian                     Ishthmus and through the Caribbean, and the group's biogeographic               history is in question.  The proposed research on the                           evolutionary history of the cacti will allow comparisons with                   those already known for the yeast and Drosphila associated with                 the cactus.                                                                          The proposed research will test important hypotheses                       concerning the evolutionary and biogeographic history of the                    cacti, and will open a new area of research on coevolutionary                   processes involving other groups.  Alternate hypotheses will be                 tested, and the results will hold interest for a wide audience of               botanists, biogeographers, and evolutionary biologists.",
