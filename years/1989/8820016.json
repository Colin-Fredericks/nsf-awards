 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arizona State University Herbarium contains                            approximately 185,000 preserved plant specimens.  It is one of                  the largest herbaria in the Southwest and is especially rich in                 general collections of the southwestern United States and                       northern Mexico.  The specimens in the Herbarium comprise a vital               resource for anyone interested in the systematics, ecology or                   conservation of the native vegetation of the Southwest, and its                 holdings of cacti and lichens are of international importance.                       Over the last 20 years, the collection has grown very                      rapidly and a large backlog of specimens has accumulated.  The                  cabinets that contain the collection are also at or near capacity               and would be unable to contain the backlog of approximately                     40,000 vascular plants, 25,000 lichens and 1,000 fossils that                   need to be processed and accessioned into the collection.                            This project will provide funds to purchase standard                       herbarium, lichen and fossil cabinets to contain the backlogged                 specimens, as well salary for two part-time undergraduates to                   help in eliminating the backlog.  During the three-year duration                of the project, the herbarium will:  1) process all new vascular                plant specimens; 2) reduce the backlog of vascular plants by                    40%; 3) accession the entire backlog of fossils into the                        collection; 4) prepare all the partially processed lichen packets               for accessioning and exchange with other herbaria.  These                       activities will make the Arizona State University Herbarium a                   much more valuable and readily available resource.",
