 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chesapeake Bay Institute of Johns Hopkins University will                   acquire several items of oceanographic instrumentation to be                    placed in a pool of shared use equipment.  This equipment is                    maintained for use on or in association with the R/V RIDGLEY                    WARFIELD, a research vessel operated by the University.  A                      substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1989                   is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The                          instrumentation will also increase the capabilities of the                      ship and of the institution to support research and                             engineering activities.  The instrumentation includes:                                                                                                          -Data storage devices and other peripheral computer equipment                    for the ship's data logging and display system,                                -Replacement oxygen and conductivity sensors,                                   -Precision acoustic pingers for determining position of an                       instrument package relative to the surface or seafloor, and                    -Niskin bottles for collecting discrete seawater samples at                      various depths in the water column,                                                                                                                            The instrumentation described above will increase the                           capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored                         research and engineering projects.",
