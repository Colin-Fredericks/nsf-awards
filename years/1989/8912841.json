 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of solar activity and solar flares are funded by                   this grant during the current solar maximum (MAX '91) using                     observations to be obtained at the Swedish Solar Observatory                    (SSO) on LaPalma in the Canary Islands.  These data will allow                  the study of magnetic fields, velocities, and energy release down               to 200 km scales.  The goal is to further our understanding of                  solar flares and active regions by studying the evolution of the                magnetic field and the details of the energy release process at                 the highest possible spatial resolution.  The data will be                      collected initially using an existing ultra-narrowband tunable                  filter imaging system which has been developed for the Solar                    Optical Universal Polarimeter (SOUP) and the Orbiting Solar                     Laboratory (OSL). After the SOUP filter becomes committed to the                model will be left at the SSO for the duration of the Solar                     Maximum observations.  The 1024 x 1024 pixel CCD camera and data                system have been developed by the OSL project and Lockheed                      Independent Research Funds.  Based on an observing run made at                  the SSO in  the Fall of 1988, it is expected that these                         observations will provide long sequences of at least several                    hours with spatial resolution between 200 and 300 km.                                This grant will support observations in 1989, 1990 and 1991,               a one man-year level of data analysis per year, and some minor                  equipment specific to this effort.  Additional support for                      graduate students and visiting scientists involved in the data                  analysis will come from Lockheed Independent Research funds.                    Most of the equipment will be borrowed from other programs or                   provided by Lockheed.  The primary goal of these observations is                to understand how magnetic flux emerges, evolves, combines, and                 disappears down to 200 km scales.  The development of field                     configurations and sheared magnetic structures in active regions                will be tracked with measurements of magnetic fields, horizontal                and vertical flows, and chromospheric structures in active                      regions will be tracked with measurements of magnetic fields,                   horizontal and vertical flows, and chromospheric structures.                    These will permit more accurate estimates of the magnetic energy                buildup in complex active regions.  Energy release in flares,                   micro-flares, and non-explosive magnetic events will be observed                in detail.  The causes for many of these phenomena may become                   apparent with observations of very high resolution.//",
