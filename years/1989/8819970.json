 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central aim of this project is to explore in vivo the                       cellular mechanisms that are responsible for the retraction of                  certain axonal projections by identified neurons in the leech                   central nervous system.  Based on recent experiments, Dr. Macagno               believes that the loss of these projections is the result of                    interactions between segmentally homologous neurons.  He suggests               that these interactions are mediated by a signal that the neurons               exchange at or near their growth cones, probably through direct                 cell-to-cell contact.  The experiments are designed to test this                hypothesis and to provide the bases for the future examination of               the mechanisms involved in the signalling and response of the                   cells.  The principal approaches will be (1) to examine                         ultrastructurally the interaction between processes by dye-                     marking and computer-aided serial section electron microscopy and               (2) to photoablate, wholly or partially, the interganglionic                    process of one cell and examine the response of its homologues.                 These observations will provide further insight into                            overproduction and selective retraction of axonal projections, a                common and important feature of the development of neuronal                     circuitry.",
