 "awd_abstract_narration": "The company will investigate the use of magnetic fields to                      separate water and oil from emulsions of these materials.  The                  method calls for the use of very small amounts of either                        water-soluble or oil-soluble magnetic additives to impart                       magnetic properties to the liquid occupying the smaller volume of               the mixture.  Magnetic fields are employed to cause the droplets                which make up the inner phase of the emulsion to coalesce in a                  manner analogous to electrostatic coalescence, which is currently               used in desalting and dewatering of crude oil.  It is estimated                 that with use of very small amounts of magnetic chemicals which                 are designed to concentrate at the boundary between the liquid                  making up the droplets and the liquid the droplets are dispersed                in, that magnetic fields on the order of two Tesla or less can                  create coalescence forces of the same order of magnitude as a                   large electrical field.  Magnetic fields of two Tesla are                       commercially available and are widely used in many practical                    applications.                                                                                                                                                   The magnetostatic method is applicable to oil/water separations                 where there is high electrical conductivity in either the oil or                water; this type of system cannot be treated by the conventional                electrical method.  The new method is safer to use in petroleum                 refining applications than is the electrostatic method because                  high voltage electric fields are not employed.  Potential                       commercial applications of the research are in desalting and                    dehydration of crude oil, enhanced oil recovery, preparation of                 injection water in secondary oil recovery, waste treatment, oil                 spill cleanup, and demulsification in the food, pharmaceutical                  and cosmetics industries.",
