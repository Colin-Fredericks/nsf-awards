The                       contract also contains an option for processing the Federal                     Scientists and Engineers data obtained from the Office of                       Personnel Management.  The contractor will be responsible for                   creating and mailing the survey instruments; processing and                     editing the data; and generating final data tabulations in the                  form of camera-ready detailed statistical tables and 5 1/4 inch                 diskettes.  The contractor shall also provide additional technic-               al support and respond to ad hoc requests, as required by                       NSF.                                                                                 NSF exists under legislative and executive mandate that                    require, among other things, the development of research and                    development (R&D) funding and personnel data bases required to                  study the impact of R&D, to evaluate the status and needs of the                various activities, and to aid Federal agencies in improving the                methods of reporting R&D data.  The availability of timely                      statistics is dependent upon an effective data processing system.               Both Federal and non-Federal sectors use the data collected by                  this program to address key questions on Federal R&D funding and                personnel levels and activities.",
