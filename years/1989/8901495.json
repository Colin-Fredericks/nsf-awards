 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses several basic features of integer                  and combinatorial programming, a theory and methodology with                    actual and potential applications to a great variety of real                    world situations.  Polyhedral methods, aimed at convexifying                    various nonconvex combinatorial structures have proved themselves               as a successful and promising approach.  This research addresses                several basic open questions in polyhedral combinatorics, like:                 when is a packing or covering problem solvable by linear                        programming, which linear inequalities are essential to the                     definition of a packing or covering polyhedron, or to that of the               traveling salesman polytope; as well as more immediately                        practical questions, like:  what is the best formulation of a                   precedence-constrained traveling salesman problem or a                          capacitated vehicle routing problem, which clique problems are                  polynomially solvable, what are the most efficient approximation                methods for solving set covering, job shop scheduling, and                      vehicle routing problems.  The expected results of this project                 are new, useful insights into the structure of the problems                     investigated and more efficient methods for their solution.",
