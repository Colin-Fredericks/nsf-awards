 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop an alternative                       interpretation of layoffs which is fully consistent with an efficient           labor market.  Specifically, this research will focus on theoretical            and empirical work which analyzes quits and layoffs within a matching           framework that interprets separations as the outcome of joint wealth-           maximizing behavior.  A dynamic representation will replace the                 assumption of a sequence of spot markets.  This will carry over to the          estimation of structural models of turnover and wage equation                   estimation in the presence of endogenous turnover.  Other aspects of            the project include analyses of (a) temporary layoff and recall, (b)            the effect of subsidized unemployment insurance, and (3) the testable           differences between the joint wealth-maximizing and rigid-wage models.          $$$                                                                             The role for government intervention in firm-worker relationships               depends on how efficiently the labor market operates when left to               market forces.  The existence of layoffs has been interpreted by some           as evidence that the labor market does not operate efficiently in the           allocation of labor and the mitigation of unemployment.  This project           develops an alternative interpretation of layoffs which may be fully            consistent with an efficient labor market.  Much of the project will            focus on examining the evidence as to whether layoffs are in fact               consistent with an efficiently operating labor market.  Of possible             policy relevance would be the estimated effect on the unemployment              insurance system of                                                             reclassifying would be quits as layoffs to quality for benefits.",
