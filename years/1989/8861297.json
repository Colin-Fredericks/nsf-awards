 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-intrusive, on-line sensors of molten metal atomization have                 the potential to improve powder yields through improved process                 control.  The prediction and control of powdered metal production               processes are largely based on operator experience.  The complex                relations between the operating variables controlling powder                    yield, powder quality and finished product quality are not yet                  well understood.  Powder quality refers to powder size, powder                  size distribution, and the powder microstructure.  Rapid                        solidification will be increased by the controlled production of                smaller powder sizes; improved powder microstructure and chemical               homogeneity are directly related to solidification rates.                       Current powdered metal production monitoring practices are                      limited to visual observation of sprays by an operator during the               production process and a quantitative sieve analysis after                      production is completed.  Presently there is no on-line sensor to               quantitatively assess powder quality during the course of the                   batch production process.  Insitec has extensive experience in                  the design and development of non-intrusive, in situ                            instrumentation for particle size, concentration, and velocity                  measurements in fossil energy combustors.",
