 "awd_abstract_narration": "cAMP receptor protein (CRP) is one of the better characterized                  gene activators and provides an excellent model with which to                   study the mechanisms involved in gene regulation.  CRP:cAMP                     complex binds a select group of promoter sequences and                          regulates the activity of gene controlled by those promoters.                   This project provides a research plan designed to utilize                       mutant forms od CRP to examine the mechanistic role of both                     CRP:RNA polymerase interaction and CRP-mediated DNA bending                     promoter activation.  These experiments utilize both an                         acrylamide-based DNA mobility assay and an intramolecular DNA                   ligation assay.  A second aspect of this work is designed to                    investigate the response of the wild-type and mutant forms of                   CRP to changes in template DNA structure.  These studies will                   characterize the effect of varying DNA superhelical density on                  both CRP binding and CRP-mediated lac promoter (lacP)                           activation in vitro.  CRP:DNA binding constants will be                         determined in experiments that utilize a small (877 base pair)                  covalently closed circular DNA containing lacP.  The results                    generated in vitro will be assessed in vivo in studies that                     monitor, through RNA:DNA hybridization and integrative                          recombination assays, the effect of different culture                           conditions on both plasmid-born lacP activity and plasmid                       superhelical density.                                                                                                                                           A major focus of biological research is the study of mechanisms                 involved in regulating gene expression.  Productive interaction                 of RNA polymerase (RNAP) with promoter DNA sequences is a                       ubiquitous requirement.  Studies dealing with the individual                    regulatory properties of different genes have uncovered an                      important class of DNA binding proteins, termed gene activator                  proteins, that function to promote the association of RNAP to                   select promoters.  This well written proposal is submitted by a                 very experienced but beginning investigator.",
