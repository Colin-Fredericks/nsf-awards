 "awd_abstract_narration": "CPU speeds are improving at a dramatic rate, while disk speeds are not.         This technology shift suggests that many engineering and office                 applications will become so I/O-limited that they cannot benefit from           further CPU improvements.  Log-structure file systems will be                   investigated as a technique for improving the I/O performance of                general-purpose file systems.  In a log-structured file system, the             only representation of data on disk is in the form of an append-only            log.  New data can be appended to a log-structured file system without          seeks, even when writing unrelated small files; this potentially                provides an order-of-magnitude improvement in write performance over            today's file systems.  When a log-strucuted file system is used in              conjunction with an array of small disks (which provides high                   bandwidth) and a large main-memory file cache (which satisfies most             read accesses), it may be possible to achieve 1000-fold improvements in         I/O performance over today's systems.  This project will explore                implementation techniques for log-structured file systems, including            log management, log wrap-around, and the interaction of the log with            disk arrays and archival storage.  A prototype log-structured file              system will be implemented as part of the Sprite network operating              system and its performance in a network file server will be measured.",
