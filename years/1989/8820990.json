 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical processes frequently include multicomponent separation                 sequences which produce more than two products.  Such separation                systems are used for feed preparation, product separation,                      product finishing and waste treatment.  The separation process of a             chemical plant has a large effect on the total capital investment and           the annual operating cost - in some cases it might be the major cost            contributor.  Therefore efforts to develop systematic automated                 approaches that will produce near-optimum separation sequences are of           great interest to industry.  The goal of this research is to use                mathematical programming techniques to obtain a better understanding            of the general problem of separating several multicomponent sources             into several multicomponent products.                                                                                                                           Specifically, the work is directed toward solving the general                   problem:  synthesize such separation sequences with \"non-sharp\"                 (meaning neither overhead, bottoms, or side exit streams contains any           one pure product), complex, and thermally coupled units.  The work              plan includes:                                                                  (a) Performing a systematic study on the synthesis of separation                systems that involve \"non-sharp\" units, using mathematical programming          approaches.                                                                     (b) Investigating the synthesis of \"complex\" columns that may involve           several feed streams, several side streams and pump-                            around systems.                                                                 (c) Developing systematic approaches for coupling goals (a) and   that          is, the synthesis of thermally coupled systems that                             involve \"non-sharp\" prefractionators associated with several                    \"complex\" columns.                                                              (d) Investigating the simultaneous consideration of heat integration            and optimization of the systems that invlove \"non-sharp\" and \"complex\"          columns.                                                                        (e) Developing software for the automation of the approaches                    described in the above goals.                                                   In addition to generating column design criteria, this work                     should also provide information on whether separator units are                  required at all for the generation of the desired multicomponent                products.  Other alternatives may result in substantial savings.",
