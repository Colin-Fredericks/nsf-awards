 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will measure, describe, and model                    change in ecological patterns and processes over large                          geographical areas in ways that will test the utility of the                    landscape approach for analyzing and predicting changes in                      ecological processes (i.e. productivity, succession), for                       optimizing resource management, and for evaluating human                        impacts.                                                                        The work will help establish guidelines for the development and                 testing of spatial ecosystem models by testing the relative                     performance of different spatial simulation techniques and by                   combining new computer technologies with data-rich coastal study                sites.                                                                               Approaches that can predict the way landscape patterns                     change are crucial to the development of landscape ecology, yet                 no coherent predictive tools have emerged.  The investigators                   will synthesize current ecological data and gather new data for                 incorporation into spatial models that predict change in                        landscape patterns.  The theories embodied within a spectrum of                 spatial models, ranging from process-based simulation to                        transition probability models, will be tested using a system of                 descriptive statistics and pattern matching techniques which                    will be developed and evaluated as part of this research.  Models               will be developed for three different coastal landscapes, for                   which much historical data and ongoing long term research already               exists.  Results will provide: (1) increased understanding of the               processes controlling changes in landscapes; (2) principles for                 adjusting spatial and temporal scales to optimize predictability                in models; (3) comparison of landscape data sets; (4) principles                for determining the optimal type of model for a particular set of               objectives, scale and resolution; and (5) new methods for                       examining the goodness-of-fit between predictions and data that                 re appropriate for spatial ecological data and which require a                  degree of spatial pattern recognition.  Finally, to the extent                  possible, the project will attempt to synthesize the principles                 and methods into a generalized theory for predicting landscape                  dynamics.                                                                            The investigators are innovative in their approach.                        Institutional support and facilities are excellent.  Results from               the work should be of significance to the establishment of new                  basic ecological research directions as well as to the areas of                 land use planning and resource management.",
