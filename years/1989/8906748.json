 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kohler and his colleagues will conduct two seasons of                       archaeological research in the Bandelier National Monument, a                   national park located in New Mexico.  The park contains numerous                cliff dwellings and other archaeological remains.  Prior                        archaeological work indicates that Anasazi peoples were present                 in the park between approximately 1,200 and 1,500 A.D.  The data                also indicate that over this time period small scattered                        settlements gave way to larger aggregated groupings, and a                      similar pattern is seen in other parts of the Southwestern United               States.  Dr. Kohler and his colleagues wish to document this                    trend and discover its cause.  To do this, they will conduct two                seasons of excavation in sites which have been located during                   prior work.  They will collect ceramic materials to construct a                 fine grained chronology.  This will permit them to determine how                population changed over time.  Faunal and floral remains will                   allow reconstruction of both diet and changing environment over                 this roughly 300 year interval.  On this basis the interactions                 between climate, diet, environmental degradation, and social                    change can be examined.                                                                                                                                         Although archaeologists for many years have recognized that a                   process of population aggregation occurred in the prehistoric                   Southwest, it has been difficult to isolate the forces which                    underlay this development.  Dr. Kohler believes that population                 growth led to the depletion of wild resources and the need to                   intensify agricultural production.  These factors in turn                       elicited social responses that favored the development of                       aggregation.  This project will provide data to test the                        hypothesis.                                                                                                                                                     This research is important for several reasons.  It will shed                   light on the factors which led to the development of complex                    societies, such as our own.  It will also increase our                          understanding of native American prehistory and provide useful                  environmental data for the management of Bandelier national park.               Finally, since this research will be conducted in conjunction                   with an archaeological summer field school, it help to train                    students and encourage them to pursue careers in science.",
