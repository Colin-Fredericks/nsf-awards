 "awd_abstract_narration": "One area of computer science that is not adequately addressed in most           curricula is the area of data communications and computer networks.  In         most cases, there are no laboratories to support this type of course.           The purpose of this project is to establish an undergraduate course in          data communications and computer networks, and to develop an                    undergraduate data communications laboratory to support instruction in          this area.  The intent is to provide a laboratory devoted exclusively           to providing computer science and computer engineering students with            exposure to the hardware and software components of data communications         and computer networks.  The laboratory equipment would consist of ten           IBM compatible microcomputers specifically equipped so as to provide            the capability to rapidly reconfigure the computers into a variety of           telecommunications topologies.  A series of experiments would be                developed with the goal of giving the student hands-on experience with          data communications.  In these experiments, the students would develop          an understanding of data communications hardware, and write data                communications software.",
