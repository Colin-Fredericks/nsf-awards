Dr. Hoffmann, a Nobel Prize winner in                       chemistry, has built up at Cornell University one of the world's                leading groups interested in bonding in molecules.  Dr. Saillard is             a distinguished crystallographer and applied theoretical chemist,               who has collaborated successfully with Dr. Hoffmann over the last               several years.                                                                                                                                                  Some elements readily form bonded diatomic pairs in molecular and               extended solid state structures.  Examples are sulfur (in pyrites,              marcasites and many molecular complexes), phosphorus, boron, and                silicon.  On the other hand, oxygen and hydrogen diatomic molecular             units in extended strucures are unknown (except for some peroxides)             and diatomic carbon entities are rare, occuring mostly in rare                  earth and actinide structures.  But the same units are known in                 discrete molecules.  In this joint project Drs. Hoffman and                     Saillard will study theoretically the conditions for stabilizing                diatomic oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen in extended solid                state materials",
