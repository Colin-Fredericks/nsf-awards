 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant funds an Industry/University Cooperative Research               Fellowship to allow the principal investigator to work with two                 industry researchers during the summer.                                              The recent development of sophisticated instrumentation has                allowed for the direct characterization of microwave and                        millimeter-wave devices from on-wafer measurements, eliminating                 the need for complex test fixtures and the uncertainty that these               fixtures introduce into microwave measurements.  Wafer-probing                  stations used in conjunction with standard microwave network                    analyzers allow for direct determination of device S-parameters                 without extensive de-embedding procedures, thus achieving                       accuracies heretofore impossible.  Such wafer-probing equipment                 has steadily increased in operating frequency, attaining state-                 of-the-art measurement bandwidths of 50 GHz.                                         The current interest in monolithic microwave integrated                    circuits (MMICs) and the inherent benefits associated with this                 technology -- reduced fabrication costs, increased reliability,                 decreased circuit size and weight, and control of unwanted                      parasitic effects -- have provided the incentive for development                of advanced measurement techniques.  Accurate device models                     developed from direct on-wafer measurements will allow for the                  predictable design of monolithic integrated circuits to higher                  microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies.  In particular,                      careful modeling of the GaAs MESFET has received recent attention               in the technical literature.  As a key active element in the                    design of monolithic circuits for microwave applications, an                    accurate MESFET model is essential in advanced MMIC design.  FET                modeling from on-wafer measurements and verification of the                     accuracy of these models from independent measurements forms the                focus of the proposed work.                                                          The principal investigator is qualified to conduct this                    research and a grant of $9,355 for 6 months is recommended.",
