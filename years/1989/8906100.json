 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Prof. Gerald W. Feigenson of Cornell University          to collaborate with Prof. Kazuhiko Kinoshita at Keio University in              Yokohama, Japan for a period of one year.  They will continue                   investigations of membrane properties that are influenced by doubly-            ionized calcium, and in particular the role of doubly ionized calcium           in bridging biomembranes prior to fusion.  Experiments will be                  performed on sea urchin eggs, which are readily available and easily            stimulated to produce the processes to be studied.  Low-light                   fluorescence microscopy will be used to measure the time dependence             of the formation and breakdown of the calcium-ion-induced gel phase             at membrane contact regions.                                                                                                                                    The purpose of this research is to clarify the role of the calcium              ion in cell movement, cell division, metabolism, and other cell-                interaction processes.  While it is known that changes in cytoplasmic           calcium ion concentration can greatly affect these phenomena, the               mechanisms of the effects are unknown.  This work has major impli-              cations for the understanding of organic chemical reaction dynamics.            Dr. Kinoshita's expertise and the equipment at his disposal will be             assets to Dr. Feigensn's proposed collaboration.",
