 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. S. W.                McKeever, Oklahoma State University and Dr. P. D. Townsend,                     University of Sussex, England.  Dr. McKeever will spend six months              in Dr. Townsend's laboratory, working on three distinct projects:               1) conductivity and cathodoluminescence of II-VI semiconductors, 2)             absorption and luminescence of doped lithium fluoride and 3) the                thermoluminescence (TL) of quartz. During this period, Dr. McKeever             will make extensive use of apparatus for the recording of 3D TL                 glow-curves and of cathodoluminescence.  The 3D TL facilities in                particular are unique and not available at Dr. McKeever's home                  institution.                                                                                                                                                    The materials which will be studied are cadmium telluride, lithium              fluoride and silicon dioxide.  Each of these materials has                      significant technological importance.  In the CdTe work, the                    investigators will examine edge emission during low temperature                 cathodoluminescence in order to study bound exciton relaxation                  luminescence.  The purpose is to characterize the excitonic states              in different samples and to use this information in the study of                the non-linear optical properties of the material.  The '3D' TL                 apparatus will be used for the lithium fluoride studies.  The                   lithium fluoride samples are variously doped with copper,                       magnesium, and phosphorus impurities.  The investigators will look              for evidence of perturbations in the emission due to impurity                   clustering effects within the lattice.  These properties are to be              used in assessing the optimal impurity concentrations and method of             production of lithium fluoride:  copper, magnesium, and titanium                for dosimetry applications.  The silicon dioxide work will involve              cathodoluminescence and 3D TL measurements to examine the effects               on the luminescence properties of various thermal, radiation and                electrolitic sweeping treatments in order to more clearly                       understand the TL behavior of this material.  Dr. McKeever is                   internationally well known in the field of thermoluminescence and               its application in dosimetry and in dating of natural sediments.",
