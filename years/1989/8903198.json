 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one year, full-time postdoctoral fellowship enables a recent               PhD in Technology and Society, with a masters in engineering-                   economic systems, to develop his capabilities in the social study               of science.  His research project will investigate the effects of               Federal funding policy on research in computer science, employing               a systematic, qualitative research study of relationships between               funding agencies, researchers, and university departments.  To                  gain formal training in grounded theory methodologies in                        sociological research, this investigator will work with two                     researchers, Elihu Gerson and Anselm Strauss, who are well known                for their development and application of these techniques.  The                 study will examine how variations in funding environments affect                the social organization, content, and quality of scientific                     resarch.  It will employ a descriptive, fieldwork approach,                     consisting of interviews of academic computer scientists,                       department chairs and funding officials, selected by a careful,                 non-randomized process which maximizes expected variations across               the variables of subspecialty, university, and funding mix.  Data               analysis will use a social worlds theoretical framework, which                  attempts to express the funding-research relationship in terms of               \"negotiated arrangements\" among participants of the intersecting                scientific \"social worlds\" of funders, researchers and                          departments.  This project addresses a central issue in science,                technology and society studies:  the impact of context on                       directions in science.  The proposed training will augment this                 researcher's ability to undertake research in this area; the                    investigator, host specialists, and host institution are very                   well-qualified to undertake and support the effort;                             collaborative work is likely to continue after the award period.                Results are likely to be appropriately disseminated and useful.                 An award in the amount of $28,000 is therefore recommended.",
