 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal fungi are ubiquitous in                   nature and have been shown experimentally to reduce plant stress,               to enable interplant transfer of nutrients, and to increase soil                stability, plant phytohormone levels, and plant absorption of                   elements in soil.  Because of these attributes, there has been                  considerable world-wide interest in these fungi among the                       scientific community and an increased demand for reliable                       cultures of VA mycorrhizal fungi has resulted.  Since they are                  obligate symbiotic fungi which cannot be maintained on culture                  media, cultures can not be obtained from existing microbial                     collections.  In October of 1985, NSF awarded a grant to the                    Institute of Food and Agriculture Sciences to establish a culture               collection of these fungi.                                                                                                                                      This collection presently consists of 548 isolates of 56 species                among the six genera of VA mycorrhizal fungi.  In the first two                 years of its operation, over 300 cultures were sent to 92                       researchers.                                                                                                                                                    This project provides partial operational funding for the                       collection for the next 15 months.",
