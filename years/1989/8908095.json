 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to generate funds to purchase a                 VAX 6210 computer to replace the VAX 750 which currently                        functions as a central computer resource within the Medical                     Center.  This central computer provides databank storage and                    computing power for nearly all research scientists in the Medical               Center whose work involves molecular biology.  Any project that                 focuses on the determination of DNA or protein sequences and                    seeks to relate those sequences to ones obtained by other                       laboratories needs to have access to a data bank containing this                information, and the programs to rapidly and reliably exploit it.                                                                                               The goal of the shared resource is to enhance current services                  and to provide new facilities, some under development in the                    Medical Center.  These resources consist in new databases, tools                for the visualization of molecular structure, and image                         processing tools employing file and compute service technologies.               Investigators will therefore be able to explore biological                      structure at all levels from the molecular to the cellular, an                  opportunity not available at present at the Medical Center.  The                PI and the Co-PIs are currently, and expect to continue to be                   major users of the computer system in the future.  They share a                 commitment to a shared computing resource and are involved in                   projects which will enhance its value to the Medical Center                     community.",
