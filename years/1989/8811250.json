A central                  focus of investigation will be the similarities and differences                 between quantification expressed with determiners and                           quantification expressed with adverbs, auxiliary verbs, and                     verbal affixes.  Considerable attention will be paid to certain                 non-Indo-European languages which appear to make little or no                   use of determiners for essentially quantificational purposes.                   The six-week workshop, June 26- August 4, 1989, will be a  closed               working group with three organizers and approximately  thirteen                 invited scholars representing a wide range of language expertise                and considerable variety of theoretical frameworks.   There will                be a one-day conference on the topic of the workshop  on a                      saturday during the Institute, presented by the workshop                        participants, and open to everyone interested.  The topics of                   the workshop and conference are closely tied to the topics of a                 3-year project being undertaken by the same three investigators                 with NSF support.",
