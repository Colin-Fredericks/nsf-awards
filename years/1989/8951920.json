 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microcomputers will be integrated into the biology curriculum at                Ursinus College.  Initially these computers will be used by students in         five laboratory courses:  General Biology, Human Anatomy and                    Physiology, Animal Physiology, Neurobiology, and Quantitative Biology.          Included is a request for IBM PS/s microcomputers and compatible plug-          in boards.  This combination permits the capture and analysis of                signals from a broad range of biological instrumentation.  Laboratory           exercises in these courses are designed around working groups of four           to five students, and sufficient equipment has been included to meet            this need.                                                                                                                                                      Computer-assisted signal acquisition and data analysis has become               commonplace in scientific experimentation.  Computer literacy is an             important component of undergraduate science education.  The most               productive approach is student experience with on-line computer-                assisted laboratory experimentation.  This achieves the goals of                realistic data-gathering in a laboratory setting, and repeated use of           computers in a variety of different courses.  The project is                    significant because undergraduate students will be instructed in the            use of contemporary data acquisition and analysis in the life sciences.                                                                                         The college will provide 50% matching funds.",
