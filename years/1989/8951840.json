 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the proposal funds the purchase of laboratory          equipment which is used in a lecture-laboratory course in polymer               chemistry: materials development.  The development of this course was           assisted by an advisory committee of polymer scientists and educators.          The lecture portion of the course generally follows the course content          recommended by the A.C.S. Joint Polymer Committee.  Each laboratory             experiment contains two parts: a synthesis component and a testing              component.  The synthesis component provides students with experience           in common polymerization procedures and is used to prepare samples for          use in the testing component.  The synthesis procedures studied                 include step and chain growth polymerizations, radical and ionic                initiators, linear and cross linked polymers, and alternating, random,          and block polymers.  The testing component includes the use of                  standardized test procedures and test instruments currently found in            the modern polymer laboratory, computer interfaced test equipment for           data collection, and the use of spreadsheet software for data                   manipulation and presentation.  The equipment used includes a gel               permeation chromatograph, a differential scanning                               calorimeter/thermogravimetric analyzer, a vapor pressure osmometer,             viscometer, and a stress/strain tester.                                                                                                                         The institution is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.",
