 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experience has proven that exploiting robots for manipulation tasks             is much more difficult than engineers had expected and many attempts            at automating tasks requiring robotic manipulation have failed.  Our            research has led us to believe that a formal approach to specifying             the steps required for manipulation tasks is essential to developing            the required software for a specific task, and in adaptively                    controlling and monitoring robotic operations.  We have defined 14              primitive operations based on the reduction in the degrees of                   freedom which occurs when components are assembled or manipulated,              and from our initial experiments, these primitives appear to                    elegantly and completely define the fine manipulation required for              simple assembly tasks.  Each of the primitives has a strategy                   associated with its execution, and a set of recovery algorithms in              the event the operation fails.  The work herein proposed will expand            and further test the basic concepts.  Manipulation By Constraint can            be thought of as an approach to representing the knowledge required             to assemble or manipulate objects.",
