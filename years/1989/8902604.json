 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will use Nd-YAG laser vaporization of solid FeS rods to           generate Fe/S clusters.  Time-of-flight mass spectroscopy techniques            will then be used to detect mass distributions and intensities of               ionized clusters, produced directly from the pulsed nozzle source.              Patterns favoring stable species, especially those found in Fe/S                proteins (Fe2S2,Fe4S4, etc.), will be noted.  Mass selected ion                 photofragmentation techniques will then be used to identify the                 primary dissociation products and branching ratios of the Fe/S                  clusters.  If time allows these techniques will be extended to study            the interactions of Fe/S clusters with small cysteinyl like ligands.                                                                                            Interactive activities include teaching a graduate level cluster                chemistry course, and organizing and directing a symposium on metal             clusters involving outstanding women chemists in this area of                   research.                                                                                                                                                       This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women          to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater               visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the                      participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
