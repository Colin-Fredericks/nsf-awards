Based on an analysis of these approaches, the project staff,                    working with state education and science and technology                         officials, will identify state policy options and develop                       recommendations for state and Federal initiatives aimed at                      increasing female and minority participation in engineering                     education.  Specific activities of the project include:  the                    preparation of a background paper synthesizing current                          research and cataloging current state initiatives; the                          preparation of approximately five papers by people responsible                  for administering model programs focused on lessons learned                     from their initiatives; and a final report containing                           recommendations for consideration of the Governors and the                      National Science Foundation.",
