 "awd_abstract_narration": "Political change in socialist countries and increasing global                   economic interdependence and competition is leading to a                        reassessment of authority, hierarchy and individual                             decision-making in capitalist and socialist countries alike.                    Within countries, constraints on individual and family social                   mobility, attitudes towards workplace issues, and gender-divided                labor within dual-earner household economies are increasingly                   interwoven social facts, yet shaped by political and economic                   forces not confined to each country. In such a context,                         comparative sociological research on these topics, such as that                 indirectly supported with this grant, is a vital tool of national               understanding and reassessment. This award will support the                     beginnings of a timely U.S. contribution of data to a                           multi-nation comparative survey by means of a pilot survey of                   households in the Oakland- San Francisco area. The final form of                the survey instrument being tested here and later collected from                a broader survey of American households will contain questions                  paralleling those in instruments administered in the USSR,                      Hungary, Taiwan, Spain and possibly China. The recipients of this               award comprise a individually productive and influential team of                sociologists whose skill in survey methods and data analysis,                   experience in cross-national survey and field work and                          international reputation from their past research and                           writing commands the respect of distinguished collaborators                     abroad.",
