 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is analyzing the light-mediated control of                        expression of the RuBPCase large subunit (LSU) gene at the                      post-transcriptional level.  The primary emphasis involves                      molecular and biochemical analyses of chlorplast protein                        synthesis in cell-free extracts.  The chloroplast                               transcriptioanl repressionof elongation which occurs in                         plants shifted into darkness is being studied both in vivo,                     to determine how ribosomal transit times vary, and in vitro,                    to characterize factor(s) responsible for the altered                           elongation rates in dark-shifted versus light-grown plants.                     Initial efforts involve the continued development of a                          chloroplast-derived, protein synthesizing extract that is                       programable with exogenously added mRNA.  The chimeric LSU-                     CAT reporter gene will be employed in developing this assay.                                                                                                    TAhe regulation of expression of genes coded by chloroplast                     DNA is a fundamental problem associated with understanding                      growth and development in higher plants.  The research in                       this proposal is looking at the mechanisms of regulation of                     chloroplast gene expression through the development of a                        cell-free system that responds to the same factors found in                     the intact chloroplast.  The development of such an assay                       will markedly enhance the ability of workers in this field to                   address issues related to the control of chloroplast protein                    synthesis.***//",
