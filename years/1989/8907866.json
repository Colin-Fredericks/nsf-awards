The program             is designed to enable young U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct            long-term research abroad at research institutions of proven                    excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the conduct of joint              research and the utilization of unique or complementary facilities,             expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                     The award will support a 7-month research visit by Dr. D. Sherman,              University of Southern California, with Dr. A. D. Short of the Coastal          Studies Unit, Department of Geography, University of Sidney, Australia.         The research aims to elucidate relationships between surf zone flow             fields and bedform dynamics through a series of field experiments.                                                                                              The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,               international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents'                 allowance, if applicable, and a flat administrative allowance of                $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.",
