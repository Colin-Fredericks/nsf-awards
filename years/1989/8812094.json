 "awd_abstract_narration": "Major advances in technology have made it possible to monitor                   rapid changes in intracellular ion activities in living cells.                  the technique involves first loading cells with fluorescent dyes                specific for different ions (Ca  , H , Cl ).  Changes in ion                    concentration are then measured by monitoring fluorescence from                 the cells maintained inside the cuvette of a spectrofluorometer.                this basic technique involving a population of cells can be                     extended to analysis of single cells with the appropriate                       hardware and microscope.  Reconstruction of a digitized image by                a mini-computer allows 2 and 3-D analysis of cells undergoing                   changes in ion concentrations.  Currently, at Wright State                      University, there are as many as eight independent investigators                using related fluorescent techniques and sharing time on a single               instrument.  The available instrument has certain drawbacks as                  well as being heavily used.  However, enough significant                        preliminary data has been obtained to prompt five researchers to                request funds under the Instrumentation Program to purchase                     another spectrofluorometer with dual beam excitation, photodiode                array detection, single cell (microscopic) and imaging                          capabilities.  The research proposal of these five investigators                involve the measurement of calcium, pH, and chloride in diverse                 cell types, including astrocytes, vascular smooth muscle, and                   human diploid fibroblasts.  In addition, the requested                          spectrofluorometer will be used for studies involving membrane                  fusion such as that which occurs during exocytosis or viral                     invasion.",
