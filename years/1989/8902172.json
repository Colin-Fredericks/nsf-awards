 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the continuation of collaborative                       research between Professor Richard T. Hanlin of the University                  of Georgia and Prof. Omar Tortolero of the Universidad Centro                   Occidental in Barquisimeto, Venezuela.  The investigators intend                to continue to collect, identify, and characterize taxonomically                plant pathogenic ascomycetes occurring on crops plants in                       Venezuela, and to study the life histories of selected species.                 An illustrated key to genera of plant pathogenic ascomycetes in                 Venezuela will be prepared in Spanish.  The results of these                    studies will be jointly prepared for publication and specimens                  of the collected fungi will be deposited in herbaria in                         Venezuela with duplicates deposited in herbaria in the United                   States.                                                                                                                                                         Ascomycetes and their conidial states constitute a major portion                of the fungi that cause serious diseases of economic crops in                   Venezuela and other tropical countries.  Although the causal                    agents of the most common crop diseases induced by ascomycetes                  have been well characterized taxonomically, there are numerous                  lesser-known diseases for which the pathogen has not been                       accurately identified.  Information is also needed on the life                  histories of these fungi, such as the time of the host                          infection, the development of the pathogen in the host, and the                 nature of spore states produced.  This collaboration will bring                 together experienced researchers in a project of mutual benefit                 that should improve our understanding of tropical diseases and                  their causal fungi.",
