 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will evaluate the potential for using                the stomatal resistance formulation for estimating regional                     evapotranspiration rates.  This will be accomplished by running a               workshop at Pennsylvania State University in the spring of 1989.                The purpose of the workshop will be to clarify unresolved issues                in the use of stomatal and plant resistance parameterizations in                large scale plant canopy/atmospheric models. Subject matter will                focus on the technical aspect of measurements and formulation of                the resistance laws at the large scale and their applications.                  The workshop attendees will include an interdisciplinary group of               scientists from field of plant physiology, agronomy, hydrology                  and meteorology. The workshop participants will be divided up                   into three groups which include plan-scale, micrometeorology, and               macromodeling groups.  A series of 15 position papers will be                   presented at the conference and peer reviewed articles will be                  published in the Journal of Agricultural and Forest Meteorology.                The participants will also prepare a list of important issues and               recommendations which will be presented in a formal workshop                    report to NSF.                                                                     The principal investigators are well qualified to run this                   type of workshop and Pennsylvania State University has adequate                 facilities for this type of workshop.  The Ecosystem Study                      Program recommends that this proposal should be funded.",
