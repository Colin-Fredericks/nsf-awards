 "awd_abstract_narration": "G-4 DNA is a four-stranded structure involving four parallel,                   identical, guanine-rich sequences, with the guanines                            Hoogsteen-paired.  Such elements are able to crosslink four                     Watson-Crick duplexes.  Since during meiosis the pairing of                     chromosomes after DNA replication involves four copies of                       each chromatid, which must synapse together before                              recombination takes place, we suggest that a self-recognition                   of guanine-rich motifs in DNA to form G4-DNA crosslinks cause                   the synapsis.  G4-DNA crosslinks may also be used to align                      chromosomes in mitosis and in the formation of polytene                         chromosomes.  To test the hypothesis that G4-DNA-forming                        regions serve as identification signals for chromosome                          matching, anti-G4-DNA antibodies will be used to detect G4-                     DNA in chromosomes during meiotic pairing.  Anti-G4-DNA                         antibodies will be developed and used to detect G-4 regions                     that may crosslink chromosomes both with peroxidase and                         fluorescence methods.  This will require extensive use of                       high-resolution microscopy to examine chromosome figures in                     meiotic cells.                                                                                                                                                  The results of this work, if supportive of the working                          hypothesis, will result in a major breakthrough in our                          understanding of a fundamental aspect of genetic inheritance,                   meiotic segregation.",
