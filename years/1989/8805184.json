 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation by a                          scientist from the University of Jordan (Dr. M.H. Abu Zarga)                    in a research project with Dr. Maurice Shamma of the                            Chemistry Department, Pennsylvania State University to                          investigate the chemical contents of a variety of Jordanian                     plants.  The plants will include Androcymbium palestinum,                       Colchicum decaisnei, and Paronychia argentea.  The Jordanian                    scientist will spend about five months at Penn State for                        in-depth chemical analysis of these plants' contents.  The                      first two plants are known to be rich in alkaloids.  The                        third is not rich in alkaloids but is used in folk medicine                     and it is desirable to separate its chemical constituents                       including terpenoids, flavonoids and lignans.  Pure compounds                   obtained in the research will be forwarded to NIH for their                     clinical research and to industry to test for possible                          agricultural applications.                                                                                                                                      Scope:  The PI is a world expert in the research on natural                     products' chemistry.  His research in collaboration with the                    Jordanian scientist is likely to result in a better                             understanding of the chemistry of the plants being studied,                     and in better cooperation between scientists of the U.S. and                    Jordan which could lead to discovery of possible                                pharmacologically interesting compounds.",
