 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grasshoppers raised on hard grass diets develop relatively                 larger heads and mandibles than those raised on diets of soft                   herbaceous plants.  This morphological pattern results from                     developmental or phenotypic plasticity, a change in the                         morphology expressed by a genotype in different plant                           environments.  The red-legged grasshopper (Melanoplus                           femurrubrum) is ideally suited to studies of the evolution of                   adaptive phenotypic plasticity since preliminary experiments                    indicate that diet-induced plasticity in head size influences                   grasshopper feeding rates on different plants.                                       The P. I. has proposed a series of ecological genetic                      experiments that will test theories of the evolution of                         phenotypic plasticity by measuring the heritability (genetic                    variation) of plastic shifts in head size and by measuring the                  intensity of natural selection on the same characters as they are               expressed in two feeding environments (grass and forb).  The                    relationship between phenotypic plasticity and grasshopper                      fitness will be estimated from measurements of growth, survival,                and reproduction of grasshoppers fed in one plant environment                   (grass or forb) and then, later, shifted to a different feeding                 environment.                                                                         The ability of grasshoppers to develop different head sizes                in different plants environments enhances their survivorship and,               hence, allows these destructive herbivorous pests to persist in                 many different environments.  An understanding of the evolution                 of grasshopper developmental plasticity will provide basic                      knowledge about the conditions under which populations are likely               to evolve the ability to occupy multiple environments and to                    potentially expand their distributions into new natural and                     agricultural habitats.",
