 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Italy award will support a research collaboration between             Professor Donald G. Baird of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and             State University and Professor Giuseppe Marrucci of the University              of Naples.  The investigators plan to evaluate an existing                      molecular theory for describing the flow behavior of liquid                     crystalline polymers (LCP's) and to develop an alternative                      approach, if necessary.  More specifically, the investigators plan              to:  (1) evaluate and test a theory first proposed by Doi,                      comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results for                 both lyotropic and thermo-tropic systems; (2) carry out                         simultaneous rheological experiments and structural measurements in             order to develop relations between stress (deformation) and fluid               structure; and (3) determine possible directions for developing                 constitutive theories reflecting the structure found in LCP's.                                                                                                  There is considerable interest in the high aromatic polyestesters               and polyamides that exhibit liquid crystalline order.  High modulus             fibers and films, and in some cases injection-molded parts, can be              produced with these polymers.  During the processing of these                   polymers, structure and orientation are generated during flow to a              degree not found in flexible chain polymers.  Consequently, in                  order to design processes for liquid crystalline polymers, it is                necessary to establish the relation between stress and flow                     generated structure.  By combining the experimental expertise of                the U.S. side in understanding the rheology of LCP's with the                   theoretical strengths of the University of Naples group, the                    researchers should be able to provide deeper insights into the                  relation between deformation and structure for LCP's.",
