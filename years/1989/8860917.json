 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant cost component in many civil construction projects                is geotechnical exploration.  The research here focuses on                      development of a geotechnical exploration system that would have                capabilities not found in any currently available system.  The                  system under consideration is a combination of two known                        technologies, electric cone penetration testing (ECPT), and                     ground penetrating radar (GPR).  ECPT, which involves forcing an                instrumented cone into the ground, is an economical technique for               determination of in situ properties of soft geologic materials,                 but is only applicable to the depth of the first hard layer.  GPR               imaging techniques have been used to \"look\" into the ground, but                existing devices must operate from the surface or be lowered down               expensive boreholes.  The new device would consist of a cone                    penetrometer with a radar antenna mounted on the push rod,                      directly above it, thus creating means of investigating                         subsurface rock and existing subsurface structures at a much                    lower cost and with better precision than is possible with                      existing techniques.",
