The committee has completed two projects:  a                                    study on seismic effects on large underground                                   structures, and a conference on strategic                                       planning to reduce the potential economic                                       impacts of earthquake hazards throughout the                                    world.  Another study of the committee,                                         Estimating Losses from Future Earthquakes                                       (issued January 1989), was a project requested                                  and separately funded by the Federal Emergency                                  Management Agency (FEMA).                                                                                                                                       In 1989, the committee will complete its study                                  on earthquake engineering for concrete dams,                                    an evaluation of seismic policy adoption and                                    implementation, and begin a study panel on                                      National Earthquake Engineering Experimental                                    Facilities.  Further, with separate funding,                                    the committee will soon begin studies on the                                    following:  an evaluation of base isolation                                     techniques for seismic design of structures,                                    a workshop on earthquake economic issues, and                                   an assessment of federal earthquake                                             engineering activities.",
