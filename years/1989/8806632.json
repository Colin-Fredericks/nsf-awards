 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Takeshi Udagawa,                     Department of Physics, University of Texas, to pursue with                      Dr. Byung-Taik Kim, Department of Physics, Sung Kyun Kwan                       University, Suwon, Korea, for a period of 24 months, a program                  of research in theoretical nuclear physics dealing primarily                    with inelastic scattering.  In their experiments a target bound                 nucleon is first knocked out to an unbound orbit.  The nucleon                  may then escape from the target (knockout) or be recaptured by                  the target (knockout-fusion).  In previous research the                         collaborators have developed a theoretical approach to evaluate                 the cross sections of these inelastic nuclear reactions, fitting                well some of the available data.  In the present research, they                 will improve the theory so that inelastic cross sections may be                 calculated in both bound and unbound regions on the same basis.                                                                                                 Having developed the theoretical basis for understanding                        knockout-fusion nuclear processes, the collaborators will                       introduce the necessary modifications, and Dr. Kim will develop                 a computer program for carrying out numerical calculations.                     This computer program will be installed on the Cray X-MP                        computer at the University of Texas and tested.  Actual                         calculations will be made by researchers at the University of                   Texas.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the                       U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase                  the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and                 engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,                skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of                 mutual benefit.  The U.S. and Korean collaborators are highly                   respected scientists with extensive research experience and                     productive publication records in the field of the proposal.                    They have collaborated successfully in the past.",
