 "awd_abstract_narration": "TonB is a protein required for active transport of several                    ligand molecules across the outer membrane of E. coli, including                iron-bearing siderophores and vitamin B12.  The current model for               TonB function is that it couples cytoplasmic membrane potential                 energy to conformational changes in the outer membrane receptors,               which in turn results in transport of the ligands across the                    membrane.  The goal of this project is to biochemically analyze                 TonB function within the context of this model.  The relationship               of TonB instability to its function will be investigated by                     immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled TonB in pulse-chase                experiments.  Structural features of the unusual proline-rich                   regions of TonB will be analyzed for functional significance by                 creation of specific mutations using site-directed in vitro                     mutagenesis techniques.  The role of potential membrane anchors                 at both the carboxyl and amino termini of the TonB proteins will                be determined using membrane fractionation techniques combined                  with site-specific TonB mutants.                                                                                                                                This project will explore a structurally and functionally unusual               and important membrane protein.  The results will be of interest                to protein biochemists as well as cell biologists, since general                principles concerning structure-function relationships are likely               to emerge.  In addition, the information which will be generated                concerning the structure and role of TonB in active transport of                necessary nutrients may be useful in combatting pathogenic Gram-                negative bacteria.",
