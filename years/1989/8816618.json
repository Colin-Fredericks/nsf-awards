 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray diffraction studies will be carried out on two bacterial                  enzyme systems each involving oxidation-reduction and electron                  transfer reactions.  An electron density map for crystals of                    p-cresol methylhydroxylase has been computed at 3.0 A resolution                and the paths of the polypeptide chains have been traced.  After                the amino acid sequence has been fitted to the density, the                     structure will be refined and the binding of substrate and                      inhibitors studied. Crystals of amicyanin, methylamine                          dehydrogenase and of their intermolecular complex have been                     prepared.  Their structures will be analyzed by anomalous                       scattering, multiple isomorphous replacement and/or molecular                   replacement methods                                                                                                                                             Dr. Mathews has engaged in structural studies of biological                     macromolecules using X-ray diffraction methods for many years.                  His work on b type cytochromes has led in part to a working                     hypothesis of how electron transport proteins interact and pass                 electrons from one to another.  His approach is unique in that                  one of the systems under study has both the donor and acceptor                  electron transfer groups in the same molecule, while the other                  system contains a novel prosthetic group.***//",
