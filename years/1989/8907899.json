 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to a group of botanists who are                       interested in the processes that control soil nutrient                          availability in temperate and tropical regions.  The investigators              study both agricultural and forest soils in efforts to understand               the role of microfauna, nitrogen-carbon-phosphorus interactions,                root dynamics, nitrogen fixation, decay of organic matter, and                  water dynamics in the production or cycling of nutrients.  The                  requested equipment is needed to provide the accurate measurements              of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur needed for these types              of studies, and for measurement and analysis of root growth and of              the microfauna in the soil.                                                     The nutrient properties of soil and its relation to the ecosystem               directly or indirectly dependant on it for sustenance is a topic                whose fundamental importance has been widely recognized in recent               years.  There is now widespread concern about the continued                     conversion of forest lands to agricultural purposes, now largely                occurring in tropical areas, and about the kinds of land                        management techniques needed to preserve existing forest and to                 maximize the benefits gained from land where conversion has                     already occurred.  Key to the latter is a basic understanding of                the formation, use and recycling of nutrients in natural (forest)               and artificial (agricultural) ecosystems.  The use                              of equipment of the types funded through this award is crucial to this          understanding.",
