 "awd_abstract_narration": "The total CO2 concentration and partial pressure of CO2                    will be measured in discrete water samples during the scheduled                 1989-GOFS North Atlantic Expedition along the 20 W meridian                     between 33 N and 60N.  The total CO2 concentration will be                      determined at sea by means of a coulometer with a precision of                  +1.5 uM/kg or better, and the CO2 partial pressure will be                      determined also at sea by means of equilibrator-gas                             chromatograph method with a precision of 0.1%.  With a team of                  two analysts aboard (i.e. one for each instrument), 40 to 45                    water samples will be analyzed per day for each of these CO2                    properties.  With this rate of data production and with the                     precision of measurements, the CO2 distribution associated                      with major ocean dynamic features as well as fine features in                   the CO2 distribution within and below the photic zone of the                    ocean can be resolved.                                                               The total CO2 and pCO2 data collected during the                           expedition will become part of the basic communal data set for                  the GOFS participants.  Using the hydrographic, biological and                  chemical data, the following questions will be addressed;                            1) the orgin of a strong CO2 sink area centered at 50 N                    and 20 W, which was observed in the surface water during the                    1981-TTO/North Atlantic Study;                                                       2) the geographic and depth variability of the C/P ratio                   for regenerated nutrients in the water column using the isopycnal               analysis method of Takahashi et al. (1985); and                                      3) seasonal changes in the CO2-nutrient chemistry in the                   subarctic and temperate gyre regimes, and interaction between                   these two regimes in terms of the bio-geochemical processes                     occurring within the transition zone.",
