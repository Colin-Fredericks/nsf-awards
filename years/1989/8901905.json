Dr. Sah intends to continue his investigations in topics con-                   nected with the classical problem on scissors congruences as well               as various related mathematical questions that have arisen in                   such disparate fields as mathematical physics, number theory, and               functional analysis.                                                                 This very interdisciplinary project connects physics with                  several of the most active areas of modern mathematics: algebra,                topology, functional analysis. In one of the bridges that Dr. Sah               has constructed between mathematics and physics, he found that a                space curve related to the 4-state self-dual chiral Potts model                 in physics was precisely the degree-4 Fermat curve, of genus 3,                 long known to mathematicians and extensively studied by algebraic               geometers. In another, related development, Dr. Sah has been                    active in explaining the \"polylogarithms\", mysterious functions                 arising as integrals of logarithms, which have been appearing                   both in physical and algebro-geometric research.",
