 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to modernize a Biochemistry teaching                  laboratory to allow more effective instruction.  Improvements,                  which focus in the area of enzymology, protein, purification, and               molecular cloning, will be incorporated into an existing                        laboratory course required of undergraduate majors.                                                                                                             A new spectrophotometer and personal computer will permit                       expansion of a unit on enzymology.  The new instruments will                    permit each student to gather enough accurate data to perform                   meaning full analyses of cooperativity and the effects of                       allosteric efforts.                                                                                                                                             New fraction collectors and conductivity meter will permit a unit               on protein purification to be expanded to allow quantitative                    interpretation of chromatographic profiles.  The ability to                     collect fractions over extended periods or in the cold will also                allow greater flexibility in choosing enzymes to purify.                                                                                                        Finally, incubators, and a microcentrifuge will replace presently               inadequate arrangements for working with recombinant plasmids and               their bacterial hosts.  Instructors will be more readily able to                grow cells for starting materials.  Students will be able to grow               and analyze larger number of cultures, and will have more ready                 access to their materials at all stages of the experiment.  The                 grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds from                  non-Federal sources.",
