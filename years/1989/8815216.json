 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in die casting between           the NSF's Engineering Research Center for Net Shape Manufacturing at            Ohio State University, under the direction of Dr. Taylan Altan, and             the Centre de Mise en Forme des Materiaux (CMFM), Ecole de Mines de             Paris, Sophia-Antipolis, under the director of Dr. Jean-Loup Chenot.                                                                                            The research will focus on the development of mathematical techniques           and a computer program for the simulation of metal flow and                     solidification in die casting.  The computer program will be able to            predict the solidification pattern, microstructures and casting                 properties.  Through use of this program, occurrence of potential               casting defects will be predicted and avoided, by modifying the                 process conditions such as metal flow (shot speed), die and melt                temperatures.  Each of the cooperating laboratories offers unique               analysis and computer modeling capabilities.  In both locations,                researchers are working on the fundamentals of fluid flow and heat              transfer.  CMFM has extensive experience in the mathematical modeling           of processes that involve such as injection molding and casting.  The           Ohio State University ERC has extensive experimental and computational          capabilities and has recently started the computer modeling of                  casting and solidification.  The proposed research and associated               software to be developed may have important applications in industrial          practice.",
