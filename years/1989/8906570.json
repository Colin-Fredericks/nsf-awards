 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering research equipment grant is to acquire an                 Nd: YAG pulsed laser with a pulse energy of 50J to perform                      research in the area of manufacturing processes.  The projects                  for which the Nd:YAG laser equipment will be used include:                      (1) advanced laser drilling methods for the production of                       noncircular holes; (2) synthesis of metallic classes by laser                   glazing; (3) innovative laser welding of recently developed Al-Li               alloys; (4) laser machining of super alloys; and (5) development                of superhard coatings by laser vapor deposition.                                     The objectives of research with Nd:YAG laser equipment are                 threefold: (1) to address the basis issues in near infrared laser               beam-material interactions during processing; (2) to examine the                mechanisms responsible for the process advantages and methods to                minimize manufacturing defects; and (3) to assess the superiority               of laser processing over other nontraditional machining methods.",
