 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although there is much interest in shared memory multiprocessors, and           there are now successful commercial products for multis, scaling to             large numbers of powerful processors poses difficult problems.  Most            approaches either introduce geographical locality to the user or limit          the notion of shared memory by supporting caches that may become                inconsistent.  Multicube is a recently proposed architecture that               provides hardware-guaranteed cache consistency, introduces no                   geographical locality, and may scale to large numbers of processors.            The goal of this research project is to study the Multicube approach to         building scalable, large-scale shared-memory multiprocessors.                                                                                                   The multicube architecture is based on shared buses, multilevel caches,         and cache consistency protocols.  A novel set of synchronization                primitives has been proposed as an extension to the cache consistency           protocol.                                                                                                                                                       The project encompasses the study of memory reference and                       synchronization behavior of existing parallel programs, scalability             issues, bus implementation issues, the implications of clustering of            processors, I/O, particularly swapping and virtual memory, and a                variety of other architectural issues for the system.",
