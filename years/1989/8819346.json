 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the proposed research Dr. Schmid-Schoenbein is concerned about blood         flow in skeletal muscle and its engineering analysis.  The long term            objective is to develop a theory of transport in skeletal muscle which          explains in full detail how nutrients are carried to the muscle cells,          metabolites are controlled and under what conditions muscle is subject          to injury by our own white blood cells.                                                                                                                         The PI's original objective was to develop a quantitative biomechanical         model of the microcirculation in skeletal muscle as a keystone to an            understanding of transport and organ function.  In the past the                 following objectives were met: the micro-anatomy in a selected muscle           was defined in a complete and quantitative way; the passive vessel and          blood properties were established, and a new theory of blood flow was           formulated and critically tested against independent microvascular and          whole organ measurements. The PI now proposes to expand the scope of            the theory to include myogenic autoregulation with experimental                 verification and a detailed analysis of leukocyte mediated                      microvascular resistance.  Dr. Schmid-Schoenbein's previous theory and          recent measurements showed a surprisingly high microvascular resistance         in rat skeletal muscle perfused with deactivated granulocytes.  More            specific measurements for activated granulocytes and other leukocytes           are needed in light of their importance in pathophysiology.                                                                                                     The PI's approach constitutes a systematic analysis of microcirculation         in skeletal muscle; it serves to unify numerous physiological                   observations, and it sets the basis for eventual analysis of problems in        muscle exercise.",
