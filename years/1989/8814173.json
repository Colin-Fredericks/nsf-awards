 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last two decades, there has been an outpouring of                      research by scholars on the causes and determinants of violence.                While this work has expanded our knowledge, it has often dealt                  with symptoms rather than causes, interventions and penalties                   rather than prevention, and criminal violence rather than                       violence more generally.  Furthermore, studies have usually been                concerned with limited domains--for example, violence by                        strangers or family members of by adults or youth.  Finally,                    research has tended to emphasize particular kinds of explanations               of the level of violence (e.g., individual characteristics,                     situational attributes, cultural conditions, risks of penalties)                or has focused on the social control functions of different                     institutions.  While some studies have withstood reanalysis and                 replication, others have not.  A need remains for theoretical and               empirical integration and for the development of a cogent agenda                for future research.                                                                                                                                            With these goals at the fore, the National Academy of Sciences'                 Committee on Research on Law Enforcement and the Administration                 of Justice is convening a Panel on the Understanding and Control                of Violence.  Over the next two years, with funding primarily                   from the National Science Foundation and the National Institute                 of Justice, an interdisciplinary Panel of distinguished scholars                from a range of academic perspectives will review and synthesize                knowledge about violent behavior and recommend directions for                   research that can advance knowledge and inform policy.  The Panel               will assemble data on patterns and trends, review theoretical and               empirical research on causes and correlates, synthesize and                     critique research on violence, compare and contrast findings                    across disciplines, and offer guidance on core conceptual and                   methodological problems.  This effort should lay the groundwork                 for more robust theory and empirical study that integrates                      biological, psychological, situational, and social factors.  It                 is anticipated that this Panel will address theoretical,                        measurement, and methodological questions that lie at the                       frontiers of our understanding of violent behavior; identify                    critical gaps in knowledge; and orient, if not reorient, basic                  science on violence for the decade ahead.",
