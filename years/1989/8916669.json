 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of Application and/or Algorithm-Specific                          Integrated Circuits (ASIC), or semi-custom chips, is currently                  the fastest growing segment of the semiconductor industry in                    the world.  However, the U.S. lead is fast eroding and may have                 already been surpassed by foreign competition.  One method of                   addressing this problem is the establishment of an                              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) on                     Ultra-High Speed Integrated Circuits and Systems (ICAS) whose                   focus is the design, implementation, and performance evaluation                 of ASIC for communications and signal processing systems.  A                    planning grant, NSF CDR-8820908, has shown that such a center                   is both feasible and viable.                                                         This award initiates an I/UCRC on Ultra High Speed ICAS at                 the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in collaboration                 with San Diego State University (SDSU).  The initial research                   will provide a unified and coordinated effort in (1) advancing                  the state-of-the-art in submicron microelectronics, (2)                         generating novel algorithms and architectures to exploit ultra-                 fast submicron technology, (3) designing and analyzing advanced                 communications and signal processing systems based upon ultra                   high-speed implementation, and (4) developing innovative                        computer-aided design (CAD) tools and concepts for next-                        generation dedicated ASIC chips for communications and digital                  signal processing.                                                                   Six companies and four federal laboratories will each                      provide $50,000 per year to support this research.  Extensive                   facilities in materials growth and characterization, device                     fabrication and computer aided design (CAD) are located at UCSD                 which is also providing a newly completed engineering building                  (125,000 square feet) with class 100 clean rooms, an electron                   beam lithographic system, a double crystal x-ray                                diffractameter, an Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis                  (ESCA) apparatus and a scanning and transmission electron                       microscope (STEM).  The ICAS Center will also make extensive                    use of the 21-seat Daisy Engineering Workstation facility at                    SDSU as well as their communications and signal processing                      laboratory.  In addition, the San Diego Computer Center (SDSC),                 located on the campus of UCSD, will provide access to their                     CRAY X-MP/48 super computer as well as interactive graphics and                 visualization facilities.  The faculty at both academic                         institutions is highly qualified to conduct the research using                  the available facilities.                                                            The Program Manager recommends that UCSD (in collaboration                 with SDSU) be awarded $100,000 a year for a five year                           continuing grant.  An additional $100,000 is provided for the                   first year's membership of the Naval Research Laboratory                        (Washington, DC) and of the Naval Ocean Systems Center                          (San Diego, CA).  The latter facility is also providing $25,000                 to augment the research in signal processing already ongoing.                   This award has been coordinated with the Division of Electrical                 and Communications Systems.  The total amount is $225,000 for                   one year.                                                                           Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager                   and/or the Director of the Division of Cross-Disciplinary                       Research will review the progress of the Center on a number of                  renewal criteria, including the following: (1) extent to which                  university-industry interaction and collaboration is                            developing; (2) extent to which the support base for the center                 is expanding; (3) extent to which a robust research program is                  developing; and (4) San Diego State University is required to                   recruit company memberships to maintain its collaboration                       status.  If review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will                    recommend support of the next period of this continuing grant.",
