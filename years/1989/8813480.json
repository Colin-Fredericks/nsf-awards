 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research topic investigates several fundamental topics                in coding theory as applied to reliable data communication. The                 major areas of study are: (1) codes with multi-level error-                     correcting capabilities, (2) weight distributions of linear block               codes, (3) block coded modulation, and (4) coding techniques for                error control. In the first area, codes are sought which can                    provide different levels of error protection for different parts                of a message. An example of application is the broadcast channel                where different receivers operate in different noise                            environments, hence requiring different levels of protection. The               second research area is motivated by the need for simpler schemes               to evaluate the error control performance of broader classes of                 codes. The third area addresses the problem of combined                         modulation and block coding to achieve highly reliable and                      bandwidth-efficient data communication systems. Similar                         techniques, but using trellis ( or convolutional) coding rather                 than block coding, have emerged as an important application in                  modern data systems ( especially for voice-band and satellite                   channels). The final area is the continued development of the                   idea of cascaded coding, which is a generalization of                           concatenated coding. This concept, in conjunction with the                      preceding topic, could lead the way to development of systems                   with extremely low error probability with a minimal increase in                 assigned channel bandwidth. In addition to suggesting specific                  solutions to current data transmission problems, this project is                likely to lay the groundwork for future research in coding                      theory.",
