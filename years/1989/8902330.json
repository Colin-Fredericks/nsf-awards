 "awd_abstract_narration": "Monge.Kantorovich problems (MKPs) deal with \"optimal\"                      correspondences between two or more masses of equal volume given                on an abstract space, where the optimality depends upon the                     context of the problem.  MKPs have a long and colorful history in               different areas of mathematical sciences since their original                   formulation by G. Monge (1781) and L.V. Kantorovich (1940).                     Despite the existence of separate results for particular MKPs no                serious attempt has been made to explore the interplay among the                various approaches.                                                                  The objective of this project is to make a systematic study                of the relationships between the methods and results in the                     \"continuous case\" of MKPs . marginal and moment problems in                     probability . and those in the \"discrete case\" . optimization                   over transportation polytopes and axiomatic approaches to                       measurement problems.  It is the belief of the principal                        investigators that the algorithms and axiomatic approaches of the               discrete case hold great promise in obtaining explicit solutions                for continuous MKPs.  Symmetrically, the methods of                             probability .limit theorems, normal and stable models . will                    lead to the identification of new mathematical programming and                  game theoretic structures, algorithms and models in the discrete                case.",
