 "awd_abstract_narration": "Resources will be used to establish an undergraduate teaching                   classroom.  This classroom will center around the UNIX based                    scientific workstations for the purpose of enhancing engineering                analysis and design.  The specific objectives center around the                 conversion of existing programs for use on the UNIX systems,                    incorporation of new programs which will soon be released for the UNIX          system, and thirdly the development of new programs.  It is planned to          evaluate an integrated analysis and design project which runs                   throughout the student's sophomore, junior, and senior year and is              interdisciplinary in nature.  An example engineering project includes           a bridge or water treatment plant and how the material taught in each           of the specific engineering courses would relate to the ultimate                planning analysis, design and construction of this project.  In order           to establish this plan, a computer classroom with the computational             capabilities of networked scientific work stations, file servers, and           peripherals is needed.                                                          Starting in the sophomore year simple analysis applications covered in          the basic courses will be translated to specific project topics.  In            sequential courses such as soil mechanics, foundation design, steel             design, concrete design, hydraulics, hydrology, transportation, etc.            the concepts covered will be translated to the specific project.  This          project will be a coherent computer-based analysis and design                   experience for the students running through several courses.",
