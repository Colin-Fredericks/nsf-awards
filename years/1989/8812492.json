Each rise of the interglacial sea floods the banktops and                       superimposes another sediment cycle upon the remains of the                     former.  To understand the geologic record of the last few                      sealevel rises, and more importantly, to contribute to the                      understanding of cyclic limestones worldwide, this project is                   focussed on the latest Bahamian depositional cycles and the                     erosional surfaces that separate them in both dished interior                   and ramped margin lagoonal study sites.  The present phase of                   the study will concentrate on (1) the carbon isotopic signal of                 the organic fraction as a function of the depositional                          environment, (2) the spectrum of paleoecological information                    imprinted upon banktop discontinuity surfaces as they are                       modified by sealevel encroachment, (3) the geological/                          geochemical nature of the present sediment cycle and the                        subjacent rock cycles, and (4) the geological/geochemical                       criteria derived from the cyclic deposition/erosion couplet                     that can be applied to ancient analogs.                                         %%%                                                                             The shallow limestones of the Bahamas accumulate in pulses.
