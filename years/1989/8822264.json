 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-day conference will bring together a diverse group of                international scientists to discuss and evaluate recent advances                in understanding the sensory systems of dolphins and whales.                    These animals have remarkable abilities and sensory adaptations                 for sensory discriminations, echolocation, communication and                    navigation, and their cognitive abilities may be quite advanced.                This symposium will be associated with the International                        Theriological Congress, which deals with all aspects of mammalian               science, providing an unusually broad audience.  The extensive                  participation of Soviet scientists at this symposium should                     provide new levels of interaction and facilitate a stronger                     global network of scientists working on cetaceans.  The results                 of the symposium will be published, and should have a broad                     impact on scientists of sensory systems, behavior, animal                       cognition, marine biology, and ecology; it may have an impact on                the global conservation movement as well, since these animals                   have become a popular symbol.",
