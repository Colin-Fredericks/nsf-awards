 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies in Science, Technology and Society supports projects that               examine the social, economic, and political contexts that                       influence the development and use of science and technology.                    Ethics and Values Studies supports projects that examine the                    social values and mutual obligations and responsibilities that                  arise in these interactions.  This project examines these issues                in the context of the electric power industry, currently                        undergoing fundamental changes in structure and regulation. It is               designed to explore the ways in which electric power planners and               policy analysts seek, through their styles of speech and writing                (that is, their rhetorical strategies), to influence those                      changes.  It also seeks to discover and explore the ethical                     dilemmas associated with those strategies, and to discover how                  planners resolve those dilemmas.  The project attempts to                       accomplish these objectives by conducting a case study of                       electric power planning in Chicago.  Relying heavily on the                     methods of participant-observation and depth interviews, the                    project analyzes the rhetorical strategies of eight to ten key                  planners who are contributing to, supporting, or opposing the                   City of Chicago's current effort to explore innovative options to               remaining on Commonwealth Edison's electric power system.  When                 completed, the project will enhance our understanding of the role               that rhetoric plays in planing, particularly with regard to the                 electric power industry.  It will also provide students of                      rhetoric with a detailed case study of how their research relates               to public policy making.  And it will provide students of                       planning ethics with greater insight into how planners interpret                and respond to practical ethical dilemmas.                                                                                                                      This study comes from a well-qualified researcher.  Research and                dissemination plans are appropriate; institutional support is                   very good; the budget is modest.  The project has important                     implications for our understanding of how expertise operates in                 political contexts.  Support is highly recommended.",
