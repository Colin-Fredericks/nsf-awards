 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this research is to understand how an individual               modulatory neuron uses a peptide and a conventional transmitter                 to influence the activity of a well-defined neural network.                     Although neural network activity in many systems has been shown                 to be influenced by exogenously applied peptides, few studies                   have detailed the effects of peptide-secreting neurons.  The                    projects to be performed focuses on the paired modulatory                       prolactin-containing neurons, two homologous peptidergic neurons                that modulate the activity of the pyloric network, the best                     described neuronal ensemble which generates a rhythmic, patterned               activity, and is located in the stomatogastric nervous system of                the crab.  This project combines biochemical and                                electrophysiological techniques to address a related series of                  questions.  This work is important because it uses a model system               to attack important cellular questions about neuronal circuits                  which are similar in man.",
