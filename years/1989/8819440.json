 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies using mitochondria from spf ash mice, which are                         severely deficient in ornithine transcarbamylase, will                          clarify the mechanism of the specific requirement for                           ornithine of carbamyl phosphate synthetase (ammonia) in situ.                   Experiments using liver mitochondria from normal, spf, and                      spf ash mice will establish the effects of interactions of                      carbamyl phosphate synthetase (ammonia) and ornithine                           transcarbamylase with the inner membrane on their catalytic                     properties, and the effect that the mutations have on the                       channelling extramitochondrial ornithine to ornithine                           transcarbamylase.  The relative contribution of this enzyme                     and of carbamyl phosphate synthetase (ammonia) to the control                   of citrulline synthesis will be analyzed.  Experiments using                    rat and mouse liver mitochondria will be done to obtain                         quantitative information on the role of matrix carbonic                         anhydrase in the supply of HCO3- to carbamyl phosphate                          synthetase (ammonia) and to pyruvate carboxylase, and to                        determine the Km values of these enzymes in situ for HCO3-.                     The significance of this work lies in the information it will                   yield on the properties of proteins under the conditions                        which prevail in cells, and on how enzymes and metabolic                        pathways function in situ.                                                                                                                                      In their normal environment, many enzymes appear to have                        kinetic properties different from those they exhibit in                         solution.  Examples are several of the enzymes of the pathway                   of urea synthesis, two of which (carbamyl phosphate                             synthetase (ammonia) and ornithine transcarbamylase) are in                     the mitochondrial matrix, and the remaining three in the                        cytoplasm.  Work to date shows that, although these enzymes                     are soluble, several of their substrates are channelled                         between cell compartments or enzymes, suggesting that the                       enzymes are organized within the cell.  In addition, these                      studies show that some kinetic characteristics of the two                       mitochondrial enzymes in situ differ from those they exhibit                    in solution.***//",
