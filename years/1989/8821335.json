 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditionally, the rapid growth and development of the life                     sciences in the United States at the end of the 19th century has                been largely attributed to the American adoption of the well-                   developed German ideal for physiology and morphology.  Recent                   scholarship, however, sees German science as only one factor, and               not the most important one at that, in shaping the development of               American biology.  Dr. Benson, under this research grant, is                    completing his study of the unique American setting for biology,                especially in the context of the marine biology laboratories.                   The early stations--the Anderson School of Natural History on                   Penikese Island (1873), Alexander Agassiz's Newport Laboratory                  (1875) and William Brooks' Chesapeake Zoological Laboratory                     (1878)--were summer institutes to teach secondary school teachers               the rudiments of natural history, the descriptive study of the                  natural world that characterized American biology prior to the                  1880's.  With the reform of science education, several of these                 laboratories were established to provide opportunities for                      graduate students in advanced instruction in biology.  These                    included the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole (1888),                 the Hopkins Marine Station (1892), the Scripps Institution of                   Oceanography (1903) and the Friday Harbor Laboratories (1904).                  These stations played a critical role in the growth and                         development of American biology, from its roots in the natural                  history tradition to its position when it began to come of age                  and gain an international leadership role at the turn of the                    century.  Dr. Benson will provide a critical assessment of the                  American development of marine laboratories and the role these                  institutions played in the growth and maturation of American                    biology.",
