 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of intensive aquaculture techniques in the United                  States has placed an increasing emphasis on maintaining water                   quality.  Development of a low-cost and reliable automated                      water quality and feed condition monitoring and control                         system would provide both research and commercial                               aquaculturists with a means of maintaining water quality for                    hatchery, nursery, grow-out and feed production systems.                        Information gathered manufacturers has indicated that four                      elements are required to design an appropriate monitoring/                      control system:  an understanding of the biological, physical                   and chemical parameters critical to aquaculture; experience                     in capability: and experience with control devices and                          electronic theory.  To date there have been no coordinated                      efforts to integrate these four elements to produce a complete                  system of monitoring and control for aquaculture.  Utilization                  of off-the-shelf environmental sensors, microcomputers and                      control devices integrated by software modules would go far                     in alleviating the problems attendant to maintaining water                      quality in intensive aquaculture systems.",
