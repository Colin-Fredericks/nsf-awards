 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports travel of twelve U.S.                       scientists to the International Conference and Workshop on                      Sex Determiantion and Dosage Compensation, to be held in                        Bangalore, India, between October 31 and November 3, 1989.                      The Indian organizer is Dr. H. Sharat Chandra, Chairman,                        Microbiology and Cell Biology Department at the Indian                          Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.  Ten speakers from                      Western Europe, and 35 senior scientists from India are also                    expected to participate, in addition to approximately 50                        graduate students from Indian Institutes.  Six major topics                     are to be covered:  Genes controlling early events in sex                       determination; dosage compensation; genes controlling later                     events in sex determination; chromosones and sex;                               imprinting; and evolution of sex determination and dosage                       compensation.  The participants will exchange information on                    these topics as they apply to the Drosophila and to mammals.                                                                                                    Scope:  The U.S. and Indian organizers are eminent                              scientists in the field of genetics and are from institutes                     with excellent reputations.  IISc has one of the oldest                         biochemistry departments in the world, and has some 120                         graduate students in life sciences.  A conference on a                          related topic organized at the IISc in Bangalore in 1981 was                    acclaimed as being very successful and was reported on in                       Nature (1982).  This meeting is cosponsored by the Indian                       National Science Academy, and the Department of Atomic                          Energy of the Government of India in addition to the IISc.                      The meeting is likely to lead to enhanced collaboration, in                     the fields of genetic and microbiology, between U.S. and                        Indian scientists, and to provide for exchange of                               information in this rapidly changing area of science.",
