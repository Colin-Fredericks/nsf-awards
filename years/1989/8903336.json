 "awd_abstract_narration": "Actin cross-linking proteins interact with actin filaments to form         either randomly associated networks, or filament bundles.  A 30,000             dalton protein present in the filopodia of Dictyostelium organizes actin        filaments into bundles in vitro, and this bundling activity is inhibited        by elevation of the concentrations of free calcium or magnesium.  The           primary amino acid sequences of this protein will be deduced by                 isolation and sequencing of the cDNA encoding the protein.  The results         will be used to identify regions of the primary sequence of the protein         that may potentially interact with actin and with calcium and magnesium         ions.  Functionally significant regions of the molecular will be                identified directly by studies of the activity of proteolytic fragments         of the 30,000 dalton protein, and by studies of the regions of the              30,000 dalton protein and actin that are trapped in direct association          by chemical cross-linking reagents.  A quantitative assay for the               orientation of actin filaments in cross-linked actin networks will be           developed.  Careful studies of the structures formed in mixtures of             actin with different cross-linking proteins may help to reveal                  differences in the activities of the multiple actin cross-linking               proteins present in cells.                                                           Actin monomer binding proteins are believed to regulate the self-          assembly of actin.  A novel actin monomer binding protein will be               purified from Dictyostelium discoideum, and its structure and                   interaction with actin will be dissected.  Antisera specific for the            protein will be elicited in rabbits, and used to determine the quantity         and distribution of this protein in Dictyostelium amoebae, and to               determine the presence of related proteins in other species.                         Knowledge of the novel actin monomer binding protein and the 30,000        dalton protein provide a foundation for future use of biochemical and           genetic approached to determine the contributions of these proteins to          control of actin filaments in cells, and the molecular mechanisms of            essential cellular processes such as locomotion, phagocytosis, and              cytokinesis.                                                                         Cell movements such as phagocytosis, locomotion, and cytokinesis           are essential to the life of eucaryotic cells.  Actin filaments                 contribute to the control of cell shape and generation of force for             cell movements.  The properties of actin in cells must be explained from        a knowledge of the structure and chemistry of purified actin, and of the        properties of actin binding proteins.  The presence of similar actin            binding proteins in invertebrate and vertebrate cells provides strong           evidence for the significance of these proteins as regulators of the            behavior of actin in the cytosol, and motivates detailed inquiry.",
