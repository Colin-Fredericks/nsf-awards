 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neurobiology has benefited greatly from the use of model systems.               Simple invertebrate preparations have provided a means to study                 neuronal communication.  Results from these models have proven                  applicable to mammalian systems and have shed light on molecular                mechanisms underlying behaviors, especially the neurobiology of                 learning and memory.  Brazilian opossums, with their great                      immaturity at birth, have proven to be an excellent model for                   studying neural development.  Dr. Jacobson has an active colony                 of these valuable animals which, unlike the North American                      opossum, are small in size, and easy to handle and raise in the                 laboratory.  Moreover, these Brazilian opossums are pouchless                   thus providing an easy access to young.  Thus, these animals are                ideal for investigating the mechanisms underlying the sexual                    differentiation of the brain.  Dr. Jacobson will be maintaining                 her colony during the next year and will continue her work on the               development and steroid regulation of sexual dimorphisms within                 the CNS.  In addition, the opossums will be available to other                  investigators whose science will benefit greatly from the use of                this valuable model system.",
