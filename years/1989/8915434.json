 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a workshop jointly organized by Professor               Lee A. Willson of Iowa State University and Professor Roberto                   Stalio of the University of Trieste.  The workshop will be the                  second in a series on dynamical phenomena in stars and circumste-               llar environments.  The first one was held in Trieste on pulsation              and mass loss; this one will be on angular momemtum and mass loss               and is being held in Ames, Iowa.  The objective of this series of               workshops is to explore and stimulate research in fundamental                   problems of stellar astrophysics.                                                                                                                               Fundamental unsolved problems of stellar astrophysics include the               effects of angular momentum on stellar structure and evolution,                 the nature and efficiency of the processes by which angular                     momentum is redistributed within and lost from stars, and the role              that stellar rotation plays in enhancing or driving stellar mass                loss.  A workshop on the topic of angular momentum and mass loss                is timely because: (1) computational codes incorporating stellar                rotation into stellar models are beginning to be developed; (2)                 there has not been a meeting recently concerning this topic as it               applies to the more massive, rapidly rotating stars; (3) the                    importance of rotation as a factor in mass loss and in affecting                pulsation, which in turn affects mass loss, is just beginning to be             appreciated; and (4) observational techniques making use of rapid               rotation to study pulsation properties of early type stars are also             being developed.  The topic is particularly appropriate for                     support under the U.S.- Italy Program since much of the important               activity in this area is being carried out in these two countries.",
