 "awd_abstract_narration": "People typically find their way through woods and buildings                     without harm or injury.  That is, while traveling at reasonable                 speed, we can determine our heading and avoid obstacles without                 doing damage to them or to ourselves.  Constraints of physics and               human reaction time dictate that we must be able to determine our               heading to within one degree of visual angle, or about half the                 width of one's thumb head at arm's length.  Otherwise, we risk                  injury in our daily movements.  Perceptual scientists generally                 agree that visual information provides the usual means for                      locomotor guidance and that this information lies in the relative               motions of stationary objects around a moving observer.  There is               disagreement, however, on how best to characterize these relative               motions to determine exactly what information is used.  This                    research will test a theory positing a recursive two-step                       process.  According to the theory, people first search out                      objects to look at and follow them (using pursuit eye movements)                while they are moving forward and second monitor the relative                   motions of objects nearer and farther than the one they are                     looking at, but in its vicinity.  In general, nearer objects move               faster than, and in the opposite direction from, farther objects                and near objects move in a direction opposite to one's heading.                 Thus, to be able to determine one's heading, one simply gazes at                an object anywhere in the field of view and observes the                        direction of the fastest movements around the point of gaze.  If                these move right, the heading is usually to the left; if these                  move left, the heading is usually to the right.  This research                  will test the theory in a number of ways, using computer-                       generated displays, which will simulate various types of                        environments and various types of observer movements through                    them.  In particular, the research will explore conditions in                   which people make errors in determining their heading and the                   reasons for those errors.  An understanding of these errors will                have implications for air-traffic safety, highway safety, and the               safety of visually-impaired pedestrians.",
