 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is part of the modernization and general improvement of            the physics laboratory courses at Gonzaga University.  The courses are          taken by approximately 150 students each semester.  The students'               majors vary from the liberal arts through the sciences and engineering.         The equipment includes video cassette cameras, recorders, and monitors.         The video equipment will be used to more actively (and accurately)              engage the students in time and distance measurements in several                mechanics experiments.  The equipment will allow the department to              significantly improve general physics and intermediate physics                  laboratories.  The equipment will ensure more accurate, consistent and          precise acquisition and analysis of data.                                                                                                                       The University will contribute an amount equal to 107% of the award             toward the purchase of the equipment.",
