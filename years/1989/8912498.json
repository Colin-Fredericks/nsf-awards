 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study examines the nature of interfirm networks among                      large U.S. and Japanese corporations in order to assess the                     effects of network affiliation and position on company                          structure, strategy and performance.  The Principal                             Investigators will collect longitudinal data from published                     sources on directorship interlocks, trading relationships,                      debt relationships, and reciprocal shareholding relationships                   among firms.  They will also use published sources to obtain                    information on internal company organization, size and                          diversification, and such performance dimensions as                             profitability, sales growth, and share price.  Network                          analytic techniques will be applied to these data for the                       purpose of uncovering and comparing structural patterns in                      U.S. and Japanese business networks.  Of central interest is                    the question of how clusterings uncovered by network analysis                   correspond to keiretsu (enterprise) groupings in the Japanese                   economy.  Firm level outcome variables of structure,                            strategy, and performance will be modeled as a function of                      network position and linkage.  The Japanese and U.S.                            economies appear to differ dramatically in terms of the                         structural relationships among organizations.  There is                         strong support for the characterization of Japan as a network                   economy, which relies upon a dense web of social bonds and                      obligation to manage and coordinate transactions.  By                           employing network theories and methods this study will serve                    to advance our understanding of such network economies and                      their competitive advantages relative to the United States.",
