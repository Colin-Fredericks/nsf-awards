 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide a computer based experiment                      controlled, data acquisition, data analysis system which will                   interface directly with experiments performed in the laboratory                 portion of a sophomore Modern Physics course.  The computer will                be equipped with a printer and a plotter.  A system of analog and               digital input/output interface cards manufactured by MetraByte                  which plug directly into the expansion slots of the computer will               be used to connect the experimental apparatus to the computer.                  Auxiliary equipment which conditions the signals generated by                   experimental transducers so that they will be compatible with                   plug-in cards will also be obtained from MetraByte.  Software for               programming the instrument will be a combination of card specific               software from MetraByte and the high level languages of Pascal                  and Basic.  This project will significantly improve the                         laboratory environment for the students in Modern Physics.  In                  addition to performing classical experiments they will gain                     experience in utilizing modern techniques and equipment in the                  laboratory.                                                                                                                                                          The University will match the award with an equal amount of                funds.",
