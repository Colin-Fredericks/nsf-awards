 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of El Nino climate changes is hampered by our                    short historical record of their occurrence.  Fortunately the                   changes in ocean chemistry and temperature that are produced by                 El Nino are recorded in the chemistry of living corals.  And                    since corals secrete annual growth bands, the record of their                   changing chemistry can provide us with the means to reconstruct                 the history of El Nino occurrence back through the life span of                 coral (up to about 300 years).  The goal of this research program               is to reconstruct this paleoclimate history from banded corals in               the western Pacific (Tarawa Is.) and eastern Pacific (Galapagos                 Is.).  The project involves field programs to each island to                    sample the coral, followed by laboratory analyses of the trace                  element and stable isotopic chemistry of the coral growth bands.                This study will contribute to our understanding of the history,                 frequency of occurrence, and climatic significance of El Nino                   phenomena.",
