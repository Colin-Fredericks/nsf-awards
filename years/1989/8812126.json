 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns an initial attempt to establish a                   relationship between climatic variations due to El Nino and                     growth patterns of one or more long-lived trees found in the                    desert along the north Peruvian coast.                                               Preliminary results, already in hand, indicate that some                   trees in this region-specifically the Sapote (Capparis Angulata                 R. & P.)-live for at least a few hundred years, and perhaps much                longer.                                                                              Although the task of determining a chronology of tree growth               in the tropical desert is formidable, it appears that at least a                crude chronology is possible by comparing the average growth                    pattern obtained from a series of transverse sections and cores                 from separate Sapotes with radiocarbon dating of selected Sapote                samples.  A concomitant study to establish ongoing growth                       patterns and their relationship to local climate variations will                augment our current understanding of Sapote, and will add                       considerable insight into our research efforts.                                      The establishment of a proxy chronology of El Nino                         variability over the past few centuries, particularly in the El                 Nino sensitive region along the north Peruvian coast, is of                     considerable value in our search to understand this enigmatic but               economically critical phenomenon.",
