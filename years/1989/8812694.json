 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manganese undergoes dynamic redox cycling between reduced Mn(II)                and manganese oxides.  These transfers dominate the                             biogeochemical behavior of manganese in natural waters and                      sediments.  Although the manganese redox cycle is likely to have                a major impact on the chemistry of other elements, particularly                 carbon, such effects have not been widely studied.  Thus                        manganese serves as a redox catalysts for the transfer of                       electrons between organic matter and molecular oxygen and plays                 an important role in the overall redox chemistry of sediments.                  By studying the microbial and abiotic reduction of manganese                    oxides in sediments, the work fills an important gap in our                     knowledge of elemental redox cycles in sediments, particularly                  with respect to understanding the role of manganese in the                      oxidation of organic carbon.                                                                                                                                    Biogeochemical cycling of manganese in this large freshwater                    system will provide an understanding of how this element relates                to the carbon cycle.  Previous notions about how manganese is                   reduced in anoxic environments have recently been changed by                    studies in Lake Oneida and the Black Sea.  These distinct regions               have sulfide in common, however the dominant cause of manganese                 reduction was due to organisms above the sulfide interface.  This               rather surprising result adds impact to these studies in Green                  Bay indicates that the results may be extrapolated to many other                freshwater and marine environments.  It is important to                         oceanographers as well as meteorologists to know how carbon is                  exchanged and cycled throughout the ocean.",
