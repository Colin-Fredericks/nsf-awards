 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Cary                 Cooper, University of Texas Medical Branch, and Dr. Anthony Care,               University of Leeds, England. The investigators propose to study                the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) as a potential               secretagogue of calcitonen (CT) and other secretory products in the             pig thyroid gland.                                                                                                                                              CGRP is an alternative product of the calcitonin gene and is                    expressed widely in the body by neuronal cells.  CGRP appears to                exert important neuromodulator actions to control nerve function                and vascular tone, but whether it exerts endocrine regulatory                   effects remains unknown.  Drs. Cooper and Care will examine the                 hypothesis that CGRP can regulate the secretion of CT from the pig              thyroid gland.  At the University of Leeds, they will perfuse the               surgically isolated pig thyroid gland with CGRP and related                     peptides via the thyroid artery.  Secretion of CT and other thyroid             secretory products will be measured by radioimmunoassay in thyroid              venous plasma.  At the University of Texas Medical Branch, most of              the assays will be conducted, and the investigators will examine                pig thyroid gland plasma membranes for the presence of CGRP                     receptors.  Radiolabeled CGRP will be used to study the receptors               by classical ligand binding techniques in order to a) verify their              presence, b) estimate their density, c) examine the kinetics of                 binding and their specificity, and d) examine whether perfusion of              the thyroid with CGRP leads to their down-regulation.  They will                also examine receptor-containing thyroid membranes to determine                 whether CGRP alters adenylate or guanylate cyclase in an attempt to             identify putative second messengers mediating the CGRP effect on CT             secretion.  The findings should shed light on the mechanisms by                 which this new peptide, CGRP, may regulate thyroid function.",
