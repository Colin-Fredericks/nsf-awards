 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Ronald             J. Prokopy of the University of Massachusetts, and Dr. Brian Fletcher           of the Entomology Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and                   Industrial Research Office, Canberra, and Dr. R.A.I. Drew of the                Queensland Department of Primary Industry, Australia.  The                      investigators will perform a comparative analysis of natural sources            of food and feeding behavior of apple maggot flies in the U.S., and             Queensland fruit flies in Australia, and use the information obtained           to improve food-lure baits and bait spray practices for fly management.                                                                                         The project combines the expertise of the Australian investigators in           the study of natural sources of food and microorganisms ingested as             food by fruit flies with the U.S. expertise in the experimental                 analysis of the behavior of fruit flies in foraging for food.  This             study will provide the foundation for a comprehensive understanding             of all facets of resource foraging behavior in the American and                 Queensland fruit flies, and could serve as a model for future work on           multiple-resource-type foraging behavior in insects.  The ultimate              objective, of course, is improved control of these obnoxious pests.",
