 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lipid composition and expression of lipogenic enzymes in                    Euglena gracilis vary depending on the presence or absence of                   light, a feature that raises many questions with regard to                      development and regulation.  Euglena is unique in having 2 de                   novo fatty acid synthetases (FASs).  In addition to a true                      multienzyme complex aggregated FAS in the cytosol, there is a                   nonaggregated FAS located in the pure chloroplasts.  The                        activity of the nonaggregated FAS seems to be dependent upon                    transient but crucial interactions among the enzymes and acyl                   carrier protein (ACP).  Calcium ion and/or ACP acylation                        state may influence the capacities of the proteins to                           interact.  In limited respects, the system of ACP-enzymes                       interaction may resemble the calmodulin-interactive proteins                    situation.  The nature and regulation of the interactions                       among the proteins of the nonaggregated FAS will be proved                      with observations made on both intact pure chloroplasts or                      purified proteins.  The following methods will be used to                       observe interactions between or among proteins:  chemical                       cross-linking and electroimmunoblot analysis; chemical cross-                   linking and limited cleavage of cross-linked proteins; low                      angle laser light scattering spectrometry; and fluorescence                     and UV spectroscopy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Fatty acids are imporant building blocks of cell membranes                                                                                                      and are fuel for living cells.  This project seeks to                                                                                                           determine how the several enzymes involved are regulated.*** //",
