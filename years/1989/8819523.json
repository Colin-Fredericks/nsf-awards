 "awd_abstract_narration": "Like some other national regions, communities in the Southeastern               United States face a significant seismic risk without sufficient                earthquake engineering technology base for mitigation.  Prudent                 building practices and code standards are impeded by this technology            inadequacy.  This shortcoming is particularly important in South                Carolina and other southeastern states due to the companion natural             hazards of high winds.                                                                                                                                          Masonry structures are common and most vulnerable to both of                    these natural hazards.  Masonry building design practices often do              not incorporate state-of-the-art engineering technology and, in most            cases, established building code standards regarding seismic and wind           forces.  This is due to inadequacies in the engineering technology              base as described above and a long term disregard of the serious                eastern earthquake threat.  Relevant masonry engineering procedures,            data and experience are available to remedy this technical shortfall.           However, the sources are somewhat fragmented and widespread.                    Consolidated engineering guidelines are necessary for the                       multihazards design of masonry structures.                                                                                                                      This project will produce an engineering design handbook for                    unreinforced and reinforced masonry structures to withstand the                 integrated effects of earthquakes and high winds.  The handbook                 will feature provision of the new earthquake and wind provisions of             the 1988 Standard Building Code which apply to the South and                    Southeastern United States.  The handbook will focus on the                     threats, building types and construction practices of the southeast             region, and would be of use nationwide.  It will provide integrated             design guidelines formed through a survey and consolidating analysis            of existing design technologies and methodologies, including those              recently developed, involving anchorages, diaphragms, existing                  unreinforced masonry buildings, mixed construction (prefab steel                frame with masonry walls) and potential liquefaction damage.  The               guidelines will be presented through specific detailed design                   applications to building types typical of construction in the                   southeast region.",
