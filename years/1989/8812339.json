The field                  program will use transponder navigated, closely spaced dredging,                together with SeaBeam, and camera tows to study the area from 12                to 12 30' N along the East Pacific Rise where preliminary data                  shows the existence of magmatic segmentation.  The new field data               will be integrated with existing SeaMARC I data to get fine scale               resolution of along-axis variations in chemistry to determine the               scale of magmatic segmentation.  The project will also involve                  off-axis dredges that, coupled with side scan and camera data,                  will help resolve temporal variations as well.                                  %%%                                                                                     Suggested scales of volcanic centers on the East Pacific                Rise range from a few kilometers to a few hundred kilometers.                   Thus the appropriate scale on which to consider the magmatic                    organization of the East Pacific Rise is uncertain.  This project               will take an important step in clarifying the scale of magmatic                 segmentation and its relation to small ridge offsets.  This is a                problem of first order importance in marine basalt petrogenesis.",
