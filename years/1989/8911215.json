 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award form the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                    metallic Chemistry Program, Ronald L. Musselman of Franklin and                 Marshall College will investigate the electronic structures of                  metalloprotein model compounds and porphyrinic one-dimensional                  electrical conductors. Polarized specular (mirror-like)                         reflectance spectroscopy will be used in the study, which will                  probe metalloporphyrin complexes and thereby provide                            information that may be useful in understanding the mechanism                   of reactivity at the active sites in some non-heme binuclear                    proteins and enzymes.                                                                                                                                           Polarized specular reflectance spectroscopy of single crystals                  is especially advantageous for study of visible and ultraviolet                 spectra of charge transfer transitions in metal complexes be-                   cause of their normally high intensities and high absorbancies.                 Two types of compouds to be studied are: (1) model compounds                    which mimic the binuclear metalloenzymes of copper and iron,                    such as hemocyanin and hemerythrin, and (2) partially oxidized                  metalloporphyrins which stack in such a manner so as to conduct                 electricity through the metal spine or through the pi-systems                   of the parallel macrocycles. The relative energy levels of                      metal- and ligand-based orbitals subject to partial oxidation                   and conductive band formation, as well as the electronic                        structure changes which occur upon aggregation of the discrete                  molecules into chains, will be determined.                                                                                                                      A special component of this research project will be heavy                      involvement of undergraduates.",
