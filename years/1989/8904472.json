 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phenotype conversion of wild-type Pseudomonas solanacearum, which               results in PC-type strains, appears to be an irreversible genetic               process that coordinately regulates a variety of diverse traits.                We have cloned a region from a P. solanacearum wild-type strain                 that complements the defect in several PC-type strains.  This                   regulator of phenotype conversion (rpc) locus appears to encode                 one or more trans-acting regulatory factors.  The overall                       objectives of this research is to investigate the genetic basis                 of phenotype conversion and how this locus regulates the                        expression of other genes.  The location and size of the                        wild-type rpc genes will mapped using a variety of standard                     techniques.  The direction of transcription will be determined by               making lac fusions, and the proteins encoded by these genes will                be examined by maxicell analysis.  Deletions in the control                     region of the positively regulated egl gene, which encodes a                    secreted endoglucanase enzyme, will be examined in vivo to locate               the activator binding site, and the possibility that rpc encodes                an activator protein will be explored in vitro with DNA-binding                 gel retardation assays.  The altered rpc locus will be isolated                 from a PC-type strain and compared to the wild-type locus after                 DNA sequencing to determine the genetic changes that occur during               phenotype conversion.  The long term goal of this research is to                learn more about regulation of gene expression in phytopathogenic               bacteria and thereby increase our understanding of host-pathogen                interactions.",
