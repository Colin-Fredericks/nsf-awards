 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will trace the impact of modernizing consumer goods                channels upon the economic and cultural character of a town                     community in West Germany.  The distribution of mass consumer                   goods is increasingly performed by vertically integrated market                 channels dominated by marketing oriented enterprises which take                 control of retail activities.  This project will study this                     phenomenon in a medium sized commercial town in northern Bavaria.               It will trace the history of marketing in the town; identify the                causes of market channel integration; and study the impact of                   progressive market integration on the economic and cultural life                of the town and its urban-rural relations.  The PI will live in                 the town for 12 months and conduct ethnographic fieldwork.                                                                                                      The project will increase our understanding of the socio-cultural               context of trade under expansionary economic conditions.  This                  research is important because the vertical integration of mass                  marketing channels is a major fact of the modern world, occurring               in both developing and developed societies.  This analysis, by an               experienced scholar of this process in the underdeveloped world,                will add an important case and help us understand the similar                   developments in the developing world.",
