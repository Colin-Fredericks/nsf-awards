 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increased use of real-time systems in critical applications (those          with a high failure cost) has intensified the need and desire to verify         these systems.  The distinguishing feature of real-time systems are the         hard timing constraints placed on their execution.  Thus, research              efforts will be concentrated on the correctness of real-time processes          with respect to timing constraints.  The two objectives of this                 research are the development of an algebraic theory for specifying and          verifying real-time processes and the implemenation of verification             tools based on the algebraic theory developed.  The algebraic approach          provides a single paradigm for performing both specification and                verification.  The algebraic specification language contains constructs         for representing the temporal and structural properties that arise in           real-time processes.  The semantics of this language defines an                 equational logic that can be used to analyze real-time processes.  This         logic contains rules for reasoning about hard timing constraints.  In           addition, it provides rules for reasoning about non-temporal properties         of real-time processes such as freedom from deadlock and process                interaction.  A verification tool based on this logic will be                   implemented using an automatic theorem prover.",
