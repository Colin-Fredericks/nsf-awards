 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will develop probes that detect                      moderately-highly variable mini-satellite DNA genetic markers in                plants.  Several mini-satellite probes of this type have been                   developed for use with tetrapods and they have revealed a wealth                of genetic polymorphic markers to the degree that some have been                referred to as \"DNA fingerprinting\" probes.  Such probes have                   both proven and potential applications in several fields of                     biology including genetic mapping and linkage analysis, pedigree                analysis (paternity and maternity analyses) breeding improvement                programs, and population and evolutionary genetics.  Recently,                  it has been demonstrated that some of these same probes used with               tetrapods also reveal alleles at variable loci in algae,                        gymnosperms, and angiosperms.  The central goal of the research                 is to develop DNA probes for such genetic analyses of mini-                     satellite variable loci in plants through two experimental                      approaches.  First, numerous probes (naturally derived and                      synthetic) previously used thus far only in tetrapods await                     exploration with plants.  Second, these same probes will be used                to develop plant-derived mini-satellite probes.  The ultimate                   goal is to provide probes that are rapid, easy, and broad in                    application that permit \"DNA genetic fingerprinting\" for plants.                Such probes will be a powerful new tool for the study of the                    apportionment and dynamics of genetic variation within and                      between a wide variety of plant species.",
