 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fallen Leaf Lake Conferences initiated in 1985 is a yearly                  event devoted to the molecular biology and genetics of plant                    pathogenic bacteria, fastidious prokaryotes and related areas                   dealing with these microorganisms.  Only the latest unpublished                 information is exchanged at this conference and ample opportunity               for scientific interactions is provided during the course of the                conference.  The conference is attended by members representing                 most of the major laboratories from many different countries                    (e.g., Europe, Asia, Australia, India), including the Soviet                    Union, and therefore provides excellent opportunity for graduate                and postdoctoral students to interact with internationally                      recognized experts in a specific field.                                                                                                                         Support of the on-going Fallen Leaf Lake Conferences is requested               for assistance in providing housing, meal, and transportation                   costs for graduate and postdoctoral students, keynote speaker and               for session chairs.  Previous support by NSF has been judiciously               used for the above.",
