 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Roger Siervogel                   will lead a project to copy seriously deteriorating radiographs                 from the Fels and Denver collections.  The Denver series will be                inventoried and a computer catalog constructed.  Both collections               will be made more accessible to anthropologists and human                       biologists.                                                                                                                                                     The Fels Longitudinal Growth Study began in 1929 and is the                     longest, continuously on-going series study of human growth and                 health-related outcomes of its kind in the world.  The study                    deals with normal growth processes in normal (non-diseased)                     individuals.  As part of the longitudinal study, serial                         radiographs of more than 968 participants whose current age range               is from 4-weeks to over 59 years have been taken since birth.                   The Fels collection now numbers more than 102,000.  In addition,                Fels is the repository for approximately 60,000 serial                          radiographs that were collected in the Denver Longitudinal Growth               Study.  These two collections are of major scientific                           significance but, unfortunately, most of the films taken prior to               1965 are badly deteriorating.                                                                                                                                   This project is important because it will save these                            scientifically valuable materials from destruction.  Given                      increased knowledge about radiation dangers, many of these films                could not be taken today and, thus, are irreplaceable.  Studies                 based on these radiographs have greatly increased our                           understanding of growth and development and have the potential to               contribute more information in the future.",
