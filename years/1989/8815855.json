 "awd_abstract_narration": "Die casting is the most effective process to mass produce complex               metal parts to tight tolerance at low cost.  However, the                       traditional die-casting process can only produce near-net-shape,                and always requires a secondary operation to trim off overflows                 and gates.  Further, a more serious problem (particularly for                   complex parts) is the uncertainty of having porosity somewhere in               the part caused by turbulent flow during the process, which is                  difficult to detect.  This inherent disadvantage may have been a                major factor in the slow growth of the seven-billion-dollar                     industry which is facing stiff competition from other processes                 like injection molding of plastics as well as foreign die-casting               producers, due to lack of technical edge.  It is necessary to                   develop a process that can produce net-shape parts akin to such                 processes as injection or transfer molding of polymers.  The idea               is to make use of the so-called \"semi-solid alloy\"  (a slurry of                solid particles suspended in a molten metal matrix) which has                   high viscosity and can be processed in the laminar-flow regime.                 The main objectives are to study the rheology of such materials,                develop simulation models for flow and solidification, and design               a new machine for experiments.  Successful completion of this                   research would have a potential to revolutionize the die-casting                technology and provide our industry an edge over foreign                        competition in this area.",
