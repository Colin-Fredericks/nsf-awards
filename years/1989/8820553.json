 "awd_abstract_narration": "The energy-driven movement of intracellular membrane-bounded                 particles from one region of the cell to another is mediated by                 translocator molecules which transport the particles along                      microtubules.  In axons, retrograde movement is mediated by a                   protein called \"cytoplasmic dynein,\" while anterograde movement                 is mediated by a different protein called \"kinesin.\"  In this                   project, the subcellular distribution of kinesin and cytoplasmic                dynein will be determined by immunolocalization at the light and                electron microscopic levels.  The differential association of                   these proteins with vesicles moving in the orthograde vs.                       retrograde directions in axons will be assessed.  The components                of the outer mitochondrial membrane will be analyzed to determine               the characteristics of that organelle which allow it to move                    bidirectionally in axons.  Finally, cDNA clones of the genes                    coding for the translocator proteins will be isolated.                                                                                                          These experiments have as their focus increasing our                            understanding of the motor molecules involved in the important                  cell biological phenomenon of intracellular particle motility.",
