 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project includes two national surveys of science and                  mathematics teachers.  In the first survey, teachers who                        participated in the 1985-86 National Survey of Science and                      Mathematics Education but have since left the teaching profession               will be interviewed by telephone about attitudes toward teaching,               and salary and working conditions while teaching and in their                   current occupation.  For comparison purposes, a subsample of                    those who are still teaching will also be interviewed.  As a                    result of this research, a better understanding of the relative                 importance of various factors in decisions to leave teaching will               be gained, and potentially effective strategies for decreasing                  the attrition rates of science and mathematics teachers will be                 identified.                                                                                                                                                         The second survey will be conducted in conjunction with the                 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP).  NAEP already               plans to collect data from the mathematics teachers of each                     eighth grade student included in the 1990 mathematics national                  assessment.  This project will enable NAEP to collect data from                 eighth grade science teachers as well, allowing investigation of                the relationship between teacher and classroom characteristics                  and student performance in science.  In addition, after adjusting               the teacher weights appropriately, this project will provide                    estimates of the course background preparation and other                        characteristics of science and mathematics teachers in the nation               as a whole.",
