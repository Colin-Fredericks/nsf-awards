 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports William T. Peterson and a graduate student from             SUNY at Stony Brook to collaborate with Thomas Kiorboe and others               of the Danish Institute for Fisheries and Marine Research in a                  study of marine plankton ecology off the Danish coast.  The Danish              group is carrying out studies to measure what proportion of the                 primary production by phytoplankton passes through copepods to fish             (the classical food web) and what proportion passes through                     bacteria and heterotrophic flagellates (the microbial loop.)  They              are also trying to establish whether there are predictable                      relationships between vertical mixing, phytoplankton taxonomic                  composition and the proportion of primary production passing                    through each of the two food webs.  Dr. Peterson has been invited               to participate and direct the work on copepod production,                       specifically by comparing and contrasting copepod production in                 three hydrographic regimes (mixed, stratified, and frontal water                columns in the Skagerrak) and comparing total secondary production              to rates of primary production in the three areas.                                                                                                              This study represents one of the first attempts at the simultaneous             measurement of biomass and production of all the components of the              first two trophic levels of a food web in the sea.  As such, this               study will lead to a fuller understanding of the factors                        controlling transfer coefficients and food chain efficiency, and                could lead to a re-evaluation of the role of copepods in marine                 food webs.",
