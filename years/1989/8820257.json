 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new type of analog signal processor module for digitizing the                 output of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) will be built.  The unit                is designed around a very fast 16-bit analog-to-digital converter               and a digital signal processor (DSP) integrated circuit.  By                    taking multiple samples of the waveform at the output of the CCD                it will be possible to increase the dynamic range of the readout                and to apply optimal filtering techniques to lower the readout                  noise.  The DSP will store the samples and numerically process                  them to derive a single number to send to the host computer,                    thereby relieving the load on the host.  The DSP will also                      generate the clocking waveforms to drive the CCD, as well as                    carry out other time-critical tasks such as the operation of                    motors and shutters.  The new electronic system is simpler than                 previous designs, and is also capable of high speed readouts of                 the CCD for field finding or high-speed photometry.  We plan to                 experiment with various methods for improving readout noise and                 large signal handling capabilities using several CCDs.  The                     project is expected to last about two years and involve, in                     addition to the Principal Investigator, an electrical engineer,                 an electronics technician, and a graduate student.",
