It is part of a continuing                     program of research combining classical topics such as Bessel                   functions.  Hankel transforms and Luzin's area theorem with                     more recent topics and their generalizations such  as                           quasi-symmetric spaces and more general nilpotent continuous                    groups.                                                                              A relatively new thrust in the research concerns the                       development of a theory of quasiconformal mapping on                            Cauchy-Riemann manifolds, especially the Heisenberg group.                      Work of a continuing nature will also be carried out in the                     study of function theory on symmetric cones.  Most of the                       earlier research on generalized hypergeometric functions in the                 case of real and complex matrices has been extended to                          arbitrary symmetric cones.  What must be done now is to tie                     together the various existing theories and find the most                        general appropriate setting.                                                         A new idea is being considered in the still open problem                   of finding a generalization of Luzin's area integral for                        Riemannian symmetric spaces.  It is based on the construction                   of a jump process which concentrates in neighborhoods of the                    distinguished boundary much less rapidly than Brownian motion                   but for which the harmonic functions are still martingales.                     There are many applicatons to boundary properties of solutions                  of differential equations which will not be resolved until                      successful Fatou-type theorems can be developed in this setting.",
