 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project's primary concern is with algorithmic aspects of the               question: Given a simple polygon, can it be folded to form a closed             convex polyhedron (a polytope)?  Although there now exists a                    substantial body of geometry theorems that establish existence and              uniqueness of the folded polytope, the proofs do not easily yield               algorithms.  Finding such algorithms is a major goal of this research.          In particular, several variants of the folding problem in which more            input information is given may lead to easier reconstruction                    algorithms.  Unfoldings of polytopes will also be considered.  Finding          unfoldings that do not overlap is an interesting computational problem          with important applications.  Unfoldings are related to rollings of             polytopes on a plane, a concept that leads to new problems, and perhaps         will shed light on some old problems concerning shortest paths on               polytopes.",
