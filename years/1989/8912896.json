 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent progress in the use of artificial neural networks (ANN's) as             subsystems in control systems, in Japanese laboratories as well as by           American researchers, has been based on the enhancement of these                systems with system concepts from the brain, notably the cerebellum.            This research project will assess the progress of Ann-based control             system design, especially for robotic systems, which incorporates               neurophysiological concepts and suggest new directions for future               development.  Improved applied control systems should have adaptive             components to achieve high levels of sophistication and performance.                                                                                            Algorithms with neurological plausibility will be considered for                implementation as ANN's.  These will relate to intelligent neural               network technology as it exists in the United States, Japan and                 elsewhere.  It is expected that this assessment will identify the               current directions of research as indicated in the literature. It is            important to suggest new directions which are relatively undeveloped            but offer considerable promise.  Clearly, additional neuroscientific            based subsystems can be identified from the literature.  These                  subsystems and learning techniques can be developed and mathematically          modeled for computer simulation to be studied for use in ANN control            systems. These enhanced ANN designs will be applied to robotic                  control, in future work, in an effort to substantiate, and enhance the          progress made to date (Miyamoto, Kawato, Setoyama & Suzuke, 1988).",
