 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mixtures of phospholipid and detergents are known to undergo                    transformation between micelle and vesicle forms under proper                   conditions.  The transformation process occurs within a                         narrow range of compositions of detergent and phospholipid                      and seems to involve intermediate structures which are quite                    different from either the vesicles or micelles which exist at                   the two extreme boundaries of the transition region.  Little                    is known about the characteristics of the transitions in the                    transition region and the properties of the transitions                         forms.  This project involves the study of several detergent-                   phospholipid systems by differential scanning calorimetry at                    compositions particularly close to the transition region                        between micelles and vesicles.                                                                                                                                  Lipids in aqueous mixtures of phospholipids and detergent are                   thought to exist in several different structural forms                          dependent upon the composition and conditions in solution.                      At low mole ratios of detergent to lipid unilamellar vesicles                   form, while at high ratios micellar structures prevail.  The                    transition between these limiting structures is a fundamental                   problem that has implications for several important areas                       relating to the physical and chemical behavior of                               phospholipids.  The results of this project could be                            significant for a better understanding of membrane reconstitution               methods, vesicular drug delivery methods and the mechanisms                     of lipid transport in biliary mixtures of bile salts and                        phospholipids.",
