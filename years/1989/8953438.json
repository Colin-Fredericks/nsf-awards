 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will fund a 1989 three-week summer workshop at                       Chadron State College, Chadron, NE, for local and regional                      elementary and secondary teachers.  The course is in three                      phases:  (1) classroom instruction focusing on content,                         recent research developments, methods and technology                            utilization in selected science areas, (2) fieldwork                            utilizing research in progress in this unique geographical                      region staffed by experts in those fields from other                            colleges, universities, and private institutions, and (3)                       application of audiovisual technology, along with the latest                    pedagogical developments to create classroom teaching                           materials resources.  Chadron is also the center of ongoing                     field research and study in botany, archaeology,                                paleontology, endangered species, ethnobotany and the                           environmental sciences.  The majority of elementary and                         secondary teachers work with a population of under-served                       and under-represented persons including Native Americans,                       Hispanics, and rural students.  Regionally, elementary and                      secondary teachers are generalists, without peer networks.                      The goal of this pilot course is to provide teachers with                       experiential training, in on-site roles, introducing                            innovative pedagogical technology and methods, to expand                        their content knowledge and develop classroom materials.                        Participants will be drawn from a region including the                          largest Native American population of South Dakota, and the                     majority of counties representing the largest Hispanic                          populations in Nebraska, and the most rural districts of both                   states where the needs assessment was conducted.                                                                                                                An amount equivalent to 33.3% of the NSF award is being                         contributed as cost-sharing.",
