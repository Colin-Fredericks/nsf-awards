Chaires of the University of Mississippi Medical Center and Dr.                 Thomas Jovin of the Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry,             Goettingen, FRG, is sponsored by NSF under the U.S.- Germany                    Cooperative Research Program.                                                                                                                                   Dr. Chaires plans to pursue fundamental studies of intercalation                reactions using instrumentation unavailable to him at his home                  institution.  The interaction of daunomycin (an important anticancer            antibiotic) with DNA will be studied by pressure-jump relaxation                kinetic methods, in order to explore the mechanism by which the                 antibiotic locates and binds to its preferred sites within                      heterogeneous DNA sequences.  The thermodynamics of the binding of              ethidium bromide and daunomycin to parallel stranded DNA will be                studied using steady-state fluorescence methods.  Parallel stranded             DNA (psDNA) is a novel structural variant of DNA recently discovered            in the Jovin laboratory, and consists of a duplex DNA molecule in               which the individual strands are in a parallel 3'8822596                        Antholine                                                                       This proposal for research on \"Low Frequency ESR Studies of Cu-Cu               Interactions\" between Dr. William E. Antholine of the Medical                   College of Wisconsin and Dr. Peter M. H. Kroneck of the Universitaet            Konstanz, FRG, is sponsored by NSF under the U.S.-Federal Republic              of Germany Cooperative Research Program.                                                                                                                        This research will attempt to demonstrate the efficiency of low-                frequency (S-band) electron spin resonance (ESR) for unravelling                the ESR spectra from ESR detectable binuclear copper sites.                     The researchers will compare ESR data from Cu(1.5)Cu(1.5) sites in              N2OR (nitrous oxide reductase), to ESR data from cytochrome                     oxidase, to determine whether the Cu/a site is a mixed valence                  binuclear copper site.  Analysis of line widths and strain parameters           through spectral simulation is expected to account for the shape of             these ESR signals.  A demonstration of the enhanced sensitivity of              the half field lines at S-band for Cu(II)Cu(II) dimers in nitric                oxide treated tyrosinase, ceruloplasim, and nitrous oxide reductase             will be a useful result, by itself, for copper dimers.  The ESR                 group in Wisconsin has pioneered the use of multifrequency ESR as a             prime spectroscopic modality for analysis of Cu(II) sites in                    biological systems.  The group in Konstanz has studied the                      relationship between structure and function of catalytic centers in             multicopper proteins such as ascorbate oxidase and nitrous ovide                reductase.  Thus, the two groups will complement each other in                  carrying out the long term goal of the project:  to develop                     techniques to extract physical chemical data from cupric complexes              in cells and eventually in animal systems.",
