 "awd_abstract_narration": "A systematic analysis of a unique set of high quality deep                      survey data that has been collected during the last five years                  will be carried out.  Deep surveys were carried out in several                  Selected Areas at high galactic latitude with the Very Large                    Array (VLA) and Westerbork radio telescopes.  The surveys were                  followed up through charge-coupled device (CCD) photometry and                  imaging with the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT)                      Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), Palomar and the Multiple                    Mirror Telescope (MMT).  The optical data reduction and a                       thorough analysis of these data will be completed.  The                         following items are the project goals:                                                                                                                          1) Establish the nature of faint radio galaxies unambiguously                   from their morphology on the deep CCD images, the multicolor                    photometry and the available spectroscopy.                                                                                                                      2)  A systematic study of the very faint, low surface                           brightness radio galaxies that constitute the high redshift                     tail of the radio source population.  Radio galaxy redshifts                    have been measured in the range of z greater than 1 and less                    than 3.  Some of these are good candidate for (elliptical)                      galaxies in the process of formation.  Since these objects are                  very weak radio sources, they offer a unique opportunity to                     study the formation of nearly normal galaxies, of their low                     level active nuclei, and possible mutual relationship in these                  nearly normal galaxies.                                                                                                                                         3)  A systematic comparison of the optical-infrared data with                   detailed models for the spectral evolution of galaxies.  This                   will provide important constraints to possible evolutionary                     models for galaxies, the range in their formation epoch, and                    the value of the Hubble constant (Ho).  These models will                       incorporate the roll of dust, galactic winds, and red GB, AGB,                  and Carbon stars.",
