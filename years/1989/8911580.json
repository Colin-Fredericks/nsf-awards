Frederick Bove and Hector Neff will conduct analyses of                    archaeological ceramics from the Pacific coast of Guatemala which               date to the periods immediately preceding and following 250 A.D.                This date marks an abrupt change from a group of cultures termed                \"Terminal Formative\" to another set termed \"Early Classic.\"  The                team will conduct instrumental neutron activation analysis on                   approximately 400 potsherds, most from the stratified deposits at               the site of Balberta.  They shall also collect and analyze 200                  raw material samples from clay deposits in the region.  Together                with data already in hand, as well as binocular microscope                      examination, paste color analysis, and typological and attribute                analysis, it should be possible to trace changes in ceramic                     production and distribution across this time boundary.                                                                                                          Although the abrupt Formative-Classic transition has been noted                 by other archaeologists, explanations for this have varied.  Some               have suggested that some catastrophic natural event such as a                   volcanic eruption caused rapid culture change.  It has also been                suggested that long-distance culture contacts with central Mexico               played a significant role.  Finally, it has been argued that                    intra-regional or local processes are responsible for this                      change.  The issue is important because the Early Classic marks                 the appearance of hierarchically organized centralized states                   which replace a more uniform and widely distributed form of                     organization.  The question then is what process is responsible                 for the rise of the state in lowland Middle America.  The ceramic               analysis should shed light on organization of production and                    trade and this, in turn, should provide insight into changes in                 social and political organization.                                                                                                                              This research is important because it will shed light on the                    processes which gave rise to the state and led to the development               of complex societies such as our own.  It will also increase our                understanding of the prehistory of the New World.",
