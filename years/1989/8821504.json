 "awd_abstract_narration": "The astrometric measuring engine (AME) at Lick Observatory is                   used to measure the positions of stars on photographic plates.                  These data have been used to study the motions of the stars,                    studies that have important implications for our knowledge of the               structured of our galaxy.  The AME has been a very productive                   instrument.  The National Science Foundation provided the funds                 for the acquisition of the AME, and twice in the past has                       provided funds for partial support of modifications to the                      machine.  It is now planned to replace the antiquated, failing                  PDP-8 computer that now controls AME with a modern, general                     purpose, computer.                                                                                                                                              The PDP-8 will be replaced with a Sun 4/200-HM-p14 computer                     connected to a VME crate.  This system will provide for control                 of the positioning of the AME, for data taking with the Reticon                 detectors, and for on line data reduction.  This new powerful                   system will allow faster and more efficient operation, and will                 allow tasks to be done that are now impossible.  The Sun will                   also provide computation facilities for members of the Lick                     astrometric group.                                                                                                                                              At the same time, some optics on the measuring machine will also                be replaced.  This would allow alignment procedures to be done                  more quickly, and also allow plates to be measured with large                   images of stars.",
