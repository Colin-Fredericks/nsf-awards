 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-molecular weight polysilanes with side functional                     groups will be prepared and characterized.  Polysilanes are new                 materials that show strong electron delocalization in the main                  chain.  They resemble polyenes, but are more stable and can be                  prepared as soluble high polymers.  In addition to alkyl-and                    aryl-substituted polysilanes, only a trimethylsilyl derivative                  is known.  Polymers with new properties could be prepared by the                introduction of various functional groups to polysilanes.                            The principal investigator has developed a sonochemical                    synthesis of high-molecular-weight polysilanes with monomodal                   molecular weight distribution and low polydispersity, and a rapid               and quantitative dearylation of phenylsubstituted disilanes with                trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.  Triflated silanes react rapidly                 with different nucleophiles.  This technique opens new synthetic                avenues to high-molecular-weight polysilanes with side functional               groups, such as alkoxy and amino substituents which contain                     mesogenic groups, electron-donating and withdrawing groups, or                  hydrophilic groups.  Preliminary experiments show efficient                     grafting of polytetrahydrofuran from triflated polysilanes.  As                 typical vinyl monomers, substituted styrenes, vinyl ethers, and                 Nvinylcarbazole will be grafted on polysilanes.  Cyclic ethers                  and iminoethers will be used as heterocyclic monomers.  The                     preliminary characterization will involve studies of the                        influence of substitution on basic spectrosocipic properties,                   molecular-weight distributions, and thermal behavior.  These                    polysilanes can find applications as more efficient photoresists,               photoconductors, and nonlinear optical materials.",
