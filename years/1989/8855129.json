 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Pennsylvania Summer Science Academy                      is a four week, residential/commuter program for                                thirty-five academically talented and promising ninth- and                      tenth-grade students from the mid-Atlantic region.                              Additional minority students are to be recruited, in large                      measure, through a network of teachers and other referral                       sources arising from existing programs for high school                          students conducted by the College of General Studies of the                     University of Pennsylvania.                                                          The central focus of the Science Academy is a sequence                     of biochemistry lab experiments, coordinated with readings                      and classes.  Beginning with the spectroscopy and                               oxygen-binding properties of hemoglobin, and the role of                        ATP as an energy source, student teams, working under the                       guidance of University faculty and high school teachers,                        progress to independent investigations.                                              Mathematics classes, readings, and activities explore                      polyhedra, fractals, exponential growth and decay, and                          other manifestations of mathematics in nature.  Students                        sharpen their computer skills by writing programs to solve                      challenging problems, and discuss current issues in                             computing such as privacy and computer viruses.                                     Twice-weekly seminars, led by scientists from Penn and                      other institutions, introduce students to the world of the                      working scientist and to some of the social and                                 philosophical issues in science.",
