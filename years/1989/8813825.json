 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Counterflow Virtual Impactor (CVI) is an inertial                      separation device for removing cloud droplets from their                        gaseous environment for subsequent chemical and physical                        analysis.  In its present stage of development, the CVI is now                  being used by the P.I.'s group in both airborne and ground-                     based sampling of clouds. This new grant provides for the                       further development of the sampling probe and its application                   in cloud chemistry studies.  There are four objectives.  (1) to                 test design modifications to extend the range of measurable                     droplet sizes and to improve the sharpness of \"cut-size\"                        fractionation.  (2) To better define the operating limitations                  of the device with respect to problems of droplet distortion,                   break-up, evaporation, and coalescence, using both experimental                 and theoretical approaches.  (3) To apply the CVI in studies of                 dissolved labile species in cloud droplets, especially of                       sulfur dioxide.  (4)  To conduct field observations in clouds                   to explore chemical and physical questions that can be                          approached by measuring droplet properties as a function of                     particle size.",
