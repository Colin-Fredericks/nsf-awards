David                    Chudnovsky and Gregory Chudnovsky in a wide variety of                          mathematical and computer-science fields: approximations to                     functions and numbers aimed at revealing arithmetic properties of               classical constants, solution of Diophantine problems, and                      applications of number theory to mathematical physics and                       computer science.                                                                    One of the most surprising phenomena in the past ten years'                developments in mathematics is the unification that has taken                   place, with connections being discovered among branches of the                  field that would have been thought absolutely unrelated ten years               ago. This research, which brings the theory of whole numbers and                its methods to bear on physics, differential equations, and                     computer science, is very much in this unifying spirit.",
