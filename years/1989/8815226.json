The researchers                 intend to engage in a basic research project that will complement               an applied research effort in Venezuela to commercially exploit                 local seaweed resources, initially by harvesting biomass from                   nature, and subsequently by developing the technology to raise                  selected seaweeds in a mariculture system.                                                                                                                      More specifically, the researchers plan to:  screen selected                    isolates for suitability as mariculture seed stock; determine                   optimal conditions of light intensity, water temperature and                    salinity for their growth; develop techniques to vegetatively                   propagate cloned isolates by spheroplast isolation or                           fragmentation, and to seed substrate for outdoor cultivation; and               initiate sexual and somatic hybridization studies to determine the              feasibility of creating new genotypes.  By combining techniques of              genetic engineering of the U.S. side with the information from                  field studies of the Venezuelan side on the seasonality of growth               and reproduction of certain seaweed species, the proposed research              has the potential to help develop a seaweed mariculture industry                for developing countries.",
