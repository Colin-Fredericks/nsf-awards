 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shallow water carbonate deposits typically were deposited                  episodically at the meter-scale in the frequency range of 104-105               years.  The proposed research will increase our understanding of                the origin and significance of this stratigraphic cyclicity,                    using the superb exposures of Triassic carbonates in the Alps as                natural field laboratories.  Earlier work has demonstrated that                 composite eustatic sea level changes with Milankovitch                          periodicities played a fundamental role in the cyclical                         deposition of these Triassic carbonates.  The research will                     attempt, by careful field and laboratory study of the                           sedimentology, diagenesis and stratigraphy of a spectrum of                     Alpine Triassic carbonates, to extend this early work to bridge                 the gap between high frequency meter-scale cyclicity (104-105                   year) and the much larger 3rd order scale (106 year) depositional               cycles that are the fundamental units of both seismic and                       sequence stratigraphy.  If the response of shallow water                        carbonates (which are reliable sea level gauges) to the                         interaction of composite 104, 105 and 106 year sea level cycles,                subsidence, and sedimentation can be predicted (or at least                     understood), then we will have a powerful tool for use in                       stratigraphic correlation, chronostratigraphy and sequence                      stratigraphy at an outcrop or borehole core scale finer than that               detectable by current seismic stratigraphic methods.  Such                      information would have obvious value in the exploration for                     hydrocarbon reservoirs and hydrothermal ore deposits that are so                commonly hosted in shallow water carbonate deposits.",
