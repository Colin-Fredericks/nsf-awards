 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economical solid polymer electrolyte fuel cells (SPEFCs) have                   potential commercial applications for example as auxiliary power                fuel cell systems for cruise ships, offshore platforms, and                     remote navigation systems.  Compared to other currently used                    electricity generating systems, fuel cells offer many advantages,               including (1) high fuel to electricity conversion efficiency at                 both rated and part load; (2) molecular construction; and (3) low               pollutant levels.  A major impediment to the commercialization of               SPEFC is the high cost of the unsupported platinum                              electrocatalyst.  In this work the PIs plan to develop high                     utilization pulse plated carbon supported electrocatalysts for                  SPEFC applications which reduce the platinum cost by factors of                 20 to 40 relative to the state-of-the-art.                                                                                                                      In order to obtain a high utilization carbon supported SPEFC                    electrocatalyst, the PIs plan to electrodeposit the platinum                    catalyst particles onto the carbon support after it has been                    fabricated into a gas diffusion electrode and impregnated with                  Nafion.  In this approach a porous gas diffusion electrode                      structure will be prepared with high surface area carbon (not Pt                catalyzed) and Teflon using conventional techniques.  A solution                of solubilized Nafion will then be painted or sprayed into the                  porous carbon electrode structure.  The membrane side of the                    electrode will then be exposed to platinum electroplating                       solution and small particles of platinum will be deposited.  In                 this manner, the platinum catalyst particles are deposited onto                 the carbon support only in regions accessible by the solid                      electrolyte.  Consequently, all the platinum particles have ionic               accessibility and result in greatly increased platinum                          utilization.                                                                                                                                                    The objective of this Phase I research program is to demonstrate                the feasibility of preparing a high utilization carbon supported                platinum electrocatalyst using pulse plating.  Towards this                     objective, the following questions will be addressed:                                                                                                                o  Can small platinum particles (15 to 35\u001a) be deposited                           onto a smooth graphitic or glassy carbon surface using                          pulse plating?                                                                                                                                               o  Can the pulse plating deposition technique be extended                          to solid polymer electrolyte coated carbon surfaces?",
