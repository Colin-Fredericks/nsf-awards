 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will rely heavily on the use of (supercomputer)                   numerical as well as analytic techniques to study the properties                of homogeneous and inhomogeneous superconductors.  The                          theoretical techniques include:  Quantum Monte Carlo simulations,               renormalization group theory, dynamical systems theory, many body               theory, path integral methods and any other theoretical approach                that may be deemed necessary to unravel the physics of interest.                The problems to be considered motivate and are motivated directly               by experimental findings in low and high temperature                            superconductors.  Specifically, the effects of quantum zero point               fluctuations, magnetic fields, dissipation and disorder in arrays               of ultrasmall superconductor networks.  Also, we propose to carry               out a direct comparison of the physical sources of metastability                in the magnetic properties predicted to appear in artificially                  fabricated random arrays of Josephson junctions and those found                 in the novel high temperature oxide superconductors.  The physics               that will emerge from the work proposed here could have an impact               in the understanding of the submicron structures that promise to                lead to a new type of quantum effect electronic devices.",
