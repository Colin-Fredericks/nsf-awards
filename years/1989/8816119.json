Heineman            of the University of Cincinnati, Prof. Stanley Pons, University of              Utah,  and Prof. Katsumi Niki, Yokohama National University, Japan.             Participants will meet in Honolulu, Hawaii, June 6-9, 1989, to view             the current state of the art of spectroscopic characterization of               chemical processes that occur on the surface of electrodes, as well             as new methods of characterizing such surfaces. In addition, new ways           of coupling electrochemistry to spectroscopy, and also future                   research directions that may enhance the understanding of electrode             processes, will be discussed.                                                                                                                                   The seminar will bring together electrochemists and experts in surface          characterization in an attempt to see how spectroscopic characteriza-           tion of electrode surfaces by such modern electron spectroscopic                techniques as ESCA, LEEDS, EELS, and Auger spectroscopy before and              after electrochemical reactions occur may be used to better understand          those reactions.  The seminar may be expected to yield important                results applicable to the improvement of electrodes, such as, for               example, those with tailored surfaces, for use in many types of                 industrial and laboratory chemical reactions.",
