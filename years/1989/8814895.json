 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Bernard Grossman in a research                collaboration with Professor Michele Napolitano of the                          University of Bari, Italy.  The aim of the collaboration is to                  develop numerical procedures for multi-dimensional compressible                 flows, with very high levels of accuracy in smooth regions of                   the flow and capable of modelling complex shock patterns and                    other discontinuities.  More specifically, numerical procedures                 will be developed using a highly accurate upwind scheme in                      regions of smooth flow and a very robust flux-vector/                           difference-splitting method in regions containing and                           immediately surrounding shocks and other discrepancies.                         Approximate factorization and line/plane relaxation implicit                    schemes will be used to solve the discrete equation sets and a                  multigrid strategy may be necessary to accelerate convergence to                a steady state.                                                                                                                                                 The joint work will combine the expertise of the U.S. side in                   flux-vector/difference-splitting methods with that of the                       Italian side on numerical methods using the so-called lambda                    formulation, which relies on a nonconservation form of the                      governing equations.  The new methodology will be applied to                    solve external as well as internal compressible flows containing                complex shock configurations and requiring exceptionally high                   levels of accuracy, such as flows with chemical reactions or                    flows inside highly-curved turbomachinery passages as in                        advanced aircraft and propulsion systems.",
