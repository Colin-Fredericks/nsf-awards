 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research using the newly upgraded MP                   tandem Van de Graaff accelerator, a variety of experimental                     equipment, and a unique recoil mass spectrometer, at the                        University of Rochester's Nuclear Structure Research                            Laboratory.  Experiments will include studies of nuclear shapes                 by Coulomb excitation, of heavy-ion induced transfer reactions,                 of nuclear isomers on a microsecond timescale, the spectroscopy                 of neutron deficient nuclei particularly the light krypton                      isotypes, of hyperine interactions, of correlated two photon                    decay in heavy-ion reactions, of breakup processes in 7Li-                      induced reactions, of sub-barrier transfer, and of heavy ion                    reaction mechanisms.  In addition, accelerator mass                             spectrometry will be investigated in a wide variety of fields                   including geology, hydrology, cosmochemistry, Ca-41 dating of                   old bones, materials research and nuclear reaction cross                        sections.  Some of the work involves extensive collaborations                   with outside users.",
