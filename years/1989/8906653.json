 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists have hypothesized that regulation of plankton                   communities by planktivores varies with lake trophic state,                     suggesting that an interaction effect exists between fish effects               and lake trophic state effects on plankton communities.  A fish x               lake trophic state interaction effect is one that cannot be                     predicted by considering fish effects independently of lake                     trophic state effects.  To date, there have been no tests of this               fish x lake trophic state interaction hypothesis.  In the                       proposed study, there are two principle parts:  (1) a test of the               fish x lake trophic state interaction hypothesis using outdoor                  tank experiments to examine the effects of five different                       densities of a planktivore, bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), on                  the biomass and species composition of picoplankton,                            nanoplankton, microplankton, mesoplankton, and macroplankton from               six lake communities representing the range of trophic states of                southwestern reservoirs, and (2) the development of regression                  models for predicting biomass of picoplankton, nanoplankton,                    microplankton, mesoplankton, and macroplankton across gradients                 of fish density and lake trophic state.  The study will provide                 the first view of how the impacts of different densities of fish                on plankton biomass change with lake trophic state.",
