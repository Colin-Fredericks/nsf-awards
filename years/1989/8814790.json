 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most successful techniques developed for document               retrieval is relevance feedback.  The effectiveness of this                     technique can be attributed to the fact that it provides a simple               method for interactively acquiring knowledge from the user that                 is not available from the query.  In systems that use                           knowledge-based and natural language processing techniques, the                 ability to interactively acquire domain and linguistic knowledge                from users becomes crucial.  This is because, in any real                       application, this knowledge will be incomplete or missing                       entirely.  This research involves experiments explicitly designed               to test the hypothesis hat users of an information systems can                  interactively provide knowledge that will improve retrieval                     effectiveness.  The experiments will address the acquisition of                 three types of knowledge: (1) Query knowledge such as the                       relative importance of words and phrase, (2) Domain knowledge                   such as concepts that are related to the query concepts, and (3)                Linguistic knowledge that allows the system to understand                       compound nouns.  The interfaces that are used to acquire                        this knowledge will be constructed using the document retrieval                 system built at the University of Massachusetts.  The structure                 of the linguistic knowledge that is acquired will be based on the               representation language REST that is part of the ADRENAL project                at the University of Massachusetts.",
