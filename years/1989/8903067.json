 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research                           project in biological oceanography between Nenad Smodlaka of                    Rudjer Boskovic's Center for Marine Research and Malvern                        Gilmartin of the University of Maine, the investigators will                    continue their research on the eutrophication of the                            Northern Adriatic.  In prior work, the investigators                            accumulated significant oceanographic data sets on the                          effects of organic nutrients, minerals and pollutants                           discharged by northern Italian rivers.  Specifically,                           organic and inorganic deposits effectively reduce the                           dissolved oxygen needed to promulgate marine life.  In this                     new proposal, through computer analysis, eutrophication                         trends in the Adriatic will be established.  Extensive                          research will be conducted on the the role of microorganisms                    (bacteria, protozoans, nanoplankton) under eutrophic                            conditions.                                                                                                                                                     Consequences of eutrophication on the environment is                            important worldwide.  This work could serve as the basis of                     an environmental clean up plan for the Adriatic by the                          Italian and Yugoslav governments.  Furthermore, this                            research experience is a model for addressing coastal                           eutrophication problems in the United States and other                          countries.                                                                                                                                                      This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board                      on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported                       through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions                       from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia.                       The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department                    of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to                       the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia, but                         include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia                    and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
