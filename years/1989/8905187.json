 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goals of the proposed research are to expand the                      classification scheme previously developed for decapod                          crustaceans to other major crustacean groups and to enhance our                 understanding of the function and origin of decapod hemocytes.                  The specific questions to be addressed are: 1) Can a unified                    classification scheme be developed for crustacean hemocytes?, 2)                What are the relationships between circulating hemocytes and                    hematopoietic tissue during the molt cycle? and 3) What is the                  role of hematopoiesis in the crustacean \"immune\" response?                      Because hemocytes appear to perform identical physiological                     rolesin all crustaceans, it is reasonable to expect that non-                   decapod  crustaceans, like the decapods will have two hemocyte                  lines  responsible for distinct functions.  The proposed unified                classification scheme for crustacean hemocytes will be based on                 the suite of morphological, cytochemical and functional criteria                previously developed in this laboratory.  If the unified scheme                 proves feasible, it will facilitate interspecies comparisons and                interpretations of morphological, physiological and biochemical                 studies of hemocytes.   Undergraduate students will be involved                 at every level of this project.                                                                                                                                 Although much research is directed toward the understanding                     of immune function in mammals that are good models for the                      human, little is known about the analogous defense responses                    in invertebrates.  This research will contribute to basic                       knowledge of the blood cell types involved in the defense                       responses of crustacea.  While of interest for its own sake, this               knowledge is also fundamental to the future development of                      techniques to prevent or treat diseases in lobsters, shrimp, and                crabs in their natural habitats or grown under controlled                       conditions for human consumption.",
