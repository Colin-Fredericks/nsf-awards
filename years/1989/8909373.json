 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules such as laminin and                        fibronectin stimulate the growth of neuronal processes.  The                    biochemical characterization of these molecules has yielded                     substantial information about the amino acid sequences which                    promote neuritic growth and the receptors which mediate this                    response.  However, a fundamental question remains unanswered:                  what is the nature of the processes which form in the presence of               laminin or fibronectin; are they axons or dendrites?  To address                this issue, Dr. Higgins is currently determining how chronic (1-4               week) exposure to ECM components affects the morphological                      development of embryonic rat sympathetic neurons in tissue                      culture.  A combination of techniques (intracellular dye                        injection, immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy) is being                   used to distinguish axons from dendrites.  His preliminary                      experiments indicate that:  1) laminin promotes only axonal                     growth in sympathetic neurons; and 2) a basement membrane extract               causes the extension of dendrites.  These data suggest that axons               and dendrites have different growth requirements and that ECM                   molecules may play a role in determining the shape of sympathetic               neurons.  This research project will use the same bioassay to                   determine:  1) are there other neurite-promoting factors which                  act like laminin in selectively stimulating axonal growth; and 2)               what is the identity of the dendrite-program molecule?  They will               also test the hypothesis that process-specific interactions occur               because axons and dendrites have different types of ECM receptors               on their surfaces.  Such data will help to more clearly define                  the role of ECM in the morphogenesis of the nervous system.",
