 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 3.5-year project provides a model for teacher enhancement that             incorporates instruction in mathematics content and methodology with            extensive discussion of techniques for increasing the interest of middle        school students, especially girls and minorities, in mathematics.  Each         summer, 30 mathematics teachers from middle schools in Arizona will             participate in a three-week institute that includes courses in                  mathematics, the use of microcomputers, and encouraging students in             mathematics, as well as a seminar on curriculum revision.  Academic-year        activities consist of visits by the project staff to the participants'          classrooms, inservice sessions conducted by participants for their              colleagues, and a two-day workshop in the spring.  The evaluation will          measure the participants' knowledge of mathematics, their attitudes             towards teaching it, and their students' attitudes towards learning it.                                                                                         The university and the school systems are contributing an amount equal          to 32% of the NSF award as cost-sharing.",
