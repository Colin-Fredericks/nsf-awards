 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds to contribute computer support to                 the undergraduate laboratories of the Department of Biological                  Sciences at Rutgers University, Newark.  The instrumentation                    requested includes a DEC MicroVAX computer system and a                         complement of instructional personal computers to be used                       independently or as dumb terminals linked to the microVAX system.               The computer system with its complement of software will be                     useful to majors or non-majors at all levels of instruction.  At                the introductory biology level, the personal computers will be                  used primarily as instructor/tutors taking advantage of the                     simulation and modeling software presently available.  At the                   intermediate level, the PCs will be used both as                                demonstrator/tutors in the PC mode and for treatment and analysis               of data gathered during laboratory sessions in the terminal mode,               linked to the microVAX.  Finally, extensive use of the microVAX                 system will be made in the biotechnology specialization of the                  Biology major.  The RS/1 scientific software package requested                  will allow one to go from raw data all the way through a                        finalized graphical representation of the transformed data.  The                Intelligenetics software package will be used exclusively for                   molecular biology and will provide students with much needed                    training in this important biotechnology area.  The University                  has committed substantial personnel and financial resources to                  provide a state-of-the-are biological sciences and biotechnology                education at Rutgers-Newark, and the program is being implemented               by highly competent researchers and educators.  The grantee                     institution is matching this NSF award with funds from non-                     Federal sources.",
