 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Dr. Ravi Kulkarni, Department of Mathematics,           Queens College, City University of New York, to spend nine months               at the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Stockholm, Sweden.  This                     institute, which has a century-old tradition in classical analysis,             is sponsoring a special academic year on the topic of \"Hyberbolic               Geometry and Quasiconformal Mappings.\"  During this year, Dr.                   Kulkarni will carry out collaborative research with two Finnish                 mathematicians, Drs. Seppo Rickman and Pekka Tukia, University of               Helsinki, who will be directing this special program at the                     institute.  Dr. Rickman has carried out a pioneering work in                    quasiconformal and more generally quasiregular mappings.  Through               this work it has become increasingly evident that this \"quasiregular\"           direction is a right generalization of the classical geometric                  function theory.  Notably Rickman obtained complete generalizations             of the classical Picard's theorem in higher dimensions.  Recently               he has also obtained strong forms of the Nevanlinna-Ahlfors defect              relations in higher dimensions.  Dr. Tukia also has a worldwide                 reputation due to his extensive work on the extension properties of             quasiconformal mappings and geometric features of the classical                 theories of fuchsian and kleinian groups.                                                                                                                       During his stay at the institute, Dr. Kulkarni will focus on the                following: (1) the structure of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces               (2) the study of topological aspects of fuchsian and kleinian                   groups and their generalizations (3) mobius structures.  The                    results of this research should make a significant contribution to              understanding this area of geometric analysis.",
