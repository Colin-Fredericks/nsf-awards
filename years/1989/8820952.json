 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research program is to theoretically investigate          the role of transverse effects in semiconductor laser systems.  It is           well known, for example, the broad area lasers such as semiconductor            lasers are able to support many transverse modes which can result in            mode hopping as well as spatial and temporal instabilities unless such          techniques as optical and carrier confinement are employed to minimize          these difficulties.  The study of semiconductor lasers requires models          different from the traditional two-level atom formulation to describe           complicated band structure, injected carrier densities, background              dispersive effects, and the small geometries of the laser devices.              Nevertheless, the semiconductor laser dynamics show remarkable                  similarities to the predictions of the simpler models.  Because of              this and of the existing numbers of semiconductor lasers and new                systems on the horizon, an appropriate first step is to ask how an              existing model can serve as a description.  Second, how can the                 theoretical requirements of semiconductor laser devices be combined             with the existing structure of the Maxwell-Bloch configuration to               determine an appropriate set to equations for coupling the field and            active medium?  Third, design an experiment to demonstrate                      theoretical results in the spirit that theory guides, experiment                decides.  The third objective will be done in a joint collaboration.",
