 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lightwave engineering encompasses a rapidly expanding technology                which has engendered an intense global competition in research,                 industrial, commercial and military arenas.  Because of its                     importance, a major effort to develop a curriculum and supporting               instructional laboratory was undertaken of (Phase I).  Further                  resources will be used to expand the laboratory and to meet the                 unprecedented demand by students.  Equipment will be used in                    several experiments related to the following areas of the                       curriculum:  sources, detectors, passive media, sensors,                        integrated optics, holography, optical information processing, and              optical system analysis and design.  Phase II will use the highly               successful methodology of Phase I.  Experimental configurations                 will be designed, established and tested by ten teams involving 39              seniors under the direction of an engineering review board of                   faculty and engineers and scientist from government and industry.",
