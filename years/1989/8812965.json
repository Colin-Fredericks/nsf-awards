 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently, limitations on the ability to model the dynamic behavior of          machine systems often result in performance reducing dynamic behavior.          This project addresses that limitation and focuses on the development           of analytical design models of the dynamics and vibration of high               performance, high productivity machine systems.  It extends previously          developed modeling techniques to more general machine configurations            that include supporting structures, machine enclosures, and several             types of clearance connections.  The dynamic models will be formulated          to permit the future integration with acoustic analysis techniques for          predicting machine noise.  The research examines both simple and                complex dynamic models and concludes with an experimental evaluation of         the models.  The baffled impact beam is an example of a simple model.           It comprises a beam like element (representative of a machine link)             mounted in clearance connections attached to a base plate (representing         a machine supporting structure).  The plate is supported by elastic             members which represent a machine's vibration isolation supports.  The          system is excited by forces applied to the beam through the base plate.         This simplified model, although a simplification, contains                      representations of all of the essential elements found in a large class         of machine systems.  Dynamics modeling of this system is based on the           finite element approach.  Its validity will be tested experimentally.           The complex modeling effort is similar to that associated with the              simple models but will concentrate on models which are more                     representative of realistic machine systems.",
