 "awd_abstract_narration": "Slime molds in the group Eumycetozoa are amoeboid protists                 which produce spore-bearing fruiting bodies and have amoebae with               acutely pointed pseudopodia.  The more commonly recognized                      members of the group are the widely studied myxomycetes, or                     \"true\" slime molds, and dictyostelid cellular slime molds.                      Members of both groups have been used as model systems in cell                  and developmental biology.  However, a third group, the                         protostelids, has received far less attention.  The protostelids                have very simple fruiting bodies, but many different types of                   amoebae are found in various species.  If the protostelids can be               demonstrated to be a monophyletic group, then they would provide                an excellent model for:  (1) the study of the evolution of                      patterns of amoeboid cell motility and (2) the study of phylogeny               in amoeboid protists in general.                                                     Previous work by Dr. Spiegel of the University of Arkansas                 has shown that the seven genera of protostelids with an                         amoeboflagellate state in the life cycle are members of a                       monophyletic lineage along with the myxomycetes, and phylogenetic               analysis gives a clear picture of the relationships within the                  group.  The present study will attempt to determine whether                     members of the protostelids that have only nonflagellate amoebae                in the life cycle are related to these seven flagellate genera.                 The work will concentrate primarily on the two large genera                     Protostelium and Schizoplasmodiopsis.  Preliminary work suggests                that the former is polyphyletic and will have species related to                several flagellate genera while the latter may be monophyletic.                 The species in these genera will be examined with light                         microscopy, immunofluorescence microscopy, and electron                         microscopy to determine the details of amoebal structure,                       fruiting body development, and some aspects of mitosis.  the                    characters that are discovered will be used to compare the                      various species to the flagellate protostelids and to other                     protists to which they might be related.  It is hoped that the                  study will result in a strongly supported phylogenetic                          classification of the protostelids.",
