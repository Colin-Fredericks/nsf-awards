 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scholars agree that two central questions in political economy are:             How do economic markets become politically regulated?  And, once                regulated, what determines the allocation of resources within them?  To         date, little research has been directed at these questions.                                                                                                     This project will address these questions by examining the case of the          international coffee market.  The market is regulated by international          agreement.  One objective of this research is to examine what led to            the elaboration of political rules to govern trade in this commodity.           Another objective is to characterize the way in which these rules               influence the quantities traded and the price levels maintained in              international markets.                                                                                                                                          The study of the political regulation of markets lies at the forefront          of theoretical concerns in contemporary social science.  The research           is also important for policy reasons.  Coffee represents one of the             most valuable exports from the unstable countries of Central and                Southern America.  Understanding the way in which trade in this                 commoditiy is governed is thus of great interest, for it may help               policy makers to restructure the rules of the agreement so as to bring          greater prosperity to these strategically important nations.",
