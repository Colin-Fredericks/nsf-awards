 "awd_abstract_narration": "The source of quartz in sedimentary rocks has been a topic                 of intense interest to sedimentary petrologists for more than 100               years, with the major effort devoted to sand-size grains.                       However, at least half of all detrital quartz is of silt size                   and the origin of these grains has proved to be a more difficult                problem.                                                                             PI will examine grain size, petrographic and oxygen isotopic               changes in coexisting quartz and illite during the transition                   from shale to slate to phyllite in pelites of the Stanley                       Formation (Mississippian) in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas.                In the core area of the Ouachitas these pelites have developed                  slaty cleavage and in the central part of the core they have                    developed the sheen associated with growth of phyllosilicate                    minerals that characterizes phyllites.  The results of this                     study, when correlated with published vitrinite reflectance data,               will establish (1) the temperature at which detrital quartz in                  shales reequilibrates with the sediment pile during very low-                   grade metamorphism; (2) the relationship between oxygen isotopic                values in quartz and metamorphic grade in the slate-phyllite                    series; (3) the conditions during very low-grade metamorphism in                which grain size and proportion of polycrystalline quartz                       increase; (4) the relationship between field appearance (shale,                 slate, phyllite) of pelites and the various petrographic and                    isotopic variations.",
