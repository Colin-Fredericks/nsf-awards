 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal would partially support the travel of 50 scientists               to attend the XIth International Symposium on Comparative                       Endocrinology to be held near Malaga, Spain from May 14 to May                  20, 1989.  The symposium will integrate all areas of comparative                endocrinology, from unicellular organisms up to and including                   mammals while covering all aspects from the molecular to the                    organismic level.  The symposium is intended to assure the active               participation of younger scientists and intends to serve as a                   forum for the formation of an International Federation of                       Comparative Endocrinologists.  Two satellite symposia associated                on the aquaculture of teleosts and the reproduction of                          cyclostomes will follow.  The symposium is open to everyone                     interested and has been announced in the scientific journals.                   The proceedings will be published within 3 months of the meeting.               Four hundred to five hundred participants are expected from more                than 40 nations, with 150 U.S. scientists expressing an interest.               Travel funds will be used to support the travel of junior as well               as senior scientists with appropriate regard for the support of                 women and minorities.                                                                                                                                           This international symposium will allow the meeting of scientists               from around the world to exchange ideas in a timely fashion on                  the endocrinology of diverse species, a topic of great importance               to the area of biodiversity.",
