 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in the representations of                 Lie groups by Professor John S.P. Wang of Purdue University. Dr.                Wang's project is to work on a conjecture relating Zuckerman                    modules of a semisimple connected Lie group to the L2 cohomology                of the quotient of the group by a well-chosen discrete subgroup.                Professor Wang's earlier work has already provided evidence of                  the truth of this conjecture in many cases, and his results will                be of importance not only in the general theory of Lie Groups but               also in the more special field of automorphic functions.                             Group theory began in the early nineteenth century as a                    description of operations that might be done successively, and                  also undone, as a ninety-degree clockwise rotation is undone by                 the ninety-degree counterclockwise rotation. Lie groups were                    developed in the late part of that century by the path breaking                 Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, who was interested in the                   most fundamental questions concerning differential equations.                   Now, one hundred years later, group theory pervades modern                      mathematics, and the utility of Lie groups in many branches of                  mathematics, as well as in physics, has continued undiminished.",
