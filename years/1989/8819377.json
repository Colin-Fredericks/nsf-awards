A primary aim                  of the conference is to discuss current research in high-energy                 physics and cosmology, and to promote cooperation between                       physicists from the region (countries in South Asia and the                     Middle East) and with physicists from the Western World.                        Participation of younger physicists from the region is                          especially encouraged.  Topics to be discussed include:  1. The                 Standard Model and Beyond  2. Superstrings:  superstring                        compactification and phenomenology, multi-loop amplitudes, two                  dimensional conformal field theories, four dimensional                          superstrings, and new aspects of virasoro-algebras and 3.                       Cosmology:  inflation, cosmic strings, quantum cosmology,                       blackhole radiation, and large scale structure.  Both lectures                  and seminar sessions will be organized.                                                                                                                         Scope:  Eight eminent U.S. physicists are scheduled to                          participate.  Others are expected from CERN in Switzerland,                     from France, Ireland, Japan and from China.  Partial support                    has been provided by the International Center for Theoretical                   Physics, and local arrangements are covered by the Pakistani                    hosts.  This conference follows a highly successful conference                  by the same organizers held in Adana, Turkey in September,                      1987.",
