 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project integrates empirical learning modules into a                  select cross-section of the economics curriculum:  introductory,                required, and economics elective courses.  In these modules,                    students perform analyses with real data and interact with                      realistic economic simulations.  By contrast, the standard                      economics curriculum isolates empirical analysis in statistics                  and econometrics courses, giving undergraduate students a                       mistaken sense of the practice of economics, a discipline which                 relies heavily on observation and discovery.  This project                      promotes students' capacities to apply economic concepts in                     solving problems and in evaluating economic arguments.                          Integration of the modules accomplishes this goal.  To enable the               department to proceed with this project, a microcomputer                        laboratory with attendant peripheral devices, software, and                     databases is being installed.  The resources of this facility are               essential as current facilities are not sufficient for these                    purposes.  The laboratory has twenty one microcomputers, five                   printers, a projection/demonstration system, and a central                      processor/file server with computers linked by a local-area                     network (LAN).  Data and software are stored on the file server                 and accessed via the network.  In addition to hardware, funds are               requested for econometric software, economic databases, and                     economic simulation programs.                                                                                                                                        The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal                    amount of funds.",
