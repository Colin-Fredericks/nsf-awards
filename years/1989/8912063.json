 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the role of randomness and parallelism.               Specific problems involving the behavior of algorithms with random              input include hashing, packing, and partitioning algorithms.  With              respect to parallel computation, the PI (with Megiddo and Ramachandran)         showed that linear programming with two variables per constraint (and           in the objective function) is solvable in polylog space.  This project          investigates whether it is in NC (or possibly RNC), along with                  variations of the problem, and their relation to problems such as               matching.  Also under investigation is the reduction of the processor           count in parallel algorithms.  Of particular interest are problems such         as path-finding in directed graphs, and special cases such as planar            graphs.",
