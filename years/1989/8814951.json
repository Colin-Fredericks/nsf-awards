 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professors Richard Wallis and Alexei                    Maradudin of the University of California at Irvine in a                        research collaboration with Professor Virginio Bortolani of the                 University of Modena, Italy.  The investigators intend to focus                 on surface phonons, whose dispersion curves have been measured                  for a wide variety of metals, insulators, and semiconductors by                 the inelastic helium atom scattering technique.  They intend to                 carry out a concerted theoretical and computational effort to                   provide values for the surface phonon linewidths as functions of                temperature for copper, silver, and gold surfaces.  The required                anharmonic parameters will be determined from the known third                   order elastic constants.  The researchers also intend to carry                  out calculations of surface phonon dispersion curves and                        eigenvectors for surfaces of noble metals and                                   face-centered-cubic transition metals.                                                                                                                          Much progress has been made in recent years in the experimental                 determination of surface phonon dispersion curves of a broad                    fange of crystal surfaces, using inelastic electron scattering                  and inelastic helium atom scattering.  The latter technique has                 been applied with great success to a wide range of materials and                keeps providing new insights into the study of surface dynamics.                The proposed collaboration will enable the U.S. investigators to                benefit from the expertise of the Italian investigators in                      calculating accurate phonon frequencies and eigenvectors for                    noble metal surfaces.  The U.S.side will contribute in turn its                 expertise in calculating the linewidths of surface phonons,                     which stems from their comprehensive program studying                           anharmonic effects at crystal surfaces.",
