 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this three-year project is the revitalization of high school        geometry under a model in which the university gradually transfers to           the schools the responsibility for curriculum development.  Under the           guidance of the district's mathematics supervisor, a university                 mathematics educator, and a research geometer, 16 high school                   mathematics teachers from a school district in Northern California will         study new topics in geometry and related classroom activities and will          develop 24 curriculum modules.  Throughout the course of the project,           the participants will meet for two hours per day with the project staff.        Printed materials and videotapes will be used for dissemination, and the        evaluation will assess the project's effect on teachers' knowledge of           geometry, their teaching skills, and their students.                                                                                                            An amount equal to 25% of the NSF award is being contributed as cost-           sharing by the Campbell Union School District.",
