 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stable carbon isotope ratios represent a newly available                   technique for assessing integrated plant responses to                           environmental stress.  These isotope ratios offer the unique                    advantage of yielding time-averaged data about long term                        conditions and adaptations.  The objectives of this study are to                                                                                                delineate the environmental parameters, such as vapor pressure                  deficit, temperature, respiratory fraction and soil nitrogen                    which exert control over stable carbon isotope ratios and to                    assess how different strategies of adaptation to water stress are                                                                                               expressed on a physiological level.                                                  Environmental factors which influence carbon isotope                       discrimination will be investigated in a series of controlled                   laboratory experiments and field studies.  Two study species                    which utilize contrasting ecophysiologic strategies for                         adaptation to environmental stress will be studied.  One of these                                                                                               is the creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), a dominate evergreen                  shrub throughout the southwestern deserts of the United States.                                                                                                 The second species is the ohia (Metrosideros polymorpha), an                    ecologically wide ranging forest tree in the Hawaiian Islands.  A                                                                                               model will be developed to predict water stress responses from                                                                                                  13C values, and tested by sampling tissues for 13C, and comparing                                                                                               predicted with measured parameters in plants growing under                                                                                                      controlled conditions in the laboratory and in the field along a                                                                                                gradient of soil water availability.  The information gathered in                                                                                               this study is expected to provide the basis for wide-ranging                                                                                                    application of this isotopic technique and provide new insights                                                                                                 into the nature of plant adaptation to environmental stress.",
