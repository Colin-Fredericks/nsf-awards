 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to determine the sulfide petrology, sulfur            contents, and sulfur isotopic compositions of well documented                   fresh submarine glasses and rocks form the Mariana Arc and back                 arc trough.  The goal is to evaluate the sources and sinks of                   sulfur in these rocks in order to investigate role of subducted                 oceanic lithosphere and hydrothermally altered fore arc rocks in                the generation of back arc basin magmas. These data will also be                useful for understanding the sources of sulfur in massive sulfide               ore deposits  formed in back arc settings.                                      %%%                                                                                     A primary goal in petrogenesis is to understand the source              materials of magmas that are produced in various settings.  One                 important setting in the ocean crust is the back arc basin.  Back               arc basin magmas are thought to be derived from mixing of two                   different mantle sources.  Because the suggested sources have                   different sulfur isotopic compositions, their analysis in the                   rocks from the Mariana Arc and back arc trough will provide                     fundamental new data to help sort out the sources of back arc                   basin magmas. A study of the sulfide petrology will help to                     determine the fate of sulfur in back arc basin magmas.",
