 "awd_abstract_narration": "The formation of the photosynthetic unit is being monitored in                  chloroplasts developing under controlled conditions.  The                       assembly and organization of four distinct Chl a and Chl b-                     containing polypeptides in the light-harvesting complex of PSII                 are being studied by quantitation of photosystem complexes,                     measurement of the Chl antenna size and composition in situ,                    correlation with polypeptide subunit composition, and immunoblot                analysis.  In addition, the origin, physiological significance                  and function of three novel low molecular-weight proteins (12-19                kDa region) are being studied.  These are abundant in the                       thylakoid membrane during the assembly/development of the PSU but               are largely absent from the mature chloroplast.  Experiments are                designed for the isolation of the three novel proteins and for                  the formation of antibodies against the respective polypeptides.                Subsequent research will investigate the immunological cross-                   reactivity, chemical cross-linking and localization of these                    proteins in the thylakoid membrane.                                                                                                                             Solar energy, the ultimate source of all biological energy on                   this planet, is converted to chemical form through absorption of                light by chlorophyll in the photosynthetic unit of green plants.                This research is elucidating the architecture and function of                   this unit in green plant chloroplasts and is providing                          information on the assembly/organization of the photosynthetic                  unit.  It will lead to an understanding of light utilization in a               biological energy conversion process.",
