 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative effort between Professors M. Karpovsky at               BostonUniversity and D. Pradhan at the University of Massachusetts.             The proposedinvestigations are two.fold.  The first concerns fault              detection by acompression of test responses.  Errors (manifestations of         faults) are definedas the component.wise exclusive OR between actual            test responses and fault.free responses.  Faults are masked if the              observed signature (compressed test                                             response) is equal to the reference.  Thus, depending on the statistics         of theerrors, an optimal compressor is the compressor that minimizes a          probabilitythat the test responses are compressed into the reference.           The design ofoptimal compressors when the distribution of ones                  contained in error sequences is known for a given circuit under test is         being investigated.  This work isalso based on single error correcting          codes over a finite field.  Second isboard\u001a.\u001alevel diagnosis by                 signature analysis.  The objective is to analyzetradeoffs between the           hardware complexity of the redundant chips on the boardand test time.           Two techniques, based on compression of test responses, arebeing                pursued.  These are; space\u001a.\u001atime compression of test responses,                anextension of previous research in space compressors; and board                diagnosis byHamming codes over a finite field.                                  Professors Karpovsky and Pradhan, are outstanding researchers with              solidrecords of accomplishment over the past decade, and that they are          very likelyto continue first class research.  The research topic, test          response analysis, is important to industry, and is a high.priority             category within the Design,Tools and Test Program.",
