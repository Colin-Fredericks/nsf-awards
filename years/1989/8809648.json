 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from Rutgers University, in cooperation with Princeton            University, AT&T Bell Laboratories (Bell Labs), and Bell Communications         Research (Bellcore), requests funds to establish a Science and                  Technology Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer             Science.  The Director of the Center will be Professor Daniel Gorenstein        of Rutgers University.                                                                                                                                          The Center in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science will        strengthen the development of these two overlapping areas by focussing          research activity in a continuing series of year-long research programs,        workshops and conferences.  Approximately seventy researchers from the          four collaborating institutions provide the background coherence and            direction for this activity.  The core of the research activity will be         carried out by a vigorous program of visitors (both senior and junior)          from other institutions (academic, industrial, government laboratory).          Postdoctoral fellows and graduate students will be affiliated with the          Center for varying lengths of time.                                                                                                                             Each year the Center will designate specific areas for special                  attention, inviting leading experts in the designated fields to organize        a research program in those areas of concentration.  These areas will be        chosen to take advantage of the expertise of the participating personnel        from the collaborating institutions while addressing questions of               demonstrable interest to researchers in both the discrete mathematics           and theoretical computer science communities.                                                                                                                   Within these general guidelines, there are several avenues of potential         emphasis that involve both serious theoretical inquiry and relevant             application.  For example, our modern \"information society\" depends on          clear, efficiently designed and reliable telecommunications and                 communications systems.  These are easily described by network theory           and can be modeled using linear programming techniques.  Transportation         problems require similar techniques; and optimization and linear                programming, possibly enhanced by parallel computations, are critical in        VLSI design and manufacture.                                                                                                                                    Discrete and computational geometry are foundational disciplines for            computer graphics and robotics.  As the geometries required for the             applications become increasingly more complex, research in computational        geometry becomes ever more important.  Yet there are fundamental                questions in discrete and computational geometry that must be addressed         before the applications can be realized.",
