Four instructional modules have been               developed in the fundamentals of electrical engineering in which                common standards were set to facilitate inter-institution use of                the modules.  A national association of universities is being                   created to develop additional modules and to provide peer review                and distribution of materials developed.  Ultimately, a self-                   sustaining organization will be created to market, distribute and               support innovative instructional modules utilizing modern                       workstation technology.                                                                                                                                         This project is being supported by significant contributions from               the institutions involved.",
