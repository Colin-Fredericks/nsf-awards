 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program addresses fundamental                                     concepts for understanding the behavior of                                      granular material (usually sand)  saturated                                     with water (below the ground water table) when                                  subjected to the strong ground motions                                          resulting from earthquake shaking.  Under                                       these conditions, such soils have the                                           potential to \"liquefy\", that is to lose shear                                   strength and undergo large deformations,                                        resulting in damage to building foundations,                                    tunnels and pipelines built on or passing                                       through such liquefied soil.  This phenomenon                                   is related to the response of saturated loose                                   sands strained sufficiently to result in flow                                   slides.  A                                                                      devastating landslides is an example of such                                    a flowslide.                                                                                                                                                    The relation between the steady state (flow                                     slide) and the cyclic (earthquake) behavior is                                  being addressed by fundamental experimental                                     studies.  A key element to be investigated is                                   the concept of structural collapse of the sand                                  fabric.  The concept of \"collapse\" is                                           associated with the fact that the structure of                                  contractive sands is metastable.  In a                                          collapsive skeleton, small shear strains may                                    be sufficient to produce a sudden                                               rearrangement of grains with an associated                                      loss of contact points between neighboring                                      grains, accompanied by a large increase in                                      pore water pressure.  Consequently, the shear                                   strength of the sand is reduced to a small                                      value and the sand becomes susceptible to                                       large deformations.                                                                                                                                             The results of this investigation are expected                                  to contribute to an improved understanding of                                   liquefaction phenomena and associated                                           instabilities, and to result in an improved                                     ability to predict their occurrence.",
