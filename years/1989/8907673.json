 "awd_abstract_narration": "The African antelopes promise the most comprehensive                       evolutionary studies in large mammals.  Antelopes include more                  living and extinct species than does any other large mammal group               known over the past 20 million years.  Their fossil record is                   exceptional not only in terms of species-richness, but also in                  the wealth of dating estimates and paleoenvironmental data                      associated with it.                                                                  Vrba and DeSalle are analyzing the phylogenetic relationship               trees of three major antelope groups with abundant living and                   fossil representatives, by studying DNA molecules of living                     species, and skull characters of living and extinct species.                         DNA changes between pairs of species will be compared with                 absolute dates for the same lineages in the fossil record.  This                will allow 1) estimates of rates of molecular change in lineages                and 2) estimates of absolute dates of the origins of new species                by lineage-branching; and 3) comparison of nature of these                      evolutionary events with the nature of coincident                               paleoenvironmental changes.                                                          The powerful compound data set will test various, hypotheses               of how evolution occurs.  One such hypothesis whether there is                  synchronization across phylogenies of speciations (predicted if                 wide-spread climatic changes provide the common driving force                   that initiates evolutionary changes in many lineages) versus                    random distribution against time.                                                    The Family of humans, Hominidae, evolved over the same time                period and African areas.  In fact, by far the most abundant                    large mammal fossils found together with early hominid remains                  are the very antelope groups under study.  Thus, the nature and                 timing of evolutionary responses in hominids will be compared                   with those of the co-evolving large mammal lineages.  A                         comprehension of the rich physical and biological context of                    human evolution is necessary for understanding human origins.",
