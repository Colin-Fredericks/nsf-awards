 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in biophysics                          to be conducted by Giuseppe Inesi of the University of                          Maryland at Baltimore and Leopoldo de Meis of the                               Federal University in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  The                              topic is calcium transport across biological                                    membranes.  The specific aim is to clarify the                                  mechanisms of calcium uptake in membrane vesicles                               obtained from muscle tissue.  The biological                                    significance of the research is related to the                                  contraction and relaxation of muscle fibers.  Chemical                          significance lies in understanding enzyme kinetics and                          catalysis, the coupling of catalytic and tranport                               activities, channels and transmembrane flow of                                  electrolytes and the structure of proteins.                                                                                                                     There has been a long-standing, productive                                      collaboration between Dr. Inesi and several Brazilian                           scientists who, as postdoctoral associates, have spent                          extended periods of time in his laboratory.  This                               grant will allow for the continuation of this                                   cooperation and enhance Dr. Inesi's participation in                            the work in Brazil.  Both investigators are well                                qualified and will carry out work on an important                               problem in a vital area of research.",
