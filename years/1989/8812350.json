 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strike-slip faults are common geologic structures that separate                 geologic blocks.  The North American-Caribbean strike-slip                      boundary provides a unique example of a large offset (-1100                     km), active transform fault that exhibits characteristics of                    both oceanic and continental transforms.  The plate tectonic                    controls on the structure of this interplate boundary in                        Central America and the western Cayman Trough remain poorly                     understood.  Moreover, the relations between strike-slip faults                 of the interplate boundary and a broad zone of active                           interplate deformation - the Western Caribbean Extensional                      Province - have not been explored with modern marine                            geophysical techniques.  The interpretation of this complex                     area has great implications for interpreting the structure of                   other active oceanic and continental strike-slip zones as well                  as ancient strike-slip faults now preserved in mountain belts.                  %%%                                                                                                                                                             This project involves a marine survey of structure in the                       Cayman Trough along the North American - Caribbean strike-slip                  boundary using the SeaMARC II high-resolution side-scan sonar.                  This survey is designed to help resolve several long-standing                   questions in strike-slip tectonics including how strike-slip                    faults and associated structures can be interpreted in terms of                 the direction of interplate motion and the stress state of the                  interplate area, and how the structure of strike-slip faults is                 affected by continental vs. oceanic crustal type.",
