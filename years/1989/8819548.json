 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the strong motion records taken from the 26                     accelerographs located on and in the vicinity of the Vincent                    Thomas Bridge during the 1987 Whittier Earthquake will be                       studied.  The study will:  (i)  define representative and                       appropriately correlated non-synchronous support motions, (ii)                  validate existing analytical modelling and seismic analysis, (iii)              develop system identification techniques that deal with                         multiple-input multiple-output models (both linear and                          nonlinear), (iv)  evaluate the bridge performance during the                    earthquake, (v)  optimize the return on the instrumentation                     investment and improve the usefulness of the recorded-response                  data, (vi)  propose a general program for strengthening or                      retrofitting of existing cable-supported bridges, (vii)  obtain                 information on damping values as a function of the vibrational                  amplitudes, (viii)  obtain information on the soil-structure                    interaction of this massive structure, (ix)  develop elastic                    stoppers or other special devices to dampen the effects of                      seismic and wind forces.                                                                                                                                        The study will fulfill an urgent need for comprehensive                         investigations of these unique and historical response records                  to insure the safety of suspension bridges which have been                      widely in use across the nation's seismic zones.  The research                  results will be of extreme importance to strengthen existing                    cable-supported bridges (as well as to design new structure,                    and for up-grading and installing new monitoring                                instrumentation).",
