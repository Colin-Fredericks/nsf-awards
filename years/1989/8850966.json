 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rutgers/Industry Program for Teachers of Modern Biology                     is designed to modernize and deepen the biology background of                   90 well-prepared high school teachers nationwide over three                     years, and to provide them with teaching materials (modules)                    representative of topics of modern scientific and                               technological  interest.  The program will consist of three                     main activities: (i) module development and revision: during                    this time teachers and scientists will work together to                         develop and revise modules on topics of scientific and                          technological interest for general distribution throughout                      the country.  These revisions will be based on suggestions                      made by the teachers involved in all three of the program's                     activities. (ii) a leadership institute:  here, biology                         teachers will study the modules with the assistance of lead                     teachers and faculty, attend seminars developed by                              university and industry scientists and consider alternative                     teaching strategies; and (iii) a summer program; here, the                      lead  teachers will use the modules with a group of high                        school girls.  An essential component of the program is the                     establishment of an  academic/industry relationship and a                       support system consisting ofmeetings, a newsletter and a                        computer network.                                                                                                                                               An amount equivalent to nearly 30% of the NSF award is being                    contributed by  Rutgers University and other sources.",
