 "awd_abstract_narration": "Few long-term glacial records exist, and the ones that do are                   geographically scattered.  The White Mountains, immediately east of             the central Sierra Nevada in California and Nevada have one                     of the most complete sequences of deposits from glacial events in North         America.  New pre- and post-applications of new surface exposure dating         methods make it possible to determine ages of geomorphic surfaces               through analyses of multiple cosmogenic isotopes that accumulate in             surface boulders.  The goal of this collaborative project is to develop         a numerical glacial chronology for the White Mountains using these              surface-exposure dating methods in conjunction with dates based on              associated volcanics, rock varnish, soils, and weathering.  The                 investigators will use the same approach in the Sierra Nevada in order          to an accurately compare the two records and to discriminate the                effects of synoptic climatology versus tectonic history as controls on          the glaciation of the mountain ranges.  The research is anticipated to          provide one of the most complete continental records of glacial events          in North America.  The results obtained also will provide a chronology          for comparing a continental glacial record with other long-term records         of continental and environmental change and with the well-established           marine record.                                                                                                                                                  The study will use multiple and varied dating techniques, some of which         are in the intial stages of development, to help unravel the glacial            chronology of the White Mountains.  This interdisciplinary research             effort will help assess the viability of new dating approaches and              various traditional glacial, soils, and geomorphological techniques             used by physical geographers and other earth scientists.  The research          will contribute to our understanding of how the well-preserved glacial          sequence in the White Mountains relates to changes in climate, tectonic         activity, and vegetation.  The study will correlate the White Mountain          glacial sequence to other regional continental geomorphic                       investigations and to the lengthy glacio-marine record, and it will             provide insight into the scale and timing of large changes in the               hydrologic balance of the Western United States.",
