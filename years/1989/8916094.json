 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade it has become clear that microzooplankton                  are important contributors to pelagic food chain processes.                     Estimating microzooplanktonic biomass is one major difficulty                   that can possibly be resolved by use of pigment analogs.  The                   carotenoid pigments are easily isolated from microzooplankton by                high performance liquid chromatography.  Using a wide variety of                cultured animals and various culture conditions, the study will                 address the correlation between tissue carotenoid content and                   microzooplankton biomass and identify principal sources of                      variance in the relationship.  The study will not only evaluate                 the usefulness of these pigments as biomass estimators, but will                indicate new areas of investigation of pigment biochemistry in                  pelagic ecology.  Fast and in situ measures of food chain                       interactions are part of the foundation for future long term,                   untended observations of biological processes in the sea.  New                  techniques with field applicability are necessary for the                       advancement of biological oceanography, and this study will                     assess a new method and its sources of error in detail.                         %%%                                                                                                                                                             Close examination of the food chain dynamics of the sea in recent               years has shown that much predatory activity and transfer of                    material involves small organisms not captured by ordinary                      plankton nets.  The organisms are numerous and small making it                  difficult to establish their quantitative significance in a fast,               repeatable way.  Since they contain carotenoid pigments which can               be extracted and analyzed quickly, the pigment content may be a                 useful indicator of animal biomass.  This possibility will be                   tested on a variety of organisms grown in the laboratory and                    collected from the sea.",
