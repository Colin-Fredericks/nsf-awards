 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between U.S. and                 French material scientists on the topic of ion-assisted coating of              stainless steel.  The U.S. investigators, all from Stanford                     University, are:  Dr. Robert Sinclair, Dr. William Nix and Dr.                  David Stevenson.  The French counterpart is Professor P. Moine,                 Laboratoire de Metallurgie Physique, University of Poitiers.                                                                                                    Ion-implementation has become over the past decade a versatile and              effective method for the modification of materials properties,                  including those of metals,semi-conductors, ceramics, composites and             polymers.  In this project the investigators will carry out a                   scientific investigation of the ion-assisted coating of stainless               steel.  The technical goal is to realize a low friction                         coefficient, high wear and corrosion resistant surface, by using                amorphous TiNi combined with BN.  The scientific issues addressed               will be:                                                                                                                                                        1.  The relationship of the coating microstructure with ion-beam                    processing conditions, by carrying out thorough material                        characterization on a wide variety of samples.                                                                                                              2.  Correlation of the surface properties with the microstructure,                  with particular attention to adhesion, nano-hardness, friction,                 wear and corrosion.                                                                                                                                         The Poitiers laboratory is well-equipped for the ion-implantation,              secondary ion-mass spectrometry and x-ray characterization, and the             tribological property studies.  The Stanford group has much                     experience with cross-section transmission electron microscopy,                 mechanical properties of thin films and electrochemical corrosion               studies.  Results of this research should provide 1) new knowledge              about the structure, properties and formation mechanisms of novel               and promising coatings of stainless steel and 2) improved                       understanding of ion-assisted coating technology.",
