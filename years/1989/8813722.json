 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. John J. Eisch of the Chemistry Department,              SUNY at Binghamton, for collaboration in research with Dr. Carl                 Krueger of the Max Planck Institute for Coal Research in Muelheim,              FRG.  They are studying how nickel is able to catalyze chemical                 reactions in hydrocarbons.  By measuring both the speed of certain              well defined catalytic nickel compounds and the variations in their             molecular structure, they hope to identify what features in the                 nickel catalyst structure have an accelerating or retarding influence           on the speed of the hydrocarbon reactions it helps to catalyze.  The            German laboratory offers highly sophisticated facilities for                    structure determination, especially electron density maps, and for              molecular calculations.  The U.S. group has much experience in the              kinetics of organometallic reactions and the detection of catalytic             intermediates.                                                                                                                                                  The catalytic action of transition metals, such as nickel and iron,             on unsaturated hydrocarbons has been found to lead to a versatile               array of valuable organic chemicals.  However, little is known about            how transition metals are able to effect these extraordinary chemical           reactions on a molecular basis.  This research should provide a                 rational basis for predicting catalytic activity of nickel compounds.",
