 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research consists of the development of an integrated expert                system for earthquake-resistant design of building structures, that is          capable of providing consultation and decision support for the                  different phases of the earthquake-resistant design process for                 buildings.  The design of structures for earthquake loads requires              specialized knowledge in several inter-related disciplines, which is            usually not available at a design office on a routine basis.  This              expert system will be able to mimic the reasoning process and the               decision-making actions of these experts.                                                                                                                       In the Phase I study, a conceptual architecture and the basic                   framework for such an expert system was developed.  The feasibility             of the architecture and the framework was demonstrated by building              two prototype modules of the expert system.  In this research, based            on the architecture so developed, the knowledge, procedures, and                judgments/heuristics for different steps in the earthquake-resistant            design process are integrated into functioning Knowledge-Based                  Expert Systems (KBES's).  In addition, design and development of                the supporting modules and facilities, e.g., interactive user                   interfaces, design and implementation of local data bases, and a                flexible \"blackboard\" support facility are included.                                                                                                            This research represents Phase II of the Small Business Innovation              Research Program.",
