 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with control theory and its                          applications.  It focuses on two areas of current theoretical                   interest including vibrational and robust periodic feedback                     control theory for systems governed by functional and partial                   differential equations, and adaptation criteria and adaptive                    control algorithms for such systems.  The first topic addresses                 systems  characterized by the transport of matter and/or energy                 or the transformation of information.  Models of such systems                   typically involve space derivatives and time delays.  This class                of systems include plasmas, nuclear and chemical reactors,                      transmission lines, mechanical systems with fluids, and                         combustion systems.  For such systems, conventional time                        invariant feedback and feedforward control laws cannot guarantee                the desired control performance.  The concept of vibrational and                periodic feedback offers some hope of improved control for these                systems.  For the second topic, the use of asymptotic and                       geometric techniques  for reduction of system complexity, and the               use of knowledge based rules will aid in the design of finite                   dimensional adaptive controllers of systems described above.  The               theory developed in both of these studies will be tested in an                  advanced control laboratory.",
