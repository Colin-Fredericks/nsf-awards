The workshop will take place over a weekend in                 the summer of 1989, in conjunction with the Linguistic Society                  of America Institute, to be hosted by the University of                         Arizona, Tucson.                                                                                                                                                The workshop is designed to (a) provide a forum for the                         interaction of phonologists currently working on ASL, with                      linguists involved in other areas of phonological research; and                 (b) familiarize a wider linguistic audience with recent                         research in this area, and its import for our understanding of                  phonological structure in general.  The workshop is expected to                 accelerate the development of this subfield of linguistics,                     which promises to provide significant advances in our                           understanding of the role played by the modality of the signal                  in determining the nature of phonologic structure in human                      language.  An edited collection of papers resulting from the                    workshop will be published.",
