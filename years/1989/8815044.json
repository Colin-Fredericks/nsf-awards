 "awd_abstract_narration": "Infanticide, the killing of infants by other members of the                same species, is a common phenomenon in wild animals.  Adult                    males often kill unrelated infants and then mate with the female,               whereas adult females kill strange pups to remove competition for               their offspring and to acquire the nest of the victim female.                   Little is known about the conditions under which infanticide                    occurs, the mechanisms males and females use to distinguish their               own from unrelated offspring, how infanticide affects population                growth, and whether or not the tendency to commit infanticide is                inherited.  In this proposed study the principal investigator                   will determine (1) what cues males and females use to recognize                 their own offspring, and thus avoid killing related pups, (2) if                there is genetic basis for the tendency to commit infanticide,                  and (3) how population growth and stability are affected by the                 presence of infanticidal and noninfanticidal animals.  The                      frequency of infanticide in a marked, wild population of white-                 footed mice at high and low densities will be monitored, and                    breeding experiments will be conducted in the laboratory to                     determine the inheritance of infanticidal behavior.  Previous                   studies by the Principal Investigator have shown that about 50%                 of the animals are infanticidal and 50% are noninfanticidal.                    Infanticidal and noninfanticidal animals will be introduced to                  different enclosures to determine the effects of infanticide on                 social interactions and population growth.  The results will show               how a seemingly pathological behavior can actually be adaptive                  and spread through a population.  It will also shed light on the                significance of female aggression as a mechanism to protect her                 pups from other members of her own species.",
