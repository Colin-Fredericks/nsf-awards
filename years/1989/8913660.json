 "awd_abstract_narration": "One objectives of this research is to continue the development of               adjusted and extended measures of macroeconomic variables and                   their application to major issues of economic theory and policy.                The measures will relate to budget and balance of payments                      surpluses and deficits, public, private and national saving,                    foreign and domestic tangible investment, market and nonmarket                  output and stocks of capital and wealth.  New data sets will be                 developed and made available for public use.                                                                                                                    The other objective of this project is to analyze the                           determinants and interrelations of broader measures of saving,                  investment and output and their components.  Possible                           equilibrating mechanisms with regard to budget deficits and                     balance of payment capital accounts will be explored through                    simulations and empirical estimation.  Particular attention will                be paid to the social security system and the effects of public                 investment in human and nonhuman capital on private investment                  and output.  The analysis will extent to major developed                        countries as well as developing countries, making use of adjusted               budget data and market price and replacement cost indices to                    introduce current value estimates of capital and wealth.  This                  research is important because it will provide a better                          understanding of international indebtedness and economic growth.",
