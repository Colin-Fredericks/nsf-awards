 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major long term objective of this research is to understand                 the detailed molecular mechanisms by which proteins discriminate                and interact with specific DNA sequences.  This problem will be                 approached through a detailed structural and functional analysis                of the restriction endonuclease, EcoRI.  John Rosenberg, U. of                  Pittsburgh, who has determined the structure of the EcoRI.DNA                   complex to 3A resolution, will collaborate in this effort.                                                                                                      The primary aim of this proposal is a mutational analysis of                    EcoRI.  The contribution of individual amino acids in sequence                  discrimination and catalysis will be investigated.  Hydrogen                    bonds between the endonuclease and the major groove of the DNA                  ionic contacts with the phosphodiester backbone are critical                    components of these functions.  The structural model will be used               to target for mutagenesis amino acids which appear to be involved               in these interactions.  Altered proteins will be generated by                   cassette mutagenesis and mismatch oligonucleotide mutagenesis.                  Also selected region will be saturated with mutations utilizing                 degenerate oligonucleotides.  Dr. Greene and co.workers developed               a vector system so that mutants of this potentially lethal enzyme               will be purified and characterized in order to determine the                    effects of individual amino acid substitutions on structure and                 on various functional parameters (e.g. binding energy, site                     discrimination, phosphodiester bond cleavage and editing).                      Crystallographic analysis of mutants will be carried out by Dr.                 Rosenberg.",
