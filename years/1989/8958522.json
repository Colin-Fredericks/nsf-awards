 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is being conducted in the following related areas.  In                 large scale computation in fluid dynamics, computer simulations                 are being used as an experimental tool to investigate                           fundamental phenomena in fluid dynamics, with principal emphasis                on unsteady flows in three dimensions.  Applications include                    vortical flows, shock hydrodynamics, and combustion.  In advanced               numerical algorithms, new numerical techniques are under                        development to perform the kinds of calculations described above.               Techniques include fast vortex methods, high - resolution finite                difference methods, and projection methods, as well as various                  adaptive techniques to augment these basic discretization                       methods.  In programming languages and environments, there will                 be collaboration with Prof. P. Hilfinger of the EECS Department                 at UC Berkeley in developing and evaluating new programming                     languages and environments for large scale scientific computing                 to support the design of the algorithms used in the rest of this                work.",
