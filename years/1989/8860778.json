 "awd_abstract_narration": "Isotopic carbon analysis provides a valuable tool for studies of                metabolic pathways and for tracing carbon transformations in the                environment.  This project will attempt to develop an optical                   technique for the convenient measurement of carbon isotopic                     (13C/12C) ratios.  The instrument will utilize a linear                         photodiode array to image the spectra arising from plasma                       emission of the carbon-containing molecules.  Spectral processing               algorithms will be applied to remove spectral interferences and                 to correct for apparent isotopic ratio shifts due to variations                 in sample pressure and power coupling.                                                                                                                          In this Phase I study, the optimal bandheads for isotopic ratio                 determination using the CO molecule will be identified.  The                    criteria will include a minimal contamination from other                        transitions of the 12C isotope.  Different excitation sources and               sample preparation techniques will be studied with the intent of                coupling the instrument to an automated carbon-nitrogen analyzer                in the Phase II work.                                                                                                                                           The results of the Phase I effort are expected to result in the                 ability to determine the isotope ratio of carbon to a precision                 of 0.01% or 0.1 & unit which would make the method applicable to                both natural abundance studies and tracer addition studies.  The                relative simplicity and low cost of this instrument compared to                 mass spectrometers will greatly expand the applications of                      isotopic abundance measurements.                                                                                                                                Aerodyne is a known positive performer and will provide excellent               support for the work.  The product, when available, should find                 considerable use in ecological studies requiring the processing                 of large numbers of carbon isotope ratio samples.",
