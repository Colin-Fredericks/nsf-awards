 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal for cooperative research between Dr. Jay Fox of the               University of Virginia School of Medicine and Dr. Jon Bjarnason of              University of Iceland is approved by NSF under the US-Iceland                   Cooperative Science Program.                                                                                                                                    The collaborative projects between Dr. Fox and Dr. Bjarnason both               center around the broad topic of protein structure and function.                The first project strives to understand the biological mechanism by             which enzymes present in rattlesnake venom cause the severe local               and systemic hemorrhagic in the victim.  The researchers hope to                learn more about the basic enzyme action and potential inhibitors to            these enzymes.  Dr. Bjarnason's laboratory is well-suited for                   isolation of these toxins and Dr. Fox wishes to examine his                     techniques for future use in his own laboratory.                                                                                                                The second project involves the isolation and characterization of               enzymes from fish which have an activity vs temperature profile                 shifted to lower temperatures.  Understanding the structural basis              for this activity shift may lead to development of enzymes which                can efficiently function at lower temperatures.",
