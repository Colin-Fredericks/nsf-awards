 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop knowledge-based                        environments for supporting group coordination.  The PI builds on               his earlier experience with the Information Lens (an intelligent                system that helps people find, filter, and sort electronic                      messages) in developing more powerful and flexible tools to                     support a wide variety of coordination processes. The research                  builds on a prototype system.  The new work will integrate many                 of the important features of (a) object-oriented databases, (b)                 hypertext, (c) electronic messaging, and (d) intelligent                        rule-based agents.  The system will allow unsophisticated                       computer users to create or modify their own cooperative work                   applications using three key primitives:  semistructured objects,               customizable folders, and semiautonomous agents.  The researchers               experiment with a variety of applications in this environment                   such as:  (a) intelligent tracking of tasks for project                         management, (b) managing design changes in engineering groups,                  (c) group decision making, and (d) collaborative authoring.  In                 developing these applications, the existing prototype will be                   augmented with more knowledge of objects, more knowledge of                     processes, and more kinds of agents.                                              The significance of this work is in making electronic mail                    systems more flexible and easier to use.  It is especially                      promising for alleviating the burden of managing large electronic               mail files by organizing and prioritizing messages.",
