 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern computer-based measurement systems can have a major impact               on the quality and productivity of engineering education.                       However, there is a danger that highly sophisticated equipment can              mask rather than enhance learning.  It is important that students               use relatively simple equipment at the beginning of a laboratory                program to help them build their intuition.  This project involves              the addition of two vector voltmeters and two impedance analyzers               to the Microwave and Communications Laboratory to complement the                existing automatic network analyzers.  The goal of the project is               to develop experiments around this equipment which build                        intuition, and ease the transition from theory to complex                       measurement systems.  The project will be used as part of an                    on-going overall study of the proper role of emerging hardware and              software technologies in the engineering classroom and laboratory.",
