Jain, Materials Science and Engineering Department,                      Lehigh University and Dr. D. Chakravorty, Department of                         Materials Science, Indian Association for the Cultivation of                    Science, Calcutta, India.  The research is directed at a better                 understanding of ion movement in glass.  One objective is to                    relate the ion-ion correlation and Two Level Systems (TLS)                      parameters with some material characteristics by determining                    the effect of a systematic variation of composition on ac                       electrical and nuclear spin relaxation (NSR) behaviors, the                     role of amorphousness will be examined independently.  The                      chemical characteristics will be modified by doping, and the                    physical characteristics will be changed by changing alkali                     ions.  The work by the two scientists should lead to better                     understanding of the effect of preparation of glass by sol-gel                  and by melt methods on the structural properties and the                        composition.                                                                                                                                                    Scope:  The two scientists are highly qualified to do this                      advanced research.  Their departments are well known in the                     respective countries for pioneering research in materials                       science.  The research is in an area of considerable interest                   to the U.S. and to India.  The collaboration is highly likely                   to produce significant research results.
