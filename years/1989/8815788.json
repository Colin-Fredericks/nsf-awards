 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a seminar, \"Neogene Siliceous Sediments of the          Pacific Region,\" organized jointly by Prof. Robert E. Garrison of the           University of California, Santa Cruz, and Prof. Azuma Iijima of the             University of Tokyo, Japan.  Participants will meet in Santa Cruz and           Santa Barbara, California, June 21 to 27, 1989 to discuss neogene               organic-rich and diatomaceous sediments and to visit selected neogene           sedimentary basins.  These sediments, which are observed around much            of the Pacific rim, are the major source and storage rocks for                  petroleum in both California and Japan.  Furthermore, they record               significant global paleoceanographic events, such as intensified                upwelling, and thus have considerable economic and historical                   significance.                                                                                                                                                   The seminar will be organized so that five major themes are discussed:          the correlation between biological and geological stratification;               cycles in the earth's crust; depositional environments; diagenesis;             and natural resources and basin analysis.  By comparing the development         of neogene sediments in Japan and California, and by summarizing the            latest research results in both countries, participants should be               able not only to advance the state of knowledge in the field, but               also to clearly identify the significant unresolved issues and act to           promote future trans-Pacific collaborative research in this area.",
