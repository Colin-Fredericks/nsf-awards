 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in Ramsey Theory of                       Professor Neil Hindman of Howard University. Dr. Hindman's                      research will center on investigations relating combinatorial                   partition theory and the theory of left-topological semigroups.                      This research falls in the broad category of Combinatorics,                which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                  Fundamentally, Combinatorics represents a systematization of the                very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                     modern development, however, Combinatorics has gone beyond just                 counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                 techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the               field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                  because of its importance in communications and information                     technology.",
