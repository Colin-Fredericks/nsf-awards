Funds will be used to            purchase a boat and motor, HACH portable laboratories, air pollution            monitoring systems, a microscope and photomicrographic system, a                spectrophotometer, computer and software to interface the system. The           equipment will be used to introduce freshman non-majors to aquatic              field studies, to enhance field and laboratory offerings in ecology,            and to introduce a new course in environmental science. It will also be         used for students in individual research projects. The curriculum will          be enhanced by emphasizing analytical methods and synthetic approaches          to field and laboratory exercises, as well as creating additional               opportunities for student research.                                             The college will provide 50% matching funds.",
