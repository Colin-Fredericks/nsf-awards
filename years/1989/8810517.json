 "awd_abstract_narration": "Simulation is potentially the most important computing application in           modern scientific and engineering research.  There are two broad                classifications of simulation models:  continuous simulations and               discrete event simulations.  Continuous simulations are the more                popular of the two approaches largely due their explicit mathematical           structure in the form of differential or difference equations.  While           discrete event simulations have some advantages in terms of generality          and computational efficiency, they do not yet have an explicit                  mathematical representation with anywhere near the generality and               utility of differential equations.  The lack of mathematical structure          for discrete event simulations accounts in part for the apparent ad-            hoc and complex nature of these models.  Discrete event simulations             are typically very difficult to program correctly.  The ultimate                research goal is the development of a mathematical base that will have          practical applications in developing and experimenting with discrete            event simulation models.",
