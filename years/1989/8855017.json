 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of this project is to identify talented                 secondary school students in mathematics from Puerto Rico and orient            them about a career in statistics.  The project covers a period of              twelve months and two months of persummer activity and consists of three        phases.  First phase is a presummer program to identify and recruit             thirty talented students from various secondary schools in the western          region of Puerto Rico where the Mayaguez Campus of the University of            Puerto Rico is centrally located.  The activities in this phase include         visits to schools and regional offices of the educational department and        conferences with students and teachers.  The target population is mostly        hispanic with low family incomes.                                                                                                                               Phases two of the project consists of an intensive summer program of six        weeks with activities designed to orient the students in the field of           statistics and its career opportunities.  The activities include four           weeks of formal classes and laboratory work specially designed to               interest high statistics from academia and industry give conferences on         the utilization of statistics in various fields; and visits to research         laboratories and industries.  The experts will also serve as mentors to         students in the follow up activities during the academic year.  During          the last week of the summer session students will select special                projects involving the use of statistics in consultation with their             mentors.                                                                                                                                                        In the third phase, the students will continue to work on their projects        during the academic year.  Arrangements will be made for periodic               consultations with the mentors and the project staff.  The students will        be encourage to present their research projects at a Science Fair held          annually in the western region of Puerto Rico.  During the final month          of the project, a Statistics Day will be held at the participant's              schools and a Statistics Fair will be held at the Mayaguez Campus where         the students will present their projects.",
