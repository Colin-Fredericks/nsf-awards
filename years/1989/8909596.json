 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a U.S.-French collaborative research program            focused on two highly important problems in robotics:  indoor mobile            robots and dexterous manipulation.  The researchers involved in                 this joint project are Thomas Henderson, University of Utah, Ed                 Riseman, University of Massachusetts and Oliver Faugeras, French                National Institute for Information Science and Automation (INRIA) -             Sophia Antipolis.  The proposed collaborative effort will permit                the investigation of a new approach for the specification of robot              behavior and control.                                                                                                                                           The development of complex systems for robot control and the                    discovery of the principles of their organization require a                     multifaceted research effort whose components are comprised of                  significant and robust modules based on proven theory.  The three               involved research teams each have made significant theoretical and              engineering contributions in the area of behavior-based robot                   control.  The University of Utah provides expertise in logical                  sensors and deterministic synchronous Finite State Automata; the                University of Massachusetts provides expertise in programming                   languages and environments, robot control land low-level vision,                and INRIA provides expertise in motion analysis, 3D representation              and implementation testbeds.  The group in France is one of the                 strongest European groups working on robot vision.   This joint                 project will be focused on research on logical behaviors which                  characterize techniques for the satisfaction of imposed relations               (i.e. tasks) in a semantic network representing the robot's world.              The results of this collaborative effort should make a significant              contribution to our understanding of mobile robot behavior.",
