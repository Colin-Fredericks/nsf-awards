 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Anthony              J. Nappi, Loyola University of Chicago and Dr. Yves Carton,                     Laboratoire de Biologie et Genetique Evolutives, Gif-sur-Yvette,                France.  The objective of this project is to elucidate the genetic              basis of immune recognition/regulation and parasite resistance in               insects.  The investigators will study:  1)  the role of cellular               and humoral catecholamine metabolizing enzymes during melanotic                 encapsulation responses in genetically well-defined enzyme mutants,             (2) the immune response of different geographical species and                   strains of filed collected hosts, and (3) the mechanisms of                     resistance by different geographic species and strains of                       parasites.  In order to ascertain the biosynthetic pathways                     employed in the production of the cross-linking agents that form                melanotic capsules, cytological and biochemical studies will be                 performed of the immune responses generated in larvae of Drosophila                                                                      __________             melanogaster, a host for the wasp parasitoids Leptopilina                       ____________                                  ___________                       heterotoma and L. boulardi.                                                     __________     _  ________                                                                                                                                      This project will combine Dr. Nappi's expertise in enzyme assays                with the availability in the French laboratory of specific genetic              lines of fly and wasp for the dissection of resistance mechanisms.              The results of this research will contribute to the understanding               of:  1) coevolutionary relationships between parasite and host, and             2) efficiency of use of parasites in the biological control of                  insect pests.",
