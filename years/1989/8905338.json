 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three projects will be the focus of mathematical work done                 on problems arising in the theory of nonlinear partial                          differential equations.  The first is concerned with questions                  related to symmetry in overdetermined boundary value problems.                  The symmetry occurs in solutions of certain equations in which                  the existence of positive solutions implies that the domain is a                ball and the solution is radially symmetric.  Work will be done                 examining the degree to which the positivity assumption may be                  dropped while one can still infer symmetry of the domain.                       Related to this investigation are questions concerning averages                 of functions over a fixed set as the set is subject to rigid                    motions through space. If, on assuming that the averages are                    zero, the function must be zero, one says that the Pompeiu                      property holds.  The problem of deciding the validity of the                    property is equivalent to showing the existence of solutions of                 the eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian.  Work will be done in                 looking for geometric properties of sets which complement this                  analytic result.                                                                     The second project concerns questions from potential theory                in which knowledge of quantitative properties of solutions of the               relevant operator are sought.  One particular issue is the                      problem of giving geometric conditions on the boundary of a                     domain which characterize the regular points for the heat                       operator.  Related work will consider conditions on the boundary                from which one may measure the extent of nontangential limits of                solutions.                                                                           In the third project, work will concentrate on a new                       approach to uniqueness properties of elliptic and non-elliptic                  operators that is not based on the classical Carleman method.                   Recent studies have concentrated on operators containing                        unbounded lower order terms.  The object is to determine when                   solutions of the homogeneous equation which equal zero on an open               set must equal zero everywhere.  A 1939 result of Carleman has                  influenced all subsequent results in this area.  New discoveries                using a blend of geometric and variational ideas will be employed               to extend the present theory to cover larger classes of                         operators.",
