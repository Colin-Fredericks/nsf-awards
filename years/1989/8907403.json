 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports pariticipation by four                      U.S. scientists in a U.S.-Sri Lanka Seminar on Development of                   a Science Information Center and Information Science Program                    to be held in Kandy, Sri Lanka.  The objectives are the                         strengthening of the science information resources and                          capabililties of Sri Lanka to enhance the progress of                           scientific research in that country, and to develop the                         mechanisms for implementing resource sharing on both an                         international and a domestic level in a developing country                      environment.  The collaborating scientist in Sri Lanka is Dr.                   Cyril Ponnamperuma, director of the Institute for Fundamental                   Studies (IFS) in Kandy.  Topics to be covered will include:                     user requirements and disciplines, collection and resources                     development, regional, national and international network                       relationship and information storage, retrieval and                             dissemination as well as policy and management issues.                          Research papers on these topics will be presented, and                          specific areas for future collaboration will be identified.                                                                                                     Scope:  The U.S. team from the University of Maryland,                          College of Library and Information Services is experienced in                   the area of this project.  They will interact with the top                      research scientists at the IFS and at a dozen research                          institutes and centers in the Kandy area.  The experience                       gained through this collaborative effort would be quite                         useful to U.S. scientists in building the research and                          scientific infrastructure in third world countries.",
