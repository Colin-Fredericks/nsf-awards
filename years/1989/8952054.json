The Department has purchased a JEOL Model                 JSM-T330A Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with a KEVEX                    Delta Class Series II Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS)                for element analysis and a Backscattered Electron Detector to                   sharpen images.  This instrument is being by four departments:                  Earth Sciences, Chemistry, Biology, and Physics/Engineering.  It                is used for classroom and laboratory demonstration in lower                     division Oceanography and biology classes, and is an integral                   part of upper division classes and laboratories.  Undergraduate                 students and faculty in upper division classes are using the                    equipment to examine fossils, surface textures and growth of                    mineral grains, authigenic mineral formation and alteration,                    biochemistry and chemical analysis (including polymers and                      biopolymers), cell biology, histology, developmental biology, and               physical and thermal material stress analysis.  Student and                     faculty independent research projects are also greatly enhanced                 with the availability of an SEM.",
