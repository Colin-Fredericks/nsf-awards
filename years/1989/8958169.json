 "awd_abstract_narration": "Based on her outstanding research accomplishments and her                       devotion to undergraduate education, Dr. Barbara Beltz of                       Wellesley College, received the prestigious Presidential Young                  Investigator award.  With this award, she will continue her work                on the development of neuronal plasticity.  Dr. Beltz pioneered                 methods in immunocytochemistry, an invaluable neuroanatomical                   procedure.  She has taught a very popular and first-class course                in immunocytochemical methods at the Marine Biological Laboratory               in Woods Hole, which developed into a book.  Dr. Beltz will use                 this award to focus on an number of important questions in                      developmental neurobiology: the acquisition of transmitter and                  peptides systems, plasticity in identifiable neurons, and the                   emergence of specific motor programs and behaviors during                       development.  Her emphasis will be to characterize the anatomy,                 physiology and development of neurotransmitter and peptide                      systems of neurons.  These data will add important insights to                  our understanding of how the transmitter and peptide choices in                 developing neural networks are made.  Her research area is of                   great importance and the studies are likely to reveal underlying                principles of how neurons develop.",
