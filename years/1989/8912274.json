 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rochester Youth Development Study, funded primarily by the                  Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, is a                     longitudinal study of the causes and correlates of delinquency.                 Using a sample of 1,000 youth that over-represents individuals at               high risk for serious delinquent careers, the design of the                     project calls for interviews of the child and one of his or her                 parents at six-month intervals over a three-and-a-half year                     period.  The purpose of the research is to examine the factors                  associated with initiation, maintenance, and cessation of                       delinquent behavior and drug use.  Pro-social behaviors are also                identified that potentially buffer youth from delinquent careers.               The overall conceptual framework for the study is based on an                   interactional theory of delinquency that focuses on the                         structural organization of family and peer networks.  Data are                  organized around six general concepts: attachment to parents,                   commitment to school, belief in conventional values, associations               with delinquent peers, adopting delinquent values, and engaging                 in delinquent behavior.                                                                                                                                         This grant will support wave three of the parent interviews in                  the Rochester study.  Due to reductions in support from the                     Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, the study                budget was reduced by 27 percent, which necessitated eliminating                wave three of the parent interviews.  The absence of this wave of               parental interviews would substantially weaken the scientific                   value of the overall research effort and the panel design                       especially since the end of 8th or 9th grade is an important                    transition point in parent-child relationships that may be                      associated with later delinquency.  The NSF contribution will                   reinstate the parent interviews to the data collection.                                                                                                         The use of parental interviews is unusual in delinquency research               and permits a direct examination of interactional and                           socialization effects.  The interviews with parents will enable                 the investigators to examine such issues as whether and when                    attachment to parents operates to inhibit antisocial behavior as                well as whether antisocial behavior affects attachment uniformly                across different parenting types.  Not only will the study                      provide a rich and unique data set available to others for                      secondary analysis but it will contribute significantly to                      scientific knowledge and enlightened public policy about                        delinquency and its causes.",
