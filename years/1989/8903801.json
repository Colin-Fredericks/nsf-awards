 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a 2-year program to experimentally                      investigate the petrology of the lower mantle, the single largest               region of the earth.  Using the laser-heated diamond cell, a                    natural garnet peridotite composition will be taken to P-T                      conditions existing throughout the lower mantle .  A combination                of in situ X-ray diffraction and quenched-product analysis will                 be used to determine: (1) the identity and quantity of major                    phases present; (2) the major-element partitioning between these                phases as a function of pressure; (3) the equations of state of                 the phases, and hence of the assemblage for direct comparison                   with the seismological profiles of the lower mantle; and (4) the                solidus temperature of the assemblage from which tight                          constraints on the deep-mantle geotherm could be obtained.  Year                1 will concentrate on sub-solidus equilibria, and Year 2 will                   concentrate on solidus/liquidus equilibria of the natural                       peridotite composition as well as reconnaissance (solid-state and               liquid) equilibria of an iron-enriched composition.  These                      experiments are a direct extension of techniques used in prior                  work that successfully determined the ultrahigh P/T equilibria of               individual natural minerals, and they would represent the first                 time that an actual rock assemblage had been studied at the                     conditions existing throughout the bulk of the mantle.",
