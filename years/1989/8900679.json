 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for a 10 week summer research                         experience for nine undergraduates from Carleton College and                    other regional colleges and universities.  Pre-participation                    reading requirements will provide students with an adequate                     foundation for meaningful scientific investigation.  During the                 summer, students will work in a one-to-one relationship with a                  research supervisor in the laboratory.  Weekly seminars will                    provide students with the opportunity to discuss research plans                 and results as well as to delve into primary scientific articles.               To further focus and unify the student participants, a theme of                 developmental regulation has been selected.  Six of the nine                    projects relate directly to this theme and mid-summer seminars                  will be used to discuss current literature in this area.                        Projects will include investigations of:  the mechanisms of                     action and the chemical characteristics of a possibly-steroid                   pheromone produced by Oedogonium, functional structure of                       Hensen's node in the chick embryo, regulation of floral                         development in tobacco, effect of B chromosome in maize on                      developmental processes, structure and function of the                          glucocorticoid receptor in rat liver, development of synaptic                   connections in Xenopus, variation of sex expression in                          composites, evolution and mechanisms of animal behavior, and                    effect of gregarine parasites on population biology of capitellid               polychaetes.  Opportunities to complete research and writing                    during winter break will be available.",
