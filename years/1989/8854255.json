 "awd_abstract_narration": "A week-long workshop in inorganic chemistry is being held to give               regional undergraduate faculty experience in some modern techniques and         some exposure to the chemistry of binuclear organometallic compounds.           It is expected that the experience will enhance their comprehension of          these developments, and that they will adopt some of the laboratory             procedures in their own curricula.  The mornings are being used for the         lectures with the afternoons involving hands-on experiments.  The first         day is being devoted to the bench top reaction chemistry of                     \u0131Fe(Cp)(CO)2!2, Fe(Cp)(CO)2I, and related compounds.  During the                remaining four days the participants are being divided into five                groups, and these groups are rotating through their choice of four out          of five sessions in  a sequence of technique-oriented sessions.  The            sessions are: NMR; Electrochemistry; IR; MO calculations; and X-ray             crystallography.  The facilities at undergraduate institutions are              adequate to conduct many aspects of these projects.  The aspects that           cannot be supported by undergraduate institutions, such as X-ray                diffraction, are of value in enhancing the faculty comprehension of             topics that nevertheless must be presented to students in lecture.",
