 "awd_abstract_narration": "Issues of coordination are important to consumers and firms.                    Consumers may wish to coordinate on their selection of which                    firm to patronize, especially if economies of scale characterize                the production technology.  Incumbent firms may recognize gains                 from coordination in the deterrence of entry.  In particular if                 incumbent firms have superior information (as compared to a                     potential entrant) about the profitability of entry, then their                 ability to coordinate the selection of signals (prices, for                     example) become quite important.                                                                                                                                Most previous work has ignored the issue of coordination, by                    assuming that consumers act in a simple fashion and that a                      single incumbent firm attempts to deter entry.  First, this                     project develops and extends a new theory of non.informative                    advertising, in which apparently wasteful advertisements are used               to coordinate consumer purchases when economies of scale exist                  and price information is difficult to communicate.  The analysis                provides insight into observed retail advertisements, existing                  empirical puzzles, and a new game.theoretic methodology.  The                   project also explores empirically the extent to which non.price                 advertising lowers prices.                                                                                                                                      Second, consumers lacking precise price information may                         nevertheless restrain monopoly pricing by boycotting firms that                 have previously exercised monopoly power.  The ability of                       consumers to credibility coordinate a boycott will be shown to                  depend on the direction of scale economies.  This work draws a                  heretofore unexplored connection between scale economies and                    monopoly power.  Finally, the project examines coordination among               firms.  When an entrant uses firms' prices as signals of the                    profitability of entry, incumbent firms will wish to coordinate                 the selection of signals.  The inability to coordinate will                     result in signaling equilibria that involve no distortion in                    price.  This analysis reverses previous single incumbent                        predictions and constitutes a methodological advance into                       multiple.signal.sender models.                                                                                                                                  This is an exciting project that provides new insights into a                   wide range of substantive issues in industrial organization as                  well as improving our understanding of the way firms and                        consumers coordinate their actions in markets.  The project                     contributes substantively and methodological to our                             understanding of retail advertising, consumer boycotts as a means               of restraining monopoly power and entry deterrence by multiple                  firms in a given industry.",
