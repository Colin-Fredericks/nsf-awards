 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the typical crime, victim or bystander eyewitnesses are                      interviewed several times under varying conditions.  Usually the                first time is shortly after the crime by a uniformed police                     officer; a second time can be an hour or two later by a more                    experienced detective likely at a more leisurely pace and at a                  different location.  A third time may be several days or weeks                  after the incident usually by a prosecuting attorney in his or                  her office.  Depending on the case, additional rounds of pre-                   trial or trial interviews may occur several months to years                     later.  In all, the typical witness is interviewed about a half                 dozen times by different people, under different conditions, and                for radically different purposes.  Despite variability in these                 interviews, inconsistency in recollections is very effective in                 discrediting a witness.  Yet, we know little about what such                    inconsistencies indicate about the accuracy of a witness's                      testimony.  Should judges or juries give greater credibility to                 witnesses who are consistent?  How relevant is consistency of                   testimony to the accuracy of recollection?                                                                                                                      Drs. Fisher and Cutler plan to examine the relationship between                 eyewitness consistency of recollection and accuracy through                     undertaking three laboratory experiments.  Their model postulates               that the relationship between the two can be either strongly and                positively correlated, weakly correlated, or even negatively                    correlated, and the experiments derived from this model test this               relationship empirically.  Each of the experiments manipulates                  legal relevant and model-driven variables (e.g., encoding                       quality, similarity of recall conditions, peripheral versus                     central information).  For purposes of generalizability, in the                 first two experiments, a criminal event is witnessed; whereas in                the third experiment a non-criminal event is observed.  These                   investigators hypothesize that the relationship between accuracy                and consistency will vary.  This counterintuitive finding would                 be of considerable value to an understanding of eyewitness                      behavior and testimony.  More generally, the work should advance                knowledge about (1) the effects of retrieval operations on                      recollection, and (2) the significance of consistency of recall.",
