 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although wind-blown dunes composed of carbonate sand are                        widespread along subtropical shorelines, such dune deposits were,               until very recently, unknown from strata more than several                      million years old.  Discovery of eolian limestones of                           Pennsylvanian age in southwestern U.S. supports the view that the               origin of carbonate-rich dunes is related to the shoreline                      fluctuations that accompany glacial epochs.  I will conduct                     detailed field and laboratory study of eolian limestones of                     southeastern Utah and of the Grand Canyon region of northern                    Arizona and southern Nevada.  Outcrop and subsurface studies will               determine the lateral extent of individual eolian limestone beds                and document the vertical and lateral relationships of eolian and               marine facies.  Laboratory work will reconstruct the original                   texture and mineralogy of the dune sands as well as the processes               and products of their subsequent alteration.  The study will                    established improved criteria for the identification of ancient                 eolian limestones and will test several hypotheses for their                    origin.  One of these hypotheses addresses the possibility that                 the incompleteness of many stratal sequences is due to wind                     erosion.  Although eolian limestones represent a minor portion of               the stratigraphic record, results of this study will be                         applicable to other sedimentary facies deposited during periods                 of Earth history characterized by rapid shoreline migration.",
