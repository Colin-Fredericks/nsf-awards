 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will yield important information concerning the                   physical map of human chromosome 9.  It will allow evaluation of                the randomness of retroviral integrations into this chromosome.                 The cell lines produced by the research will be extremely useful                in mapping the human genome.  The determination of a physical map               requires the ability to isolate regions of analyzable size and                  currently available hybrids are not adequate for this type of                   analysis.  The incorporation of a selectable marker into the                    human chromosome means that the radiation hybrids containing                    fragments of this chromosome should be \"cleaner\" than those                     hybrids created without being able to select for the fragment of                interest.  One of the goals of this research is to see whether                  these hybrids are really superior and to evaluate the efficacy of               using retroviral vectors to multiply mark a chromosome.  Hybrids                which have been fully characterized will yield important                        information on biological organization, structure and control of                this portion of the genome.  Comparisons with homologous regions                in other species will yield important information on evolution in               eukaryotic organisms.  The approach adopted for chromosome 9 can                be applied to any other human chromosome, or chromosomes of any                 other species so that the ROW Research Planning grant has                       considerable generality.",
