 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research represents a continuation of efforts to learn how         insects and arachnids regulate their water balance and metabolic                activities in ways that enable them to successfully adapt to harsh              terrestrial environments.  Previous research has shown that the key             structural element in preventing excess water loss is their cuticle             (exoskeleton), especially the waterproofing barrier provided by lipids          (waxes) deposited on the surface and also embedded in the outermost             layer of the cuticle.  The correlations established between barrier             effectiveness and the quantity (surface density) or molecular                   composition of these lipids are based largely on indirect evidence or           on relationships established for biological membranes which feature             both a different class (phospholipids) and a different arrangement of           these lipids.                                                                                                                                                   The proposed research is significant from the standpoint of both basic          and applied research.  The measurement technology designed for these            experiments can be used by plant and animal scientists in a variety of          disciplines to monitor water flux across biological or artificial               membranes or to measure the moisture content of gases released during           respiration or photosynthesis.  In many respects, the technological             developments are as important as the data they produce.  The proposed           studies will also provide information on how lipids are organized and           deposited on the cuticle surface, how interactions between various              lipids and nonlipid barrier constituents contribute to reduced                  permeability, and how and to what extent changes in the amount and              composition of surface lipids occur in response to increased                    dehydration and/or increasing desiccation potential.  This information          can be used by firms or agencies whose function is to develop better            means of controlling insect pests through the manufacture of more               effective sprays or abrasives, or by suggesting agricultural practices          that will create microenvironmental conditions which are inhospitable           for insects and still permit plant growth.",
