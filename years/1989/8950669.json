 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zenith IBM-compatible PCs and the Keithley System 570 (with                     ultrasonic ranging, force transducers and voltage sensors) will be              used to rapidly acquire physics laboratory data in an innovative                \"integrated\" curriculum for RHIT freshmen next fall.                                                                                                            With the computer helping record, analyze, and display lab                      information, students can assess the results of a run almost                    immediately.  New trials with different conditions can be planned and           carried out quickly.                                                                                                                                            How does air drag depend on air cart sail dimensions?  Carry out                trials with different sail areas.  Velocity?  Run the same sail at              different velocities.  This is all possible in a single lab period,             perhaps in only a part of a lab period.  Now students can explore               scaling properties in many different systems where force, voltage,              resistance, position, velocity, etc. are variables.                                                                                                             If data needs further manipulation, or is to be used for a                      pedagogical purpose outside the laboratory, disk files can be                   produced on the spot.  Homework assignments for mathematics and                 physics will now regularly include relevant, real, lab-generated                data on floppy disk files which are formatted for spreadsheets, PCs,            or a mainframe.                                                                                                                                                 The Institute will match the award with an equal amount of funds.",
