 "awd_abstract_narration": "The absorption of light by small particles of semiconductors in                 solution can catalyze reactions of adsorbed species.  Little work               has been done on the picosecond charge recombination dynamics in                semiconductor particles, in part, because of low luminescence                   quantum yields.  A very sensitive, nonlinear optical technique                  has been extended to monitor charge carrier lifetimes in                        semiconductor particles without reliance on luminescence and                    will be applied to a number of colloid systems.  The microscopic                molecular reaction dynamics of adsorbed species at the                          liquid/solid interface are almost completely unexplored.  The                   reaction dynamics of model surface adsorbed species that undergo                chemical change following charge transfer from the semiconductor                particle will be examined by dependable picosecond spectroscopic                techniques.  Experiments will be undertaken to explore the role                 of interactions between adsorbate, surface, and solvent on                      chemical reaction dynamics.  The new information obtained will                  help provide a basis for development of interfacial reaction                    dynamics theory.",
