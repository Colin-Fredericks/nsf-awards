 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) project is to           use Clinical Faculty support to ensure that all new teachers will               continue to learn new mathematics, view themselves as members of the            broader mathematics community, share with others their ideas and                experiences concerning the teaching of mathematics and become                   mathematics education professionals.  The Clinical Faculty who will work        with these new teachers will be a cadre of twenty exemplary teachers            from the Richmond area school systems.  They will have demonstrated             leadership through their activities in the Greater Richmond Area Teacher        Professional Network.  As an extension of the collegial, collaborative          activities of this network, the group of outstanding mathematics                teachers will be prepared to play an ongoing role in all aspects of             VCU's Mathematics Teacher Preparation Program.  They will work with             VCU's mathematics and mathematics education faculty in updating the             structure of the teacher preparation program, teach components of               mathematics and mathematics education courses, serve as role models for         new teachers, and work with student teachers.  The outcome of the               program will be evaluated and analyzed for potential effectiveness as a         national model for enhancing the teaching profession.                                                                                                           The cost sharing for the project will be fifty-eight percent of the             National Science Foundation portion.",
