 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a \"U.S.-Japan Workshop on Technical Japanese\"           in May 1989 at the University of Washington in Seattle.  The workshop           is being jointly sponsored by NSF and the Japanese Ministry of                  Education, Science and Culture under the U.S.-Japan Cooperative                 Science Program.  Approximately 18 U.S. participants will meet with a           similar number of Japanese participants for in-depth discussion on :            1) The present state of Japanese language instruction and its                   relation to needs for technological and scientific activities;                  2) Existing philosophies of Japanese language instruction; 3) Instruc-          tional materials and technologies; 4) Instructor training and                   utilization; and 5) An agenda for improving technical Japanese                  instruction.                                                                                                                                                    This workshop will provide a much-needed assessment of the available            programs for technically oriented Japanese language instruction.                Likewise, it will initiate U.S.-Japan cooperation in efforts to                 improve and expand such programs.  These efforts will address one of            the significant barriers to more productive scientific exchange                 between our two countries.",
