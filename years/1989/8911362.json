This conference, the                   fifth in an annual series, is supported by RILEM committees, TC-                89 FMT, Fracture Mechanics of Concrete, Test Methods; TC-FMA,                   Fracture Mechanics of Concrete, Applications; SEM subdivision on                Fracture of Concrete and Rock; ACI 446, Fracture Mechanics; and                 the International Society for Rock Mechanics.  This meeting                     provides an international forum for technical discussions on                    using fracture mechanics methodologies for describing crack                     propagation and fracture in concrete and rock subjected to                      complex states of stress.  A particularly important feature of                  this -- and the previous two conferences -- is to bring together                researchers working primarily with concrete and those working                   primarily with rock, as the testing, evaluation and application                 problems are quite similar.  It is noted that the Europeans and                 Japanese are making great progress toward implementing these                    concepts into forensic engineering and design practice.  As this                area of research has also developed rapidly within the United                   States, interaction between the various groups on formal and                    informal levels is very desirable.",
