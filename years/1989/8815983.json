The intent was to emphasize areas not covered by annual or                      biannual Gordon Research Conferences and to stress                              multidisciplinary approaches to problems to best represent the                  constituent member societies of FASEB.  The format and venues of                these conferences are conducive to scientific exchange, and                     prompt ready and direct scientific discussions.  The 1989 meeting               will feature 9 scientific sessions on diverse areas of calcium                  research, and is the only US meeting devoted entirely to calcium                related events.  The topics for discussion include:  hormonal                   regulation of calcium homeostasis, calcium regulation in                        excitable cells, calcium release mechanisms, calcium regulation                 of smooth muscle, calcium and the protein phosphorylation cycle,                calcium in growth and development, novel calcium control                        mechanisms, genetic analysis of calcium function (including                     studies in Drosophila, yeasts, fungi, paramecium, and transgenic                mice), and structure and function of calcium binding proteins.                                                                                                  This conference should contribute greatly to the progress of                    basic research on this important subject.",
