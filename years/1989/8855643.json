 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is an effort to understand the way peer interaction can             foster mathematics understanding in second-and fourth-grade children.           The domains of interest are arithmetic operations, place value, and             orthographic notation.  In Study 1, middle and low functioning second-          grade children will participate in a trading base-ten chips game over a         two-week period.  To assess the effects of peer interaction, three peer         play conditions will be compared:  peer vs. solitary vs. no play.  In           Study 2, second and fourth graders (who use inappropriate (\"buggy\")             mathematical algorithms) will participate for a 12-week period in three         activity conditions that vary in use of place value concepts and                orthographic notation.  In both studies, outcome analyses will use pre-         and posttests (both short-term and long-term) to investigate the way            condition (peer play condition or activity condition) affects                   mathematical understandings and school mathematics performance.  To             understand social processes mediating the effects, process analyses will        investigate microgenetic shifts in children's goals and the relations           between social interactions and children's posttest performances.                                                                                               Results will be widely disseminated to the research and practitioner            communities in mathematics education, among others.  Joint support for          this project is being provided by the Spencer Foundation of Chicago.",
