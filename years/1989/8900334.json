 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year research program is aimed at wrapping up                        studies of the marine geochemistry of uranium while beginning a                 new study of Th cycling in the ocean.  the uranium work will                    include completing analysis of samples collected during the                     1988 expedition to the Black Sea, processing sediment and pore                  water samples already collected from continental slopes sites                   off the east and west coasts of the U.S., and collecting and                    processing new pore water samples to quantify the contribution                  by colloids to the operationally defined dissolved (<0.45                       micron) U concentration in pore waters.                                         high Resolution mass Spectrometric (HRMS) studies of TH                         concentration and isotopic composition in the ocean will use                    the new VG ISOLAB 110 mass spectrometer to be installed at                      Lamont by the end of 1988.  the high sensitivity performance of                 this new instrument allows for a tenfold improvement of                         precision, for a factor of 100 reduction of sample size and for                 a factor of 300 shorter measurement-time, compare to                            traditional alpha-counting techniques.  The concentration of                    232 Th will be measured as a function of size-distribution in                   filtered sea water samples, in order to check for the existence                 of the colloidal Th species (<0.4u), recently assumed by                        Honeyman and Santschi (1988) in their \"Brownian pumping\" model;                 and demonstrate the capability to measure 230 Th concentrations                 in seawater and in time-series sediment-traps sample (e.g., for                 GOFS) in order to evaluate the response of deep-sea scavenging                  to temporally variable processes in surface waters.",
