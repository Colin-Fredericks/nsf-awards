 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research project is to bring recent theories               of bargaining to bear on empirical analyses of apparent                         inefficiencies in the labor market, using data on labor                         contracts.  An understanding of labor contracts is an essential                 component in analyses of economic policy, particulary with                      respect to unemployment and inflation.  Although about 85% of                   labor contracts are reached through peaceful negotiations, the                  strike threat is clearly an important part of the negotiation                   process.  The model developed in this project asserts that                      strikes occur when the union is uncertain about how much the firm               can afford to pay, and so the union starts by demanding a large                 wage increase, threatening that the firm will have to endure a                  long strike before the union will reduce its demand.                                                                                                            The core of the proposed research is an assessment of whether                   empirical data on strike durations and wage settlements can be                  explained as outcomes of this kind of bargaining conflict.  One                 potential application of the results is in evaluating the                       effectiveness of the mediation services provided by federal and                 state governments.  There are potentially important similarities                between strikes and other kinds of economic and political                       conflict.  Inefficient outcomes are apparently observed in                      international trade, where tariffs and other barriers impede                    beneficial exchange, and in lawsuits, where failure to reach a                  settlement leads to expensive trials.  There is also a clear                    connection between labor contracting and exchange in \"thin\"                     markets, such as the housing market, where bargaining may                       frustrate efficient trades.  These analogies will not be                        systematically analyzed in the proposed research project, but                   they indicate that an understanding of private information                      bargaining is likely to have applications to many important                     policy questions.",
