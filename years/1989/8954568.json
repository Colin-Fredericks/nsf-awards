 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twenty secondary school science teachers will carry out an                      undersea research project using deep-diving submersibles and                    other state-of-the-art equipment provided by the National                       Undersea Research Center (NURC).  Project Oceanology, a                         marine education center, will supply research vessels,                          oceanographic equipment, computers and a waterfront marine                      laboratory.                                                                                                                                                     With the guidance of oceanographic and science educators,                       teachers will gain first-hand experience doing scientific                       research and will strengthen their understanding of the                         nature of science.  The program will also help teachers                         transfer their experience into teaching methods which will                      engage their own students in scientific inquiry.                                                                                                                This three-year program will begin in March 1990, with the                      first year devoted to experimental design, laboratory                           investigations and field studies.  The second year will                         include data analysis, presentation of research results, and                    the design of a student research program.  During the third                     year, ending in June 1992, teachers will implement this                         program in their schools with the mutual support of their                       colleagues and the supervision of program staff.                                                                                                                An amount equivalent to 61.73% of the NSF award is being                        contributed as cost-sharing.",
