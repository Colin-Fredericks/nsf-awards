 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a study of the vertical flux and the rate of                    dissolution of biogenic silica in the water column of the Ross                  Sea, and is part of a coordinated study of the biogenic silica and              organic carbon cycling in the water column and the sediments of                 the Ross Sea.  The antarctic deep sea and continental shelf                     environments is the major repository for silica accumulation in                 the global ocean, and dominates the global silica budget.  The                  Ross Sea is a particularly anomalous area in which large amounts                of biogenic silica are accumulating in modern sediments, while the              surface production rates are generally below the global average.                Moreover the usual similarity between the oceanic silicon and                   carbon cycle does not appear to hold around Antarctica, and the                 two cycles are decoupled in that the rate of particulate carbon                 deposition in the modern sediment is very low.  The overall                     project is an integrated study of the production, vertical                      transport, dissolution, and deposition processes, using moored                  instrumentation and direct observations in a series of transects                in the Ross Sea by R/V POLAR DUKE.                                                                                                                              The vertical flux and dissolution rates will be measured by                     deploying time-series sediment traps at two depths on each of                   three moorings for a period of fourteen months.  In conjunction                 with transmissometers and current meter arrays, these moorings                  will allow the measurement and characterization of both vertical                and horizontal fluxes of particulate matter during a complete                   annual cycle of production and sedimentation.  The sediment trap                data will provide the link between surface production studies and               sea-floor accumulation studies that will be carried out by other                investigators cooperating in this project.",
