The               blueschists and eclogites constitute a coherent in situ terrain                 structurally overlain by two thrust piles containing lower-grade                high pressure metamorphic assemblages.  The entire sequence is                  overlain by the Semail ophiolite nappe.                                              The tectonic setting of these high pressure metamorphic                    rocks is unique given their occurrence in a passive continental                 margin that has not undergone continent-continent collision and                 their structural relations to the unmetamorphosed Tethyan Semail                ophiolite nappe.                                                                     The NSF is requested to provide two-year support to continue               a detailed field, petrological, geochemical and geochronological                study of high pressure metamorphism in NE Oman.  This study is                  aimed at (a) constraining the pressure-temperature conditions of                metamorphism and reconstructing the pressure-temperature-time                   paths of the different structural terrains (b) developing                       petrogenetic grids for the various lithologies of the high                      pressure metamorphic rocks; and (c) establishing the ages of                    metamorphism and uplift rates of these domains.                                      The results of this study will constrain the relationship                  between high pressure metamorphism and ophiolite emplacement in                 Oman and will be used to develop a tectonic model that will have                sufficient temporal control on the large-scale tectonic events.                 The ultimate goal of this research is to explain why high                       pressure metamorphism developed in the absence of continent-                    continent collision or oceanic crust subduction beneath the                     continental margin.",
