 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hartford Public Schools will establish a two-year Beginning Teacher         Enhancement Program in Mathematics and Science.  The goals include, (1)         to train a cadre of 20 well-prepared elementary and middle school               teachers to serve as resource persons for the beginning and reassigned          staff (Phase I); (2) to provide summer and school year inservice                workshops and professional enhancement seminars to 60 beginning and             reassigned teachers (Phase II); and (3) to offer follow-up coaching and         mentoring services to the less well-prepared teachers.  The workshop            curricula and project strategies respond to the Districts's 1988 teacher        needs assessment and suggestions by the State Department of Education           Mathematics and Science consultants.                                                                                                                            During the first year, Phase I teachers will participate in a two-week          summer workshop emphasizing hands-on science content and leadership             strategies. During the second summer workshop and symposia, Phase II            teachers will participate in a two-week program which will emphasize the        hands-on content under the tutelage of the project staff as well as             selected teachers from Phase I.  The science program will be lead by            personnel from the Thames Science Center in New London who have                 extensive experience in this type of experiential activities.  The              mathematics component will be under the leadership of the mathematics           supervisory staff and the project staff.  Science and mathematics               mentors, who have completed programs at Wesleyan (PIMMS), will                  assist both the Phase I and Phase II teachers as they implement                 their enhanced content and methodology skills in the classroom.                                                                                                 The proposal represents a coordinated effort of the Public                      Schools, the Hartford Alliance, St. Joseph's College, Central                   Connecticut College, Wesleyan and the Connecticut State                         Department of Education.                                                                                                                                        The Hartford Public School District has cost-shared an amount                   equivalent to 55% of the NSF request.",
