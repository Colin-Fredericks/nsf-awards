 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of Dr. Lehmkuhle's research is to understand why we                    have different pathways that transmit different types of visual                 information from the eye to the brain through a structure                       called the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). This                        structure is one of the first stages of processing where the                    visual input can be modulated by cortical and other extraretinal                influences that are important to making eye movements, being                    alert, and attending.  The LGN could be the site of many                        interactions that could subserve visual phenomena such as visual                attention, binocular fusion, blink suppression and saccadic                     suppression.                                                                                                                                                    In this project, Dr. Lehmkuhle will characterize how retinal                    information is modified and relayed onto the visual cortex by the               LGN and how these alterations in the flow of information along                  the different pathways are related to visual attention. Two sets                of physiological experiments will be conducted. In the first set,               Dr. Lehmkuhle will study alertness and its effect on the                        responsivity of LGN cells. In the second set of experiments, he                 will measure the influence of eye position on geniculate neurons.                                                                                               Dr. Lehmkuhle is well qualified to carry out this important                     research project. These experiments are essential steps toward an               understanding of the role of the LGN to vision.",
