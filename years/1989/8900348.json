 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eight students supported by this REU site award will be                    involved in researching several topics of current mathematical                  interest.  Continuing a highly successful pilot project conducted               by Williams College in 1988, this award will provide resources                  for its expansion and for the replacement of seed funds which are               no longer available.                                                                 The term geometry in the title does not cover all the topics               to be investigated by the students, although it does provide a                  focus.  Geometric problems include study of area minimizing                     networks which have immediate and important practical                           applications.  Of particular interest will be an analysis of the                structure of singularities of such networks and the structure of                directed minimizing networks.  Work will also be done in knot                   theory and on triangulations of hyperbolic 3-manifolds which                    falls within the province of topology.  Questions involve the                   enumeration of all knots having 14 or fewer crossings (those                    with 13 or fewer have been catalogued) and the relationship                     between the new knot and link polynomials and the hyperbolic                    volume of hyperbolic knot or link complement.                                        Other research will involve visual programming systems for                 parallel processing, explorations of the relation between sum                   graphs and product graphs - devising more efficient labeling                    algorithms than those currently known, and computational geometry               problems which arise in trying to asses visibility of portions of               the plane in the presence of certain obstacles.  The last topic                 has interesting applications to the design of fortresses.                       The award will provide support for part of a larger effort                      involving up to 17 students working with six faculty members.",
