 "awd_abstract_narration": "Consistent with the increasing instrumental emphasis in                    chemistry, Mississippi College is introducing a gas                             chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) into its chemistry                      curriculum.  Use and application of this instrument affects all                 students in organic and analytical chemistry, and instrumental                  analysis, and strengthen our undergraduate research program.  The               GC-MS uses a benchtop system, computer accessed and controlled,                 and allows identification of complex mixtures, data storage, and                comparisons searching within a large library of data.  Student                  experience with GC-MS compliments present powerful analytical                   methods thus better preparing them for graduate and professional                schools or industry.  Specific course improvements include                      increasing the instrumental emphasis in qualitative organic                     analysis of natural materials, products of chemical reactions,                  environmental contaminants and drugs.  Theory of mass                           spectrometry is supported by experiments and in advanced classes                the importance of integrating separation science and mass                       spectroscopy with computer assistance is experienced.  The                      institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of                   funds.",
