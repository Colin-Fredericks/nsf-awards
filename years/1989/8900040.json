 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Nicaraguan Rise is a major structural/tectonic feature,                     consisting of detached carbonate platforms, that separates the                  southwestern and northwestern basins of the Caribbean Sea.                      During research cruises in March-April 1987 and May 1988, a large               data set was collected that includes single-channel seismic                     reflection profiling data, bottom samples, SCUBA diver                          observations, remote operated vehicle and bottom camera pigment                 data.  In their first two years of research, Hine and Hallock-                  Muller have discovered corresponding east-west gradients in                     platform depth (average bank top depth increases east to west),                 sediment facies (gradients from chlorozoan to chloralgal sediment               types), benthic communities (algal-sponge dominance increases to                the west), and biotic pigment concentrations (doubling east to                  west).  Documentation of these gradients has important                          implications for understanding carbonate platform drownings in                  the geologic record.  In addition, their seismic reflection data                have provided new insights concerning the infilling of seaways,                 erosion/deposition on carbonate slopes, and tectonic influences                 on carbonate bank development.  They have also discovered the                   first Halimeda bioherms to be described from the Caribbean.                     About two thirds of the data remain to be analyzed.  This renewal               grant will enable completion of this project examining processes                controlling deposition on an important, but poorly known system                 of modern carbonate platforms.",
