 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of                  Dr. Richard Crew of the University of Minnesota. His research                   will center on the study of Kloosterman sums by geometric                       methods, and in particular, he will investigate the monodromy                   groups arising from certain p-adic differential equations that                  come from these sums.                                                                This research is work in the Algebraic Geometry of finite                  characteristic. Although the field originated with notions of                   continuously varying geometric structures like lines and planes,                in this context the Discrete takes over, and methods akin to                    those from the theory of whole numbers are most useful.                         Reciprocally, the algebraic geometry of finite characteristic is                now having great influence on the Theory of Numbers, and is                     finding application in Computer Science and Coding Theory.",
