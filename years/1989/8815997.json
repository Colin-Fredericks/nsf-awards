In addition, the magnitude of the                   effect of biotic processes, such as bioerosion, will be                         determined through analysis of the frequency of their occurrence                along a bathymetric gradient.  Such analyses will enable the                    determination of test morphotypes which should predominate within               assemblages accumulating under particular environmental regimes.                These data will be compared to collections made previously along                onshore to offshore traverses, thereby allowing the development                 of foraminiferal taphofacies models.  When combined with data on                the relative abundances of living species and test production                   rates, these results will better enable the elucidation of the                  relative effects of population dynamics and taphonomic processes                in the formation of sediment assemblages of foraminifera.  The                  determination of foraminiferal taphofacies based on test                        morphotypes, not individual species, has application to the                     paleoenvironmental interpretation of foraminiferal assemblages                  from different environments and time intervals.  Taphofacies                    models developed by this study will be applied to Pleistocene                   carbonates, thereby providing tests of the models and the                       determination of the preservability of taphonomic signatures.",
