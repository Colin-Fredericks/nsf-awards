Measurement in Science, is used as a unifying thread as                         students are exposed to a wide variety of disciplines and                       activities.  The program is structured around a series of                       discipline-focused modules including chemistry, physics,                        mathematics, biological sciences, earth sciences, electrical                    engineering, and computer science.  Each module will feature                    teaching, demonstrations and hands-on activities.                               Interspersed with the modules will be activities and programs                   that explore research support services and facilities, the                      philosophy and ethics of science and scientists, and the                        human dimension of being a scientist.                                                                                                                           Students will participate in laboratory experiences preceded                    by theoretical explanations.  Follow-up activities will                         include projects conducted at their home schools under the                      direction of faculty mentors and compilation of their results                   and experiences in a Young Scholars Research Journal.",
