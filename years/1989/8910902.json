 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal on \"Preparation and Properties of Layered Organic                 Derivatives of Group IV Metals\" between Dr. Abraham Clearfield of               Texas A&M University and Professor Guang-Zhi Peng of the Qinghai                Institute of Salt Lake of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)                 is jointly sponsored by NSF and CAS.                                                                                                                            The researchers propose to combine synthetic capabilities of the                Qinghai Institute with characterization techniques available at                 Texas A&M (solid state NMR, mass spectrometry, thermal analysis,                surface analysis, electron microscopy and diffraction methods)                  to investigate the synthesis and behavior of organic derivatives                of layered group IV phosphates, especially and their synthesis                  of novel phosphonic acids and organic phosphates and their                      subsequent reaction with IV cations.  These reactions lead to                   the formation of layered metal phosphonates and phosphates in                   which the organic moiety resides in the interlamellar space.                    When diphosphonic acids are used, the organic group bridges                     across layers and acts as pillars holding the layers in place.                  The researchers will attempt to prepare mixed derivatives so as                 to space the pillars and produce pores of relatively uniform                    size, and to functionalize the organic groups with carboxylate,                 sulphonate and amino groups to impart ion exchange and complexing               power to the derivatives.  Catalyically active species will also                be immobilized on the layered compounds.                                                                                                                        This research should be applicable to photochemistry, separations               procedures, catalysis, ion exchange and ion sieving.  The                       subject compounds can also be precursors to the synthesis of                    novel interlayered phosphates and oxides.",
