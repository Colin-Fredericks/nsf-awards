 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of the orientation behavior of migratory birds and other                kinds of animals rely heavily on orientation cages as the means                 of assaying the animal's choice of direction.  In the case of                   birds, these are usually circular cages in which the direction of               the animal's hopping or fluttering is recorded.  The integrity of               the results of such studies obviously depends upon the                          researcher's ability at least to know, and often to control, the                stimuli to which the birds are exposed.  Because the perceptual                 world of other species often differs markedly from our own,                     researchers must be extremely careful to be certain that their                  experimental subjects are responding to the stimuli of interest.                                                                                                Migratory birds have been shown to use patterns of polarized                    skylight for orientation.  This is a visual stimulus to which                   human beings are barely sensitive, and the physiological                        mechanism by which vertebrates perceive polarized light is                      unknown.  In addition, it is technically impossible to simulate                 precisely the polarized-light pattern of the clear sky.  Dr.                    Able's experiments to date suggest that polarized skylight may be               centrally involved in the development and performance of                        orientation in several species of migratory birds.  These facts                 make it extremely important to examine in detail the birds'                     response to polarized skylight:  To what specific aspects of the                stimulus are they responding, and how do they use the information               as a compass?  Knowing these things will help experimenters                     produce an optimal testing stimulus and apparatus, and will                     ensure that the birds' orientation is not an artifact based on                  some unknown aspect of the testing situation.",
