 "awd_abstract_narration": "Color vision in humans depends on particular receptor cells                called cones in the retina of the eye.  One population of cones,                known as the short-wavelength cones or S-cones is most sensitive                to light in the blue region of the spectrum; others are the                     medium-wavelength or M-cones, and long-wavelength or L-cones,                   most sensitive to red.  Cones contribute to two conceptual                      channels of information leading to visual perception.  Intensity                of light stimuli is signalled in the luminance channel, and color               of light is signalled in the chromatic channel.  Sorting out the                relative contributions of the different kinds of receptors to                   these different channels has been an important problem.                              This project will examine the temporal properties of the                   chromatic and luminance contributions.  A human subject will set                flicker of a colored test light to be at just the threshold of                  visible flickering.  The frequency or the intensity of the                      flicker, or the background, or a second stimulus that tends to                  mask or augment the flicker of the first, can all be varied.                    Using very intense lights, this lab already discovered that S-                  cones can contribute to the luminance channel.  Fast responses to               light intensity apparently use a brisk pathway to a luminance                   channel, while slower responses to color use a sluggish pathway                 to a chromatic channel.  The current project will asses the                     relative prominence and the temporal properties of the two                      pathways at more normal light levels, and try to determine if the               S-cone contribution to luminance is important at these lower                    levels.  This work uses innovative techniques and methodology for               delivering and analyzing pulsing stimuli, and results from this                 work will be very important to theories of color vision, to                     commercial engineering measurements of colored lights, and to                   understanding human vision in general.",
