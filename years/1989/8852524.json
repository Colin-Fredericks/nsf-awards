 "awd_abstract_narration": "This laboratory improvement program involves engineering students in            the full spectrum of computer integrated manufacturing from the CAD to          the CAM phase through a dedicated experimental laboratory facility.             The planned facility would fulfill two objectives:  introduction of             key advanced manufacturing technologies, and investigation of                   fundamental engineering and scientific concepts and their application           to a real engineering system.  The laboratory facility centers around           a fully-instrumented computer numerical control (CNC) machining center          that supports experiments in four interwoven areas, namely, (1)                 measurement and analysis of basic physical quantities, (2)                      manufacturing processes, methods and equipment, (3) analysis and                synthesis of servosystems used in manufacturing systems, and (4)                principles of numerical control, computer numerical control, and                metrology.                                                                      It is anticipated that the capabilities offered by this facility would          profoundly impact the quality of education in four core courses in the          newly-introduced option in manufacturing.",
