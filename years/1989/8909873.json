 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conventional probability theory has, since the 17th century,                    been enormously successful in characterizing chance, uncertainty,               and indeterminate phenomena.  Its success has been so great that                there has been little interest in developing alternatives to the                conventional position. Professor Fine and his students are                      continuing their long-term study of the structure, interpretation               and application of one alternative, the frequentist theory of                   lower probability, which they believe offers considerable                       advantages over the traditional approach.  By \"lower                            probability\" they refer to a probability-like but superadditive                 nonnegative and unit formed set function, examples of which                     include the familiar countably and finitely additive probability                measures, the widely discussed belief functions pioneered by                    Demster and Shafer, the lower envelopes studied by Kyburg, Levi,                Suppes, Walley and others, and the class of undominated lower                   probabilities introduced by Professor Fine and his students.                    Under this renewal grant, they aim to develop lower probability-                based reasoning about nondeterministic physical and natural                     phenomena and particularly the development and study of a theory                of statistics that can coordinate time series data with the lower               probability models that are provided by the statistical theory.                 They expect to exploit their recently developed definition of                   lower expectation as a basis for a theory of estimation and for                 learning from observations through conditioning.                                                                                                                While the interpretations of lower probability offered by others                have been of either subjective or epistemic varieties, their                    efforts will continue to concentrate on the possibilities of an                 objective frequentist-related interpretation.  This research on                 an objective interpretation of lower probability should also                    enhance our understanding of such interpretations for                           conventional probability.",
