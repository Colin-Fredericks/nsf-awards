 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are to elucidate the mechanisms of                    neurohormonal control of cellular volume regulation in marine bivalve           molluscs.  Two neural products, the peptide FMRFamide and the                   transmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) increase the efflux of amino              acids from isolated ventricles of the clam Mercenaria mercenaria                exposed to hypoosmotic stress.  Phorbol esters also potentiate the              amino acid efflux of tissues in hypoosmotic media, suggesting that the          activation of protein kinase C is involved in the control of                    hypoosmotic volume regulation.  The roles of changes in intracellular           Ca++ levels in the modulation of the amino acid efflux of tissues in            hypoosmotic media will be investigated.  Changes in the activity of             protein kinase C in tissues exposed to hypoosmotic media will be                determined.  The possibility that neurosecretory cells in the visceral          ganglion release FMRFamide into the circulation in response to                  decreases in ambient salinity will also be investigated using                   immunocytochemical techniques.                                                                                                                                  While neurohormones have been implicatead in the control of salt and            water balance in invertebrates, no known hormone has yet been clearly           associated with the control of a specific osmoregulatory mechanism.             This project will associate the neurosecretion of FMRFamide with the            control of hypoosmotic cellular volume regulation in molluscs.  In              addition, this project will provide new information on the cellular             mechanisms involved in volume regulation in molluscs and other animals.",
