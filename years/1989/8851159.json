 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laboratory work in computer control of integrated automated                     systems must address the issues of distributed control and                      communication networks.  The current focus of the laboratory                    course in computer control is at device level.  The intent of                   this project to restructure the course around hierarchical                      control concepts.  The impact on the student is a change in                     perspective on computer control in automation.  With this new                   focus, students will demonstrate an ability to integrate                        individually controlled devices into complete, automated systems.               Students will learn the basics of communications by developing                  communication rules for control systems.  These rules will be                   used to control work centers consisting of a variety of machines                such as robots and machine tools. The next step for students is                 to control an entire factory floor.                                             These advances will be made through the acquisition of new                      laboratory equipment.  The two main equipment needs are a                       computer network and computer workstations.  The network is                     necessary to provide communications in the control system.                      Workstations will be used in two ways: (1) to provide an                        interface between from the student and the system and (2) to                    emulate physical devices such as machine tools, furnaces,                       conveyors, and the like, which are too large and expensive for                  the laboratory facility.",
