 "awd_abstract_narration": "For over a hundred years, anthropologists, comparative anatomists               and paleontologists have sought evidence from the fossil record                 and from; studies on the morphology of nonhuman primates in order               to understand how, why, and when the ancestors of living humans                 became habitual accomplished bipeds.  Early in this endeavor it                 seemed that the answer to this question ;might be that the                      practice of brachiation, or arm-swinging, by human ancestors                    preadapted and predisposed them for bipedalism.  Recent                         information on the natural behaviors of apes lend little support                to this theory, land new attempts must be made to discover the                  probable behavior of the form which gave rise to humans.  Since                 the fossil record currently provides limited data bearing                       directly on this question, and the data which do exist have led                 to contradictory interpretations about the stages through which                 the earliest humans passed on their path to becoming accomplished               bipeds, emphasis must be placed on determining the functional                   significance of: (1) osteological features characterizing the                   oldest fossil hominid, (2) anatomical similarities between humans               and nonhuman primates, and (3) those anatomical traits that are                 unique to humans.  Specific hypotheses of muscle function, and                  the ways in which bony changes might influence such function, can               only be tested by in vivo physiological techniques.                                                                                                             The proposed study will apply telemetered recording of muscle                   activity (combined, when appropriate, with force-place and                      kinematic analyses) in nonhuman primates during regular arboreal                locomotor behavior, terrestrial movement, and bipedalism in order               to establish the actual roles of individual muscle in these                     behaviors. In so doing, a better understanding of changes that                  might have preadapted or predisposed a human ancestor for                       bipedality is sought.  The same methodology will be applied in                  humans to a study of uniquely human muscles during a wide range                 of bipedal activities.  Combined data nonhuman primates and                     humans will provide a sounder basis for interpreting the                        differences in muscle attachment, orientation, and size that can                be deduced from fossil evidence of early hominid skeletal                       structure.",
