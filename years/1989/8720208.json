 "awd_abstract_narration": "This innovative project, based at the University of                        California, Berkeley, involves a group of molecular biologists                  and mathematicians under the direction of Dr. Nicholas                          Cozzarelli.  The major focus of this project is to attack various               problems arising in the studies of DNA replication, supercoiling,               protein folding, mapping of genes that underlie quantitative                    traits, and pattern recognition in protein sequences by using new               mathematical methods from topology and geometry.  The question of               exactly how DNA replicates, folds and unfolds, and how geometric                properties of large molecules are related to the sequences of                   amino acids are among the major unsolved problems of molecular                  biology.  The use of new mathematical tools of differential                     geometry and knot invariants in the study of these problems                     should make an impact on both molecular biology and mathematics.                     There are two significant aspects of this project: to                      stimulate creative interactions between mathematicians and                      molecular biologists and to provide support for training and                    outreach on the interface of these two scientific fields.  A                    major portion of the funding for this program will support                      graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, thus providing new                  young scientists trained in this area.  Conferences and books are               planned in order to disseminate new results of this research.",
