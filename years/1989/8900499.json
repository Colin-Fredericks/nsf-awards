 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel approach to engineering computing in the area of the electric           power transmission systems and other large textured systems is                  introduced and proposed for study and evaluation.  The approach is              novel in various ways.  It exploits the \"textured\" character of this            class of engineering systems by constructing their model and the                associated algorithmic arrangement as one unit.  Conventionally                 engineers supply the models and problem statement and then experts in           numerical work solve this mathematical programming problem.                     Strengthening this interface creates a truly engineering computing              approach, where the system is broken up into optimally sized multiple           groups of active and passive elements.  Disjointness and intersection           of these groups is then alternately exploited in iterative parallel             processing to solve problems of dynamic or static optimization or               other computations.  The computational speedup ranges (on the basis of          preliminary work) into orders of magnitude and it is rapidly                    increasing with the size of the system given the appropriate number of          parallel processors.  Even serial processing produces very large                speedup, however.  The proposed project will 1) refine the concept of           textured system, based on the power system, 2) investigate                      convergence, computation time, applicability and accuracy, 3) examine           parallel processing considerations including communications overhead,           and explore links with existing computer architectures, e.g.                    interconnection networks, 4) evaluate effectiveness and limitations,            and 5) conduct preliminary software development and testing.",
