 "awd_abstract_narration": "They will prepare and characterize new solid-state inorganic                    compounds that as laser crystals will provide greater efficiency,               enhanced tuning capabilities, and higher powers as compared with                materials currently available.  Crystals of new borates and                     fluorides prepared specifically for substitutional doping with                  the ions Ti(III), Cr(III), Cu(I), and/or Nd(III) provide unique                 materials for spectroscopic characterization of luminescent                     phenomena and the determination of laser gain.  Through judicious               selection of associated cations, compounds of high                              crystallographic order with congruent melting points below 1670 K               can be realized.  Compounds with such features could be easily                  grown as large laser crystals with superb optical quality.                      Determination of coefficients of thermal expansion for these                    materials by X-ray diffraction will provide information on their                thermal response when subject to high laser powers and elevated                 operating temperatures.  Refinement of atomic parameters from                   data collected at elevated temperatures will provide details on                 the microscopic rearrangements occurring with thermal stress.                   Through chemical synthesis, crystal growth, and detailed                        characterization of new materials, it is likely that they will                  realize a new generation of solid-state laser materials.",
