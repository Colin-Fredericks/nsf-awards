 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genus Pseudomonas comprises a diverse group of bacteria                     that are involved in the pathogenicity of plants and animals                    including humans, in the biotransformation of natural and                       synthetic wastes including highly toxic hazardous compounds and                 in the development of new industrial products such as                           surfactants, polysaccharides, various organic acids, enzymes,                   vitamins, amino acids, antibiotics and a host of other                          compounds.  It is, therefore, no accident that the first two                    genetically altered strains that have been proposed to be                       released into the environment for protection of plants from                     frost-related damage or the attack by insect pests are                          pseudomonads viz. P. syringae and P. fluorescens.  Although                     intense work in various aspects of Pseudomonas biology has been                 going on in both the United States and elsewhere in the world,                  the last major meeting on Pseudomonas held in the United States                 was more than a decade ago---an ASM sponsored symposium in 1976                 in Orlando, Florida.  The proposed meeting in Chicago during                    July 9-13, 1989 is therefore long overdue and is expected to                    attract more than 400 participants from the international                       scientific community.",
