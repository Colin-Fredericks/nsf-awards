 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most striking aspects of quasi-stellar objects                       (quasars, or QSOs) is their strong collective evolution with                    cosmic time, as is apparent from a comparison of near and distant               samples.  The duration of the luminous phase of quasars is likely               to be short, less than 100 million years, because otherwise the                 central masses would become unreasonably large.  On the other                   hand, the collective evolution evidently has a timescale that is                much longer than 1 billion years.  A basic question in                          understanding quasars is thus what governs their individual                     births and deaths, and what controls the overall activity of                    quasars over the age of the universe.  If a clearer picture for                 the collective evolution can be obtained, it is possible that the               nature of quasars, and their relation to the origin of galaxies,                can be better understood.  The research will provide fundamental                data on very faint quasars by expanding and elaborating on a                    proven survey technique that has made it possible to achieve                    fainter limits and a higher surface density of confirmed quasars                than any other survey. The survey technique involves                            high-precision, wide-field, multi-band photometry to identify                   quasar candidates, followed by multi-object spectroscopy of these               candidates to obtain redshifts.  The objective is to determine                  the evolutionary characteristics of low-luminosity quasars up to                very high redshifts.  This information complements that obtained                for high-luminosity quasars by wide-field (Schmidt) telescopes at               brighter limits.",
