 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although gate matrix and functional array layout styles have received           much research attention, algorithms for these methods are not complete          enough to assess their design potential.  The P.I. is developing a              complete VLSI module generation system based on these design styles and         performing a thorough evaluation of them.  The system takes many design         issues into consideration: transistor sizing, timing analysis,                  physical-sized (gridless) routing and layout, array folding, array              partitioning, and variations on the gate matrix layout.  Research work          includes: a new representation for dynamic nets, new recursive min-cut          algorithms, algorithms for performing net assignment in NMOS and CMOS           independently, a five-stage algorithm for compaction, a graph                   representation for functional arrays, and algorithms for layout                 generation, transistor reordering and traversing a reduced graph.  A            complete study of these two layout styles is being performed, and the           results evaluated against standard design methods, such as standard             cell.                                                                                                                                                           New VLSI design styles need to be developed in order to design complex,         high transistor count IC's.  This research investigates two new design          styles, gate matrix and functional array layout methods.  The P.I.'s            approach is unique in that he intends to answer the basic question of           whether these promising design styles are better than traditional               approaches.  The novelty is in the concepts to be used in building a            design system that completely covers the design problem.  The principal         investigator is a promising and competent young professor who should            make significant contributions to the field.",
