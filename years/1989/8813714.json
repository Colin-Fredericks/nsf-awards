 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop the methodology for                 determining the overall distribution coefficients and the extent                of extraction necessary for supercritical extraction of a                       complex chemical mixture of environmental pollutants from                       water.  These parameters will be determined as a function of                    the type of solvent, temperature, and pressure in terms of the                  toxicological indices obtained via cell culture bioassays.                                                                                                      The investigator plans to study the use of carbon dioxide and                   other supercritical solvents with or without entrainers for                     extraction of a complex mixture of toxic organic contaminants                   from water and determine an overall distribution coefficient as                 well as the extent of extraction necessary for treatment of                     water to achieve acceptably safe levels of contaminants in                      water destined for human consumption, considering toxic indices                 for genetoxicity and carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity and                         neurocarcinogenesis, prenatal toxicity and birth defects.  The                  investigator will base the research on model mixture of water                   contaminated with a wood preservative (creosote).  The                          distribution coefficients and the extent of extraction will be                  determined as a function of temperature and pressure in a                       single equilibrium stage extractor.                                                                                                                             The research being conducted in this project is directed toward                 a promising new technology to complement those currently                        available for treatment of water contaminated by organic                        substances.  It offers promise of reduction in the volume of                    residual contaminated material that is produced during                          treatment of water by conventional procedures and processes                     now used.",
