 "awd_abstract_narration": "An early introduction to computers, during the first year of a pre-             engineering or physics program will motivate the students, and enhance          their educational experience.  Students will learn the hardware,                software, and related peripherals, as they learn the concepts of                physics.  Students will become more familiar with modern data                   acquisition and analysis techniques, which they are likely to enounter          when they transfer to B.S. degree programs in physics or engineering,           graduate school, or the work force.                                                                                                                             To facilitate this goal, the Physics Department of Medgar Evers                 College will install a computer-based physics laboratory for the first          three semester of the four semester introductory calculus level physics         course, and integrate its use into five experiments each semester.  The         computers will be used for data acquisition, analysis and control.  The         physic laboratory will have 8 work stations centered on the Macintosh           SE computer, with MacADIOS Data Aquisition System, and it will contain          a local area network with a Macintosh II computer as the file server.           The grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match for         the NSF award.",
