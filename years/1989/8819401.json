 "awd_abstract_narration": "The longterm goal of this work is to elucidate the mechanistic                  basis and regulation of an antagonistic interaction between                     Oomycete fungi and a strain of Bacillus cereus.  A strain of B.                 cereus has been identified that prevents infection of seedlings                 by a variety of Oomycete fungi.  The ability to prevent infection               is associated with a low molecular weight, extracellular peptide.  The          objectives of the proposed research are to purify the                           antifungal peptide, determine its structure, begin to determine                 its mode of action on the fungus, and to identify the genes                     required for its biosynthesis.  The genetic analysis will involve               identification of transposon mutants that lack antifungal                       activity, and cloning of the wild-type genes that restore                       activity to the mutants.  An alternative approach to identify the               appropriate genetic sequence will be to shot-gun clone DNA from                 the antifungal strain of B. cereus into either E. coli or B.                    subtilis, and identify the desired recipients by screening for                  antifungal activity.  Identification of the genes involved in                   production of the antifungal agent will provide the basis for                   elucidating the pathway and regulation of its biosynthesis.                                                                                                     The results of this research will provide important basic                       information about biochemical mechanisms involved in plant-                     microbe interactions.  This fundamental information may, in the                 future, be useful in developing ecologically sound methods for                  protection of plants from fungal pathogens.",
