 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of Hillsborough County's Teacher Enhancement Project is to          prepare one teacher in each of the system's elementary schools to become        a lead teacher for elementary science instruction.  These lead teachers         will receive approximately two hundred hours of instruction in science,         science teaching methodology, cognitive psychology as it pertains to            elementary science, cooperative learning, peer coaching, and leadership         strategies.  They will then become responsible for the support of the           system's nationally recognized hands-on inquiry based elementary science        program.  One teacher per grade level will also receive some instruction        in science content and methodology so that they can be part of network          support for improved science teaching.  It is hoped that the success of         this model will result in the dispersal of new knowledge and teaching           techniques throughout the entire Hillsborough County School System.  In         addition, the Lead Teacher at each school will become the recognized            resource person for science and will continue to act in this capacity           long after the NSF project period has ended.                                                                                                                    The cost sharing for the project will be eighty-nine percent of the             National Science Foundation portion.",
