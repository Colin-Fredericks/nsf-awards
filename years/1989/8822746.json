 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in heterogeneous                 catalysis between Dr. Gary Simmons, Lehigh University and Profs.                Ulrik Gelius and Nils Martensson, Physics Institute, University of              Uppsala, Sweden.                                                                                                                                                X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCA) is a tool of major                      importance in materials science.  Recent developments in this                   field promise unprecedented advances, as well as precision in the               understanding of properties of materials that stem from                         interfacial phenomena.  In this joint project, Dr. Simmons will                 use ESCA instruments developed in Sweden to study the interaction               between copper and zinc oxide that is believed to account for the               activity of Cu/ZnO methanol synthesis catalysts.  The Uppsala                   instrument has the highest sensitivity at high energy resolution                in the world, and thus has the capability of resolving the                      copper-zinc oxide interaction from the valence band photo electron              spectrum of the Cu/ZnO catalyst.  High resolution spectra of the                core electron levels, as well as the Auger electron transition,                 may provide further evidence for the copper-zinc oxide                          interaction.  In addition, participation in the ongoing programs                at the Physics Institute will afford the principal investigator                 the opportunity to learn about the theoretical basis of new                     information that will likely be resolved by the new generation of               high resolution ESCA instruments.  The project will benefit from                the significant background and experience in heterogeneous                      catalysis of the principal investigator, as well as the recent                  interest by the Uppsala group in the application of high energy                 resolution ESCA to solid state problems, including catalysis.",
