 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term objectives of this proposal include the elucidation of            nephronal heterogeneity of transport enzymes, the factors which regulate        transport enzymes in each nephron segment and the mechanism by which            these factors regulate the transport enzymmes, especially ATPases. An           electroneutral H-K-Atpase has been reported to be present in the stomach        where it is responsible for H+ secretion.  Our preliminary observations         indicate that an ATPase, is present in the distal nephron where it may          be responsible for K+ reabsorption and/or H+ secretion.  The specific           aim of this project is to study the regulation of renal tubular K-              ATPase in the distal segments of the mammalian nephron by                       adrenocorticosteroids, plasma K+ and extracellular volume (Na intake).          This aim will be pursued by determining K-ATPase activity in distal             nephron segments of normal and adrenalectomized rabbits by an                   ultramicroassay method developed in our laboratory.  The effects of             different intakes of potassium and sodium and administration of                 corticosteroids (aldosterone and dexamethasone) on K-ATPase activity in         the distal nephron segments will be studied.  The relationships between         concentrations of K+ and cortocosteroids in the plasma and K-ATPase             activity in different nephron segments will then be determined.                 The kidney plays an inportant role in maintaining the volume and                composition of the body fluids.  Urine formation is corollary of the            primary function of the kidney in regulating the concentration of salts         in the body fluids.  There are two principal steps involved in the              formation of urine: 1) filtration of large amounts of nutrients and             salts, but not proteins and cells from blood, through specialized               structures called glomeruli, and 2) reabsorption of 100% of filtered            nutrients (such as glucose and amino acid) and approximately 99% of             salts back into the blood through microscopic structures called tubules         which are connected to the glomeruli.  It is the second step which is           regulated by several hormones (specialized chemicals released into the          blood by special organs of the body) and the changes in salt                    composition of the blood due to a change in our diet.                                                                                                           An enzyme protein called Na-K-ATPase is present in the renal tubules            and is responsible for reabsorption of salt and nutrients from the              filtered tubular fluid back into the blood. Recently, we have                   discovered that another enzyme called H-K-ATPase is also present in the         distal parts of the renal tubule.  Our preliminary observations suggest         that this H-K-ATPase may be responsible for maintaining normal                  concentration of potassium in the blood during decreased intake of              potassium in our diet.",
