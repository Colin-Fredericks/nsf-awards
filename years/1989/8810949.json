Using data analyses and sensitivity                            experiments with General Circulation Models, this project will                  explore whether these oscillations were driven by variations in                 relatively small Northern Hemisphere ice sheets that did not                    calve icebergs to the open Atlantic ocean or by large-scale                     changes in Arctic sea-ice limits.  Among many possible causes                   of the Northern Hemisphere ice age, the project will explore                    the effect of large-scale tectonic uplift in Southeast Asia                     (Tibet, Himalayas) and the American southwest (Colorado                         Plateau, Rockies) on the Northern Hemisphere planetary waves                    (and thus on climate at the earth's surface).  New analyses                     will extend the high-resolution isotopic time series, and                       experiments with a model including an interactive mixed-layer                   ocean will define more accurately the full climatic effects of                  Late-Cenozoic tectonic uplift.                                                  %%%                                                                             This project will examine climatic fluctuations preceding the                   initiation of the \"Pleistocene\" ice ages and the initiation of                  the ice age itself (which actually began 3.2 million years ago;                 approximately 1.0 million years before the Pleistocene began).                  The project will utilize computer models of climate                             interactions in order to examine the feed-back mechanisms of                    climate and ocean environments with the tectonic uplifts of                     major high-altitude land masses.  This will be the first                        attempt to model so many of the variables the cause of respond                  to climate changes that resulted in the initiation of the ice                   ages.",
