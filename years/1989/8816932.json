 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support a field investigation of the Transantarctic             Mountains (TAM), an intracontinental mountain belt that developed along         the crustal boundary between the subcontinents of East and West                 Antarctica.  Uplift of the TAM appears to be related to extensional             tectonism within the Antarctic Plate during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic.          The principal goal of this study is to document the kinematic history of        the boundary between East and West Antarctica, both during the early            stages of Gondwana break-up in the Jurassic and during the morphological        development of the TAM in the Cenozoic.  The work will focus on the             Beardmore Glacier area of the central TAM and on a portion of the TAM in        South Victoria Land where faults or dike swarms of demonstrated Jurassic        and Cenozoic age are present.  Detailed structural analysis of fault,           fracture and dike arrays in these regions will be used to define                Jurassic and Cenozoic regional strain kinematics and paleostress fields.        These data will directly test existing models for Jurassic extensional          and translational motions between East and West Antarctica, and will            provide new constraints on Cenozoic displacements within the Antarctic          plate that must be integrated into the Antarctic-Australia-Pacific plate        circuit.  The results will enhance our understanding of the tectonic            evolution of the Antarctic plate and will have application to the               general geotectonic problem of continental rifting and the development          of rift-margin uplifts.",
