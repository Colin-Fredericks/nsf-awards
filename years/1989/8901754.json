 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \u001aDrosophila\u001a Stock Center previously housed at the                  California Institute of Technology has been transferred to                      Indiana University at Bloomington, where the Stock Center's role                as a resource to the international research community has been                  expanded.  The Stock Center currently maintains over 3000                       genetically distinct strains of the fruit fly \u001a\u00d5Drosophila\u001a                     \u001amelanogaster\u001a plus over 100 strains previously maintained.  In                 1988, 638 requests for stocks an/or information were processed,                 resulting in the shipment of 2667 subcultures of strains from the               Indiana collection to researchers in 25 countries.  In addition                 to expanding the content of the collection, a computerized                      database has been established that assists investigators in                     rapidly determining which strains available from the Stock Center               are likely to be relevant to their individual research programs.                When strains not available from the Stock Center are requested,                 information about likely sources of the desired materials is                    provided whenever possible.  In the tradition of the Caltech                    Stock Center, \u001aDrosophila\u001a strains that serve as basic tools in a               wide variety of research projects continue to be constructed at                 the Indiana Stock Center.  Stock Center personnel also serve the                research community as a source of information about successful                  husbandry and genetic manipulation of this important research                   organism.                                                                               The national research initiative for the sequencing of the              human genome will be facilitated by pioneering studies using                    model systems such a \u001aDrosophila\u001a.  This simple eukaryote has a                 long history of genetic utility and thus much more is known about               its genomic structure than any other metazoan.  This fact coupled               with the small genome size makes \u001aDrosophila\u001a an ideal candidate                for establishing aspects of the paradigm to be used in the human                genome project.  The Stock Center, in its dual role of culture                  maintenance and informational clearing house, will facilitate                   the use of this organism by researchers new to \u001aDrosophila\u001a as well             as the cognoscenti.                                                                     This project provides partial support for the Stock Centers             activities for the next five years.",
