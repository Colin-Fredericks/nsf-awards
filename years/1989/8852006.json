This junior-level course is              intended to involve several relatively simple bench-scale experiments           related to the material covered in the introductory chemical                    engineering.  However, the current laboratory has experiments that are          too few for proper illustration of the curriculum that has not moved            with the times and does not involve sufficient data-acquisition and             processing by microcomputers.  In order to remedy these deficiencies,           a virtually new start is taken, based on ten experiments, each of               which has been selected so that it illustrates several specific                 physical phenomena and principles.  It is also likely to stimulate              further inquiry on the part of the students.",
