The first project, representing joint work with Professor                  C. P. Boyer, continues the ongoing program of Professors Boyer                  and Mann to study the geometry and topology of moduli spaces of                 instantons and monopoles which arise in the differential                        geometric formulation of Yang-Mills-Higgs gauge theories.  The                  techniques developed in this program have applications to other                 moduli problems which will also be investigated.                                     The second project, representing joint work with Professor                 R.J. Milgram, attempts to extend the results of Professors F.R.                 Cohen, R.L. Cohen, B.M. Mann, and R.J. Milgram on the more                      general case of rational functions from the Riemann sphere to                   Grassmannians and flag manifolds.  The topology of such spaces                  is important in several areas, including linear control theory,                 and the results of this project will be useful in applications                  to other areas of mathematics.",
