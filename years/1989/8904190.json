 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a continuation of the PI's research on the design of small to           medium scale shared-memory multiprocessors where the number of CPU's            ranges from a very few to several hundreds.  The emphasis is on the             management of the memory hierarchy.  Innovative architectural features,         such as multi-level cache hierarchies and interconnection networks with         memory in the switches are studied.  An important component of the              research is providing qualitative and quantitative evaluations through          trace-driven and synthetic simulations.                                                                                                                         In the case of multi-level cache hierarchies, the emphasis is on the            design and evaluation of a two level virtual-real cache hierarchy, the          effect of inclusion properties on the protocols for cache coherence and         performance in bus-hierarchy based architectures, and on techniques for         speeding up trace driven simulation (inclusion properties, trace                reduction, parallel simulation).                                                                                                                                A second area of research is techniques and architectural enhancements          to reduce the memory latency in architectures where processors and              memory modules are connected by a multi-stage interconnection network.          The first part of the research considers caching as a viable                    alternative and studies improved self-invalidation cache coherence              schemes and compares their performance and cost with those of                   previously published protocols.  The second part continues the PI's             investigation of the introduction of memory in the switches of the              interconnection network.",
