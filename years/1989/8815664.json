 "awd_abstract_narration": "The entomological collections of the American Museum of                    Natural History form one of the world's greatest resources for                  studying the diversity and evolution of arthropods, a group that                includes the majority of known species of animals on earth.  Over               16 million specimens document the variety of insects and                        arachnids found throughout the world, making the collection one                 of the four largest in existence.  The tremendous growth (c.                    800%) of the collection over the past 40 years has stretched to                 the limit the physical space available for storing it.  By                      installing a compactor system (in conjunction with the Museum's                 renovation of the collection's main storage area), this award                   will allow a doubling of the number of cases of insects that can                be safely stored and accessed.  The compactor system selected                   will allow the collection to mount its existing storage cases                   directly on the movable carriages, preserving their airtight                    protection against collection pests.  Positions for one                         preparator and two assistants, as well as funding for visiting                  specialists, will make available for scientific study, for the                  first time, large quantities of specimens from all geographic                   regions, particularly of groups of noctuoid moths and true bugs                 (Heteroptera and Homoptera) that contain economically important                 agricultural pests.",
