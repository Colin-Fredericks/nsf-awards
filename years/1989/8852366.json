 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanical design and laboratory curriculum in the fields of                fluid and thermal science and system controls will be enhanced with             the acquisition of five Personal System 2 workstations.  These                  workstations will be equipped with Keithley data acquisition systems            and transducers capable of performing engineering measurements, such            as temperature of a solid or fluid, flow rate of a fluid, pressure,             displacement or force.  These measurements will be used to implement            control algorithms or optimize designs for different student projects.          This is significant in that it gives undergraduate engineers a state-           of-the-art data acquisition and control environment in which to                 develop individual projects in fluid and thermal science and design.            The equipment is easy to use; students need only understand BASIC               programming to do projects.  Once theory and analytical materials are           covered in the classroom, algorithms for measurement and control can            be derived and implemented very quickly, and complicated measurements           can be performed to confirm analytical predictions and test design              prototypes.  These systems permit early creativity for students                 because assembly language programming and advanced circuit design do            not need to be mastered to build \"smart\" projects.  They can move               directly to actual design and construction of mechanical engineering            systems.",
