 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Richter's project will investigate a class of                    operators on Hilbert space called two-isometries, which satisfy a               weaker, order two version of the norm-preserving condition that                 defines isometries. An important example of a two-isometry is the               operator of multiplication by z on the space of functions that                  map the disc analytically to a region with finite area, i.e. the                classical Dirichlet shift on the classical Dirichlet space. The                 essence of the projected research is to use operator-theoretic                  results to study functions in spaces of Dirichlet type, and                     conversely to use function theory to construct models for                       abstract two-isometries. A central problem is that of                           characterizing the invariant subspace lattice of the Dirichlet                  shift and its generalizations.                                                       The mathematical research envisioned here has to do with                   analytic functions on the disc. These may be described                          geometrically as the continuous mappings of the disc into the                   plane that preserve angles, except perhaps at scattered singular                points. It is a reflection of the important role analytic                       functions have played in mathematics for well over a century that               they can be described in numerous other ways as well. One method                of studying analytic functions is to group them into linear                     spaces, most fruitfully Hilbert spaces defined by an appropriate                finiteness condition, and consider the behavior of certain                      operators that arise naturally on these spaces. One such space is               the Dirichlet space consisting of all analytic functions on the                 disc which map the disc to a planar region with finite area. The                operator of multiplication of functions in this space (and its                  generalizations) by the independent variable will be studied and                characterized by Professor Richter.",
