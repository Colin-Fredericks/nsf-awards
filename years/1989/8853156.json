 "awd_abstract_narration": "The complexity of technical fields like Computer Science has grown so           rapidly that traditional undergraduate labs no longer present adequate          representations of contemporary work.  This gap is often filled by              work-study programs which supply realism but generally do not identify          and reinforce fundamental principles.  Weakness in undergraduate labs           is due in part to inadequate equipment, but more generally, complexity          often exceeds that which any one student can be expected to master in a         structured project environment.  A solution to this dilemma being               developed by the NCSU CSC Dept. is a collaborative senior projects lab          which emulates the scope and complexity of an R&D organization yet is           carefully supervised by teaching faculty.  A small but powerful                 parallel computer and high performance color graphics system will be            acquired and integrated with existing, conventional computing support.          Advanced applications of this system will require students specializing         in computer graphics, software engineering and parallel computing to            join forces to solve problems none could have attempted in isolation on         equipment that would be difficult to justify for any single,                    specialized lab.  the interplay of theory and practice from three               typically distinct subjects will enrich the lab experience for each             student and provide realistic complexity without losing sight of basic          principles.",
