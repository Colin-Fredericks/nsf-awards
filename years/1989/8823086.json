Kabalka of the                         University of Tennessee is within the Organic Dynamics Program,                 and is aimed at an understanding of organic reactions on                        surfaces.  Most of our knowledge about organic reactions comes                  from experiments run in the liquid or gas phase.  It is                         expected that reactions which occur on solid surfaces might                     take a different course, and this will provide new fundamental                  information about reaction pathways and also provide new                        opportunities for organic synthesis.                                                                                                                            Two synthetic reactions will be examined on solid surfaces:                     asymmetric induction in Diels-Alder reactions and macrocycli-                   zation.  Asymmetric induction reactions have been studied                       widely in solution, but rarely on surfaces.  Surfaces have                      attractive features for these reactions provided that the                       surface is chiral.  This can be achieved by using surfaces that                 are intrinsically chiral or which are made chiral by adsorption                 of chiral molecules.  Macrocyclization, the synthesis of large                  rings from acyclic precursors, is a long-standing problem when                  performed in solution.  For carefully selected cases this                       reaction should be easily achieved on solids because competing                  intermolecular side reactions will be inhibited.",
