 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds to equip a laboratory course in                   recombinant DNA techniques for undergraduate students at the                    University of Wisconsin.  The purpose of this course is to                      provide \"hands-on\" experience in common molecular research                      techniques used in the plant biotechnology industry.  Experiments               to be covered include creating \"recombinant\" plants using                       Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and basic biochemical                    procedures for extracting and analyzing proteins and nucleic                    acids.  The horticulture undergraduate curriculum has                           historically not included such techniques.  With the increasing                 use such techniques in horticulture graduate research and with                  the increased incorporation of biotechnology techniques into the                horticulture industry, it is now important to provide                           horticulture undergraduates with hands-on familiarity of these                  techniques.  In the long-term, these students become our leaders                in their respective industries.  Therefore, by providing better-                educated future leaders, the proposed project may help to dispel                myths and fear concerning the role and safety of biotechnology                  procedures.  The grantee institution is matching this NSF award                 with funds from non-Federal sources.",
