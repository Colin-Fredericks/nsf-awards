 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eukaryotic ribosome formation entails coordinate synthesis of                   a least 80 different macromolecules, all of which assemble                      into ribonucleoprotein complexes by a process that begins in                    the nucleus and concludes in the cytoplasm.                                                                                                                     Heretofore, cis and trans-acting promoter elements common to                    most yeast ribosomal protein (rp) genes appeared responsible                    for coordinate synthesis of yeast ribosomal protein.  Dr.                       Fried and co-workers discovered that rp-gene TCM1 is                            transcribed by promoter elements unlike those of other rp-                      genes.  An additional trans-acting factor, p82, interacted                      with TCM1 and a rp-gene of the other type.  The function of                     TCM1-specific factors in transcriptional regulation of TCM1                     and the participation of those in expression of other (rp-)                     genes will be determined.  Likewise the role of p82 in                          mediating coordinate regulation between the two types of rp-                    genes will be studied.  These objectives will be accomplished                   by purifying the various transcription factors and cloning                      their respective genes.                                                                                                                                         Currently it is unknown what causes ribosomal proteins to                       enter the nucleus or how ribosomal subunits are subsequently                    exported out of the nucleus.  The PI has deduced segments of                    yeast ribosomal protein L29 that promote nuclear                                accumulation.  Using in vitro biochemical assays, he will                       determine whether nuclear entry of L29 is a receptor mediated                   process, if the L29 nuclear accumulation segments are ligands                   for the receptor, and if these segments are distinct from                       domains of L29 that bind ribosomal RNA.  Also, comparative                      studies will be conducted with mouse rp L27', which function                    in place of L29 in yeast, albeit less efficiently.  Finally,                    biochemical requirements for export of ribosomal subunits                       will be determined in an in vivo microinjection assay.",
