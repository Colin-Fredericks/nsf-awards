 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasingly competitive nature of world markets and                   producers has placed a considerable burden on semiconductor                     manufacturing companies within the United States.  There are many               factors which have forced semiconductor manufacturing companies                 to evaluate their strategies carefully.  In the examination of                  how new manufacturing technologies and processes will perform,                  the following questions often arise:  Is there sufficient                       capacity in the proposed system?  What will happen if the product               mix changes?  Will the new technology really reduce manufacturing               lead times?  Will inventory levels go down, or will they actually               increase?  What will resource utilization rates be over a range                 of market forecasts?  Will the rules we are considering for                     controlling inventories and dispatching jobs really work?                            Models and a prototype decision support environment will be                developed that can be used in answering these and other questions               related to the design and operation of their material logistics                 systems.  Primary goals are to develop models and software to                   plan and schedule production and to understand and control                      stochastic variability, and to use previously developed computer                graphics modeling and simulation software to evaluate planning                  methods, scheduling rules, and dispatching rules for                            manufacturing resources.  Work shall be closely coordinated with                IBM's East Fishkill semiconductor fabrication plant to develop                  and test these models and software.",
