 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continental arc magmatism reflects a major process in plate                     tectonics, the convergence of oceanic and continental plates.                   The subduction of an oceanic plate beneath a continental plate                  results in creation of new continental crust and incorporation of               crustal material into the convecting mantle.  These are                         important processes that need to be understood in detail in order               to understand the evolution of the earth.  Andean volcanoes                     reflect the active subduction of the oceanic Nazca plate beneath                the South American plate.  In the Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) of               the Andes, from 33o-42oS, there are major along-strike geologic                 changes; e.g., from north to south there are decreases in the age               of the subducted crust and continental crust thickness.                         Concurrently, along and across strike of the Main Cordillera the                lavas vary systematically in composition (major and trace element               abundance, radiogenic isotope ratios).  There are several                       alternative explanations of these geochemical trends.  The P.I.'s               previous and proposed studies have the objective of understanding               the origin and evolution of volcanism in this region;                           specifically, to define the relative importance of components                   from the subducted crust, asthenosphere, lithosphere and                        continental crust to the arc magmas, and to determine the                       importance of variations in degree of melting, subsequent melt-                 solid segregation, magma mixing and crustal assimilation.  To do                this phenocryst phase compositions plus whole-rock major and                    trace element abundances and isotopic ratios (0, Sr, Nd, Pb) will               be used.  To date emphasis has been on stratovolcanoes on or near               the volcanic front of the SVZ.  This project will focus on recent               basaltic lavas erupted 50 to 200 km east of the volcanic front.                 Because these back (retro) arc lavas are less evolved than                      volcanic front lavas, their geochemical characteristics more                    directly reflect source compositions (especially, important is                  the possibility of determining geochemical characteristics of                   continental mantle lithosphere) and mantle processes.  In                       addition, along the volcanic front near a single stratovolcano                  (Villarrica), significant geochemical differences between lavas                 erupted from the stratovolcano and several surrounding                          (satellite), small basaltic cones have been found.  These                       differences can be interpreted as reflecting much less crustal                  contamination in the satellite cone lavas, or the influence of                  source heterogeneities which are averaged out in long-lived magma               chambers beneath the stratovolcano.  These are important and very               different alternative interpretations.  To test the generality of               results near the Villarrica stratovolcano and to distinguish                    between these interpretations, satellite cone lavas associated                  with other stratovolcanoes in the SVZ will be studied. ***//",
