 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, Science Education for Equity Reform, (SEER) is                    a response to demographic trends which show that the                            population of 18-22 year olds in the 1990s will be both                         smaller in magnitude and different in composition.  If the                      needs of the nation are to be met, the demographic data                         affirm that we must remove those barriers which keep females                    and minorities from choosing careers in science and                             engineering.  The two-fold objective of Project SEER is to                      improve, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the science                     instruction at the K-5 levels and, at the same time, to                         achieve a condition of equity which allows full educational                     opportunity for each child regardless of gender, ethnic                         origin, or any other factor which limits achievement. SEER is                   a pilot project to be carried out in the six elementary                         schools of University City, Missouri School District.  This                     demonstration project is destined to serve as a model for                       potential adoption by other school districts that want to                       achieve equitable science learning for all children.                                                                                                            One hundred elementary teachers from University City,                           Missouri will be selected to participate in this program                        which includes a 3-week physics institute for teachers K-5, a                   1-week curriculum institute for teachers K-2 and development                    of curriculum models and activities for grades 3-5 during the                   summer of 1989.  In addition there will be academic year                        physics institutes followed by a 1-week curriculum institute                    for teachers and the refinement of the K-2 curriculum during                    the summer of l990. The Educational Equity Center of the Mid-                   Continent Regional Educational Laboratory (MCREL) will work                     with the American Institute of Physics on this program.                                                                                                         An amount equal to about 20% of the NSF request is being                        cost-shared by University City School district and private                      sector funding.",
