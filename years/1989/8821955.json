 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Scientific revolution\" has many meanings, the most common being                the overthrow of one theory for another.  The \"revolution\"                      concerning the theory of continental drift and plate tectonics is               a recent example of such a revolution.  Much rarer, however, has                been those kinds of global scientific revolutions which radically               alter our view of the world around us.  While there may be more,                four readily come to mind: the Scientific Revolution of the 16th                and 17th Centuries, the Darwinian Revolution, the Einsteinian                   Revolution and the Revolution ensuing from Quantum Theory.  These               revolutions represent not just a change in theories or sets of                  theories, but a radical shift of our views of ourselves and our                 place in the Universe.  Studies of these global revolutions                     consequently remain centrally important for understanding both                  science and human nature itself.                                                                                                                                Dr. Davis is examining the papers of one of the central figures                 in the first scientific revolution, Robert Boyle.  Boyle, second                only to Newton, made lasting contributions to the establishment                 of the mechanical philosophy.  As an experimental scientist and                 aggressive polemicist, Boyle sought to demonstrate the                          philosophical, theological, and scientific deficiencies of the                  Aristotelian, Renaissance and Cartesian systems of nature.  It is               in no small part owing to Boyle's defense of atomism that Newton                and his followers also rejected these other systems.  Despite his               importance, Boyle's unpublished papers have never been analyzed                 as a whole for what they reveal about the development of his                    thought.  Collaborating with Dr. Michael Hunter of the University               of London, Dr. Davis will undertake an analytical study of he                   relationship of Boyle's unpublished and published writings.  The                long term goal is to complete a work which will shed entirely new               light on our understanding of a man whose work can be seen as a                 microcosm of the scientific revolution.",
