 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program supports the work of Scott                        Denmark, of the University of Illinois.  Prof. Denmark's work                   involves examining how a reaction central to organic synthesis                  and biochemistry, the aldol condensation, can result in                         compounds with unique spatial orientations of atoms.  The                       orientation in space of atoms can have profound effects on both                 chemical and biological behavior of molecules, and it is one of                 the challenges of modern organic chemists to understand how                     reactions result in these characteristics.                                                                                                                      The program  has three objectives: (a) the examination of the                   factors controlling stereoselectivity of reactions of                           allylmetals with aldehydes and acetals, (b)  the clarification                  of  the nature of the intermediates in these reactions, and (c)                 the design, synthesis and testing of novel Lewis acids for                      their potential as chiral catalysts. The study  involves                        extensive use of specific model compounds with unique                           stereochemical centers.",
