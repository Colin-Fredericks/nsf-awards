This project sill benefit                  all of the constituencies for the reform of mathematics                         education.  By providing information development and classroom                  application of new standards.                                                                                                                                   The Resources for Mathematics Reform (RMR) CD-ROM will be easy to               use; permit searches configured to meet users' needs; provide                   concise, informative abstracts for each program and chapter or                  lesson; permit printouts of actual teacher and student materials;               span all grades from K-12; be geared to emerging consensus about                what should be learned and taught in mathematics, as embodied in                the NCTM Standards; extend its scope beyond NSF and public-domain               materials; provide information about program implementation and                 use; and take advantage of an extensive dissemination and users                 network.  It will also constitute the first in a series of                      products using different technologies to make exemplary materials               and information accessible to a wide variety of users.",
