 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of                separating companents of fly ash produced by combustion of                      coal into by useful materials by use of nevel electrostatic                     process.  Unburned carbon in the fly ash reduces                                its ability to function adequately as an aggregate in production                of concrete.  The carbon entrained in the fly ash has the                       potential for serving as a low-cost treatment of water or                       wastewater.  The research involves determination of the extent                  to which carbon can be removed from fly ahs, concentrated by                    additional processing, and its adsorptive properties which woul                 determine its usefullness in water and wastewater treatment.                    The proposal leading to this project was submitted in response                  to NSF 88-8, Program Solicitation for Small Business Innovation                 Research.                                                                                                                                                       Many potential uses of fly ash are possible if its properties can               be properly controlled.  This project offers a potential for                    utilizing fly ash, a waste product in plentiful supply, as a                    source of useful materials, reducing costs for disposal of the                  fly ash and avoiding the environmental problems now associated                  with its management.",
