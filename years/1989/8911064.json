 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geographers, demographers, sociologists, and other social                  scientists have clearly documented that both migration and fertility            rates are highly correlated with employment rates, but little attention         has been paid to possible direct relationships between individual and           household decisions to relocate and to have children.  This Research            Opportunities for Women Planning Grant will enable the investigator to          begin a systematic exploration of that relationship by articulating and         refining statistical methods that can be used in a variety of regional          contexts and at different scales.  The investigator also will begin             testing a macro-level model of the linkages between migration and               fertility, using data at the state level.                                            This project will be the first step in what should be a                    significant effort that will enhance both theoretical and empirical             knowledge about these important demographic relationships.  The project         also will provide a superb opportunity for a young female scholar with          an excellent background to further improve her basic research skills.",
