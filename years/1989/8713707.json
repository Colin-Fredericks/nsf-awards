 "awd_abstract_narration": "The past five years have seen a profound escalation in the                      need for large numbers of high quality synthetic peptides in                    the fields of molecular biology, immunology, pharmacology,                      biochemistry, biology, and chemistry.  A major limiting                         factor in these studies has remained the availability, cost                     and purity of the desired peptides.  Although it is currently                   possible, using available manual or automated methods, to                       produce large numbers of peptides (ie., hundreds), the effort                   is so time consuming and costly that to carry out this number                   of syntheses is normally impractical even in well equipped                      laboratories.  Small laboratories and institutions are                          virtually precluded from carrying out research requiring                        large numbers of peptides.  We have recently devised a                          procedure called simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis                        (SMPS), which permits the rapid simultaneous solid phase                        peptide synthesis of large numbers of peptides.  In the                         proposed research SMPS will be optimized and in turn used to                    optimize synthesis protocols.  Upon completion of the                           proposed research it is expected that laboratory personnel,                     even those without specific prior training in peptide                           chemistry, will be able to simultaneously synthesize at least                   100 totally different peptide sequences having excellent                        purity, without the need for automated equipment, in a time                     frame (2-4 weeks) and cost at least 10 times less than                          currently available manual or automated methods.",
