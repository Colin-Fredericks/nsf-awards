 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Ronald Pursell of Pennsylvania State University is                     preparing a comprehensive, systematic study of the species of                   mosses belonging to the family Fissidentaceae, that occur in                    Mexico, the West Indies, Central and South America.  The study is               based primarily on specimens preserved in museums in the United                 States, Europe and Latin America.  At present, over 300 species                 are recognized, although when the study is completed this number                may be reduced by as much as 50%.                                                    After three years of research, approximately 50% of the                    species have been studied.  The project will be completed in an                 additional three years.  The ultimate publication will consist                  essentially of a detailed Introduction (including the                           delimitation of the family, an historical account of the family,                its evolution, geographic limitations and ecology, and the basic                structural features of its member plants) and a Systematic                      Section including keys for the identification of species and                    other taxonomic groups, descriptions and illustrations of all                   species recognized, geographic distribution and the ecologic                    amplitude of each species, and discussion on the relationships of               the species.                                                                         The monograph will summarize all the work published over the               past 188 years on this family of plants in this area.  It will be               used by individuals, both professional scientists and non-                      professionals, to identify representative collections of the                    species.  Moreover, at a time when human activities are                         drastically affecting the survival of many plants, this study,                  when used with similar studies, will be helpful in identifying                  areas rich in endemics and/or rare species that should be                       protected.***",
