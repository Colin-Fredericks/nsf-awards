Dr. Stevens's project is                    concerned with special values of L-functions. These functions are               number-theoretic constructs that are studied by methods from                    complex analysis. Dr. Stevens plans to embed the theory of                      Shintani decompositions for totally real number fields of degree                n into the geometry of the Borel-Serre completion of the                        symmetric space of GL(n), and to use the extra structure afforded               by this geometry and the action of GL(n,Q) on it, to study the                  arithmetic properties of special values of partial zeta                         functions.                                                                           Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                 century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                     century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                       fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                 The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                  rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                    study of Modular and Automorphic Forms is one of the most active.               This field is principally concerned with questions about the                    whole numbers, but in its use of Geometry and Analysis, it                      retains connection to its historical roots.",
