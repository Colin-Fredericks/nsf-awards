 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, to be carried out on the campus of GMI                       Engineering & Management Institute, consists of two parts,                      an intensive three-(3) week summer workshop and nine (9)                        monthly follow-up activities during the school year.                                 Students with high interest and potential will be                          identified and recruited from the schools of Genesee                            County.  Emphasis will be placed on the recruitment of                          minorities and women.  GMI has established two minority                         pre-college science and engineering programs, ASPIRE and                        AIM, with strong participation from school districts within                     the County.                                                                          The workshop will involve a maximum of forty (40)                          students who willcommute daily to GMI, where they will                          participate in activities that involve basic mathematical                       concepts, communication skills, computer science,                               engineering design projects, science investigations, and                        simple research projects.  The activities will focus on                         chemistry as an essential scientific discipline.  A portion                     of the workshop (30%) will involve career awareness                             activities and field trips.  Participants will observe                          scientists and engineers in the research and teaching                           environment.                                                                         The follow-up activities involve nine (9) monthly                          meetings with students and teachers from Genesee County                         schools.  These activities, consisting of dynamic speakers,                     films, field trips and competitive events, are designed to                      motivate and guide interested persons toward science and                        science-related careers.",
