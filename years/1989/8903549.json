 "awd_abstract_narration": "The supercontinent Pangaea, which existed from Late                        Carboniferous through about Middle Jurassic time had a unique and               extreme climate, which is predicted to have been a strong                       monsoonal circulation that reached a maximum during the Triassic.               A monsoonal climate would be expected to have had the following                 features: (1) dry or seasonally dry continental interiors; (2)                  evidence of strong seasonality, especially in low latitudes; (3)                equatorial region that is dry, especially in the east; (4)                      maximum expression of these features in the Triassic.  For the                  purpose of testing the monsoon and alternative hypotheses, data                 on paleoclimatic indicators will be compiled from the literature                and data maps will be constructed for three times during the                    Pangaean interval that have been identified as likely to have                   been key times in the development of the monsoonal circulation.                 Particular attention will be paid to the problems of quality                    control on data and on the heretofore intractable problems of                   quantitative analysis for terrestrial paleoclimatic data.                       Preliminary applications of a numerical climate model to the                    Pangaean paleogeography will be carried out.  This research will                contribute to paleoclimatology and to our understanding of                      climate dynamics by (1) establishing a method for quantitative                  paleoclimatic data analysis; (2) documenting the effects of a                   large land mass on global climate; (3) increasing understanding                 of the dynamics and structure of an extreme paleoclimatic state.",
