 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tritiated proline when injected into the nervous system of cats,                is incorporated preferentially into glial cells. The unusual                    incorporation pattern suggested the existence of a previously                   unrecognized glial-neuronal communication system.  This system                  involves the translocation of molecules from glial cells into                   neuronal soma followed by axonal transport and partial                          redistribution to adjacent glial processes.                                                                                                                     The long-term goals of the research are to characterize the                     molecules involved in the translocation sequence and to                         understand the operations and functions of the system.  These                   studies will utilize anatomical and biochemical methods to                      characterize the preferential incorporation of proline into                     feline glia and to determine the translocation process to                       neurons.  Other studies will document the suitability of the rat                and determine the use of optimal neuronal pathways.  Future                     studies will address questions regarding possible functions of                  the glial-neuronal communication system during neuronal activity                and maturation.                                                                                                                                                 Although neuroscientists agree that brain function is carried out               by combined actions of neurons and glia, the actual mechanisms of               communication and cooperation are poorly understood.  These                     studies are designed to improve this understanding.",
