 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Shankar will investigate techniques for the                      specification, verification, and logical construction of                        hierarchies of protocol layers.  A computer network has several                 layers of protocols, each improving on the services offered by                  the layer below.  A real protocol layer is typically a large                    system of several functions such as connection management,                      multiplexing, data transfer, channel sharing, routing, error                    control, flow control, and multi-access.  Research includes the                 development of service specifications for various protocol layer                interfaces and protocol entity specifications that guarantee the                interface specifications.  The study is intended to achieve                     rigorous understanding of protocol mechanisms essential for                     reliable and efficient internetworking and the exploitation of                  new technologies such as obtaining minimal specifications of                    protocol service and protocol entities that guarantee                           interoperability of different implementations without undue                     constraints, interfacing between protocol hierarchies, and                      dynamic behavior of routing hierarchies.",
