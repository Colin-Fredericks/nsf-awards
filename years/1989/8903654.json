 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the basic sedimentology and taphonomy of limestone                    buildups known in the Fort Payne Formation, a detailed systematic               study of the crinoid fauna (Phylum Echinodermata) will be made.                 The Fort Payne Formation is Lower Mississippian (late Osagean;                  appoximately 350 million years old), and this study will be                     conducted in rocks from south-central Kentucky.  Where these                    rocks are in the subsurface, they are oil and gas producers.                    Because crinoidal remains are the dominant component in the                     limestone buildups, it is vital to document fully their diversity               and to understand their paleoecologic distribution.   This will                 result in a better understanding of the origin and distribution                 of these limestones.                                                                 Specific objectives of the proposed research include 1,                    species-level systematics of the Fort Payne crinoid fauna,                      including documentation of within-species variations from the                   large collections available; 2, determination of the crinoid                    species composition of Fort Payne paleocommunities; 3, evaluation               of the faunal role in the differential development of limestone                 buildups; 4, integration of these data with crinois species                     distributions throughout the midcontinental U.S. in order to                    understand better the regional distributional controls on late                  Osagean crinoids.                                                                    This research will result in the most thoroughly documented                paleontologic study of the enigmatic Lower Mississippian                        Walsortian facies.  Further the resulting knowledge of late                     Osagean crinoids will be one of the most comprehensive data sets                available for Paleozoic macroinvertebrates.  The resulting                      regional synthesis of systematics, facies distribution,                         paleogeography and community paleoecology will be a rich source                 for future research to which fundamental evolutionary and                       paleoecologic questions can be addressed.",
