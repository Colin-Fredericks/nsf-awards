 "awd_abstract_narration": "Simulations of large systems are computation and memory intensive.              However for many critical applications, simulation is the only way to           design high performance and reliable systems.  The wide availability of         distributed processors and multiprocessors opens up the possibility of          carrying out simulations by allocating each process in the simulation           on a different processor, thus, potentially achieving significant               speedups and low memory requirement per processor.  However,                    distributed simulation requires resolution of several problems                  including decentralizing the advancement of clock, collection of                statistics, termination of simulation, analysis of overheads as                 compared with sequential simulation, and optimization of performance.           Unlike previous approaches that incur either too much computation               overhead by using centralized coordination or too much communication            overhead by using a distributed solution, hierarchical decentralized            solutions to problems have been developed in distributed simulation.            The objectives of this project are to explore methods for generating            distributed simulations directly from specification, develop techniques         for improving the efficiency of distributed simulations, design methods         for collecting and analyzing data from distributed simulations, and             carry out experiments on a variety of multiprocessing systems.",
