The Symposium will convene August 27-September 1, 1989                in Kyoto, Japan under the auspices of the International                         Committee on Microbial Ecology of the International Union of                    Microbiological Societies.  This triennial Symposium is the only                meeting of professional scientists that focuses solely on                       microbial ecology.  The goals of the Symposium are to serve as a                forum for the discussion of recent advances in microbial ecology                by scientists from throughout the world, and to identify areas                  that require attention for the advancement of knowledge and for                 the improvement of human well-being.  The objectives of the                     program include:  (1) to bring together young and mature                        investigators in an environment that encourages communication,                  enabling each to benefit from the special knowledge of the                      others; (2) to generate collaboration among investigators from                  different regions of the world; (3) to provide opportunity for                  cross-disciplinary exchanges of refinement of principles and                    practices current in microbial ecology.  Adequate American                      participation in the Symposium is of special importance today                   because advances in microbial ecology relate directly to the                    future capacity of this country to maintain a competitive                       advantage in the agricultural, environmental, and medical                       sciences.",
