 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a ROW planning grant for an initial study of how                American households' participation in credit markets affects                    their decisions regarding spending, saving, and working.  The                   focus is on use of installment credit since default on                          installment contracts result in wealth-reducing repossession of                 the good being purchased.  Household budget surveys from the                    interwar years (when availability of installment credit became                  widespread) is analyzed to ascertain the correlation between                    installment buying and household reliance on more than one wage-                earner or on non-wage income; occupational or industrial                        categories of household workers; saving rate; and debt service to               disposable income ratios.                                                                                                                                       In the Great Depression, consumption accounted for                              disproportionate shares of falls in gross national product.                     Literary evidence asserts indebted households severely reduced                  consumption spending to avoid defaulting on installment                         contracts.  This study provides now-lacking evidence on this                    assertion.  Further, the underlying model of household behavior                 indicates how recent federal tax law changes encouraging home-                  equity over installment debt may affect labor force participation               and household spending decisions.",
