 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal on \"Molecular Analysis of Host Range in Several Rhizo-            bium Species\" between Dr. Steven G. Pueppke of the University of                Missouri, Columbia, and Dr. William J. Broughton of the Laboratoire             de Biologie Moleculaire des Plantes Superieures, Chambesy/Geneva,               Switzerland, is approved by NSF under the US-Switzerland Cooperative            Science Program.                                                                                                                                                The researchers propose to understand how soybean, cowpea, and other            legumes are nodulated by broad host-range rhizobia.  The model microor-         ganisms are rhizobium fredii 257 (researched at Columbia) and rhizo-            bium sp. NGR234 (researched at Geneva).  Using Tn5 mutagenesis, the             investigators already have isolated two unusual mutants of strain 257           that nodulate soybean cultivars not nodulated by the parental strain.           The intend to coordinate analysis of these two mutants with that of             Rhizobium sp. NGR234 to exploit distinctions which can be exploited             to help elucidate the basis of host specificity.                                                                                                                One mutant of strain 257 has Tn5 in the chromosome while the other              has the transposon in the sym plasmid.  The investigators have                  isolated cosmids containing DNA flanking the sites of the Tn5                   insertion, subcloned the fragments of interest, and are mapping them.           This proposal hopes to define the negatively-acting host range genes            contained in these clones and search for counterparts in NGR234.  Dr.           Broughton has isolated a series of positively-acting host range genes           and is defining them physically and genetically.  A second objective            of the collaboration is to seek analogous genes in strain 257.                  Achievement of these objectives will help determine the relative                contributions of positively and negatively acting genes in specifying           host range in broad host-range rhizobia.",
