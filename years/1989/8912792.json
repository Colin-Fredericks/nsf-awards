 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a collaborative project in historical                   demography between two groups of U.S. and Swedish researchers.  The             U.S. group will be led by Dr. Katherine Lynch, Department of                    History, Carnegie Mellon University.  The Swedish group will be                 headed by Dr. Lars-Goran Tedebrand, Department of Historical                    Demography, University of Umea.  The project involves an interdis-              ciplinary study, using  a unique historical-demographic data base               being built at the University of Umea, Sweden.  Research by  group              members, to be undertaken in collaboration with historians and                  statisticians at Umea, will use individual-level vital registration             and household data to test propositions about infant and child                  mortality, changes in the incidence and timing of life-course                   events and other important demographic consequences associated with             the dual processes of industrialization and social modernization in             the nineteenth century.                                                                                                                                         The Demographic Data Base, housed at the University of Umea, is one             of the most important data bases available to historical demo-                  graphers, currently containing information on over 220,000                      individuals, mainly for the nineteenth century.  The value of the               Data Base lies particularly in the fact that it contains a wide                 variety of information on named individuals as they passed through              the events of birth, marriage, death and migration; and, in                     addition, stores information on those same individuals' families.               The Data Base information on individuals, drawn from Sweden's                   nearly unique \"church examination records,\" thus captures both the              longitudinal and cross-sectional features of demographic life much              as modern vital registration and census records do.  In addition to             analyzing the data to develop predictors of infant and early                    childhood mortality, the researchers will exchange innovative                   computer software designed at Carnegie Mellon University to display             and manipulate additional demographic time series data.  Both the               US and Swedish teams are highly qualified to carry out this                     research.  The results are likely to have a substantial impact on               progress in the fields of historical demography and social history,             both from a substantive and methodological point of view.",
