 "awd_abstract_narration": "The largest and most rapidly growing insect collection in                  the southwestern United States, most of the southern United                     States, and northern Mexico is located at Texas A&M University.                 The collection contains approximately 1,000,000 specimens                       representing all insect orders, and it is particularly strong in                holdings of Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, and                             cyclorraphous Diptera.  A substantial portion of this material                  is from the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, a large geographic                    area from which comprehensive collections of insects are scarce.                The collection is known for the quality of its specimens and it                 is widely used as a source of material for systematics research.                Texas A&M University and the Texas Agricultural Experiment                      Station have supported systematics research in general and the                  collection in particular for many years.  However, increased                    insect systematics research at Texas A&M and extensive collecting               activities in recent years have strained the capacity of local                  support to maintain momentum in the growth of the collection.                   This project will provide funding to assist in processing a large               backlog of valuable material, for storage cabinets to provide                   space needed for improved curation of existing holdings, and for                assistance in sorting and determining already prepared specimens.               In combination with support to be provided form the Texas A&M                   University System, these additional resources will enable                       continued growth and utilization of this valuable systematics                   resource.",
