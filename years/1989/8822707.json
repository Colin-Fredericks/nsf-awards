It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectroscopy is essential to chemists and biologists who are                    carrying out frontier research.                                                                                                                                 The Department of Chemistry at Portland State University (a                     Predominantly Undergraduate Institution) will use this award                    given by the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program and the                   Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program to help                      acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer.  The acquisition will                    enhance research actvity in the following areas of chemistry                    and biology:                                                                                                                                                    1) Compounds relevant to membranes for artificial                                  photosynthesis                                                               2) Fluorine-containing low molecular weight compounds and                          polymers                                                                     3) High valent chromium oxidants                                                4) Atmospheric reaction products                                                5) Electron deficient heterocyclic pi-systems                                   6) Fluorine-ligated iron-sulfur clusters in photosystem I                       7) Structure of a small iron-sulfur protein                                     8) Protein thermodynamics probed by denaturation                                9) Structure of calcium-binding proteins using NOE.",
