 "awd_abstract_narration": "Benthic resting eggs constitute an important phase in the                  life history of many coastal planktonic copepods.  The resumption               of development and hatching of resting eggs are of fundamental                  importance to the perpetuation of many populations year after                   year in many areas.  The relative contribution of resting eggs to               recruitment however, is poorly understood largely because we do                 not clearly understand either the conditions that promote the                   accumulation of resting eggs on the sea-bottom or their hatching.               It is very likely that resuspension of the seabed by storms leads               to the resuspension of eggs.  Moreover, since continental shelf                 areas are frequently subject to storms, these could have a major                impact on copecod recruitment.  This research seeks to determine                the bottom stresses that are necessary for eggs to be                           resuspended, and the conditions (e.g. temperture) that permit the               their hatching.",
