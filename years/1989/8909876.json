 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Ornstein, Katznelson, and Adams will investigate                a variety of matters in ergodic theory. Problems in combinatorics               and combinatorial number theory will be attacked using ergodic                  methods. The stability under perturbation of basic ergodic-                     theoretical properties of some specific classical dynamical                     systems is another focus of effort. The investigators will also                 consider smooth conjugacy of differentiable dynamical systems and               its relevance to twist maps. Other topics include Hausdorff                     dimensions of orbit closures, combinatorial structures associated               with equivalence relations, and the ergodic theory of foliations.                    Ergodic theory is concerned with what happens in the long                  run when a transformation of a space is iterated many times. (The               space in question need not be anything particularly elaborate;                  something like a line segment will do.) Via the transformation,                 one can think of the group Z of integers acting on the space, or                of time passing in discrete steps. Continuous time, similarly, is               modeled by an action of the group R of real numbers, called a                   flow. This situation is also of interest in ergodic theory. A                   good example is a geodesic flow on a surface, where points on the               surface are imagined as moving at constant speed along paths of                 shortest distance. A principal goal of research in ergodic theory               is to classify the various sorts of long-run behavior that are                  possible in a given situation. Typically, there will be not too                 many, and all of them will be realizable within an appropriate                  standard model. Fitting ergodic-theoretical phenomena into such                 models is part of the work of this project.  Ergodic theory has                 recently come to play an important role in the study of                         complicated combinatorial structures. The principal                             investigators hope to continue to make contributions in this                    area as well.",
