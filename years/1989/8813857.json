 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Carol A. Venanzi of the Department of Chemistry,            New Jersey Institute of Technology, for collaboration with Jean-Luc             Fauchere of the Department of Biotechnology, Swiss Federal Institute            of Technology, Zurich and Michel Vallotton, Division of                         Endocrinology, University Hospital, Geneva.  The objective of their             research is to obtain an understanding of the relative contributions            of the structural and electrostatic components of molecular                     recognition to the host-guest complexation process.  The model system           to be studied is a cyclic analog of adrenocorticotropic hormone                 (ACTH).  This molecule was chosen because it can act as both a host             (enzyme mimic) and a guest (hormone mimic).  The U.S. investigator              will use molecular modeling techniques combined with molecular                  dynamics simulations to provide information on the molecular                    recognition features of the proposed mimic, such as the orientation             of the catalytic components as compared to chymotrypsin and the                 effect of solvent on conformation.  The Swiss investigators will                synthesize and test the biological activity of the target molecule.             The advantage of the collaboration is that the investigators bring to           the project distinctly complementary skills in computer modelling and           experimental research along with an understanding and an appreciation           of each other's methods.                                                                                                                                        The proposed research addresses a challenging and important area of             molecular chemical physics.  The results will contribute to a better            understanding of the structure and biocatalytic activity of enzymes             by providing information on the mechanism of substrate recognition at           the enzyme active site, as well as information on the requirements              for molecular recognition at the hormone receptor.  The successful              synthesis of enzyme and hormone mimics will contribute greatly to the           creation of cheaper and perhaps better substitutes for these                    biomaterials.",
