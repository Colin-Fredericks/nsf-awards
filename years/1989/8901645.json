For stability problems in collisionless spherical systems, the                  principal investigator intends to modify the so-called                          energy-Casimir method in its Hamiltonian setting so as to                       include inequality constraints.  This method has been proven to                 be successful in stability problems of fluids and plasmas.  The                 immediate goal is to establish the nonlinear stability of                       certain spherically symmetric equilibria which have been                        studied previously by Antonov.                                                       Motivated by recent results on vortex dynamics the                         principal investigator also plans to analyze the stability and                  bifurcation of equilibria and periodic orbits in a symmetric                    Hamiltonian system (with a reversion).  Particular emphasis                     will be placed on stability computations and on the role played                 by reversibility of these systems, in the presence of symmetry.                      Nonlinear stability questions are of fundamental                           importance in stellar dynamics.  The results may be used to                     explain the appearance of spherical galaxies and globular star                  clusters.  Results on symmetric Hamiltonian systems will be                     applicable to a wide range of physical systems possessing the                   same underlying symmetry structure.",
