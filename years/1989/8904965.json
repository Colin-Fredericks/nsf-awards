 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to make an extensive                     series of laboratory experiments on bed configurations produced                 in fine sands by oscillatory flows and combined flows                           (superpositions of oscillatory and unidirectional components)                   over a wide range of moderate to long oscillation periods,                      moderate to large maximum orbital velocities, and small to large                unidirectional current velocities.  The experiments will be made                in a large new combined-flow duct about 15 m long, 1.2 m wide,                  and 0.4 m deep.  The oscillatory component is produced by forcing               water back and forth through a closed horizontal duct between                   open reservoir tanks by means of a piston moving in simple                      harmonic motion, and superimposing a current by pumping water                   from one end of the duct to the other at the same time.                         Comparison of the stratification geometry produced in the                       sediment deposit with that observed in shallow-marine sandstones                in the ancient sedimentary record should lead to fundamental                    advances in the ability to interpret the depositional conditions                of ancient storm-deposited sandstones.",
