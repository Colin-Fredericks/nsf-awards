 "awd_abstract_narration": "Construction of a camera for operation in the 8-10 micron                       atmospheric window has been completed and the laboratory testing                of the instrument is now in progress.  The camera will be used                  for astronomical observations of regions of star formation both                 within our galaxy and in other galaxies.                                                                                                                        Some modifications and improvements will be made to the                         instrument.  A larger format array, which is expected to have                   higher sensitivity, will be installed.  A circular variable                     filter will replace the fixed filters, to allow acquisition of                  narrow band images both in continuum (dust) emission and in                     atomic and molecular features.  The observations will be made                   from the University of California-San Diego/University of                       Minnesota 1.5m telescope at Mt. Lemmon near Tucson, Arizona.  A                 scale of 1 arcsec per pixel will adequately sample the 2 arcsec                 images formed by a combination of diffraction and seeing.                                                                                                       The scientific program will be aimed at achieving a better                      understanding of the star formation process.  Within our galaxy                 no systematic studies of molecular clouds known to be active star               formation regions have yet been feasible due to the large                       observing times required by single detector systems in the                      thermal infrared.  This camera will obtain large area maps in                   reasonable timescales at wavelengths where the sensitivity to                   cool, young sources is high, and obscuration by dust is low.                    Many external galaxies show excess infrared emission (measured                  by the IRAS satellite) which has been attributed to star                        formation induced by galaxy collisions.  The morphology of these                objects can be studied using the camera.  This will reveal                      details of the internal structure of the galaxies.  This                        information is not available from other wavelengths due to dust                 obscuration, and can provide crucial evidence for or against the                galaxy interaction hypothesis possibly giving clues in the                      mechanism which triggers star formation activity.",
