 "awd_abstract_narration": "The form and location of industrial production in the U.S. and             other western nations has changed dramatically in the last few decades.         Traditional methods consisted of concentrated, assembly-line production         with high degrees of vertical integration among firms (now termed               \"fordism\" in recognition of the role of the U.S. automobile                     manufacturer in developing this system early in the century).  This             structure has been supplanted by new modes of \"flexible production,\" in         which firms use operational and locational styles to permit maximum             flexibility in response to rapidly changing patterns of international           demand and activity by their competitors.  These new modes of                   production have been pioneered in newer \"high technology\" industries,           but their impact now is felt in all industrial sectors.  Social                 scientists have examined various facets of this change through a                variety of case studies, but no comprehensive, cross-sectoral and               cross-locational comparison has been made of the impacts of changing            industrial production on urban systems.                                              This project will identify the social and economic bases of major          concentrations of high-technology industries in southern California and         will investigate the impacts of these concentrations on the growth and          geographic structure of the region.  Four specific facets of high-              technology industrial development will be examined in both theoretical          and empirical contexts:  the development and innovation of technology,          the processes of industrial organization, labor markets, and locational         dynamics.  Theoretical work will result in development of a locational          model of high-technology industries, which will be tested through               detailed examination of firms in southern California.  This testing             will include an inventory of all high-technology firms in the region            and detailed analyses of electronics and aerospace industries through           the use of surveys and interviews.  Analyses will be made of specific           locational issues among and between industries, including the presence          of external economies, the extent of vertical integration, and the              organizational and labor market characteristics of firms.  Additional           inquiries will focus on the relationship of industrial development with         the demographic character and educational levels of industrial labor            forces, and on the impacts of industrial change on patterns of regional         growth.  These empirical analyses will consist of standard forms of             statistical and cartographic analysis of extensive data from published          sources and data gathered in original surveys and interviews.                        The benefits of this research will be multi-faceted.  The                  theoretical bases relating industrial development and urban structure           will be enhanced through both expansion of theory and the rigorous              empirical testing of related hypotheses.  Knowledge of the specifics of         high-technological developmental also will be greatly enhanced, greatly         extending our understanding of how such industries grow and function in         general and in southern California, where they have had such profound           impacts on one of the nation's largest and most rapidly growing                 metropolitan complexes.",
