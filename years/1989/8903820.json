 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to analyze quanti-               tatively the magnitude of volume diffusion in compositionally                   zoned garnets and examine the impact that the process of                        diffusion has on the determination of pressure-temperature-time                 paths for metamorphic rocks from medium-grade terranes.                              Specific research goals include 1) development of numerical                models to describe accurately the lattice diffusion of cations in               chemically zoned minerals during, as well as after, growth; 2)                  measuring the change in P-T trajectories caused by diffusion                    during the growth of compositionally zoned garnet; 3) evaluation                of the importance of diffusion to P-T path calculations                         previously obtained from a nappe and dome terrane in west-central               New Hampshire.                                                                       The fundamental goal of this research is to clarify in a                   meaningful way the conditions under which pressure-temperature                  histories can be retrieved from zoned metamorphic porphyroblasts.               In addition, this study will week to improve our understanding of               the effect of volume diffusion on metamorphic parageneses.  It is               anticipated that these results will lead to an improved                         capability for accurately describing the thermo-tectonic behavior               of the crust in orogenic belts.",
