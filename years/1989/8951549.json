 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Williams College Department of Physics is teachnig two optics               courses designed for students who are not majoring in the sciences.             The first course, \"Understanding Light,\" is a one-semester course               introducing the physics of light and emphasizing modern optical                 technology.  Students do 4 lab experiments, including (1) building a            HeNe laser and observing its transverse modes, (2) building a fiber             optics communication link, (3) observing atomic spectra with a                  spectrometer, and (4) making a transmission hologram.  The second               course, \"Light and Holography,\" is an intensive 4 week course given             during our Winter Study Period.  Students do 3 holography lab                   experiments, including (1) making a transmission hologram, (2) making a         reflection hologram, and (3) measuring the deformation of a stressed            object with holographic interferometry.  They also do an independent            final project making a hologram of their choosing.  Through these               appealing lab experiences, the department intends to make courses for           nonscience majors more stimulating.                                                                                                                             The college is matching the NSF funds with an equal amount.",
