 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers in the cognitive and brain sciences are generally                   concerned with mental functioning and the workings of the mind.                 Unfortunately, the cognitive processes that these researchers                   wish to study, such as attention, learning, and memory retrieval,               are not directly observable.  Thus, unlike physicists and                       chemists who have specific instruments to measure observable                    phenomena, cognitive scientists have no direct scales by which to               measure the functions of the brain.                                                                                                                             This project will develop new measurement tools for the study of                mental processes.  In particular, the project will develop a                    scientific method of measurement called multinomial modeling.                   Multinomial models are relatively simple statistical models that                can transform human performance data into measures of cognitive                 factors.  These models have been successful in overcoming                       measurement problems in other areas of science, such as                         statistical genetics.                                                                                                                                           In general, this project will create and test a number of                       multinomial models in crucial areas of human cognition.                         Scientists will then be able to use these models to explore more                effectively many theoretical and practical issues in the areas of               cognitive science and neuropsychology.  For example, multinomial                models may enable us to determine if brain dysfunction, such as                 in schizophrenia, occurs at the encoding stage of information                   processing or at some higher level.  It may be possible to                      discover if the memory deficits associated with old age and                     disease, such as Alzheimer's disease, affect people's ability to                store information or just their ability to retrieve it.  In                     addition, these models will be able to pinpoint the precise                     effects of certain drugs and other disruptive variables on                      different aspects of cognitive functioning.",
