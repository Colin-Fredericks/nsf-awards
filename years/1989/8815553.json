 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Bruce C. Gates of the Center for Catalytic              Science and Technology, University of Delaware, to collaborate in               research with Dr. Helmut Knoezinger of the Institute for Physical               Chemistry, University of Munich, FRG.  They share an interest in                catalysis and surface chemistry, and are collaborating in a study of            new classes of metal catalysts prepared from organometallic                     precursors on basic metal oxide supports.  The precursors they are              using include rhenium, rhodium, osmium, iridium and platinum.  The              supports include magnesium oxide, lanthanum oxide and calcium oxide.            The catalysts include ensembles of mononuclear complexes, robust                anionic metal clusters, and metal aggregates with unique nuclearities           formed by removal of ligands from molecular metal clusters.  After              preparing a variety of supported catalysts, they will determine their           structures and characterize the reactivities of surface bound                   clusters.  They will also experimentally determine their catalytic              activities, selectivities and stabilities for industrially important            test reactions.  The work will be shared based on the complementary             expertise and facilities of the two research groups.  Dr. Knoezinger            has expertise in surface physical chemistry and spectroscopy and Dr.            Gates has worked more with surface organometallic synthesis and                 detailed characterization of catalyst performance using flow-reactor            techniques.  Therefore, the catalysts will be prepared in Delaware              and the analyses and experimental testing will be done in both                  laboratories, depending on where the appropriate equipment and                  available manpower is located.                                                                                                                                  This research will advance fundamental understanding of the                     structures and catalytic activities of metal oxide-supported metal              catalysts having molecular structures.  It may also elucidate the               role of molecular metal clusters in what have heretofore been                   considered conventional supported metal catalysts.  By making the               connection between molecular metal complex catalysts and cluster                catalysts and conventional supported metal catalysts, it will point             the way to possible exploitation of the molecular precursors in the             preparation of novel catalytic materials.",
