 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project by William Jones within the Organic Dynamics                       Program will investigate the chemistry and structure of small                   ring, organic compounds complexed to metals.  The equilibrium                   between allene (two double bonds across three carbons) and                      zwitterionic forms (doubly charged) will be studied. This work                  will provide information about sigma and pi bond strengths.                                                                                                     Small, strained rings complexed to transition metals show quite                 unusual chemical behavior.  For instance, depending on                          substitution, a cyclopropane bonded to an electron deficient                    metal can either open to a pi-allyl complex, or undergo                         alpha-carbon elimination to give a carbene complex.  Both of                    these reactions will be studied with an eye to determining the                  detailed mechanism of the former, the generality of the latter,                 and the factors that cause one to dominate over the other.                      Both cationic and neutral cyclopropylidene complexes will be                    prepared to determine the conditions under which they open to                   complexes of allenes.  It is anticipated that neutral complexes                 may open slowly, and cyclopropylidenes complexed to neutral                     electron deficient metals may be quite stable due to                            cyclopropane's potential to behave as a four electron donor.                    Fe(II) complexes of properly substituted cyclobutanes undergo                   alpha-elimination of carbon to give cyclic carbene complexes.                   The generality of this reaction will be explored, and some of                   the chemistry of these unusual compounds will be studied with                   the intention of preparing iron containing naphthalenes and                     highly strained cationic carbyne complexes.",
