 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ionized hydrogen (HII) regions in our Galaxy present a different                scale of star formation than is easily observed in other                        galaxies.  Extragalactic systems provide unique opportunities for               looking at the largest star forming centers, which are seen as                  giant HII regions containing numerous, sometimes hundreds of,                   hot, early type stars.  In our Galaxy, on the other hand, HII                   regions which are ionized by only one or two massive stars can be               examined in detail.  By comparing studies on both the large and                 small scales, that is other galaxies and our own Galaxy                         respectively, the question of differences in the star formation                 process is addressed.  The nature of the star formation process                 plays an important role in the evolution of a galaxy.                                                                                                           Dr. Hunter is beginning a multi-wavelength observing project to                 investigate the nature of small, optically visible regions of                   ionized hydrogen in our Galaxy to compare with data she has                     previously obtained on star forming regions in external galaxies.               She will use optical, near infrared, and far infrared data to                   measure the stellar content of a sample of small star forming                   regions in our Galaxy.  Observations of the carbon monoxide                     molecule in these same regions will yield information on the                    properties of the neutral gas clouds out of which the stars are                 forming.                                                                                                                                                        This grant is a Career Advancement Award under the Research                     Opportunities for Women (ROW) program.",
