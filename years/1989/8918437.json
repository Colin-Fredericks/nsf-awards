 "awd_abstract_narration": "In sheer numbers, insects are the most successful species on earth.  No         one denies the many beneficial activities of insects as, for example, in        the pollination of economically important crops, the production of silk,        and most recently biological pest control (one insect predating on              another).  Everybody also knows about the potentially devastating               effects of insects.  Insects have been known to wipe out entire crops,          contributing to world hunger.  Insects are also known as the dreadful           bearers of blood borne fatal diseases such as yellow fever, malaria, and        elephantiasis.                                                                                                                                                  Since biblical time (the flight of locust) men have tried to cope with          the undesirable impacts of insects on mankind.  In modern times the most        successful approach has been the use of pesticides; but pesticides - as         we are now learning - have serious undesirable side-effects on man and          animal alike.  For this reason alternatives to insect control are               needed.  The present proposal marks the exploration of a new approach           via attempts to interfere in the normal salt and water budget of the            insect.  This approach will be pursued in the blood-feeding yellow-fever        mosquito (Aedes aegypti).                                                                                                                                       Shortly after mating the female mosquito seeks a bloodmeal.  She needs          blood in order to obtain nutrients and proteins for her eggs.  Having           found a source, the female yellow-fever mosquito gorges herself, taking         a meal 2-3 times her own body weight|  Such a heavy payload prevents the        mosquito from flying away, thereby threatening reproductive success (she        must find a pond to deposit her eggs) and personal calamity (a swat).           To guarantee the former and to avoid the latter, she must maintain              flight capability and maneuverability, namely by quickly eliminating            unwanted weight, in particular the unwanted salt and water portion of           the bloodmeal.  This she does by way of a hormone, the so-called                diuretic, natriuretic hormone.  In the upcoming grant period the PIs            plan to purify and isolate this hormone, learn its structure and attempt        to synthesize it.  This work will be done in the laboratory of a peptide        chemist, Dr. Hayes of Texas A&M University.  At the same time                   Dr. Beyenbach (a transport physiologist) at Cornell University will             study how the kidney in the mosquito works normally and under the               influence of the hormone.  And the laboratory of the insect                     endocrinologist, Dr. Hagedorn (University of Arizona) will investigate          how the hormone is released in the mosquito, where it is made and               stored, and what organs other than the kidney it affects.  Three                potential target sites for pest control via disrupting normal salt and          water balance in the insect will be investigated: 1) by giving synthetic        hormone causing the insect to lose salt and water when they need to be          conserved, 2) by interfering with normal kidney function, e.g.                  preventing the action of the hormone and thereby reproductive success,          and 3) by disrupting the normal feedback loop of salt and water balance         by inhibiting the production or the release of the hormone, when the            insects need the hormone.",
