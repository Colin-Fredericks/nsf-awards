 "awd_abstract_narration": "The debate on the efficacy of rules versus discretion has                       received a great deal of attention in the theory of economic                    policy,  in macroeconomics,  public finance and in trade policy.                But the existing literature has focussed almost exclusively on                  theoretical aspects of this debate.  To date there has been                     virtually no empirical study of how relevant the distinction                    between rules and discretion is in the real world.                                                                                                              Trade policy lends itself particularly well to an empirical                     investigation of these issues,  for two reasons.  First,  the                   theory yields very sharp predictions of how a trade policy chosen               under discretion differs from that chosen under rules.  Second,                 and perhaps more important,  trade policy in the U.S. is                        implemented under a variety of institutional arrangements.  A                   major difference among some of these arrangements is the                        commitment technologies that they provide.  Hence,  by comparing                the policies implemented within these different environments,                   one can examine whether the capacity to undertake binding policy                commitments matters or not.                                                                                                                                     This project represents an empirical exploration into the effects               of government discretion on trade policy decision-making.  The                  theoretical literature on time-consistent trade policy suggests                 that government discretion may be counter productive,  and that                 reliance on a simple set of trade policy rules may be preferred                 to endowing trade policy makers with a high degree of policy                    discretion.  This research proceeds on the premise that tariff                  decisions made in the context of escape clause actions (section                 201 of the United States Trade Act of 1974)  and the                            determination of exclusions from the tariff reductions negotiated               under the Tokyo Round form a natural experiment that can be used                to assess the impact of policy discretion on trade policy                       decisions.  The former decisions were made in an environment in                 which the government possessed a high level of discretion                       relative to the allocation decisions of those factors of                        production affected by the government choice.  The latter                       decisions were implemented only after a substantial time lag,                   and were thus made in a setting in which the government possessed               little discretion relative to the relevant factor allocation                    decisions.  The aim of this study is to analyze differences in                  the government decisions made in each of the two environments,                  and to ask whether or not systematic differences exist which                    would suggest that trade policy discretion leads governments to                 be trapped in sub-optimal time-consistent tariff equilibria.                                                                                                    The answer to this question has very important implications for                 economic policy and for trade policy in particular.  A finding                  that the two environments lead to systematically different                      policies would imply that policies conducted under rules tend to                dominate policies chosen under discretion;  as a consequence a                  institutions providing a commitment technology would be valuable.               The opposite conclusions would be reached if instead the two                    environments led to similar policies or to policies that differed               on dimensions other than those predicted by theory.",
