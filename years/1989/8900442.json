 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU Site program which provides for nine undergraduate                      students with research opportunities in the area of sensor                      technologies is renewed.  The main program is the study of                      sensor-related phenomena in order to generate scientific                        knowledge and to apply this knowledge to sensor development.  The               REU Site will be part of the Center for Sensor Technologies.  The               Center provides the infrastructure for faculty and students to                  collaborate, exchange ideas, co-supervise students, and share                   resources.  Approximately one-half of the students are selected                 from institutions outside the University of Pennsylvania.                       Students are selected by a committee according to the students'                 academic potential, research interest, attitude towards graduate                studies and research opportunities in the mother institution.                   Each selected student will work under close supervision of one or               two faculty members.  The projects are chosen based on their                    educational value, the scientific merit and the prospects for                   continuing involvement after the summer.  Project topics include                optical, mechanical, microstructures and micromachining,                        packaging, neural network based sensors and sensor interfacing.                 Fundamental studies of multi-phase fluid transport in                           photolithographically micro-machined fluidic structures will be                 investigated.  Sensors and VLSI processing techniques for                       efficient optical and acoustical pattern recognition using neural               network concepts will be studied.  An image sensor which is                     modeled after human eye is being designed.",
