 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators propose to study the interactions of key                 nutrient cycling processes in terrestrial ecosystems.  The main                 objectives of this research are to examine the effects of                       different temporal interactions on nutrient availability in                     agricultural ecosystems and to examine the dynamics of these                    interactions within the soil profile.  Specific to the newly                    proposed research are 1) a focus on water as a primary                          determinant of nutrient turnover; 2) a focus on soil pores of                   biological origin as regulators of water movement in the soil                   profile; 3) a focus on specific pathways of N loss from the                     system, and 4) a focus on quantitative modeling.  Hypotheses                    about interactions among processes at several different scales                  will be tested.  Soil lysimeters will be installed for tilled,                  no-tilled, and never tilled agricultural plots.  15N will be used               to examine seasonal dynamics.                                                        Several replicated soil catenas sites will be used to                      address questions related to spatial variation in N turnover for                plants, microbial biomass and inorganic N pools.  Initially at                  these sites the PI's will track wetting fronts, root turnover,                  and soil solution concentrations of biologically important ions.                Simulation modeling will be used to build a quantitative                        predictive models of how these processes interact to regulate                   nutrient availability to plants in a landscape perspective.  The                investigators are well qualified to perform the proposed research               and the facilities at the Kellogg Center are more than adequate.",
