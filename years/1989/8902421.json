 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. T. Douglas Price, with a team of American and Danish                        collaborators, will conduct two years of preliminary                            archaeological research to set the groundwork for a major, long                 term project.  The team will undertake archaeological survey and                limited excavation in the Saltbaek Vig region of eastern Denmark.               This area, typical of southern Scandinavia, is known to contain                 sites from the \"Mesolithic\" (terminal hunting and gathering) and                \"Neolithic\" (early farming) periods.  It has excellent                          preservation of archaeological remains.  During two field                       seasons, the team will initiate an archaeological survey to                     locate and identify unknown prehistoric sites.  They will also                  record museum and amateur collections to define and characterize                assemblages that are already known, and they will conduct                       paleoenvironmental studies in the area.  These investigations                   will constitute the first systematic survey for Stone Age sites                 in Denmark, help to document changes in sea level, temperature                  and vegetation, and establish the chronology and distribution of                known sites, as the baseline for further investigation.                                                                                                         Approximately 5,000 years ago, Neolithic farmers appear suddenly                in southern Denmark, and they rapidly replace the Mesolithic                    hunter-gatherer occupants.  While this fact is clear, the                       mechanisms involved in this transition are little understood.  It               is not known to what extent resident hunters and gatherers were                 replaced by new populations or whether these groups rapidly                     changed their subsistence practices when new techniques, plants,                and animals were made available to them.  It seems that domestic                plants and animals were slow in coming to Denmark, but once they                appeared, a rapid transition ensued.  Dr. Price and his                         colleagues will examine this change and try to understand the                   mechanisms involved.                                                                                                                                            The transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture                        constitutes perhaps the single most important advance in human                  prehistory.  Within very short periods of time, many populations                were exposed to a new mode of subsistence and underwent rapid                   social transformation.  By understanding this process,                          anthropologists can gain new insight into the plasticity of human               social organization and the mechanisms involved in rapid social                 change.  This research will provide insight into societies in                   isolated parts of the world who today are undergoing this same                  transformation.",
