 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ravens are solitarily-breeding birds, which defend year-round domains           against other ravens, and whose 4 to 5 young disperse by fall.  Yet,            very noisy groups of usually 20 to 40 ravens sometimes aggregate at             food bonanzas such as animal carcasses.  Although it sometimes takes            months for a large group to arrive, other baits are visited by more             than 30 ravens the day after they are discovered.  Ravens are quite             rare and forage solitarily.  The carcasses are hidden and the birds             noisy.  Do they help each other find food?  If so, they probably are            not helping family members, the conventional explanation.                                                                                                       Over the last four winters, Dr. Heinrich has found that specific calls          that ravens give at baits are powerful attractants of other ravens,             that these calls act only at close range, and that the aggregating              birds are primarily juvenile ravens that come at dawn directly from a           communal roost where they convene at night.  He now wishes to discover          how information is transferred at the roost and what the consequences           are for those birds that provide the information.  Experiments will be          carried out with communally-roosting ravens in a large outdoor                  enclosure built into the forest at Dr. Heinrich's study site in Maine.          Dr. Heinrich will try to learn how sharing with others benefits the             raven doing the sharing.  Active recruitment to share food with                 strangers has not previously been demonstrated for any wild animal.             Furthermore, the mechanism of recruitment from a communal roost has             never been experimentally examined.                                                                                                                             This innovative research will contribute to our understanding of the            conditions under which cooperation is an adaptive behavioral strategy.",
