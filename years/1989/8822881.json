 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                      metallic Chemistry program, Karl M. Kadish of the University of                 Houston will investigate the electron transfer reactivity and                   spectroscopic properties of a wide variety of metalloporphyrins.                Metallophorphyrins are model compounds for numerous metallo-                    proteins and enzymes such as hemoglobin, chlorophyll and                        vitamin B-12 and their study, especially redox behavior and                     electron transfer mechanisms, is important for understanding                    the modes of action of these bioinorganic systems.                                                                                                              A broad based selection of monometallic, bimetallic and                         trimetallic metalloporphyrins will be examined by the usual                     electrochemical methodologies as well as by UV-visible, FTIR and                ESR spectroelectrochemistry of the in situ products and/or                      intermediates produced in each electrode reaction. Stable                       electrooxidation/reduction products will be isolated and                        characterized by usual methods. Special emphasis will be placed                 on metal-carbon and metal-metal bonded metalloporphyrins as                     well as on metalloporphyrins in high and low oxidation states                   and those with diatomic molecules as ligands. Water soluble                     porphyrins will be investigated in aqueous and non-aqueous                      media as will be porphyrins in micelles.",
