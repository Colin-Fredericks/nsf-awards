 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines an approach for investigating market                     institutions using an extension of the highly influential                       experimental methods developed by the principal investigator.                   His past results have helped to define the field of experimental                economics and have substantially contributed to our understanding of            market design and structure.  The current proposal seeks funding to             extend this work into areas of central interest to the DRMS program,            including decisions about pricing and supply made by real-world                 concerns and decisions about the effects of changes in incentive                structures on institutional behavior.  These extensions are likely to           be significant, both because they represent a sensitivity to                    behavioral concerns on the part of researchers traditionally                    interested in economic theory and because they promise to extend our            knowledge of an important class of institutions that combine                    decentralized decision making with centralized optimization models.             The project should lead to new theoretical insights, by focusing on             the design of institutions and exchange structures using innovative             auction mechanisms, and it should lead to new applied insights, by              extending knowledge of markets derived in laboratory settings to                real-world case studies of natural gas pricing and utility networks.",
