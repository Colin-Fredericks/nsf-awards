 "awd_abstract_narration": "The spawning area and oceanic migratory cues for                           American and european eels have long remained enigmatic.                        Because young eel larvae are concentrated immediately to                        the south of the North Atlantic Subtropical Convergence in the                  Sargasso Sea, it is hypothesized that mature eels cease                         migration and spawn near this front and use physical or                         biological features of the front for orientation.  This                         research will directly test 1) whether maturing adult                           American eels are concentrated in, or immediately to the                        south of, the frontal zone, and 2) how the fine-scale                           vertical and horizontal distributions of adults are                             related specifically to characteristics of the frontal                          zone and adjacent waters.                                                                                                                                            Quantitative hydroacoustic sampling will be used to                        identify echoes of appropriate strength to be eels, and to                      map their distributional patterns and densities.  Aimed                         midwater trawling, video from a remotely operated vehicle,                      traps baited with mature captive eels, and fine-scale                           sampling of eggs and newly hatched larvae will be used to                       verify whether targets are actually eels.  Hydroacoustic                        data, midwater trawling, and profiles of temperature and                        salinity will be used to characterize the biological and                        physical features of the front.                                                                                                                                      This research links open-ocean spawning of a                               physiologically unique, long-distance migrating fish to a                       specific oceanographic feature.",
