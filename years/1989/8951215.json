 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to provide state-of-the-art instruction is          computer interfaced high performance liquid chromatography and gas              chromatography.  This project allows the expansion of the capabilities          of Central Florida to teach the principles and practices of modern              chromatographic separation techniques.  Student interest in the                 laboratory is raised to a high level because of the use of                      microprocessor controlled HPLC interfaced to computers.  This equipment         is used in organic, analytical, and biochemistry laboratories.                  Students are better prepared for both industrial positions as well as           graduate school as a result of applying these techniques in the                 laboratory.                                                                                                                                                     The university will match the award with an equal amount of funds.",
