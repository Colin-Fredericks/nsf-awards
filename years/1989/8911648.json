 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative study aims to investigate the dynamics of                    two interrelated aspects of the life course -- marriage and                     childbearing -- by examining entry into marriage, entry into                    parenthood, and subsequent childbearing.  It will focus                         especially on how these transitions vary with time (e.g.,                       age, marital duration, ages of children, historical time) and                   seeks answers to three broad questions:  (1) What earlier and                   current experiences influence an individual's marital and                       fertility behavior? (2) Do earlier experiences have enduring                    direct effects, or do individuals react primarily to their                      present situation?  More generally, in what ways do effects                     of previous experiences vary over the life course?  How do                      answers to these questions vary over the recent historical                      past? The project will utilize local hazard models.   These                     models entail two significant innovations:  they let one                        estimate time variation in the hazard rate without making                       implausible assumptions about its parametric form, and they                     let one test hypotheses about time dependence in the effects                    of covariates.  The proposed research bears on a number of                      important policy issues.  For example, social policies are                      increasingly directed towards family concerns such as the                       growing prevalence of children born out of wedlock and the                      increasing numbers of female-headed households.  Although                       recent studies by social scientists have documented the                         detrimental consequences of growing up in a single-parent                       family structure relatively little is known about the long-                     term effects.  Yet differences in the nature of these long-                     term effects may suggest markedly different policy actions.                     Thus family policies appropriate if the effect of single-                       parenthood is large and relatively constant as individuals                      grow older may differ substantially from policies appropriate                   if the effect declines as individuals grow older.  Still                        other policies may be appropriate if effects vary according                     to the ages and durations in which a child is exposed to a                      single-parent family structure.  The study will analyze these                   and related forms of age variation using innovative                             methodologies, which will clarify the age-varying effects of                    individual-level attributes and social circumstances on an                      individual's marital and fertility behaviors.",
