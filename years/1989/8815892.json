Capaldi             of the University of Oregon and Prof. Takayuki Ozawa of the University          of Nagoya, Japan.  Participants will meet in Honolulu, Hawaii,                  December 4-6, 1989 to exchange recent research results and promote              future joint research projects.  The seminar will deal with the                 biogenesis of the mitochondria, mitochondrial diseases, and in                  particular the role of mitochondrial DNA in human diseases.                                                                                                     Research in this field has progressed rapidly, but is usually conducted         and reported along narrow disciplinary lines.  This seminar, on the             other hand, will bring together biochemists, geneticists, molecular             biologists, and clinicians in an attempt to find common threads,                related to mitochondrial genetic variations, in the propagation of a            variety of human diseases.  This interdisciplinary and international            discussion of some of the latest research results in this area could            have important implications in medicine.",
