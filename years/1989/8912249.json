 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Colorado's Mountain Research Station is one of                the nation's outstanding biological laboratories.  The facility                 supports research in biology, geology, geography and climatology.               It is both a national resource used extensively by researchers                  from a variety of agencies and institutions and an important                    asset to the faculty and graduate students of the institutes and                departments of the University of Colorado.  Since its beginning                 in 1914 the Station has added signifcantly to man's understanding               of biological and physical processes in the alpine environment.                 The Station served as a major site for the International                        Biological Program, and is now a Long-term Ecological Research                  site for the National Science Foundation.  An extensive data base               has resulted from these and other programs, including the                       Mountain Climate Program that the Station has operated                          continuously since 1952.                                                                                                                                        The project provides funding to purchase, install, and equip a                  pre-formed modular laboratory building.  The building will be                   installed at 3,540 m on the alpine tundra of Niwot Ridge, site of               the Niwot Ridge Long-term Ecological Research program.  The                     Tundra Laboratory will facilitate research in the Niwot Ridge                   area by providing shelter for researchers and instruments from                  the alpine climate.  It will provide a refuge from the frequent                 summer electrical storms, hail, cold winter temperatures, and                   extreme winds that characterize the Niwot Ridge weather.  It will               make possible a variety of types of research that are not                       currently feasible.  The Tundra Laboratory will be solar heated,                highly insulated, and equipped with photovoltaic system to                      provide electrical power.  It will support research in biology,                 geology, and climatology.",
