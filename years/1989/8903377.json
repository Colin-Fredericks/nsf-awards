 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wing and two graduate assistants will analyze a large series                of faunal and floral remains recovered from archaeological sites                in the Caribbean.  Included in this sample are materials from                   Haiti, Jamaica, the Virgin Islands, Nevis, Antigua, Barbados and                the Bahamas.  In particular, the team wishes to reconstruct                     subsistence practices across this wide range of islands, see how                they changed over time, and to examine the role played by                       domesticated and captive wild species.  To accomplish this,                     analysis will be conducted on assemblages currently curated at                  the Florida State Museum as well as other institutions in the                   United States.                                                                                                                                                  The Caribbean is a particularly interesting region for such a                   study, because no indigenous species were domesticated in this                  region and all are outside introductions from the South and                     Central American mainlands. In regions where domestication takes                place, it is extremely difficult to determine the point in time                 when the shift from wild to domesticated occurs.  In the                        Caribbean, however, such is not the case, and it thus should be                 possible to determine just when different domesticates enter the                diet and then trace their effects over time.                                                                                                                    This research is significant because it will provide insight into               one of the most important changes in human prehistory:  the shift               from a hunting and gathering way of life to one based on                        domesticated plants and animals.  It will allow researchers not                 only to study changes in subsistence practice but also broader                  alterations in social organization.  The study will also increase               our understanding of how cultures change, and, hopefully, help us               predict the potential effects when improved species are                         introduced in less developed areas of the world.",
