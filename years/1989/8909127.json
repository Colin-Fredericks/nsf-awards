 "awd_abstract_narration": "The P.I. will try to determine analytically the receptive field sizes           and the nature of the map from the stimulus to the cortical layer in a          class of Hebbian neural network models.  In particular, he proposes a           generalization of Cooper's network model and shows that it always               gives rise to continuous maps if certain constraints are satisfied.             Other models to be studied include Amari's network in two dimensions,           and an extension of Linsker's model.  Highly discontinuous maps occur           if the cortical lateral interactions are sufficiently plastic as in             Edelman's model, giving rise to neuronal groups.  The analysis will             provide further insight into the plasticity of neural systems.                                                                                                  The P.I. will also try to extend the Hebbian models the treatment of            control and change of coordinate problems which have been successfully          tackled with feed.forward networks with non.local synaptic rules.               This will first be done using simulations of a sensory.motor system             with two Hebbian networks working together. He will also show how the           encoding of the input and output affects the performance.  This will            lead to more robust control systems implementable with less human               effort.",
