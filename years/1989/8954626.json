 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create and research a computer-based curriculum               for probability and statistics targeted primarily for the high                  school.  The development and evaluation of the materials will be                based on past and ongoing research of student conceptions of                    probability and statistics.  The curriculum will focus on the                   development of concepts, many of which have proven difficult to                 teach in standard courses.                                                                                                                                      The program will consist of a software package together with a                  set of laboratory activities organized into three modules,                      \"Chance\", \"Chance Plus Rules\", and \"Chance Plus Structure\".  In                 the majority of these labs, students will use the computer to                   build sampling models, draw large random samples, and analyze the               resultant data.  These computer simulations will provide the                    empirical data against which students will evaluate their                       intuitive predictions and theories.   Students will eventually                  build models to study complex phenomena consisting of both                      probabilistic and deterministic components.                                                                                                                     Small components of the curriculum will be evaluated and revised                based on clinical interviews with individual students.  Larger                  components will be tested in a number of sites involving a                      diversity of student populations.",
