 "awd_abstract_narration": "The macrodykes of the Kangerdlugssuaq area, East Greenland                 are among a large number of tholeiitic intrusions emplaced into                 Archean crust and Tertiary volcanic rocks along the East                        Greenland margin during the initial stages of Tertiary rifting of               the North Atlantic basin.  These intrusions are spectacularly                   exposed in the glaciated terrain along the Blosseville Coast and                preserve evidence of complex interaction with their volcanic,                   sedimentary and gneissic host rocks.  The available chemical                    data on these intrusions indicate that these magmas were                        selectively contaminated by components of the lower crust and                   hydrothermally altered mafic volcanics and that magmatic                        processes led to chemical stratification within these intrusions.               Various scales and modes of crustal contamination are revealed                  along the intrusive contacts.  These exposures permit detailed                  structural and chemical study of the hybridization process.                     Field and geochemical studies of these intrusions are proposed                  to assess the roles of fractionation and assimilation in the                    chemical evolution of these magmas and appropriate models will                  be developed to describe these relations as constrained by                      experimental phase equilibria and kinetic data obtained using                   natural materials of the macrodykes.  The results from this                     \"case study\" will be used to evaluate the role of crustal                       contamination during chemical evolution of associated gabbroic                  complexes and contemporaneous East Greenland basalts and place                  constraints on the source regions for these magmas.",
