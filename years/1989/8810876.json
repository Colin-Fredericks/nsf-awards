 "awd_abstract_narration": "The particles causing absorption and scattering in the                  atmosphere are mostly nonspherical.  While the assumption of                    \"equivalent spheres\" appears adequate in some applications in                   remote sensing, it could be woefully inadequate in others, such                 as lidar backward scattering.                                                           Professor Bohren has been experimenting with approximate                methods which directly treat particles of arbitrary shape.  One                 such method is the Purcell-Pennypacker or coupled dipole method,                in which a particle is approximated by a lattice of dipoles small               compared with the wavelength but still large enough to contain                  many atoms; each dipole is excited by the incident radiation                    field and the fields of all the other dipoles.  Under this award,               Professor Bohren will continue his work on reformulating the                    coupled dipole method so as to decrease limitations on applicable               particle size and refractive index and increase computational                   efficiency, and on experimenting with embedding exact theories in               the coupled dipole method thereby adding to the stock of hybrid                 theories.",
