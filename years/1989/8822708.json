 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ten undergraduates will be selected to participate in research                  projects on the Juneau Icefield, Alaska.  For 40 years, research,               emphasizing geology, glaciology, geophysics, glaciometeorology,                 geobotany and surveying, has been conducted on this icefield.                   With cooperation between the University of Idaho's Glaciological                and Arctic Environmental Sciences Institute and the Foundation for              Glacier and Environmental Research, this research/educational                   activity aims at a total systems study of one of North America's                largest icefields.  It is a total involvement program,                          representing a seven days a week immersion in on-going and new                  research projects.  Under supervision of professors of unique                   experience, drawn from the University of Idaho and other                        universities, each undergraduate will select a research project                 and be encouraged to exercise as much independent judgment and                  initiative as possible in its development.  Undergraduates                      selected will be earth science students who demonstrate scholarly               aptitude, motivation, and research potential.  The staff will be                available throughout the season for advice and help, including                  lectures, seminars and site specific instructions in methodologies              to insure an effective research experience.",
