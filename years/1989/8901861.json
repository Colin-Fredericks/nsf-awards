 "awd_abstract_narration": "The notion of interpolation indicated by the title of                      Professor Slodkowski's mathematical research project may be                     explained as follows. Mathematical objects of many sorts                        frequently come not singly but in whole families, individual                    members of which are located by specifying the value of a                       parameter. (For instance, a famous family of Banach spaces is                   indexed by the set of real numbers greater than or equal to one,                with plus infinity thrown in for completeness.) The general                     problem of interpolation is: given members of the family located                by extreme values of the parameter, fill in all the rest in some                natural, optimal way. The particular interpolation problems                     addressed by this project have fundamental implications for                     mathematical analysis.                                                               More specifically, these problems have to do with                          multivariable complex interpolation theory and some related                     aspects of complex convexity. They are divided into three broad                 categories. The problems in the first group deal with the                       interpolation of infinite-dimensional spaces, regularity                        questions, and interpolation of convex and polynomially convex                  sets. The second category of problems concerns polynomially                     convex hulls. The third has to do with multifunctions that                      satisfy analogues of the function-theoretic properties of                       analyticity and harmonicity.",
