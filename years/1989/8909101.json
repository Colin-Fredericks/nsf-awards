 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the process of high energy beam welding.  The           first objective is to develop a realistic mathematical model which              includes all of the important physics -- keyholing, nonequilibrium              vaporization and subsequent vapor expansion, convection within the              liquid region, and conduction within the solid region.  The second              objective is to develop a more efficient numerical scheme for                   computation.  To achieve this objective, a modular approach will be             employed.  Different methods best suited for each specific region are           to be used.  Within the solid region the boundary element method will           be used to solve for the heat transfer.  Boundary layer theory will be          applied to model the convection within the melt region.  The                    nonequilibrium vaporization will be modeled with a Mott-Smith type              solution.  The subsequent vapor expansion will be modeled by a one-             dimensional gas dynamic equation.  These different regions are to be            combined together by matching boundary conditions along the solid-              liquid and liquid-vapor interfaces.  The matching of boundary                   conditions along the solid-liquid interface determines its shape,               hence the shape of the molten region.  The matching of boundary                 conditions along the liquid-vapor interface determines the keyhole              shape.                                                                                                                                                          It is expected that this technique will be computationally efficient            and will provide more realistic predictions of the weld penetration,            the molten shape, the cooling rate and the heat affected zone.                  Experiments will be performed to verify the mathematical model.",
