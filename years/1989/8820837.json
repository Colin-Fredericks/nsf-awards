 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate engineering curricula in the U.S. require issues                  of engineering ethics to be addressed.  Engineers and the                       engineering profession recognize that students need to learn how                to use and assess available information in making ethical                       decisions, and how to test and develop their own perspectives on                professional ethics.  They need to develop the thought processes                necessary to integrate information with acceptable professional                 \"norms\" of behavior, to make ethical decisions.  Yet, surveys                   demonstrate little in the way of formal or systematic approaches                to the development and testing of new curricula or teaching                     methods.  This project will develop and test annotated case                     studies, with accompanying commentaries and bibliographies, in                  print and software form, for classroom use. Special effort will                 be made to develop multiphased cases, sensitive to organizational               contexts and to the importance of thinking through the likely                   outcomes of initial decisions for later decisions that also call                for ethical reflection.  Workshops for engineering faculty at WMU               will help them develop effective ways of meeting the ethics                     requirement of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and                      Technology.  Project results will be available for national                     dissemination.                                                                                                                                                  This project addresses an important issue in a unique way.  The                 research team and collaborators are interdisciplinary and well                  qualified to collaborate.  Further effort is likely to continue                 beyond the duration of this award.  The project is designed well;               appropriate testing and dissemination are planned.  University                  support is good.  An award in the amount of $124,977 is therefore               recommended.",
