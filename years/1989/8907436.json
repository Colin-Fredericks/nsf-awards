 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Minority Research Initiation award is for the support                 of Professor Baker's work on nonselfadjoint operator algebras. He               is particularly interested in subalgebras of approximately                      finite-dimensional C*-algebras (resp. von Neumann algebra                       factors) that play a role analogous to that of the upper                        triangular matrices in a full matrix algebra. The problems he                   will pursue have mainly to do with classification, isomorphism                  invariants, and isometric versus algebraic isomorphism.                              The operators that lie at the heart of this project may be                 thought of as a species of enriched numbers. They obey the same                 laws of arithmetic as numbers with two notable exceptions, namely               that the result of multiplication depends on the order in which                 the factors are taken, and not every nonzero operator has an                    inverse. Mathematical analysis knows only two number systems, the               real and complex, but there is an immense variety of operator                   algebras. Situations unsuitable for numerical representation can                often be represented in some fashion by operator algebras, thanks               to the greater degree of flexibility available with the latter.                 The price for this is that understanding the structure and                      classification of operator algebras requires considerable effort,               as for instance the work to be undertaken in this project.",
