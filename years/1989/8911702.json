Eisenhower's Science Advisers and               National Security Policy.\"                                                                                                                                      Mr. Damm, under the direction of Professor Hogan, is undertaking                doctoral dissertation research into the history of President                    Eisenhower's science advisers and their influence on national                   security policy making during the 1950's.  The research is taking               place at the Eisenhower Library in Abilene Kansas and at the                    National Archives in Washington D.C.  The information obtained                  from these two depositories, together with information garnered                 from current research in contemporary periodical literature on                  science and national security issues, will be used to develop a                 corporatist analysis of Eisenhower's science advisers, showing                  how professional and institutional ties affected their outlook                  and performance.  This project will provide the first detailed                  historical study of the role of Eisenhower's science advisers in                shaping national security policy, and will utilize an important                 set of records neglected to date:  the Records of the                           President's Science Advisory Committee.  This project will also                 illustrate an important theme in the development of the Cold War                and the rise of the \"national security state\" that is still                     relevant today:  the permanent mobilization of American science                 and scientists.  Finally it will highlight one of the most                      important trends in modern American history:  the exercise of                   public power by private elites.",
