 "awd_abstract_narration": "The early Cretaceous was an interval of geologic time that                 witnessed the diversification of mammals and flowering plants,                  and the first extinctions leading to the disappearance of                       dinosaurs.  Vertebrate fossils of this age are not common in                    North America, and Dr. Dale Winkler proposes to excavate and                    prepare an important collection of early Cretaceous fossils from                north-central Texas.  The specimens of dinosaurs are                            extraordinarily well-preserved, representing a variety of taxa in               a range of growth stages.  Quantitative analysis of development                 will be pursued following the collection and curation phases of                 the project.  Amphibians, other reptiles, and mammals are also                  represented at the targeted localities.                                              The proposed research has the potential to fill an important               gap in our knowledge of vertebrate evolution.  The excellent                    preservation of the vertebrates in this area will illuminate both               the details of growth in several dinosaurs and the diversity of                 the vertebrate assemblage as a whole.  The results of this work                 will be of interest to paleontologists, paleoecologists, and                    evolutionary biologists in general.",
