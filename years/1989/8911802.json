 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will work on two projects.  The                 first project is concerned with inference for nonstationary time                series.  The main objective is to study the consistency and                     efficiency of the model selection procedures that are either                    based on information criteria or on the predictive least squares                principle.  The second project is concerned with the inference                  for nonlinear time series.  The main objective is to establish a                unified estimation theory for the nonlinear autoregressive model                and a general computation method for its functionals.                           Nonlinearity tests and conditions for stationarity are also                     considered.  Since in applications the problems in general are                  nonstationary and nonlinear, these projects will contribute not                 only to the field of statistics, but also to other branches of                  science.",
