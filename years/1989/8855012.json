 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CSRA High School Student  Science Research Program                     is a 6 week summer program for rising high school juniors and                   seniors from the 18 county Savannah River Area of South                         Carolina and Georgia.  This program is an expansion of a                        pilot program recently completed this past summer.  For the                     proposed program, participants will be 18 highly motivated,                     talented students who show a strong interest in the sciences                    and who have been nominated by two teachers (one of whom is a                   science teacher).                                                                    For 6 weeks students will carry out an independent                         project, but on a collaborative basis with individual                           scientists who will act as mentors.  Each student will learn                    various aspects of research and experience first hand active                    research and development activities.  The intent is to allow                    the student independence in pursuing his/her project while                      providing sufficient supervision to ensure proper development                   of a sound study.  The fields of study the students will                        choose from will be microbiology, ecology, environmental                        science, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering and                       computer science.                                                                    At the end of the program the students will be required                    to write a formal report on their research project and submit                   it for presentation at either the Georgia or South Carolina                     Junior Academy of Sciences.  Students will also be required                     to present their reports to their high school science class                     or science club.",
