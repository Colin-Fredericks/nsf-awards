The project will use remote sensed imagery                    together with ethnographic field data to investigate the manner                 in which increased agricultural production for cash markets                     affects land use and the exploitation of tropical forest                        resources.  The methods include a survey of seven villages along                a small river to determine population density, land use patterns,               and market production, and intensive ethnographic interviewing to               establish the \"native models\" for culturally appropriate land                   use.  Satellite imagery will be analyzed to determine the degree                of fit between the natives' understanding of ecological processes               and changes as detected from space.                                                                                                                             This research is important because the Amazon forest is one of                  the most valuable ecological resources on the planet.  In order                 to learn how to deal with changes we must understand how the                    native people who live there use the natural environment.  This                 sort of research, which compares native strategies with                         objectively observed outcomes, can accomplish that understanding.",
