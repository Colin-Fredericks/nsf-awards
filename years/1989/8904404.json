This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic, corporate,               and government cooperation in the support of basic research in                  the mathematical sciences.                                                           This equipment will be used to support five projects in the                Department of Mathematics at the University of Colorado at                      Denver: Multilevel Methods for Transport Models, directed by T.                 Manteuffel; Asynchronous Fast Adaptive Composite Grid Methods for               Parallel Computers, directed by S. McCormick; Multilevel                        Reconstruction Algorithms, directed by W. Briggs; Fast Solvers                  for the p-Version Finite Element Method, directed by J. Mandel;                 and Flows in Heterogeneous Porous Media, directed by T. Russell.",
