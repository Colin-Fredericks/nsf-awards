 "awd_abstract_narration": "The FASEB Conference on Ubiquitin and Intracellular Protein                     Degradation will bring together scientists studying the different               systems which regulate protein breakdown within the cell as well                as those studying ubiquitin genes, their expression and their                   potential regulatory roles in cell metabolism.  Ubiquitin was                   first isolated and characterized about 15 years ago as a major                  protein extract with strong mitogenic activity.  Based on                       specific antibodies, its presence was detected in many biological               species.  Its sequence of 76 amino acids was determined from                    several species and shown to be surprisingly conserved.  The                    purified ubiquitin was found not to be a mitogen but its first                  function was detected when it was identified as the cofactor                    required in an ATP-dependent pathway for degradation of proteins.               Until recently, this was ubiquitin's only apparent role in the                  cell.  However, the isolation of genes encoding ubiquitin                       revealed additonal sites for its function - in particular in DNA                repair and ribosomal RNA synthesis.  A role in DNA metabolism had               been suggested from the early detection of ubiquitin sequences                  covalently linked to histone H2A and H2B in interphase chromatin.               Similar ubiquitin-conjugates have been found in insect muscle                   actin, in cell surface receptors, in virus structural proteins                  and in cytoskeleton proteins.                                                                                                                                   An increasing number of scientists from widely divergent                        disciplines are studying the role of ubiquitin in conjugates,                   their relationship to the ATP-dependent proteolytic degradation                 system (which has been found essential for normal cell growth and               metabolism), the factors that regulate expression of ubiquitin                  and the meaning of the unusual and unique organization of                       ubiquitin genes.  This conference will bring these investigators                together in an atmosphere that will provide meaningful exchange                 of the latest developments in these areas of research which will                contribute to our understanding of basic cell functions.",
