When a tsunami (a long wavelength                                   sea wave generated by an earthquake)                                            encounters a coastline, severe damage may                                       result due to flooding, to the flotation of                                     large objects, and to the impact of the wave                                    or floating objects with constructed                                            facilities.                                                                                                                                                     The parameter that is important in evaluating                                   the potential damage to a coastline is the                                      wave runup.  Very little useful scientific or                                   engineering information exists on the runup                                     of tsunamis.  The objective of this study is                                    to investigate some aspects of this complex                                     phenomenon, beginning with the study of the                                     runup of a cnoidal wave, which is one                                           quintessential model for tsunamis.                                                                                                                              This investigation involves analytical                                          modeling combined with laboratory experiments                                   in a new 100 foot long wave tank.  By                                           comparing the results from these two                                            approaches with results from numerical                                          simulations of the Boussinesq equations, an                                     attempt is made to determine the relative                                       effects of dispersion, nonlinearity, and                                        possibly dissipation, leading to more concise                                   information on the validity of different                                        models.  This is followed by a preliminary                                      laboratory investigation to determine the                                       forces associated with cnoidal wave motion on                                   simple structures, such as cylinders and                                        plane surfaces, close to the shoreline.                                                                                                                         Potential applications of these fundamental                                     studies to tsunami engineering are in the                                       calibration of numerical models which are                                       frequently used in evaluating the flooding of                                   coastline areas prone to tsunami damage, and                                    in the operation of tsunami early-warning                                       systems.",
