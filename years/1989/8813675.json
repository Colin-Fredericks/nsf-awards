 "awd_abstract_narration": "Submarine pipelines are used worldwide for a variety of purposes.               They carry oil and gas from offshore fields and are used in                     offloading tankers and transporting liquid obtained offshore.                   They transport to sea, for disposal, sewage and in some cases                   sludge from metropolitan areas, wastewaters from industrial                     complexes, and heated cooling water from power plants or water to               be used in Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) plants or                     acquaria.                                                                                                                                                       This proposal is for experimental research to study the forces                  imposed by waste-induced water motion on a test pipe set at                     various locations within an open trench of different shapes and                 dimensions.  In practice, problems can arise in this context when               large waves arrive before a pipe trench can be naturally or                     artificially backfilled.  In the research, a 12.75-inch-dimeter                 test pipe will be configured for this experiment.  This system                  will be installed offshore from Honolulu within a prepared 5.0-                 ft-deep seabed trench of adjustable cross-section.  The                         approximate water depth at the site will be 37 ft.  Wave-induced                water motion will be perpendicular to the pipe and will be                      generated by 12- to 16-second swells arriving during the period                 April-August.  Judging from past observations, wave heights to 12               ft. are virtually certain.  Horizontal and vertical force data on               the pipe's central test section, as well as water motion                        information from a nearby current sensor, will be recorded on the               project boat anchored over the site.  All data will be processed                and anlayzed to yield Morison equation wave force coefficients as               well as maximum force coefficients.  Plots displaying variations                in these coefficients with trench/pipe details and wave                         characteristics will add to the research information base and                   should be of considerable benefit to submarine pipe designers.",
