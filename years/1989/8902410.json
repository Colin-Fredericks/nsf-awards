They             will investigate the social behavior and demography of Japanese                 Macaques on Yakushima Island, in order to illuminate the process of             mating across the boundaries of macaque troops, and hence the social            structure of this primate family generally.                                                                                                                     The processes by which females initiate mating consorts with alien              males will be observed, in order to clarify the role of female choice           in the mating success of these males and the criteria by which                  females choose mating partners.  Dr. Nishida and his colleagues have            developed a respected school of behavioral studies on the basis of              their experience with Japanese primates, and their approaches to the            explanation of primate behavior is somewhat different from, and                 therefore refreshing to, those of western primatologists.  Dr.                  Sprague has worked with his Kyoto colleagues before and their                   experience will complement the expertise which he has developed on              this subject over the past eight years.",
