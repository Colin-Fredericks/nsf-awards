 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research effort are 1) to extend to motion and           surfacedeformation the investigator's prior research in perceptually            basedvisualization of texture, and 2) to develop a practical system             based on thisapproach that will handle actual motion and deformation            visualizationproblems.                                                                                                                                          The method is based on the method the investigator has already employed         withsuccess for texture visualization.  The method will proceed in a            number ofstages.  First the computational paradigm used in the                  investigator's texturesynthesis system will be adapted to surface               deformation.  Then an initial setof texture attributes that are                 potentially of perceptual significance will bedefined.  This set will           form the foundation for a library of applicativefunctions that will be          implemented.  Users will compose these functions tocreate visual                syntheses of specific types of naturally occurring motion andsurface            deformation.  Those functions discovered to be useful for this                  processwill form the basis of a perceptual attribute taxonomy.  This            taxonomy canthen be used to form a systematic parameterized approach to         realisticvisualization of surface deformation.                                                                                                                  The new contributions will be a taxonomy of perceptually significant            motionand deformation operations, and a working system of perceptually          based userinterface for visualizing motion and surface deformation.  A          key result willbe that the user of such an interface will be able to            specify and controlhighly realistic visual simulations without having           to be overly concerned withdetails at lower levels.",
