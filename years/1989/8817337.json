 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses one of the central problems in the                 study of coevolution:  how interactions between species evolve                  during population differentiation and speciation.  Much of the                  diversity of insect species has arisen through the                              differentiation of insect populations onto different plant                      species.  This study focuses on one of the classically cited                    cases of coevolution between insects and plants in which                        pollinators of the plants have evolved as seed parasites.                       Specifically, the study will analyze the systematics of the                     Prodoxidae (Lepidoptera) and the phylogeny of host associations                 and interactions between these moths and their host plants.                     These moths incluce the yucca moths and related genera, and they                have evolved species onto a wide variety of plants over time.                   The study will take advantage of recent findings on host                        associations and mutualism in Greya spp:  some of these species                 are exclusively seed parasites, whereas other species appear to                 be the primary pollinators of their hosts.  Many of the same                    behaviors seen in Greya also occur in the closely related genera                that are pollinators of yuccas.                                                      The study has three specific objectives.  In Objective 1 the               evolutionary history of the Prodoxidae will be inferred using                   sequence analyses of mtDNA.  Objective 2 is to study the                        systematic relationships within Greya, the pattern of association               with plant taxa that has evolved within this genus, and the                     origins of the morphologies and behaviors important to the                      evolution of mutualism.  Finally, Objective 3 is to study                       differentiation in the interactions between Greya politella and                 its host plants.  Greya politella is the widespread species in                  the genus, and the outcomes of interactions between these moths                 and their host plants appear to vary among populations.                         Consequently, study of the systematics of Greya, its relationship               to other prodoxid genera, and the distribution of behaviors                     involved in mutualism will provide an opportunity to study the                  evolutionary processes that shape the outcomes of coevolution.                  These results will provide a more solid empirical basis for                     evaluating current theories on the mechanisms of coevolutionary                 change.",
