 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses three major objectives in current                   biostratigraphical and paleobiological research.                                                                                                                     1.  THE NATURE OF SPECIES EXTINCTIONS ACROSS THE K/T                       BOUNDARY:  To what extent was the end-Cretaceous mass                           extinction event gradual or sudden in geological terms?  To                     what degree was extinction selective towards certain groups of                                                                                                  species?                                                                             2.  SPECIES SURVIVORSHIP:  To what extent did planktic                     foraminifera survive the end-Cretaceous mass extinction event?                                                                                                                                                                                  Were certain morphologies favored?  Which species were more                     favored, generalists or specialists?  How long did they                         survive?  Did surviving species give rise to new Tertiary                       species?                                                                             3.  POST-EXTINCTION-EVENT RADIATION:  How does species                     diversity rebound after a mass extinction event?  What are the                                                                                                  rates of diversification, are they high immediately after the                   extinction event, or are there substantial lags?  What                          taxonomic groups, generalists or specialists, contribute to                     diversification in both numbers of species and relative                         abundance of individuals?  Does the diversification correlate                   with environmental factors such as climate or productivity?                                                                                                     %%%                                                                                  This project will examine the evidence for a mass                          extinction and subsequent radiation of foraminifera across the                  Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary at 65 million years in both land                   and marine sections.  The rate of extinction and radiation will                                                                                                 be measured and the role of species morphology and ecology on                   those rates will be examined.  The post-extinction radiation                    will be examined to see which species survived and how their                    subsequent diversification occurred.  The role of climate and                   productivity in the survivorship of different species will                      be examined.  The results of this study will provide a detailed                 picture of the events surrounding the most well known                           extinction in the geologic record.",
