 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed purchase of a mass spectrometer for isotope ratio                  analyses is to benefit and enhance a number of collaborative                    projects, especially those of the rhizosphere research group of                 which the principal investigator are major participants.  The                   objectives of this research group are:  (1) to understand the                   fundamental relationships among plant roots, soil, and                          microorganisms (rhizosphere systems), (2) to characterize and                   quantify nutrients cycling in rhizosphere systems of natural and                disturbed ecosystems (ecosystem rhizosphere), and (3) to provide,               through a multidisciplinary approach, information derived from                  rhizosphere studies for use in improving the nutrient use                       efficiency of plants and managing environmentally sensitive                     ecosystems in response to their reactions to human influence.  A                considerable amount of research has already been conducted or                   been initiated by our research group, and several more projects                 are being considered.  A significant portion of the methodology                 being developed is centered around the use of a stable isotope of               nitrogen (15N), a major nutrient common to all rhizosphere                      systems.  The 15N isotope can be traced throughout the plant-soil               system using the isotope-ratio mass spectrometer for analysis.                  The ability to trace this element through the various                           transformation processes affords us the opportunity to quantify                 the processes of rhizosphere systems with emphasis on                           microorganisms-root interactions and nutrient transport and                     transformations.  Our cooperative projects address basic                        questions on the functions of rhizosphere systems of which is a                 dire lack of knowledge.  These areas include the effect of                      introduced organisms in the rhizosphere on plant-soil nutrient                  dynamics, nitrogen cycling in deforested areas, nitrogen use                    efficiency in semi-arid areas, rhizosphere processes, and the                   fate of genetically engineered organisms in the environment.                    These projects will contribute significantly to our basic                       knowledge of rhizosphere functioning.  The acquisition of a                     modern isotope-ratio mass spectrometer will greatly enhance our                 ability to carry out the planned research as well as to stimulate               other research interests.",
