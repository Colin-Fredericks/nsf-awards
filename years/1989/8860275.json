 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the              subfield of process analytical instrumentation.  The goal of this               research is to demonstrate the feasibility of a rugged, relatively              inexpensive, sensitive and versatile detector for the simultaneous              on-line analysis of compositions, concentrations, and temperatures              of gases and particles in process streams.  This instrument is                  based on Phase Sensitive Fourier Transform (PS-FT) spectroscopy,                and it will be designed to (1) substantially reduce the noise in                measurements of hot streams that are turbulent, inhomogeneous, or               contain particles, (2) increase the limits of detection in a                    noise-free environment, and (3) provide a sensitive method of                   performing spatially resolved measurements.  PS-FT will expand the              capabilities of Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Emission and                 Transmission (E/T) spectroscopy which is a technique that has been              developed and patented by Advanced Fuel Research, Inc.  This Phase              I project will demonstrate the capabilities of PS-FTIR.  The                    technique will be implemented by modifying a commercial FT-IR and               will demonstrate the reduction of noise from detectors, the                     rejection of noise from sample streams, and the application of a                crossed beam technique for obtaining spatially resolved data.                                                                                                   Modern chemical analysis of process streams requires increasingly               sophisticated methods to understand complex chemical processes.                 Often, many variables must be measured simultaneously, in-situ,                 and at the lower limits of detectability.  While many techniques                are available as in-situ diagnostics, in general they only measure              one property, so that several instruments are required to analyze               the stream.  This Phase I research will demonstrate the                         feasibility of enhancing the sensitivity and spatial resolution of              FT-IR while retaining its broad spectral bandwidth.  The                        successful development of this instrument as planned would have                 both a technological and a cost advantage over combinations of                  diagnostics currently available.",
