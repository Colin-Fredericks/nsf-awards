The analysis of (1) and (2) will employ quantitative methods and                the variable rule program to isolate constraint effects in                      recorded casual speech samples.  The VBE sample will include                    thirty-two speakers, finely age-stratified to permit a close view               of age-grading and change in progress.  The MCE sample will also                include thirty-two speakers, eight from each of the targeted                    areas.  The analysis of (3), primarily library-based, will                      explore the extent to which copula variability patterns in VBE                  and MCE have broader typological parallels and explanations.                                                                                                         The significance of this project is that it will overcome a                number of limitations in existing work on copula variability in                 VBE and MCE which restrict the validity of recent attempts to                   compare them and resolve the controversial creole origins issue                 of VBE and related varieties like Samana English.                               %%%                                                                                  The project consists of a detailed, quantitative study of                  certain aspects of the grammar of the language of urban American                black people (VBE), and of creole speakers in the Caribbean and                 in South Carolina (MCE), and the variations in their speech                     styles.  The research is motivated by, and addresses, some                      important theoretical issues which have arisen with respect to                  the historical origins of VBE, and to its current status in                     relation to standard American English.  The project should result               in significant advances in our understanding of VBE and the                     changes it is undergoing.",
