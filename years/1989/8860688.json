 "awd_abstract_narration": "High temperature superconductivity materials will permit                        development of a wide variety of electronic devices with                        decreased power requirements.  This program will create large                   single crystallites of 1-2-3 compound superconductor material;                  increased current carrying capacity of large single crystals will               allow a practical use of high Tc materials.  The objective of                   Phase I of this program will be to enlarge the size of                          microscopic crystallites to a size such that they may be cut out                of ceramic material and used as an interconnection in a circuit                 device.  The procedure used to increase the size of single                      crystal form of high Tc material will take advantage of initial                 formation of crystallites at 950 degrees centigrade.  Solid phase               epitaxial growth of larger crystallites will be performed by                    developing a temperature gradient in a tube furnace.  A very                    narrow zone (mm long) will be created at 950 degrees centigrade                 while the remainder of the tube furnace will be maintained at                   approximately 850 degrees centigrade.  This narrow zone will be                 moved slowly along the length of the material to permit solid                   phase epitaxial formation of larger crystallites.  The objective                of obtaining larger crystallites will be attained by studying the               mechanisms involved in creation of oriented crystallites in the                 heat treatment processing of ceramic materials.",
