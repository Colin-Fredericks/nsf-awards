Their divergent views on the idea of                    progress--directional evolutionary change for the better--can be                understood best by exploring the disagreements between them                     regarding the issues of evolutionary patterns and ethics, topics                which remain controversial in today's scientific community.                                                                                                     This study begins in 1900 and explores the development of                       Huxley's idea of evolutionary progress which was shaped by his                  Oxford education and contemporary views of fossil patterns as                   primarily unidirectional and determinate.  By the 1940's an                     alternative interpretation of fossil patterns as multi-                         directional and plastic had become predominant and Simpson, a                   leader in this transformation, rejected Huxley's attempt to                     ground ethics in evolutionary trends.  This divergence influenced               the interaction between Huxley and Simpson, affected their                      research programs, and determined their opposite reactions to                   Teilhard de Chardin, the French paleontologist-priest whose                     evolutionary theology captured the imagination of many scientists               in the 1960's.",
