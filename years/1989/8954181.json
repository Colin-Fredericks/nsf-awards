 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to interest young minority women in future             careers in science by providing them with an enrichment of skills,              incentives, and role models upon which to base their career choices.            Twenty-four female high school students in grades 9 or 10 and 6 high            school science teachers will be selected to participate in a 10 day             summer training program to prepare them to work on software teams               composed of 4 students and one teacher advisor. The teams will produce          high quality science education software during the school year                  following the summer session.  The 6 team will be chosen from the               Washington, DC area.                                                                                                                                            The significance of this model lies in its ability to provide a group           of young minority women and their teachers the opportunity to use               leading edge technology in the context of programmer teams using sound          software engineering principles and to produce high quality science             education software that will be evaluated by commercial software                developers for possible commercial production and distribution.  In             addition, young minority women will be able to reflect upon their               thinking and learning styles in the context of developing science               education software for other learners while teachers will increase              their range of professional experiences to include research data                collection and reporting for a scholarly journal article.",
