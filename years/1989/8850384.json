 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for the Liberal Arts, in cooperation with the                        department of Chemistry at the University of Virginia, plans                    a live statewide televised course for an estimated 300 high                     school teachers of chemistry on fourteen Saturdays from                         January to May l989, and a similar course for eigth grade                       physical science teachers in l990. The long range goal of                       this project is to increase the scientific literacy among                       students in Virginia schools through the increased science                      knowledge and heightened instructional and career awareness                     of their teachers.                                                              Modelled after a successful and innovative physics course                       broadcoast in l987, these courses will address the needs of                     the teachers for a sense of competence in subject matter,                       updated information in their field, mastery of demonstration                    methods and communication with other practitioners of their                     discipline.  Entitled \"The Chemical Web of Life on Planet                       Earth\", the chemistry course will provide three hours of                        graduate credit, suitable for recertification purposes.  The                    course will stress the dependence of terrestrial life on                        fundamental chemical                                                            processes, the syllabus will be based on responses to a needs                   assessment of the participating teachers. Activities will include               lecture, demonstrations, video tours of active research                         laboratories and discussion with leaders in their fields.                                                                                                       Teachers will meet in one of seven classrooms near their homes,                 where they will receive guidance from college-level instructors                 and interact with the lecturer and other participants through                   open microphones on their desks.  During each three-hour session,               one hour will be allotted to activities in the local classroom,                 where teacher will work cooperatively on problems related to the                lectures and plan strategies for translating course content to                  their own classrooms.  This should provide the opportunities for                teacher networks to be established in very feasible geographical                regions, as well as to provide access to the the university level               staff. The interactive mode of this model has proven to be                      successful in the previous physics course. Outside funding from                 the University, industry and schools represents about a 10% ratio               of the requested grant.",
