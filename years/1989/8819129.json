 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanism of induction of ACC synthase, the key regulatory                  enzyme in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway in plants, by various               plant hormones and environmental stimuli is poorly understood.                  Recent experimental evidence obtained by Dr. Theologis'                         laboratory using DNA sequences complementary to the ACC mRNA                    indicates that enzyme inducers such as IAA, wounding and Li ions                act at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. Studies               on the structure of the ACC synthase gene in Cucurbita are                      proposed herein to gain insight in the future into the details of               the biochemical mechanism that regulates its expression. The                    specific aim of this proposal is: Structural characterization of                genomic sequences to ACC synthase mRNA in Cucurbita. To achieve                 this goal the following experiments are proposed. Genomic                       libraries will be constructed into the cloning vector EMBl3 using               DNA from Cucurbita pepo seedlings. The genomic sequences of the                 ACC synthase will be isolated by plaque filter hybridization                    using the already isolated Cucurbita cDNA clone pACC1 as probe.                 The organization and structural analysis of the gene(s) will be                 investigated in detail.                                                         %%%                                                                             Ethylene is one of the simplest organic molecules with biological               activity. It is considered to be the fruit ripening hormone and                 is known to regulate many aspects of plant growth, development                  and senescence. ACC synthase is the key enzyme in the synthetic                 pathway of ethylene.",
