 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kafatos proposes to continue an analysis of cis-regulatory                  elements of the moth chorion promoters, and to characterize the                 trans factors by biochemical fractionation, molecular cloning,                  and functional analysis with in vitro transcription assays.                     Specific objectives are as follows: 1) Use a reporter lacZ gene                 to determine in detail elements that are necessary for follicle                 specific regulation of moth chorion genes transferred into the                  Drosophila genome. 2) Biochemically fractionate, purify and                     characterize putative trans-factors from Drosophila and                         silkmoths. 3) Study the relative affinities of these factors for                chorion genes that differ in temporal programming. 4)Molecular                  cloning of trans-factor sequences. 5) Development of an in vitro                transcription system, to assay and confirm the nature of purified               or cloned factors. 6) Use of the factor clones to study chorion                 regulation, e.g. affinities and changes in concentration of the                 factors during choriogenesis, and their distribution in other                   tissues and developmental stages.                                               %%%                                                                             The chorion proteins and used to form the eggshell of the moth                  and fly. Their synthesis represents an excellent system in which                to study the developmentally regulated expression of a complex,                 multigene family.",
