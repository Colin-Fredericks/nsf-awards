 "awd_abstract_narration": "During normal postnatal development, mammalian skeletal muscles                 undergo an orderly process of synapse elimination, whereby each muscle          fiber loses all but one of the multiple synapses with which it starts           at birth.  Dr. Van Essen will study several aspects of synaptic                 specificity and plasticity in the soleus muscle of the rabbit, using a          variety of anatomical and physiological techniques.  One objective is           to ascertain the way in which two distinct populations of motor                 neurons (fast or slow) innervate their respective populations of                muscle fibers.  He will determine the incidence of mismatched                   connections (fast motor axons onto slow muscle fibers and vice versa)           during the stage of extensive polyinnervation, and he will test for             differences in the number of synapses initially made onto fast and              slow fibers.  Another objective is to study the regional distribution           of muscle fibers within individual motor units and to ascertain                 whether this distribution within the muscle changes during the period           of synapse elimination.  Finally, Dr. Van Essen will determine whether          there are changes in neuromuscular connections during a period of late          postnatal development, when many muscle fibers are known to convert             from fast to slow contractile type.  These studies may provide                  valuable insights concerning the cellular basis of synaptic plasticity          and the rules governing orderly rearrangements of synaptic                      connections.",
