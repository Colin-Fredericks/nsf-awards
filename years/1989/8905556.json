 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence of a class of computational hardware with both                    graphics and near supercomputer capability, available to the                    chemist at a relatively modest price, is a recent phenomenon.                   Such instrumentation allows chemists to effectively carry out                   projects that involve both large scale computations and                         algorithm development as well as projects in which interactive                  graphics are essential.                                                                                                                                         The Department of Chemistry at Northwestern University will use                 this award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to help                    acquire a mini-supercomputer system with advanced work                          stations.  The acquisition will enhance chemical research in                    the the following areas:                                                                                                                                        1) X-ray crystallographic studies                                               2) Reactive intermendiates in organic reactions                                 3) Development and testing of nonlinear optical materials                       4) Gas phase dynamics of chemical reactions                                     5) Self-consistent field approximations for vibrational                            dynamics                                                                     6) Electronic structure studies of photochemical reactions.",
