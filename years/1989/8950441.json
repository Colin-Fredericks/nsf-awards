 "awd_abstract_narration": "The equipment will continue the development of the ultrasonics                  laboratory in the Physics Department at Millersville University.                Pulses of very high frequency sound are used as a probe (analogous to           SONAR) to study fundamental physics (the nature of high temperature             superconductors), biophysics (properties of hemoglobin and of enzymes),         and the nature of waves (phase and group velocity, reflection                   coefficients, Bragg scattering of light by sound, the Fourier                   uncertainty principle for pulse modulated waves, the Kramers-Kronig             relation).  These studies can be done on a bench top, at low cost, and          are readily understood by undergraduate students.  They provide physics         majors fulfilling their required senior research requirement with an            entry into research which is always interesting, and occasionally               publishable.  The instrumentation is unintimidating, and the process of         generating and detecting sound is intuitively accessible.  The award            will purchase two plug-in electronics modules to cover the frequency            ranges 10 to 90 MHz and 90 to 300 MHz.  The institution will provide an         amount equal to 135% of the award toward the cost of the project.",
