 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morphological integration can be defined as a characteristic of a               transformation that deforms one morphology into another.  A                     region of morphology is integrated if the deformation acts                      globally; regions are poorly integrated if they comprise parts                  that undergo different transformations.  The goals of this                      postdoctoral project are to:  (1) identify integrated parts of                  the skull and jaw of species of New World murid rodents; (2)                    compare parts detected by morphometric analysis to those                        predicted by developmental theory and functional morphology; and                (3) explore if developmentally integrated units remain integrated               through phylogeny.  Known-age tissue samples of the cotton rat,                 Sigmodon fulviventer, will be explored for ontogenetic                          integration; adult samples of S. fulviventer, S. hispidus                       berlandieri, S. hispidus komareki, Neotoma floridana, Peromyscus                leucopus and P. maniculatus will be analyzed for phylogenetic                   integration.                                                                                                                                                    Changes in shape coordinates will be used to analyze                            transformations within and between regions of the skull and jaw                 hypothesized a priori to be integrated because of developmental                 origin or function.  The uniform, global but not uniform, and                   localized non-linearities will all be analyzed.  The hierarchy of               integrated parts will be constructed by application of the method               of principal warps which decomposes non-global components                       hierarchically as determined by the amount of \"bending energy\"                  required to displace the landmarks, regardless of the affine                    transformation.  The principal warps can be used to categorize                  the features of shape change, each at its own geometric scale,                  and to investigate variation in the underlying bending-energy at                progressively larger geometric scales.                                                                                                                          This one-year fellowship activity will take place at the                        University of Michigan.",
