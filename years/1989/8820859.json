 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a request for a multi-user central computer                    facility for the cognitive science group at Brown University.                   Broadly defined, cognitive science is the study of the mind and                 its structural and functional representation.  Such study                       includes the investigation of representational and computational                components involved in using and comprehending language, and in                 perceiving, acting, thinking, and knowing.  A central                           characteristic of cognitive science is its concern with                         computational problems.  There are four broad areas of research                 represented in Cognitive Science at Brown University in which the               computer has served as a necessary tool.  These include neural                  modelling of language and cognitive process, computational                      vision, speech, and memory and cognitive processes.  Although                   most of us represented in this proposal have our own computer                   equipment, the need for and the utility of a central cognitive                  science machine has been proven to us over and over again.  The                 requested equipment and associated software will allow us not                   only to maintain but increase our current computational resources               and will allow us to maintain, and develop a state-of-the-art                   computer and communications network for research in many areas of               cognitive science.",
