 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at the University of Wisconsin will help                           teachers improve their background in genetics and to assist                     them in becoming familiar with the resources available to                       help them keep abreast of new developments in genetics and                      biotechnology.  It will offer teachers the opportunity to                       explore and examine the ethical and moral decision-making                       needs at both the societal and personal levels.  It will                        challenge teachers to reconsider their own genetics                             curriculum and teaching strategies in a stimulating and                         supportive environment.  It will help teachers to identify                      and discuss content-specific issues and misconceptions                          commonly held by students in genetics and will enable                           teachers to develop instructional activities to address them.                   The proposed project will act as both the catalyst and                          support teachers seek in their continuing efforts to revise                     and improve their science teaching.                                                                                                                             The proposed project will consist of the following two major                    components:                                                                                                                                                     The Summer Institute for Genetics Education - This component                    will allow for the continuation and expansion of the Summer                     Institute for Genetics Education.  Existing teacher materials                   will be evaluated and modified and new modules will be                          developed.  Future modules will focus on other topics such as                   the genetic basis of evolution and developmental biology,                       ethical issues and decision-making models, and student                          learning and problem solving in genetics and other curricular                   issues.  In addition, future modules will be planned to                         address the special needs of elementary and middle school                       teachers and the teaching of the concepts of variation,                         continuity, and development.  Twenty-five teachers each year                    will attend five separate workshops, each of one week                           duration.                                                                                                                                                       Genetics Education Institute Academic Year Activities -                         During this component, the Summer Institute staff will                          develop and conduct follow-up and promotional activities                        during the school year.  These activities would include, but                    not be limited to, 10 workshops, 10 in-services, 3 convention                   presentations, seminar series, and assistance to teachers who                   wish to conduct outreach activities in his or her own                           community.  The Institute staff will review and disseminate                     information to teachers on educational research, curricula,                     audio-visual aids, and printed materials.  The staff will                       provide or arrange for guest lectures in classrooms,                            coordinate and conduct school field trips to campus, act as a                   clearinghouse to provide students and teachers with materials                   on specific requested topics, develop and field test                            classroom for instructional activities, write and distribute                    ideas and information to teachers via the GenoType newsletter                   and other professional journals such as The American Biology                    Teacher and The Science Teacher.  In addition, the staff will                   seek to acquire long-term support for the project in the form                   of funding and equipment.                                                                                                                                       An amount equal to 34 percent of the National Science                           Foundation award has been added to the project.",
