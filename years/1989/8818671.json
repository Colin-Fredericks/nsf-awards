 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds for Prof. Michael F. Sheridan of                  Arizona State University to travel to Italy to conduct field work               and collaborative research at three different Quartenary volcanos               in Italy with his Italian counterparts, Prof. L. La Volpe (Bari),               L. Civetta (Naples), and G. Cavaretta (Rome).  The general                      objective of the proposed research is to achieve a better                       understanding of the physics of volcanic activity through                       geochemical investigations at the proposed sites.  The specific                 objectives are:  1) to reconstruct the volcanic history of Vulcano              in Sicily, following a field investigation of the oldest exposed                stratigraphic sequence; 2) to interpret explosive volcanic                      phenomena recorded in the products of eruptive cycles younger than              50,000 years on Pantelleria (Straight of Sicily), using the                     variation in volatile species and light trace elements measured by              the ion microprobe; and 3) to investigate the geochemistry of boron             and other light elements in the hydrothermal minerals of the                    Sabatini Volcanic District (Latium).                                                                                                                            The activity planned at Vulcano is important for its likely                     contributions to the basic science of volcanology vis a vis                     volcanic hazards.  The work at Pantelleria is of potential                      scientific value since it promises, through the application of ion              microprobe analysis, to yield important analytical data on the                  volatile and light element content of glass inclusions and                      phenocrysts, thus providing information on the volatile                         concentrations of the magmatic reservoirs of the volcano.  The                  proposed research project will take advantage of the combined                   skills and expertise of the U.S. and Italian investigators, who                 have worked together effectively as a team in the past, in the                  conduct of preliminary field work at the volcanic sites and the                 completion of laboratory analysis in Naples and Arizona State                   University.",
