 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation is concerned with algorithms and computational               techniques to decide if a given nonassociative polynomial is an                 identity for a variety of nonassociative algebras.  In general, this            problem is computationally very difficult, and existing methods suffer          from prohibitive time and memory requirements.  The approach used in            this investigation is to use a dynamic programming algorithm.  The              algorithm solves the problem by constructing a certain homomorphic              image of the free algebra.  The number of arithmetic operations                 required to construct the algebra is bound by a polynomial in the               dimension of the resulting algebra (but for many varieties the                  algorithm might not be polynomial-time in the input size).  Using this          method, it appears that many questions, which previously appeared to be         computationally impractical, may now be solved with existing computers.         Preliminary tests show that this method can be used to decide in                minutes if certain polynomials, up to degree 10, were identities in the         variety of commutative, fourth-power-associative algebras.  While the           method looks promising, several theoretic issues need to be examined in         order to make the method more practical.  A goal is to implement the            full version of the algorithm on several specific problems.  One such           problem is the search for Jordan s-identities.  Another is determining          whether there exist nonspecial Malcev algebras.",
