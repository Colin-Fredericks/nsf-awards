 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Sidney Redner of Boston                       University in a research collaboration with Professor Francois A.               Leyvraz of the National Autonomous University in Cuernavaca,                    Mexico.  The investigators intend to study a wide-range of kinetic              and dynamic phenomena, based on approaches using modern statistical             mechanics.  A major goal of the research is to elucidate, in                    general terms, the role of fluctuations in simple                               diffusion-controlled reactions, as well as slow relaxation                      phenomena in both reversible and irreversible chemical reactions.               In addition, the researchers will seek a better understanding of                the fundamental physical laws underlying multi-fractality for                   systems such as the random resistor network and a class of physical             processes under random systems that encompass hydrodynamic                      dispersion and filtration.                                                                                                                                      Understanding the kinetics of diffusion-controlled reactions is an              important basic science problem with a wide variety of                          applications, such as trapping and relaxation processes in                      condensed-matter, aggregation and gelation processes, and chemical              reactor engineering.  Application of modern and powerful tools,                 such as scaling and the renormalization group, should yield further             insights into these processes.  The study of random system is a                 much more recent area of research, the effects of disorder giving               rise to a variety of new physical phenomena, as well as posing                  fundamental and enduring questions.  The Mexican side will                      contribute a strong background in the area of diffusion and                     aggregation processes while the U.S. side brings to the                         collaboration expertise with statistical mechanics and the study of             random systems.",
