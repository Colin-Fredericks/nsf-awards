 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transcription initiation is a primary site for gene                             regulation.  The goal of this work is to further define and                     characterize the mechanism (s) of general and gene -                            specific transcription.  Basic information will be aquired on                   the structure and function of the transcription                                 apparatus and on expression  of developmentally and/ or                         light regulated genes.  Several wheat transcription factors                     (TFs) have been isolated. One TF has been purified and                          footprinted to a DNA promoter, it appears to be the plant                       equivalent of animal TFIIA.  The transcription complex                          formation will be investigated in order to define the                           intermediate structures which occur during assembly.  Studies                   will be continued on developing an in vitro RNA polymerase                      II transcription system and perfecting an RNA polymerase III                    in vitro system.  Lastly, studies are begining on identifying                   gene-specific TFs.                                                                                                                                              There is a need to improve agricultural crops to yield more                     ford per - acre and to increase the nutritional value of                        these crops.  Insect and microbial damage pose a constant                       threat to plants and there is also a need for plant more                        tolerant of environmental variability and extremes.  To                         develop better plant species it is now possible to introduce                    new traits into plant gene pools.  Thus these types of                          studies are sorely needed and Dr. Ackerman can help with his                    expertise.//",
