This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long and                Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The program             is designed to enable young U.S. scientists and engineers to                    conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the conduct of             joint research and the use of unique or complementary facilities,               expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                     The award will support a ten month research visit by Dr. Keith L.               Perry and Dr. William E. Fry of Cornell University - State,                     Department of Plant Pathology, with Dr. Richard Francki, Waite                  Agricultural Research Institute, University of Adelaide, South                  Australia.  While plant RNA viruses exhibit an extraordinary degree             of variability with respect to host range and induced host range                responses, little information is available on what mechanisms lead              to this diversity.  The researchers propose to address this                     variability among plant viral RNAs through a study of recombination             (the exchange of sequence domains between two RNAs) and pseudorecom-            bination (the reassortment of intact genomic RNAs from multicomponent           viruses), assessing the role of recombination and pseudorecombination           as well as point mutations in the evolution of plant viruses and                the generation of new disease agents.  The researchers seek: (1) to             isolate recombinant and pseudorecombinant viruses and obtain an                 estimate for the minimum frequency of their occurrence in mixed                 virus infections;  (2) to assess the competitive fitness of                     recombinant viruses; and (3) to make a detailed molecular characteri-           zation of recombinants to determine if recombination is homologous,             if hotspots for recombination exist, and if crossover points occur              intragenically or within non-translated RNA domains.  The experi-               mental system consists of (1) a group of tripartite RNA viruses, the            cucumoviruses; (2) their aphid vectors;  and (3) a wide host range              of plants in which virus-plant interactions can be observed and                 manipulated.                                                                                                                                                    The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,               international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents'                 allowance, if applicable, and a flat administrative allowance of                $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.",
