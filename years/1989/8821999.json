 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focuses on the development of methods to compare                  alternative types of material handling systems used by industry.  The           goal of the project is to assist users in selecting well-designed,              integrated material handling systems that will meet their needs at              minimum cost.  The approach will seek general solutions to material             handling problems but it also will look in detail at several specific           companies and the material handling systems that they employ.  This             mix of general theory and empirical validation through examination of           the performance of existing systems is very appropriate to the goals of         the DRMS program.  The researchers combine strong backgrounds in                quantitative analysis with experience in industrial applications of             material handling systems.  Initial results, obtained by the researcher         based on a subset of the proposed studies, are very promising.  Both            the importance (and expense) of material handling decisions suggest             that the results of the proposed study should be of interest to                 suppliers and users in a large number of different research and                 industrial settings.",
