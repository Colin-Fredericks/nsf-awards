 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal on \"Subsurface Flow and Transport Simulation\" between             Dr. William G. Gray of the University of Notre Dame and Dr. Anton               Leijnse of the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental            Protection, Bilthoven, The Netherlands, is approved by NSF and the              U.S.- Netherlands Cooperative Science Program.                                                                                                                  This research will improve our ability to describe the flow of                  water in the subsurface and the movement of chemicals in that water             using numerical simulation procedures.  The flow is difficult to                describe accurately when the subsurface geologic formation is                   inhomogeneous or when the concentration of contaminants is so high              that it affects the fluid density.  The computational techniques to             be implemented here will improve this description by automatically              refining the computational grid in the vicinity of these complex                regions.  The work will be done cooperatively with basic theory and             algorithms being the primary responsibility of researchers at the               University of Notre Dame and testing and implementation for field               situations performed by researchers at the Netherlands Department               of Public Health and Environmental Protection.",
