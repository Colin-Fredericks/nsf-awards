 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor W. E. Billups of Rice University to               collaborate in research with Dr. Roland Boese of the Institute for              Inorganic Chemistry of the University of Essen, West Germany.  The              objective of their joint research is to determine the structures of             very unstable molecules of theoretical interest.  Dr. Boese and his             co-workers have developed an apparatus to crystallize liquids on an             x-ray diffractometer at low temperatures by means of a miniature zone           melting procedure with focused infrared light.  He has been able to             determine very accurate structures of unstable inorganic compounds.             Dr. Billups has developed a vacuum gas phase procedure for the                  synthesis of small ring cycloalkanes and other highly strained                  organic compounds.  The innovative experimental techniques they have            introduced have had wide but separate applicability.  The plan for              the collaboration combines their virtually unique expertise through             the synthesis and preliminary characterization of the compounds at              Rice University and then determination of their precise structures              using the unusual equipment at Essen.                                                                                                                           Small ring cycloalkanes have aroused great interest because their               high energy content relative to their acyclic isomers often results             in unexpected properties.  Progress in this area has been slowed by             the extreme difficulty of structural analysis of such highly unstable           compounds.  The successful application of the Boese technique to the            acquisition of good structural data by low temperature x-ray                    crystallography would be a boon to physical organic chemists engaged            in structural chemistry.  In addition, the technique, once accessible           to the chemical community as a whole, will find wide application in             the structural analysis of small unstable molecules.",
