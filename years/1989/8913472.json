 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support joint research in statistics between Dr.                Brian Yandell, University of Wisconsin, and two British mathe-                  maticians - Professor D. Michael Titterington, University of                    Glasgow and Professor Brian Ripley, University of Strathclyde,                  Glasgow.  The focus will be on three interrelated collaborative                 projects; graphics in spatial statistics, regularization and                    statistical graphics.                                                                                                                                           This area of research is one of the fastest developing and most                 exciting in the statistical sciences.  This award will give Dr.                 Yandell the opportunity to work for four months with leading                    British researchers in this field.  The first project will involve              the investigation of the properties of existing systems for                     spatial statistics and image reconstruction, with the view towards              developing a new tool kit for graphical statistics.  The project                on regularization will investigate the larger theoretical domain                of the problem of model selection under ill-posed constraints.                  The third project will concentrate on the graphics interface and                the use of graphics as a means to conduct formal and informal                   statistical analysis in an interactive environment.  This will                  involve considerable development of software.  Results of this                  joint research should make a significant contribution to the                    development of statistical computing tools for displaying and                   analyzing complicated spatial patterns of data.",
