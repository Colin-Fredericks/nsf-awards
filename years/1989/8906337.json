 "awd_abstract_narration": "They will examine magnetic behavior and phase transitions in a                  variety of mixed and dilute magnets with short-range exchange                   interactions.  Effects of competing spin anisotropies and/or                    competing exchange interactions are of particular interest,                     especially their influence on the structure of T-composition                    magnetic phase diagrams.  New systems exhibiting tetracritical or               other multicritical points should emerge, some with qualitatively               new features.  New examples of the insulating spin glass will be                examined, including cases of model classes not yet realized                     experimentally.  The nonlinear susceptibility will be studied, in               order to further their understanding of spin glass universality                 classes; time-dependent effects will also be examined.  Work is                 also proposed on certain Fe(III) bisdithiocarbamate and                         bisdiselenocarbamate compounds.  Interest centers on                            characterizing the magnetic ordering in these unusual                           pentacoordinate systems, determining zero-field splitting                       parameters and exchange interactions, and discovering new                       examples of XY or Ising systems.  Methodology will consist                      primarily of variable temperature, variable field magnetization                 and susceptibility measurements on both single crystal and                      polycrystalline samples.  This work will have a major impact on                 the departmental research environment, especially in                            opportunities afforded undergraduates for research during the                   academic year and during summers.  Such experiences will be                     valuable preparation for later scientific work.",
