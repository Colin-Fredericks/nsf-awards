 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the analysis of the quasi static motion                 of systems of contacting bodies.  A robotic system in contact                   with the local environment can in some sense be characterized                   dynamically as a system of interacting rigid and flexible bodies.               Some of these bodies are actively controlled while others respond               in a passive manner.  If the accelerations of these bodies are                  very small, then it is often useful to assume that acceleration                 to be zero in the analysis of the motion of the passive bodies.                 This type of system is said to be quasi static, and the law of                  static equilibrium is assumed to hold.  Mechanical systems                      amenable to quasi static modeling are those for which the motion                is dominated by the effects of contacts, i.e., a robot hand                     assembling workpieces into a fixture.  The approach used here is                based on Peshkin's Minimum Power Principle which states that the                instantaneous motion of the passive bodies is that which                        simultaneously minimizes power dissipation and satisfies                        kinematic constraints imposed by contact with active bodies.                    Application of this principle results in an algorithm which can                 determine the velocities of the system's passive bodies and the                 contact forces as functions of time.  The algorithm is less                     computationally intensive than traditional solution of the system               differential equations, and integration of the algorithm into                   existing mechanical assembly CAD/CAM systems will allow proposed                assembly procedures to be evaluated for contact forces, joint                   torques required, and stability and jamming conditions before                   beginning assembly.",
