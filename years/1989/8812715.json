 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this oceanographic instrumentation                            development project are to design, build, and test a modern                     rock coring drill and establish a facility for its operation.                   Design criteria require the drill to penetrate and recover                      three-meter core samples from igneous basement rocks, lithi-                    fied sediments, and sulfide deposits at ocean depths of up to                   5,000 meters.  The drill will be deployed from conventional                     deep-sea research vessels and will collect spatially oriented                   cores from environments that are difficult or impossible to                     sample using conventional sediment coring or dredging tech-                     niques.  Areas of specific research applications that would                     make use of such a capability include sampling of mid-ocean                     seamounts, drilling carbonate blocks at convergent margins,                     off-axis sampling of igneous rocks for studies of crustal                       evolution, and sampling at hydrothermal deposits.  The new                      drilling capability will also be useful in resource assess-                     ment such as Exclusive Economic Zone mapping efforts off                        Hawaii.                                                                                                                                                         Advances in the field of ocean engineering are also                             anticipated.  Robotic and system control technology must be                     developed to mark and extract the rock cores with reference                     to polar coordinates.  Control of the drill system must be                      such that accommodations can be made for differing seafloor                     conditions and off-vertical placement.  This project will                       also provide the engineering foundation for a planned 50-                       meter rock coring capability.",
