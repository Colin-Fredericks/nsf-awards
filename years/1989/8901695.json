 "awd_abstract_narration": "The source of problems to be analyzed in this project derive               from differential geometry and mathematical physics.  These areas               of science provide important prototypes of non-linear equations                 in which fundamental and difficult analysis must be done to                     understand the properties of solutions.  Work will concentrate on               the study of problems related to singularity and regularity of                  solutions of partial differential equations such as those                       encountered in the Yamabe equation in geometry and in the theory                of liquid crystals.  Other work will consider the boundary                      regularity of very degenerate non-linear elliptic systems which                 arise in efforts to decide when it is possible to find harmonic                 maps between two (non necessarily smooth) domains when the                      boundary values are prescribed.                                                      The work will focus on several specific goals.  Among them                 will be the study of singular solutions of nonlinear elliptic                   equations in an effort to obtain estimates on the dimension of                  the singular set as well as to understand the location of such                  sets.  In cases where the singular set is isolated, its location                appears to be rigid.  In studies of liquid crystal models, work                 will be done examining the transition between the nematic and                   smectic states of crystal configurations, while more geometric                  work will seek to provide information as to how one can determine               whether or not a compact Riemannian manifold is conformally                     equivalent to a sphere.",
