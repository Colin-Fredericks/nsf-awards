 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this research is to characterize DNA polymerase                structure and function in order to understand the molecular basis of            DNA replication.  The bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase is the model              system for these studies.  Biochemical and genetic techniques are               being used. Dr. Reha-Krantz will study two regions of the phage T4 DNA          polymerase that are critical for DNA polymerase function; one region            may be part of the nucleotide-binding site and the second region may            interact with nucleotides, DNA and/or this region may be part of the            DNA polymerase active site for phosphodiester bond formation.  Enzyme           purification and characterization, protein chemistry and genetic                engineering techniques will be applied to these projects.  This                 research will further our understanding of how a DNA polymerase works           and will, thus, be a significant contribution to the field of DNA               replication.                                                                                                                                                    The interactive activities include teaching in the introductory                 Biochemistry course and lecturing at seminars in the Department of              Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry.  In addition, Dr. Reha-Krantz            will be an active participant in the lecture series and support groups          sponsored by the Yale Office for Women in Medicine.  These meetings             will provide opportunities for interacting with graduate students,              medical students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty.  She will also              supervise a high school student as part of the Minority High School             Student Research Apprentice Program.                                                                                                                            This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women          to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater               visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the                      participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
