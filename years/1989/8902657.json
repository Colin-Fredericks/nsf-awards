 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for partial support of a symposium on approximately               solved problems.  Problems are solved approximately either                      because we cannot solve them exactly ir because we choose not to.               There are many problems in physical science, engineering,                       artificial intelligence, and economics that we cannot solve                     exactly because the information (data) is partial and                           contaminated.  Sometimes, however, it is our own choice to settle               for approximation because it is significantly cheaper.  The                     symposium is defined by the intersection of two ideas:                          complexity and approximate solution.  A complexity theory for                   approximately solved problems is one that studies lower bounds on               the intrinsic difficulty of solving a problem and seeks to obtain               optimal information and optimal algorithms.  It studies these                   questions in worst case, average case, and probabilistic                        settings.  The symposium includes both theory and applications.",
