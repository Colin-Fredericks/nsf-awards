 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology at                   Michigan State University will provide funds to buy equipment for               a new advanced undergraduate laboratory course in modern plant                  physiology and molecular biology.  Such a course is not currently               offered at MSU, even though there are many students studying                    diverse types of plant science who could benefit from such a                    course.  The new course will replace two laboratories that are                  currently part of two advanced plant physiology courses; these                  will continue as just lecture courses.  The award provides funds                to buy eight types of equipment:  one high-speed centrifuge and                 rotors, six gel electrophoresis units, two rotary evaporators,                  four pH meters, one scanning spectrophotometer, two shaking water               baths, two protein and DNA blotting apparatuses, and one                        scintillation counter.  These will be used to conduct laboratory                sessions devoted to Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer;                       bacterial transformation; purification, electrophoresis, and                    transfer blotting of plant DNA, RNA, and proteins, and detection                by hybridization with DNA probes and antibodies; induction of                   gene expression by plant hormones; enzyme assays; and enzyme-                   linked immunoassay of plant hormones.  The current available                    teaching equipment in the Department of Botany and Plant                        Pathology is very inadequate for the proposed course.  The                      grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds from                  non-Federal sources.",
