 "awd_abstract_narration": "The determination of the dynamics and structure of molecules               lies at the heart of chemistry.  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)               spectroscopy plays a central role in that process.  NMR is                      introduced and used in the laboratory by students in their first                organic chemistry course, NMR occupies a more advanced level in                 the instrumental analysis course and again at a still more                      advanced level in physical chemistry and undergraduate research.                This Fourier transform NMR is used for analysis of tiny                         quantities of material produced in the beginning microscale                     organic laboratory as well as the structure analysis of newly                   synthesized molecules utilizing 2D techniques.  This modern,                    fast, sensitive NMR has expanded significantly the scope and                    sophistication of a large part of the Mount Holyoke College                     laboratory curriculum.  The institution is matching the NSF grant               with an equal amount of funds.",
