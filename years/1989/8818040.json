 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will use a combination of field observations,                endocrine analyses, and \"DNA fingerprinting\" to determine the                   mechanisms and adaptive consequences of several reproductive                    phenomena that have been little-investigated in mammals.  The                   study organisms is the dwarf mongoose, a small gregarious                       carnivore for which a substantial base of observational data and                a population of individually-recognizable animals exist in the                  Serengeti National Park, Tanzania.  In groups of these animals                  older dominant individuals suppress reproduction in younger,                    subordinate (but physiologically mature) animals, which are less                likely to exhibit mating behavior, to conceive, or to bring                     pregnancies to term than are dominants.  The PIs will use                       behavioral observations and analyses of urinary peptide and                     steroid hormones to document the stage(s) at which reproduction                 is suppressed.  Genetic fingerprints will be used to determine                  maternity and paternity of offspring and thereby determine                      whether subordinates's breeding attempts are ever successful.                   Field demographic data will determine the effects of attempting                 reproduction on individual survival and future reproduction.                         A second reproductive phenomenon to be investigated is                     synchrony of estrus between subordinate and dominant females.                   DNA fingerprinting will be used to determine whether                            synchronously reproducing subordinates produce more surviving                   offspring than do asynchronous animals.  Finally, subordinate                   females without young of their own nevertheless lactate and nurse               the young of dominants.  The endocrine status of lactating                      nonbreeders, as well as the effort of their lactation on                        components of their own and of dominant's fitness will be                       investigated.",
