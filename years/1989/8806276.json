 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid development and intensification of winter                         cyclones in coastal regions presents a major weather                            forecasting problem.  Along the East Coast of the United                        States, the development of cyclonic storms and frontal                          systems often occurs along the coastal region of the                            Carolinas.  These weather systems may lead to severe weather                    in the heavily populated northeast corridor in the form of                      freezing rain, heavy snowfall, blizzards and extensive                          coastal erosion.  A complex interaction of cold continental                     air, warm ocean currents, traveling atmospheric disturbances                    and local geography all appear to contribute to the rapid                       development of these systems; however, the processes are                        not well understood and the phenomena are often poorly                          forecast.                                                                           In January-March 1986 a cooperative research project to                     study winter storms in this region was held by a consortium                     of universities and Federal agencies.  Entitled GALE                            (Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment), the project was                          designed to provide detailed information on the role of air-                    sea interaction, planetary boundary-layer processes and                         mesoscale meteorological processes.                                                 The Principal Investigator intends to investigate the                       evolution of mesoscale precipitation distribution associated with               evolving east-coast cyclones by: (1) investigating the influence                of the three-dimensional kinematics and topography on the                       evolution of the precipitation patterns; (2) discerning the                     dynamic factors that control the location and evolution of the                  boundary between rain-snow areas; (3) discerning the influence of               gravity-wave activity on the precipitation distribution.",
