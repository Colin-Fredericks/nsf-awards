 "awd_abstract_narration": "An equipment package will be assembled for field measurements of the            temperatures, moisture concentration, and heat flux through various             insulation layers used in home construction.  The primary objective of          the experiments will be to validate a numerical model of the                    radiation/diffusion (mass and heat) transport processes which occur             under actual field conditions, including day/night, winter/summer,              high humidity, and contaminated surface operation.  Most existing data          have been taken under steady-state, guarded hot plate conditions,               making extrapolation of models to high humidity and time-varying                environments tenuous.                                                                                                                                           Numerical models of the energy lost through building walls indicate             that substantial savings can be obtained by properly choosing the               geometry and properties of the composite insulation materials, such as          the emissivity, density, and affinity of the materials for moisture.            Research equipment purchased through this grant is essential to                 provide a reliable data base against which such models can be                   validated under actual field conditions.",
