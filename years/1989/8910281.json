 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Initiation Award is to develop a new approach for                 detecting targets on the ocean surface using microwave radars with              frequency and polarization diversity.  In the proposed approach,                received signals from resolution cells lying adjacent to a given cell           are processed adaptively to obtain relevant information about the               spatial structure of the ocean surface.  This information is used to            implement a detection strategy which maximizes the contrast between             the target and the background medium.  An investigation of various              theoretical aspects of the problem along with its testing will be               conducted.  The application of the proposed concept to other problems           and the impact of the proposed work are discussed.                                                                                                              Over two decades of research in the area of microwave remote sensing            of the ocean has established the strong connection between the                  characteristics of microwave sea echo and the physical characteristics          of the ocean surface.  Improvements in the performance of high                  resolution radar systems operating in an ocean environment can only be          achieved by recognizing this dynamic link between the statistical               characteristics of microwave clutter and that of the ocean waves.  The          research is an attempt at solving this problem by unifying ideas from           three different disciplines of research (viz., detection and                    estimation theory, scattering of electromagnetic waves from rough               surfaces and oceanography).  This represents a new approach to the              problem and results from this work as well as its theoretical aspects           are expected to generate a good deal of interest in the scientific              community.",
