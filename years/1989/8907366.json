 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Dupin condition can be naturally formulated in Lie                   sphere geometry.  It is known to be invariant under certain Lie                 transformations.  Using this knowledge several theorems were                    proven which concern hypersurfaces whose principal curvatures are               constant along their corresponding curvature surfaces.  Recently                the principal investigator and a collaborator successfully used                 these transformations to partially solve the problem of                         classifying all Dupin submanifolds.  The principal investigator                 will continue his work on this classification.                                       Spheres and tori as they appear in three-dimensional space                 are examples of what mathematicians call two-dimensional                        submanifolds.  These are Dupin if they satisfy certain curvature                requirements.  The principal investigator has made substantial                  progress towards the classification of such submanifolds.  He                   will continue his work on this deep and renowned problem.",
