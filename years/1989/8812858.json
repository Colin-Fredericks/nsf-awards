 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research derives from the notion that the process by which a               sentence is comprehended requires several steps.  One step is to                retrieve the meanings of the words, and another step is to                      combine the meanings of the individual words into the meaning of                the entire sentence.  The mental procedure that performs these                  tasks is called the \"parser\", because it \"parses\" sentences.  How               the meanings of the words are combined is dictated by their                     inflections and by their order in the sentence.  For example the                sentence \"Boys like girls.\" sounds natural because the words and                their inflections form a pattern that induces the parser to                     combine the meanings of the words in such a way that we                         understand \"boys\" to be the agent and \"girls\" to be the recepient               of the action \"like.\"  However, not all patterns of words and                   inflections are recognized by the parser.  In this view, the more               dissimilar a pattern is from one recognized by the parser, the                  more odd or deviant the string of words sounds.  Hence, strings                 like \"Boy like girl.\" and \"Boys red girl.\" sound deviant.  Such                 strings are ungrammatical; the process by which people judge                    whether a string in the language is natural or odd is known as                  grammatical intuition.                                                                                                                                          Several predictions may be derived from this notion about the                   role of grammatical intuition in language comprehension.  First,                it should be possible to specify what the patterns are that the                 parser recognizes and to show that the perceived deviance of a                  word string increases with its difference from the pattern most                 similar to it that the parser recognizes.  Also, deviant word                   strings should be more difficult to understand than natural ones.                                                                                               This research project will test these predictions.  First, the                  parsing procedure for a subset of English will be implemented in                a computer program.  The specificity of the program will make it                possible to derive precise predictions about grammaticality and                 comprehensibility for the sentences recognized by the program.                  Then, these predictions will be compared with measures of human                 performance; among them, the time college students take to make                 grammaticality judgments for the sentences and the time they take               to comprehend the sentences.                                                                                                                                    Regardless of the merits of the initial hypothesis, comparison of               the performance of a computer program with human performance is                 likely to produce results that will improve our understanding of                human language comprehension and hence that will be useful in                   improving the ability of computer programs to understand human                  language.",
