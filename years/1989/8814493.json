 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Science in Developing Countries Program award will support a               group of U.S. researchers headed by Professor Robert Ginsburg of                the University of Miami to collaborate with a group of Bahamian                 scientists headed by Dr. R. V. Cant, Chief Hydrologist of the                   Bahamian government.  The purpose of the proposed research is to                provide a detailed case study of the meteoric diagenesis of a                   Holocene sediment deposit.  This sand body occurs as a large                    pocket-beach strandline deposit that abuts against Pleistocene                  limestones at Great Exuma Island, Bahamas.  The research will                   document all relevant aspects of the hydrogeology,                              hydrogeochemistry and petrography of the sand body.                                                                                                             The proposed study will contribute to our understanding of the                  relationship between early meteoric carbonate diagenesis and the                physical and chemical hydrology of ocean islands.  The                          hydrogeologic aspects of the study will be applied to define the                quantity and quality of a potentially important water resource of               immediate interest to the Bahamian government.  By bringing                     together a team of geologists with interests in sedimentology,                  geochemistry and hydrogeology, and allowing them to collaborate                 with Bahamian water-resources scientists who best know the                      occurrence of fresh ground water and the hydrogeologic framework of             the islands,this award fulfills the objectives of the Science in                Developing Countries Program.",
