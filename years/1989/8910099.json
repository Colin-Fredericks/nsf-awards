 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program uses glancing angle Extended X-ray Absorption             Fine Structure (EXAFS) x-ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate             the structure of multicomponent glasses and how they are changed by             dopant diffusion.  The structure of two types of glasses will be                investigated.  In the first type, a \"single alkali\" glass, only one             elemental component participates in ion exchange with the dopant.  In           the second \"mixed alkali\" type, two or more components interact with            the dopant cation.  Dopant diffusion is expected to occur along                 \"percolation channels\" throughout the glass; these should be different          in character for the two glass types.  Further, these channels are              expected to close off near the glass surface due to alkali leaching             during surface polishing.                                                                                                                                       The results of this study are expected to have a direct impact on               integrated optics technology, micro-optics and gradient-index optics,           all of which use ion exchange in glass for fabrication of many of               their components.  The EXAFS measurements will be in collaboration              with Professor G. N. Greaves of the Daresbury Laboratory, an                    international synchrotron facility in Warrington, England.",
