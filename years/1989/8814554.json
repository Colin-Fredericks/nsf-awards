 "awd_abstract_narration": "Active galaxies will be studied primarily through high                          resolution radio observations by Very Long Baseline                             Interferometry (VLBI) techniques.  Detailed studies of a few                    individual objects and studies of well-defined samples of                       objects, suitable for statistical analyses will be carried out.                 A large program of high resolution radio observations using VLBI                techniques, lower resolution radio observations from the Very                   Large Array (VLA), and data on optical spectra taken on the                     Palomar 200-Inch Telescope will be done.  The proposed                          observations should provide a powerful discriminant between                     various \"unified\" theories of active galaxies and between rival                 theories of superluminal motion.  Specific problems that should                 yield astrophysically important answers within the next three                   years will be the main emphasis of the research.  The successful                execution of the planned scientific program constitute an                       important step toward understanding active galaxies.                                                                                                            Partial support of the operations costs of the 40 meter telescope               at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory are provided.   The data                  from VLBI observations made around the earth are reduced at the                 California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and support for                  the operational cost of the correlator used to reduce the data is               included in the grant  These facilities are cornerstones of the                 world-wide VLBI effort.",
