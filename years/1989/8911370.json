 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal develops a theoretical model for explaining the                   formation of strategic alliances in new high technology                         ventures and proposes to test it on an existing data base                       collected between 1978 and 1986.  The data base, which                          contains information on strategic alliances among 105                           semiconductor firms, is considered to be very comprehensive.                    Of particular interest is the proposed development of an                        explanation for how new firms faced with substantial                            technological and financial risk typically plan activities                      and devote organizational resources to survive the                              developmental period.  Key considerations in the proposed                       model include the degree of risk from new technology                            development, the extent and type of organizational resources,                   the characteristics of the founding management team, and                        environmental variability.  The project combines an                             advancement of organizational theory with an improved                           understanding of an important real-world industry, and                          promises to provide important additional information of                         general interest on the organizational characteristics                          andstrategies of start.up ventures.",
