 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell-cell interactions and later developmental events during                    the Chlamydomonas sexual cycle are known (or presumed) to be                    controlled by alleles at the mt, or \"mating-type\" locus.  Mt                    exemplifies a master regulatory gene orchestrating the                          expression of groups of unlinked cell-type-specific genes.                      This proposal describes work designed to determine which                        aspects of sexual development are under direct mt regulation,                   and to define the circuitry of genetic pathways that                            underlies progression of the sexual cycle.  Intensive                           searches for mutant phenotypes showing mating-type-limited                      expression will be conducted.  Altered chloroplast gene                         transmission (under mt control) will be used to identify                        mating-type-limited (mt1) mutants.  Through the                                 characterization of sexual development in mutant strains                        (microscopy), analysis of chloroplast inheritance (marker                       transmission genetics and DNA-specific  flourescence                            microscopy), measurement of linkage between mt1 gene loci,                      and definition of epistatic interactions between these genes                    in constructed double mutant strains, the mt locus will be                      identified and distinguished from the genes it regulates.                       Induction of second-site suppressor mutations and                               characterization of the suppressed strains will be used to                      further clarify the primary functions of the mt1 loci.                          Genetic analysis of mating mutants will also be used to                         evaluate alternative models for the mating-type \"switching\"                     typical of homothallic species.                                                                                                                                 The proposed experiments will lay a genetic foundation for                      the eventual understanding of the molecular basis of                            differentiation of the sexual stage of the organism.                            Chlamydomonas is a simple one-celled plant and an                               understanding of the mechanisms involved in the simple                          differentiation of mating types may give insight into the                       more complex mechanisms used in differentiation in higher                       plants.",
