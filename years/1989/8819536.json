 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds for three faculty, one                       senior research associate, one research assistant and three                     graduate students to continue their research in elementary                      particle physics.                                                                    1.  The group has been the originator and major                            contributor of a Positron Electron Project Time Projection                      Chamber (TPC) two gamma experiment at the Stanford Linear                       Accelerator Center (SLAC).  The experiment has already provided                 unique results on charm production in gamma collisions but due                  to lack of integrated luminosity many aspects of two photon                     physics have been left untouched so far.  With the modified TPC                 vertex detector and with the higher luminosity expected at SLAC                 this experiment is well suited for resolving some of the                        remaining problems (annihilation - B physics).                                       2.  The efforts of the group include also a monopole                       search using large arrays of proportional chambers with a He                    gas mixture.  The experiment has set nice limits at low beta                    but will run for another year to improve statistics.                                 3.  A calorimeter R&D has also been started by the group                   in collaboration with CERN (European Organization for Nuclear                   Research in Switzerland) and NIKHEF (the Netherlands Institute                  for High energy Physics in Amsterdam).  A new configuration,                    the \"spaghetti\" calorimeter, has been well received by the high                 energy physics community since it appears that radiation damage                 problems are under control.  Results will be important for                      future detectors at SSC, LEP 200, etc.",
