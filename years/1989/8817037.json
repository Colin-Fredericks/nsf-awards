 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prolonged residence in Antarctica is associated with profound changes in        thyroid hormone economy.  Results from previous research by Dr. Reed            have shown that human pituitary thyrotropin (TSH) responsiveness to             hypothalamic releasing hormone (TRH) is increased by 50%, and                   triiodothyronine (T3) production rate (PR), metabolic clearance rate            (MCR), and volume of distribution (TVD), are increased 150%, 160%, and          230% respectively over paired control values after 42 weeks residence in        McMurdo, Antarctica.  The mechanisms for these changes, and the                 physiologic and psychological significance of them are at present               unknown.  In this proposal, the investigator will continue studies in           this area by investigating the human circulating blood lymphocyte as a          model for the human tissue response to alterations in thyroid hormones          found with prolonged Antarctic residence.  Circulating lymphocytes              (which accurately reflect systemic thyroid activity at the tissue level)        will be isolated before, during, and after 42 weeks of Antarctic                residence.  These lymphocytes will then be analyzed for changes in              nuclear T3 receptor number and/or affinity, and the T3 receptor                 precursor messenger RNA, in order to determine concomitant cellular and         sub-cellular alterations associated with the changes in peripheral T3           TVD, PR and MCR as previously described.",
