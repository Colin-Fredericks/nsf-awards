 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the brain, sensory systems often show an spatial mapping                 of sensory stimulus properties.  In such a \"map\" an array of                    neighboring nerve cells shows a systematic variation in the                     responsiveness, or \"tuning\", of each cell to some particular                    sensory parameter, such as the pitch of a sound or the                          orientation of a visual bar.  It is not yet understood just how                 such highly specific maps develop, nor how that development may                 depend on experience.                                                                                                                                           This project uses a part of a relatively simple insect nervous                  system that has physiologically characterized and  individually                 identifiable neurons.  The cricket has a pair of sensory                        appendages, called cerci, at its rear end.  Each cercus is very                 sensitive to airborne sounds and vibrations, and sends sensory                  signals to a central ganglion where interneurons initiate                       appropriate motor behavior such as escape.  Extracellular and                   intracellular recordings and dye-filling will be used with                      sophisticated confocal microscopy and computer reconstruction of                the incoming afferent projections, their synaptic sites, and the                morphology of the target interneurons.  An anatomical map will be               constructed using projections of single neurons that encode wind                velocity and wind direction.  This map predicts where activity                  should occur in the system for a particular stimulus, and will be               tested by activity-dependent dyes during physiological tests.                   The objective is to describe the structural and functional                      organization of this well-defined, topographically mapped sensory               system.  The development of this map will be traced from younger                tages, to compare to the adult map, and to see whether                          functional changes occur during development.                                                                                                                    Results from this novel approach will have impact on many areas                 of sensory and developmental neuroscience, by clarifying the                    cellular mechanisms of this widespread mapping principle.",
