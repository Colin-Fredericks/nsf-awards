 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this grant is to study the developmental changes that            occur in structure and function of hemocyanin, the blue, copper                 containing respiratory protein that is found dissolved in the blood of          arthropods and molluscs.  Respiratory proteins, hemocyanins, hemoglobins        and hemerythrins, are excellent models for unique insights into the             structure of oxygen transport molecules and how the molecules combine           reversibly with oxygen.  A dramatic change in hemocyanin subunit                composition and oxygen binding properties occurs during development from        late larval stage, or megalopa, to adult in the locally abundant                Dungeness crab, Cancer magister.  Hemocyanin expression in the                  unfertilized egg or oocyte, the fertilized embryo, and the newly hatched        larval stage or zoea, will be analyzed to determine when changes in             hemocyanin expression occur.  Where and how the hemocyanin molecules are        synthesized will be determined in the crab.  Larval Dungeness crabs are         active swimmers in the well oxygenated surface waters of estuaries and          open ocean whereas the adult crab is found buried or walking along the          less oxygenated muddy sandy bottom of estuaries and the nearshore.              Accordingly, experiments in both laboratory and field will ask how a            stage specific hemocyanin might be of help to the crab at a particular          time in its life cycle and how the protein enables the animal to respond        to environmental stresses such as temperature, salinity and low oxygen.         Metabolic studies will also be done to see whether the functional               properties of larval hemocyanin are related to the physiological demands        of the larva versus the adult.                                                                                                                                  These studies will provide models to explore the relationship between a         protein's structure and its functional properties, a central question in        understanding how protein molecules work.  Information on the site and          manner of hemocyanin synthesis will help to increase our knowledge of           other medically important copper containing proteins such as cytochrome         oxidase.  The relationship of respiratory proteins to one another and to        other families of proteins is of great interest to the field of                 evolutionary biology.  In addition, the Dungeness crab is a commercially        important fishery in the Pacific Northwest.  Information about the              crab's development and the role hemocyanin plays in its tolerance to            various environmental conditions will enhance management of the natural         fishery as well as efforts to develop a viable Dungeness crab                   aquaculture industry.",
