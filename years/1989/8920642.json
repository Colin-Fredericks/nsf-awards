 "awd_abstract_narration": "Object-oriented database systems with behavioral encapsulation                  support powerful data abstractions but are generally slow.                      Conventional database systems provide efficient query                           processing, but limited data modeling facilities.  This                         research project seeks new techniques that combine the power                    of abstract data types with database optimization technology                    into a semantically powerful and efficient query and command                    processing system.                                                                                                                                              If behavior is encapsulated, a central query optimizer cannot                   reason about semantics, behavior, and cost over an entire                       query.  The key to performing optimization of queries over                      encapsulated types is in revealing such information to a                        trusted system component, and in ensuring that the behavior                     will not change between the points of revelation and                            evaluation.  Since syntactic analysis of type and behavior                      definition may yield only limited performance improvement, the                  type implementor will be able to reveal other relevant                          information. The project includes the definition of an                          object-oriented data language, an algebraic query language that                 permits optimization, a revealing mechanism, an extensible                      optimizer, and a software prototype to validate the                             investigated concepts and ideas.                                                                                                                                The goal of the research is to develop a key technique that                     will allow object-oriented database systems with encapsulated                   behavior to attain performance comparable to extensible                         relational systems, thus making such systems viable                             alternatives for managing large data volumes.",
