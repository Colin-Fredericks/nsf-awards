This integrated, project-                 based and research-oriented laboratory program operates with                    individualized \"mini-research\" projects, thereby offering                       students superior learning and rapid growth in independence.                    Students use the computing center for data acquisition and                      analysis, simulation and illustration, and for computational                    chemistry projects.  The center also allows the presentation of                 calculational methods, including molecular mechanics, semi-                     empirical, and ab initio, to an entire laboratory section at one                time.  The center allows the students to apply these methods in                 individualized research-level activities, working side by side,                 helping each other in a group setting.  The center help the                     students toward a smoother transition to graduate school and                    industrial settings, attract the interest of potential majors,                  and provide an example of innovative laboratory curriculum for                  other chemistry departments.  The institution is matching the NSF               grant with an equal amount of funds.",
