 "awd_abstract_narration": "The production of a highly polished, damage-free wafer surface is               generally acknowledged as a critical first step in the fabrication of           semiconductor devices.  In the case of gallium arsenide (GaAs),                 however, little is known concerning the microscopic aspects of the              polishing process.  A research program is proposed that will determine          the effect of wafer polishing (specifically the chemical-mechanical             polishing that is commonly used in GaAs substrate fabrication) on the           level of surface and subsurface damage in GaAs.  The principal tool to          be employed in this work is x-ray diffraction performed under                   conditions to maximize the diffracted intensity from the surface and            subsurface regions.  Techniques such as diffraction under conditions            of grazing incidence reflection, inclined Bragg plane diffraction, and          triple crystal diffraction will be utilized for their sensitivity to            both the wafer surface and to the subtle defects that are expected to           accompany a high quality chemical-mechanical polish.  The                       crystallographic structure of the surface layer, the strain in the              surface, and the density of defects with depth below the wafer surface          will be characterized as a function of polishing variables such as              wafer rotation speed, force on the sample, and the type and feed rate           of the chemical polishing solution.  This work will result in a                 quantitative understanding of the factors that govern the formation of          defects during the chemical-mechanical polishing of device-quality              GaAs substrates.",
