 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vertebrate paleontology collection of the Stovall                      Museum, University of Oklahoma, constitutes a major US holding of               such materials, is one of the best existing records of vertebrate               evolution in the southern plains, and is in various respects a                  unique research resource.  The Paleozoic and Mesozoic holdings,                 in particular, contain a number of type specimens and exceptional               series, including a large collection of Oklahoma Permian                        tetrapods and singular dinosaur faunas or specimens.  The                       collection was amassed during a short interval earlier in this                  century and was never properly curated; because of ensuing                      decades of inactivity and neglect, the specimens are currently                  inaccessible and thus not available for research purposes.  The                 University has, in recent years, taken positive steps to redress                past deficiencies in collections care, has re-established an                    active program in vertebrate paleontology, and has committed                    itself to increased levels of support for the future.  This                     project will support recovery of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic                     vertebrates, which are most in demand for research purposes.                    This program will involve 1) installation of the appropriate                    specimens in proper storage units; and 2) specimen                              identification, conservation, reassociation with field data, and                cataloging.  Recovery of the collection will restore its capacity               as a resource for research and education, will permit projected                 levels of institutional support to maintain high standards in                   collections management for the future, and will enable the                      collection to experience renewed growth.",
