 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lysosomal proteases are active in cellular protein turnover and             degradation of molecules which enter the cell by phagocytosis.  Like            secretory proteins, they are synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes.           Two pathways exist for their subsequent sorting from secretory proteins         and transport to lysosomes.  In fibroblasts, a phosphotransferase adds          phosphate to mannose residues, forming the mannose-6-phosphate                  recognition marker which enables lysosomal proteins to react with               specific receptors which carry them to lysosomes.  In kidney and liver          cells, an alternative pathway exists but the sorting sequences on the           lysosomal enzymes and the cellular receptor it reacts with have not been        characterized.  Thus transport to the lysosome is not a default pathway         but rather requires that biosynthetic forms of the lysosomal enzymes be         recognized by specific cellular enzymes in a complex sequence.  While           the active sites of lysosomal cysteine proteases have been carefully            studied, virtually nothing is known about the structural motifs which           constitute processing enzyme or receptor binding sites on lysosomal             enzymes.  We will define these surface sequences for the lysosomal              cysteine protease cathepsin L by coupling analysis of protein structure         with molecular biology technology.  Mutant enzymes will be constructed          by site-specific and/or saturation mutagenesis techniques and introduced        into eukaryotic cells by electroporation.  Proper cellular segregation          of the mutant enzymes will be assayed by immunofluorescence, pulse-chase        analysis of the biosynthesis of the expressed protein, and cell                 fractionation.  By this method we hope to identify the specific amino           acid sequences recognized by the phosphotransferase and to identify             surface sequences critical to the recognition of cathepsin L by                 processing proteases responsible for propeptide removal, asymmetric             cleavage into light and heavy chains, and removal of carboxyl terminal          amino acids.                                                                        This research addresses an important and timely problem in modern           cell biology, namely, what are the mechanisms responsible for the               correct sorting of cellular or secretory proteins.  A successful outcome        of this work will increase our understanding of section protein-protein         interactions and the basis of recognition specificity.",
