 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been established that the concentration of methane has more              than doubled over the past 100-200 years and that nitrous oxide                 levels have increased by some 20%.  These changes are probably                  caused by increasing emissions from human activities and possibly               from reduction in the capacity of the atmosphere to remove                      methane.  Increased concentrations of both gases can add to the                 global warming expected from the increasing concentrations of CO2.              Changes, during ice ages and other colder periods, probably                     reflect the response of the biogenic sources in the world's                     ecosystems.  As the earth warms up in the future, these ecosystems              may emit more and more CH4 and N2O into the atmosphere, causing a               positive feedback on the cycles of these gases and hence on the                 world's climate.  This program has 3 components:  1.  recovery of               ice core samples from Vostok Station; 2.  laboratory analyses of                ice samples to measure CH4 and N2O over the 150,000 years spanned               by the core and supplemented by analyses of other available cores.              The expected results are primary data on the changes of N2O during              heating and cooling of the earth and more complete data on the                  response of CH4 to climatic changes; 3. delineate the patterns in               the data and assess the causes of the changes of concentrations                 that occur during ice ages.  These analyses will provide                        information on how the sources and sinks of these gases respond to              climatic changes and may provide a basis for understanding what                 may occur in the future.",
