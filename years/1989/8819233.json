 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this proposal are to investigate the molecular                genetic and developmental mechanisms that regulate myosin heavy                 chain (MHC) isoform structure and function in Drosophila. Unlike                other organisms studied, Drosophila has only a single muscle MHC                gene, but this single gene encodes multiple MHC protein isoforms                by a process of complex, developmentally regulated alternative                  RNA splicing. The Drosophila MHC gene has five sets of                          alternatively splice exons that are differentially expressed in                 different larval and adult muscle types. These alternatively                    spliced exons are particularly interesting because they encode                  defined protein domains in the MHC head and hinge regions as well               as the carboxyl terminus. These domains are hypothesized to be                  important determinants of the distinct contractile activities of                specialized muscle types, including control of ATP binding and                  ATPase activity, actin/myosin cross bridge formation, myosin                    light chain binding, MHC head movement, and myosin filament                     assembly. Genetic, biochemical and transgenic experiment are                    proposed to investigate the muscle-specific functions of the                    variant protein domains in MHC isoforms generated by alternative                exon splicing. These approaches will also be used to investigate                the roles of intron and exon DNA sequences and RNA and protein                  splicing factors in the regulated splicing of specific exon                     sequences into MHC isoforms expressed in functionally specialized               muscles such as the indirect flight muscle.                                     %%%                                                                             The proposed studies undertake to reveal the functions of                       specific variants of MHC in specialized contractile activities of               different skeletal muscle types and to define fundamental                       developmental and molecular mechanisms that control alternative                 RNA splicing. This alternative splicing gives rise to a family of               proteins with different properties from a single gene.",
