 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses three major aspects of research to                      elucidate the mechanisms underlying cardiac rhythms:  (1) single                channel gating mechanisms, (2) reconstructing caridac action                    potentials, and three effects of pharmacological agents on the                  propagation of action potentials.  The general approach is                      mathematical modeling and correlation of the models with                        experimental data derived from the physiological studies of                     others.  Specifically, the first part of this proposal deals with               the ionic channel activity in heart cells from the viewpoint of                 non-Markovian Weibull kinetics.  Markovian models will be                       compared with non-Markovian models to determine their relative                  merits and to determine whether the non-Markovian Weibull model                 can be classified as a \"fractal\" model.  The second part of the                 proposal deals with the construction of a minimal unified model                 for cardiac action potentials using experimental data on action                 currents obtained by others, so as to study the dynamic role of                 compartmentalized calcium ions under spontaneous beating                        conditions, and to construct a mathematical model for the cardiac               action potential.  The third part of this proposal deals with                   elucidation of the effect of calcium channel blockers on the                    action potential propagation.  To acheive these objectives the                  cardiac impulse initiation and propagation will be simulated using              the Cray X-MP/48 supercomputer and study how changes in the ionic               channel properties would alter the properties of the propagating                waves.                                                                                                                                                          The availability of advanced scientific computers has greatly                   expanded the possibility for using mathematical modeling as an                  approach to study physiological processes.  Although models of                  the heart action potential have been of interest for many years,                experimental advances have provided new information that can now                be incorporated into more sophisticated models which, in turn,                  may point to more refined experiments.  The ultimate goal of                    these approaches is to develop a thorough understanding of the                  electrical phenomena that underly the rythmic activity of the                   heart.",
