 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Dr. David M. Bodily of the University of Utah           to conduct collaborative research for nine months with Dr. Yosuke               Maekawa of the Government Industrial Development Laboratory, Hokkaido           and Dr. Yoshiki Sato of the National Research Institute for Pollution           and Resources in Tsukuba, Japan.  They will investigate the action of           metal sulfides and halides in catalyzing coal liquefaction.                     Combinations of hydrogenation and cracking catalysts under different            conditions of temperature, pressure, concentration, donor solvent,              and nature of the gas phase, will be studied as they affect the                 design of a real coal liquefaction plant in Japan.                              If coal liquefaction processes which operate at lower temperatures and          pressures than are now possible were to be developed, the economic              feasibility of using coal as an energy source would be greatly                  increased.  The effectiveness of metal sulfides and halides in                  improving coal liquefaction without requiring the use of very high              pressures or temperatures will be studied.  In this work, the strong            research groups in Hokkaido and Tsukuba will complement the experience          of the Principal Investigator.",
