 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between the structural and surface                             characteristics of catalysts based on molybdenum oxide and the                  selectivity of these catalysts in the partial oxidation of                      methane is investigated.  Among the issues addressed are the                    nature of active sites, the effects of promoters, catalyst-                     support interactions, the role of lattice oxygen, and the                       participation of the gas-phase oxidant. Supported,                              unsupported, and promoted catalysts are prepared and                            characterized using laser Raman spectroscopy, X-ray                             diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with three-                           dimensional imaging, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray                    photoelectron spectroscopy, steady-state kinetics, and                          transient response experiments.  The role of lattice oxygen in                  the oxidation reaction is examined using in situ laser Raman                    spectroscopy in conjunction with isotopic labelling.                                                                                                            Methane is readily available from natural gas or refinery                       effluents.  Its direct partial oxidation to methanol or                         formaldehyde would offer major savings in both capital                          and operating costs over traditional methods of making these                    products.  Molybdenum-oxide catalysts show promise for this                     conversion, but further study is needed to obtain a practical                   process.",
