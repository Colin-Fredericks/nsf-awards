 "awd_abstract_narration": "A scanning tip microscopy laboratory has been established at the                Optical Sciences Center, University of Arizona, which aims to                   characterize isolated semiconductor clusters used for nonlinear optics          interactions.  The characterization facility is a crucial link between          fabrication and application groups working in the field of lightwave            technology, because it makes possible tailoring the fabricated media            to the applications requirements.  The laboratory capabilities include          scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), scanning force microscopy (SFM),           and near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM).  Acquisition of              several pieces of equipment would enhance these capabilities.                                                                                                   1.  General purpose:  a spectrum analyzer is needed to monitor the              acoustical and mechanical noise that exists during the interaction of           the tip and sample.  A single spectrum analyzer will serve six                  different ongoing experimental efforts.                                                                                                                         2.  UHV-STM:  a Knudsen source is needed for semiconductor                      fabrication, a magnetic rotary drive to transport samples, and a LEED           and Auger for surface analysis.                                                                                                                                 3.  Sputtering gun and power supply.                                                                                                                            4.  Molecular Modeling Computer.",
