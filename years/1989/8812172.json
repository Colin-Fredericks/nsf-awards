 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intercellular communication mediated by bioactive substances                    occurs in virtually all multicellular systems.  Chemical                        neurotransmission in the vertebrate nervous system represents a                 form of this type of signalling.  Fast chemical signalling                      (within milliseconds), in which the neurotransmitter is released                at specialized neuronal junctions, called synapses, stimulates                  the opening of receptor-controlled ion channels in the post-                    synaptic cell.  There is evidence that the amino acids, glutamate               and aspartate, may represent the principal fast transmitters used               by many central neurons.  However, the actions of some chemical                 mediators, for instance neuropeptides, are slow (acting over                    seconds or even minutes) and they are functionally important as                 modulators of synaptic transmission.                                                                                                                            Since the chemical nature of excitatory synaptic transmitters in                the mammalian spinal cord is still unknown, this research project               will analyze cellular mechanisms underlying the rat spinal dorsal               horn in vitro.  The experiments will be directed at the role of                 excitatory amino acid synaptic mediators (l-glutamate and its                   analogues), receptors for excitatory amino acids, the role of                   tachykinins (substance P and neurokinin A), and the activation of               intracellular second messenger systems (phoshoinositides) by                    excitatory amino acids and the tachykinins.                                                                                                                     Specific objectives to be examined are: 1) the pharmacological                  properties and ionic mechanisms of fast and slow excitatory                     postsynaptic potentials in the rate spinal cord slice                           preparation.  The emphasis will be on NMDA receptors, since                     information about their role in primary afferent transmission is                lacking; 2) the possibility of the involvement of second                        messenger systems (phosphoinositides and cyclic nucleotides) in                 the regulation of actions of excitatory amino acids and                         tachykinins at afferent synapses in the rat spinal dorsal horn;                 and 3) modulation of voltage-dependent calcium conductance of                   acutely-isolated rat dorsal horn neurons by excitatory amino                    acids, tachykinins and second messengers using whole-cell voltage               clamp technique with a patch microelectrode.  These studies will                provide for a better understanding of synaptic signalling via                   chemical mediators within the nervous system.",
