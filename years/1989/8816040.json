 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin of massif anorthosites and associated alkaline                  rocks remains an important problem.  To date our studies of the                 Laramie Anorthosite Complex, one of the few unmetamorphosed                     massif anorthosite complexes in the world, have focussed on the                 evolved rocks:  the monozosyenites of Red Mountain, Sybille, and                Maloin Ranch.  We have found evidence  for differentiation and                  variable contamination in these bodies, and in the Maloin have                  identified an additional process in which less evolved biotite                  gabbro magma has mixed with differentiated magma.  Our                          preliminary Sr and Nd isotopic data indicate that no units of the               L.A.C. are simple depleted mantle-drived melts, but that all--                  even the anorthosites--have interacted with the crust to some                   degree.  Moreover, the evolved plutons each have unique Sr and Nd               isotope characteristics indicating that, although their mineral                 chemistries suggests that they evolved by similar processes,                    they evolved independently and assimilated crustal materials to                 different degrees.                                                                   Our work to date allows us to identify several important                   goals:  (1) We must produce petrochemical models of the differen-               tiation processes within the Complex, focussing in particular on                the isotopic and chemical trends within the anorthosites that are               produced by country rock contamination on transitional contacts                 between the anorthosite and monzosyenites, and on the gabbroic                  bodies that have evolved with little country rock interaction.                  (2) We must determine the extent of layered and unlayered anor-                 thosite, determine the cause of the layering, and assess whether                any or all of these anorthosites was emplaced as a diapir.  (3)                 We will determine whether changes in oxygen fugacity and silica                 activity are correlated to crustal contamination.  (4) We will                  study composite dikes to determine whether the mafic portions are               related to residual magmas from the anorthosite units. (5) We                   will continue to determine the absolute age of the various units.               (6) Finally, we will attempt to determine the origin(s) of the                  magmas that produced the Complex.",
