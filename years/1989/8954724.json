 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will produce videodisc based instructional                         materials for use in improving the preparation of elementary                    level teachers to teach mathematics.  Video images of                           exemplary mathematics teaching will be coupled with analyses                    of lessons that examine both pedagogy and mathematical                          content.  Videotapes of lessons will be recorded across a                       year's instruction in a third and a fifth grade class.  The                     teachers in these classes will be distinguished professors of                   mathematics education.  Their teaching will be grounded in a                    disciplinary perspective on mathematics and will reflect                        current thinking about what ought to be occurring in                            mathematics classes at the elementary level.  They will also                    have a greater capacity than full-time teachers to stand back                   from their practice and analyze it with observers.  In                          addition to videos of lessons, audio and written accounts of                    the teachers' reflections on why they did what they did and                     audio and written commentaries on the lessons by                                mathematicians, school-based collaborators, teacher                             educators, and educational researchers will be prepared.                        These will be attached to the lessons in a hypermedia                           computer system in order to support random and flexible                         access to cases and analyses from multiple perspectives.                        Students and instructors will also be able to construct their                   own analyses.  It is expected that these materials will have                    an impact on the way teacher education is structured in the                     university setting.  Through the project more should also be                    learned about the potential for new kinds of information,                       presented using new kinds of media, to change the way                           perspective teachers and teacher educators think about                          mathematics teaching.                                                                                                                                           The cost sharing will be eleven percent of the National                         Science Foundation portion.",
