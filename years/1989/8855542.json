 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project is designed to improve the quality of                      instruction of physics and physical science in Virginia and                     neighboring parts of West Virginia and Tennessee.  Program                      components include: (1) Summer course-work sessions during                      the summers of 1989 and 1990.  Summer 1989 courses will                         include physics fundamentals and techniques for teaching                        physics concepts.  Summer 1990 courses will be topically                        oriented and build on the foundation from 1989.  Courses will                   include Computers in Physics Education, The Physics Around                      You, Electromagnetic Devices, and a seminar in current                          research topics.  (2) Academic year 1989-90 activities will                     include four 8-hour Saturday seminars on campus for sharing                     experiences with new techniques, presentations by active                        researchers, and workshops on teaching topics to be selected                    by participants. Academic year 1990-91 will include two more                    such seminars.  (3) Each participant will conduct or assist                     in conducting two workshops for other teachers in his/her own                   geographical area.  A total of 14 such workshops will be                        held.  (4) A Physics Telephone Hotline will be available on                     which any teacher may call the Virginia Tech Physics                            Department for assistance with a teaching concern.  (5) An                      electronic bulletin board will be maintained for                                communication between participants, staff, and other teachers                   for sharing ideas, data, and techniques.                                                                                                                        Twenty one participants will be recruited -- 1/3 experienced                    and 2/3 inexperienced.  Special attention will be given to                      teachers from the rural schools.  Visitation of each                            participant's school by faculty provided the primary                            evaluation of the program.  Cost-sharing is approximately 28%                   of the National Science Foundation request.",
