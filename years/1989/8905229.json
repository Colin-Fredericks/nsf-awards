 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fold-thrust belts are formed as a result of translation of a               wedge of sedimentary rocks along a system of interconnected                     faults that include decollement flats, frontal ramps, and lateral               connectors (such as transverse faults, lateral ramps, and zones                 of displacement transfer).  Lateral connectors are commonly                     aligned across strike of the fold-thrust belt; the transverse                   alignments of lateral connectors have been called cross-strike                  structural discontinuities (CSDs).  CSDs are common features of                 fold-thrust belts and are potentially significant in exploration                for petroleum, ground water, and ore deposits.  The internal                    geometry and kinematics of the complete length of CSDs are not                  well known.  Lateral connectors and CSDs are as important in the                overall make-up of fold-thrust belts as frontal ramps, but the                  lateral connectors have been much less studied.  Detailed studies               of structure and stratigraphy within a CSD are designed to                      address the following important questions:  whether or not inter-               nal structural components of CSDs are systematically arrayed                    along the trend or with respect to stratigraphic and/or                         structural levels; whether or not CSDs are genetically linked to                pre-thrust structures (basement faults), to stratigraphic varia-                tions caused by synsedimentary pre-thrust structures, and/or                    structures in the autochthon; and how CSDs function kinematically               within a fold-thrust belt.",
