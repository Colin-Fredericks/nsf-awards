 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, within the Organic Dynamics Program,is by a young                 investigator, Robert C. Corcoran of the University of                           Nevada-Reno, who will study methods for increasing the chemical                 reactivity of certain oxygen containing organic compounds.  The                 resulting information is expected to aid in the design of                       catalysts to allow more rapid and/or stereoselective reactions                  at these functional groups.                                                                                                                                     Stereoelectronic effects in the Lewis  acid activation of the                   oxygen in acetals and carbonyls are to be investigated. In the                  Lewis acid mediated cleavage of acetals the acid may complex                    with an oxygen lone pair which is antiperiplanar to the                         adjacent C-O bond, or to one which is gauche; a kinetic                         preference for activation of the antiperiplanar lone pair                       should be observable.  Two modes of Lewis acid activation of                    carbonyl oxygens are possible; in the plane of the carbonyl, or                 perpendicular to that plane.  Though in-plane complexation is                   generally assumed to be the dominant mode of activation,                        perpendicular complexation may also play a role.                                The existence of stereoelectronic preferences in the activation                 of oxygens in these systems will be investigated by examining                   conformationally rigid systems which incorporate a Lewis base                   appendage that can cooperate with the oxygen in question in a                   chelate ring.  The chelation-directed complexation will allow                   the selective positioning of a Lewis acid with respect to the                   target oxygen.  Rate differences between otherwise similar                      substrates which are differentially activated in a geometric                    sense will be an indication of steroelectronic preferences.                     The determination of such stereoelectronic preferences will aid                 diastereoselectivity in the reactions of acetals and carbonyl                   compounds.",
