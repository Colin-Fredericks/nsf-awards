 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Burtrand I. Lee,                     Department of Ceramic Engineering, Clemson University, to                       pursue with Dr. Seung Bum Park, Department of Civil                             Engineering, Chungnam University, Taejon, Korea, for a period                   of 24 months, a program of research on the development of                       carbon fiber reinforced cement composites.  The objectives of                   the project are to (1) develop surface modification techniques                  for carbon fibers, (2) fabricate carbon fiber reinforced                        cement composites, and (3) understand the fiber/matrix                          interactions and the effects on mechanical properties of the                    composites.  These objectives will be met by oxidizing the                      surface of commercially available carbon fibers in various                      degrees and incorporating the fibers in portland cement paste                   followed by curing.  The cured composites will be                               characterized for microstructure, mechanical properties, and                    physical properties as functions of fiber physical and surface                  characteristics, curing, etc.                                                                                                                                   Cement materials are extremely brittle.  Although this                          brittleness may be modified by fine and coarse aggregate in                     mortar and concrete, these materials are still very brittle                     when compared to other common construction materials such as                    steel and wood.  The incorporation of fibers into the cement                    matrix is the practical solution to the brittleness problem.                    Fibers of several types - steel, asbestos, glass, and                           polypropylene - are among those that have been used with                        success in the past.  Carbon fibers are of interest because of                  the high strength, low specific gravity, and high stiffness                     they impart to the cement composites.  The collaborators will                   prepare carbon fiber/cement composites and study the effect of                  pretreatment of the carbon fibers on the properties of the                      composite.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the                   U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase                  the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists                     and engineers through the exchange of scientific information,                   ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on                      problems of mutual benefit.  The U.S. and Korean collaborators                  are highly respected scientists with complementary expertise                    in the preparation and study of concrete composites.  The cost                  of Korean participation in this project will be borne by the                    Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF)",
