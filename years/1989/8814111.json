 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large numbers of maps are accessioned regularly by map libraries,          where they are a major source of information for geographers and other          scholars.  The process of cataloging those maps is time-consuming,              expensive, and prone to error, however, because many catalogers have            little substantive knowledge about the information contained on the             maps.  The complexity of information presented on many maps likely will         prevent the complete \"automation\" of the map cataloging process, but            partial assistance is possible through development of semi-automatic            systems that can be use to rapidly classify much of the information on          maps.  This doctoral dissertation research project will conduct a more          comprehensive inventory of the criteria currently used to catalog               maps.  These criteria then will be used to define a set of decision             rules and develop a computer-based program to assist nonexperts in              classifying maps, and that program will be tested in an experimental            framework to determine if it is faster and more effective than current          methods.                                                                             The first part of this project will increase general theoretical           understandings about how map information is used to catalog maps,               while the second and third offer prospects for development of a minor           \"expert system\" that can economically assist in the cataloging                  process.  This project should help determine the degree to which                certain steps in the map cataloging process can be efficiently handled          by nonexperts, thereby freeing persons more knowledgeable in the                content of the maps for more sophisticated analyses.",
