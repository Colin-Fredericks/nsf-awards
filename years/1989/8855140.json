The research component of the program will give the participants                experience in research under the supervision of an academic researcher.         The participants will carry out individual research projects.  In the           areas of specialization of their mentors.  The participants will give           oral presentations of their research results at the conclusion of the           summer program.                                                                                                                                                 The program of scheduled seminars and research will provide participants        in the program with a structured environment for instruction in research        methods, philosophy, ethics of science, and career exploration.                 Numerus field trips are planned to reinforce the seminar portion of the         program.
