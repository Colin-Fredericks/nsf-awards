 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference will bring together 20 philosophers of biology,                 developmental biologists, evolutionary biologists, and                          theoretical biologists to examine a number of philosophical and                 conceptual issues which arise in developmental biology and its                  implications for evolution.  The three focal areas will concern:                1) the place of theory in developmental biology;  2) self-                      organization and selection as balancing and collaborative                       processes in development and evolution;  and 3) implications of a               proper theory of development for evolution.  Some of these issues               are not new, others have never been addressed.  In particular,                  the intertwined roles of self-organization and selection                        constitute a large new problem area never confronted in physics,                nor yet well formulated in biology. The group which will come                   together includes expertise in a variety of areas of philosophy                 and biology which bear on the issues raided.  The aim is to                     produce a clear statement of research programs to advance in each               of the three domains.  The results of the conference will                       hopefully be published in the Quarterly Review of Biology, and                  also will likely be published in a single volume from the Santa                 Fe Institute.",
