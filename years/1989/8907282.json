 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant is                in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in                  the subfields of surface spectroscopy and separations science.                  During the twelve month period beginning 1 June 1989, Professor                 Conroy will conduct studies to test the feasibility of using                    selected biomolecules as vibrational spectroscopic probes to                    investigate interactions of these molecules with metal oxide                    surfaces of importance as stationary phases in chromatography.                  These studies will be carried out in the presence and absence of                solvents of varying polar character.  The goal of this work is to               point the way to more detailed characterizations of the molecular               interactions that serve as the basis for chromatographic                        separations of biologically important species.  These activities                should contribute to Professor Conroy's establishing an                         independent research program at Virginia Polytechnic Institute                  and State University.                                                                                                                                           The research area that is being investigated in this project is                 broadly important in separations science, surface science, and                  biotechnology.  The results of this work could lead to the                      development of new techniques of bioseparations and the                         optimization of existing ones.",
