 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two projects in observational cosmology will be carried out.  One               project is the continuing exploration of the large-scale                        structure of the universe, as delineated by the distribution of                 galaxies.  A large redshift survey in the north and south                       galactic polar caps will be used to explore volumes approximately               500 megaparsecs across.  Of particular interest will be the                     structures in which galaxies occur, the properties of large voids               in space, and the largest scale on which the universe is                        inhomogeneous.  Attention will be given to the question of                      whether galaxies are, indeed, reliable tracers of the mass                      distribution in the universe.                                                                                                                                   The second project is the study of the evolution of stellar                     populations in galaxies during the last half of the age of the                  universe.  An attempt will be made to establish whether the                     evolution which has been shown to occur in the members of compact               clusters of galaxies is characteristic of all galaxies, or is                   instead, the result of some process internal to the clusters.                   The properties of galaxies in several different environments will               be used to test for an environmental dependence of evolution.                   The properties of nearby spherical (SO) galaxies will be examined               to ascertain if they represent the end-point of the observed                    evolution of galaxies.",
