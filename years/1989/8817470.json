 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Minority Research Initiation (MRI) Planning Grant proposal.           The proposed research will attempt to pinpoint the reasons why the              problem-solving skills of black high school students remain below the           national average for white high school students and why the development         of these skills among black students are actually on the decline.  This         study is timely, much needed, and is expected to contribute to the base         of scientific knowledge.                                                                                                                                        The planning grant will provide funds to support the activities of a            well-trained minority scientist to plan and prepare a competitive               proposal for submission to the MRI research initiation component.               During the planning period, the principal investigator will conduct an          exhaustive review of the literature and collaborate with senior                 researchers to select a national database, an appropriate research              design and suitable data analytical techniques.",
