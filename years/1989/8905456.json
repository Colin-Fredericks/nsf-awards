 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work to be done will focus on several aspects of the                       behavior of solutions to nonlinear differential and                             difference equations.  It includes studies of the porous                        medium flow which occurs traditionally in the study of ideal                    gas flow, but also arises in plasma physics, population                         dynamics and heat conduction.  Particular emphasis will be                      placed on the corresponding equations in higher space                           dimensions.  The ultimate goal is to determine the regularity                   class for weak solutions to the equations.  In one                              dimensional flow the optimal global regularity is Lipschitz                     continuity for the pressure, but for flows in higher                            dimensions, the optimal result is unknown.                                           A second line of investigation involves the two-phase                      Stefan problem which seeks to describe the shape of a body                      immersed in a fluid of the same material (ice in water) as it                   diffuses.  Intuitively the shapes are expected to be                            self-similar, but this has been shown to be false.  Many                        facts are known about the two- phase problem in one space                       dimension, but very little is known about the final shape of                    a disappearing phase in higher dimensions.  Some immediate                      progress can be expected by using results from the                              one-dimensional case applied to the radially symmetric case                     in higher dimensions.                                                                Work is continuing on studies of the dynamics of                           circuits involving two current biased Josephson point                           junctions.  The dynamics are described by pairs of                              differential equations giving the phase difference in the                       electron wave function across the junctions.  Initial work                      will concentrate on establishing the existence and stability                    of in-phase rotations - solutions of the systems which agree                    for all time and are semi-periodic.  For large parameter                        values in the equations, in-phase rotations are well known                      since the equations reduce to that of a damped pendulum.                        However, as the parameter values are reduced, numerical                         simulations suggest areas of instability.  Efforts will be                      made to describe the range of instability.",
