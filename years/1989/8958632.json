 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell behavior is strongly influenced by cell surface receptor                   macromolecules.  Both theory and experiment will be used to                     study the role of receptors in several important biological                     processes including cell adhesion, viral infection, vesicle                     fusion and membrane signal transduction.  Such information                      will allow the use of receptor-binding ligands to manipulate                    cell behavior in bioreactors, and develop therapies for                         aberrant biological processes.  One area of interest is                         receptor-mediated cell adhesion to ligand-coated surfaces,                      found in cell separation technology, and in physiological                       precesses such as cancer cell metastasis.  Well-defined                         extracellular matrix-like supports which contain receptor-                      binding ligands will be developed.  Using these supports both                   the dynamic adhesion of leukocytes under flow conditions and                    the long-term adhesion, elongation and physiology of                            genetically engineered cells will be explored.  In these                        problems, experiments are analyzed using mathematical models                    which employ, real fundamental parameters.                                                                                                                      Biotechnology holds immense promise for the future.  In order                   to engineer cellular behavior for commercial and societal                       gain, it is necessary to understand cellular behavior on a                      fundamental basis.  For example, to elicit the synthesis of                     high value pharmaceuticals from cells, or treat diseases which                                                                                                  result from malfunctioning cells, it is necessary to have                       detailed information about how the cell works.  Molecules on                    the cell surface called receptors are extremely important in                    tranducing information to the cell.  It is proposed to study                    how to exploit cell receptors to manipulate and modify                          cellular behavior.  Using both mathematical modelling and                       experimental techniques, the quantitative relationship between                                                                                                  receptors and cell behavior in several important processes                      such as the adhesion of cells to surfaces, the adhesion of                      viruses to cells, and the secretion of proteins will be                         studied.  This understanding can then be used to develop                        bioreactors for pharmaceutical production, treat adhesion-                      related diseases such as the spread of cancer cells through                     the body, separate cells more efficiently, or block the                         progression of virally transmitted diseases, such as AIDS.",
