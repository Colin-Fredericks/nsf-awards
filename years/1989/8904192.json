 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop two new techniques for purifying                                                                                                   biological macromolecules such as enzymes and antibodies from                                                                                                   complex media while attaining high selectivity, yield, and                      activity.  The techniques belong to the class of affinity                       separation techniques but are distinguished by using affinity                                                                                                   surfactants.  It is proposed that the use of affinity                           surfactants increases effectiveness by limiting nonspecific                     hydrophobic interactions between different proteins that                        plague other protein precipitation techniques.  The target                      proteins for the study are the oligomeric dehydrogenase                         enzymes and the class of IgG antibodies.  Affinity surfactants                                                                                                  will be synthesized and purified as part of the project.  The                                                                                                   surfactants will be used either directly dissolved in the                       aqueous protein solution or by incorporation into unilamellar                                                                                                   vesicles.                                                                                                                                                       Precipitation is an important purification process in many                      chemical processes.  It has had limited utility in                              biotechnology because of the nonspecific nature of hydrophobic                                                                                                  interactions between proteins.  Affinity surfactant                             precipitation of proteins is a promising technique to improve                                                                                                   the usefulness of precipitation technology in downstream                        processing in biotechnology.",
