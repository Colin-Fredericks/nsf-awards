Examples of empty                    subjects are the (logical) subjects of the infinitive clauses in                such sentences as \" Felix persuaded Max to eat turnips\", or                     \"Eunice promised John to hurry home\".                                                                                                                                Although the topic of empty subjects has been studied for                  several years, non consensus has been reached, even internally to               any of the disparate theoretical frameworks in which the problem                has been addressed.  The objectives of this workshop are:                                                                                                            1)  to assess the present understanding of control related                 phenomena from the perspectives of semantics (model theoretic and               truth theoretic), syntax (categorial grammar, government and                    binding theory, and lexical functional grammar), historical                     linguistics, and language acquisition;                                                                                                                               2)  to compare and synthesize these various approaches to                  control; and                                                                                                                                                         3)  to encourage further cooperation among researchers                     working within these different theoretical frameworks.                                                                                                               The workshop will bring together leading scholars who have                 done substantial work on control phenomena from diverse                         perspectives.",
