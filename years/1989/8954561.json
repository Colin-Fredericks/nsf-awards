The modules will be developed by teams involving                      university scientists, inservice teachers, and science                          educators.  The modules will be taught by the scientists and                    carry the appropriate science-department rubric. The teaching                   institute will involve 150 secondary school teachers from                       Montana and the Rocky Mountain region over three years.                         Project outcomes will include sixteen modules in biology,                       chemistry, earth sciences, and physics developed and tested                     by special cooperative developmental teams, and an institute                    model for cooperative course development between university                     science departments and their college of education.  The                        Rocky-Mountain Institute model will be disseminated to about                    a half-dozen other universities geographically distributed                      throughout the country.                                                                                                                                         An amount equivalent to 41.6% of the NSF award is being                         contributed as cost-sharing.",
