 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main purpose of this projected study is to investigate the                  structure and regulation of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, the               enzyme involved in the catabolism of the neurotransmitter GABA.                                                                                                 The structural studies entail the elucidation of the primary                    sequence of the enzyme by either direct amino acid sequence or by               analysis of the C-DNA encoding this aminotransferase.  Valuable                 information on certain regions of the polypeptide chain modified                by specific chemical reagents have been obtained by direct amino                groups of the enzyme has been determined together with the                      identification of the SH pair undergoing oxidation/reduction.                   Tryptic peptides isolated and purified by HPLC chromatography                   will be used in further sequential studies.  It is expected that                the complete amino acid sequence of the enzyme will be elucidated               in less than two years.                                                                                                                                         Screening of a library of C-DNA clones inserted into the phage                  lambda G 11 has begun.  Two methods, i.e., hybridization with                   oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes and recognition by antibody                     probes are being used in the screening steps.  The results                      derived from the sequential studies are important for further                   analysis of specific regions of the aminotransferase by site-                   directed mutagenesis.",
