 "awd_abstract_narration": "Man's understanding of his global environment increases                    with each advance in his ability to measure its properties.  In                 particular, knowledge of photochemical transformations in the                   earth's atmosphere and of the wide array of chemical processes                  occurring in both remote and urban areas has developed in                       conjunction with research quality instrumentation capable of                    probing the composition of the atmosphere with increasingly                     greater resolution.  Several gases present at one part in a                     billion or trillion play important and often crucial roles in                   chemical or radiative processes in the atmosphere.                                   In this project, a new and evolving experimental technique                 will be extended and applied to the measurement of important                    atmospheric gases.  The technique involves the use of fixed                     frequency infrared gas lasers with frequency modulation                         methods. A major advance expected from this work is a laser                     absorption detection instrument with high sensitivity that uses                 a simple laser system, thus providing the versatility,                          affordability, sensitivity, and ruggedness necessary for                        extensive field measurements.  Development of the instrument                    will be directed at the measurement of hydrogen peroxide and                    methane.  The technique has potential for application to other                  atmospheric gases since several species are likely to have                      absorption in the infrared that can be probed by the gas laser                  system.",
