 "awd_abstract_narration": "An organizing committee has been formed to establish an                         International Mouse Genome Organization that would coordinate                   mouse genetic information databases, organize regular meetings on               the mouse genome, enhance opportunities for genetic analysis of                 the laboratory mouse and coordinate the development of maps of                  mouse and human genomes.  Participants in two international gene                mapping meetings held in Paris in September, 1987, and in the                   U.S.A. in June, 1988, have agreed there is a clear need for                     further meetings.  In August, 1989, the Third International Mouse               Genome meeting will be held in Oxford, England.  The goals of                   this meeting are (1) to provide a forum to continue the exchange                of new gene mapping data, methods for computer analysis of                      genetic data and genome mapping and sequencing data; (2) to                     establish committees to integrate complex high resolution mapping               and sequencing of specific regions of the mouse genome; (3) to                  stimulate international collaboration in mouse genome analysis;                 (4) to coordinate mouse genetic databases; and (5) to formalize                 the International Mouse Genome Organization.  The integrated high               resolution maps produced by this meeting are essential not only                 for studying mouse genome organization and evolution, but also                  for identifying mouse mutations.  Such mutations not only are                   model systems for therapy but also provide important clues about                metabolic function, bearing on development, immunology and                      cancer.  This award will support the travel of selected young                   United States scientists to participate in this important                       meeting.",
