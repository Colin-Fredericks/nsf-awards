 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wesleyan University, in association with the Connecticut Pre-Engineering        Program (CPEP) and major Connecticut organizations, will establish an           Urban Young Scholars Program.  The purpose of this project is to prepare        predominantly minority disadvantaged secondary students in mathematics          and science, to undertake guided research projects, and to formulate            their own career goals and academic needs.  Target population for the           project will be 45 disadvantaged students from Hartford, new Haven, and         Bridgeport and 15 other Connecticut youth who all are entering the 9th          and 10th grades.                                                                                                                                                Students from Hartford, New Haven, and Bridgeport and other towns will          participate in a 5 day a week summer residential program at Wesleyan.  A        major framework for interdisciplinary learning will be the NSF supported        Science, Technology and Society (STS)curriculum.  Students will choose          to major in either Physics, Chemistry, or Biology, taking a related             minor.  Strong emphasis will be placed upon mathematics and computer            learning throughout the curriculum.  Separate activities for the                Philosophy and Ethics of Science and Career Exploration will be                 presented.  Senior project staff will include Wesleyan faculty, master          high school teachers, and guest speakers who reflect varied academic,           cultural and ethnic backgrounds.  Supporting senior staff will be               college student mentors/tutors and prospective teachers interning on            Wesleyan's campus.                                                                                                                                              Wesleyan, Choate Rosemary Hall, and the Connecticut Pre-Engineering             Program will provide follow up activities throughout the 1989-90 school         year for the 60 students.  The proposed project, thus, will develop             year-round connections among these three mathematics and science                enrichment programs, offering a bridge for middle school CPEP students          to the 11th and 12th grade Connecticut Scholars Program at Choate               Rosemary Hall.",
