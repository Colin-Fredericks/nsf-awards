This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic, corporate,               and government cooperation in the support of basic research in                  the mathematical sciences.                                                           This equipment will be used to support five research                       projects in the Department of Mathematics at the University of                  Connecticut: Computational Linear Algebra, directed by I.                       Koltracht and M. Neumann; Numerical Solutions to Nonlinear                      Partial Differential Equations, directed by J. Augenbaum, Y.                    Choi, J. McKenna, and E. Tomastik; Image Restoration, Inverse                   Problems, and Signal Processing, directed by K. Grochenig and W.                Madych; Algebra, directed by G. Cornell, J. Hurley, and E.                      Spiegel; and Computational Geometry and Complex Analysis,                       directed by W. Abikoff.",
