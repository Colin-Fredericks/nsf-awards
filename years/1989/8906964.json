 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laminar flames can, under certain conditions, be inherently                     unstable, leading to wrinkled or corrugated structures.  It is                                                                                                  clear that the general character of the instability is                          intimately tied to the underlying fluid flow and by the extent                                                                                                  of heat transfer away from the flame front.  Stratified                         mixtures exist in many combustion environments, creating a                      curved and possibly unsteady propagating flame front.  The                      proposed research is directed towards a fundamental                             understanding of the behavior and response of a laminar,                        premixed flame to such non-uniformities in the flow field.                      Droplet vaporization and combustion will also be                                investigated.  The techniques to be used are the asymptotic                     and perturbation methods supplemented by numerical                              calculations, with the results compared to observed physical                    phenomena.                                                                                                                                                      One's understanding of the behavior of combustion in systems                    as complex as engines and furnaces is often enhanced by an                      analytical model of a much simplified description which                         isolates one or two controlling physical parameters.  This                      theoretical study will attempt to stretch the application of                    asymptotic and perturbation techniques to premixed flames                       propagating in non-uniform mixtures, with the objective of                      gaining insight into the effects of strain rate, flame front                    curvature, vorticity, mass diffusion, and heat transfer on the                                                                                                  flame stability.",
