 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motilin is a gastrointestinal hormone which may regulate                        intestinal motility.  The precise molecular nature and tissue                   distribution of motilin, and mechanisms of motilin induced gut                  contractions are controversial due to use of antisera against                   porcine motilin and synthetic porcine motilin for studies in non-               porcine species.  Paucity of anatomical and physiological                       information on enteric nerves in the species studied is also a                  compounding problem.                                                                                                                                            This study focuses on the synthesis, localization and function of               the prepromotilin derived peptides, motilin and motilin                         associated peptide (MAP).  Motilin cDNA from guinea pig gut will                be used to detect prepromotilin mRNA by Northern analysis and in                situ hybridization.  Nucleotide sequence determination will                     permit synthesis of guinea pig motilin and MAP for use in studies               on single enteric neurons in vitro and intestinal motility                      studies in vivo, as well for antisera generation to study                       motilin/MAP processing by RIA, HPLC and immunohistochemistry.                   Conducting these studies in guinea pigs, a species with a well                  characterized enteric nervous system, will make it possible to                  assign motilin/MAP actions to specific neuronal sub-populations                 with defined interactions and effector targets.  Studying the                   biology of motilin/MAP from the level of gene expression to                     physiological action(s) in the intact animal should define their                role in gastrointestinal function.",
