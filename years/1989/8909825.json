 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nearly all perceptual judgments can be reached by the use of more               than one sensory system.  For instance, the location of an object               can be determined visually, or alternatively, it can be                         determined without vision by using feedback, known as                           proprioceptive information, from the arm and hand groping for the               object.  Coordination of information from these different sources               is necessary in order for people to perceive a coherent world.                  This research will lead to a much more complete understanding of                that integration by determining how new mappings are acquired                   between spatial dimensions defined in different sensory systems.                The specific dimensions which the research will use are spatial                 positions proceeding from left to right localized visually and                  those same positions localized proprioceptively.  The research                  will employ a new technique, using a variable prism under                       computer control and a single light-emitting diode worn on the                  finger; this technique will allow the experimenter to divide the                continuum of visual space into discrete locations and manipulate                each location individually.                                                                                                                                     The research will address two questions:  First, is there a                     specific mathematical function that describes the relation                      between the dimensions, so that the process of learning a new                   mapping can be described by changing the values of the parameters               of the function?  Or does learning proceed by the formation of a                list of independent associations between individual locations?                  Second, what are the constraints on this learning process?  For                 example, is it constrained such that only linear relations can be               learned?                                                                                                                                                        Two complementary strategies will address these issues.  The                    first is the assessment of the influence of incomplete                          information.  Only a small subset of a mapping, consisting of                   only a few new pairs of visual-proprioceptive locations, will be                presented.  The type of interpolation and extrapolation that                    occurs to untrained locations should reveal the internal                        constraints imposed by the system.  The second is the reaction to               the assessment of complete information.  Presentation of a                      variety of complete mappings will reveal what mappings, if any,                 are unlearnable; the type of deviation from the imposed mapping                 will also reveal internal structure.",
