 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Fox's project is concerned in about equal measure                with index theory for differential operators and with the                       representation theory of Lie groups. The former subject may be                  thought of as a far-reaching outgrowth of calculus on manifolds                 (surfaces and their higher-dimensional analogues). The basic                    operations of calculus, differentiation and integration, are in                 this setting packaged together in the form of pseudodifferential                operators. These operators, which are defined in terms of the                   geometry of the manifold (distance, curvature, and the like on a                local scale), turn out to yield information about its topology                  (overall shape and conformation). Lie groups, the other area of                 investigation, arise in many mathematical situations as groups of               symmetries. An example (not quite apt in the present context                    because it happens to be compact) is the group of rotations of a                sphere, where the group operation consists of following one                     motion by another. Knowledge of this particular group is very                   helpful whenever spherical symmetry is present, and the                         representation theory of Lie groups generally may be regarded as                the systematic study of symmetry.                                                    These two main aspects of Fox's project are closely                        interwoven in that much of the index theory to be pursued is                    equivariant with respect to some (not necessarily compact) Lie                  group acting on a manifold. Kasparov's representation ring for                  non-compact groups is a focus of interest. Index formulas for                   Dirac-type geometric operators invariant under group actions will               be sought, as will an extension of the calculus of asymptotic                   pseudodifferential operators to non-compact manifolds. Some of                  this work bears on a mathematical model of the quantum Hall                     effect in physics.",
