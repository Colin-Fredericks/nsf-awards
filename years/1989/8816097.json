 "awd_abstract_narration": "Remanent magnetization directions in glacial diamictons                    have not been tested against established records of the                         geomagnetic field at the time and place of deposition and the                   accuracies of diamictons as geomagnetic field recorders have not                been determined.  An established record of Late Wisconsinan                     geomagnetic declination, from DRM in varved sediment in the                     western Mohawk Valley, New York, will be used to test the                       fidelity of remanence from contemporaneous till, sediment flow                  deposits, pelagic rainout diamicton, and subglacially deformed                  lacustrine beds.  In addition to remanence, anisotropy of                       magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and anisotropy of anhysteretic                    susceptibility (AAS) will be measured.  AMS will be used to                     determine fabrics dominated by coarse particles that carry a                    viscous remanence, while AAS should record fabrics dominated by                 fine particles that carry a stable remanence.  Petrographic                     analysis of microfabrics, AMS, and AAS will be used to determine                whether remanence directions and particle alignment in various                  types of diamictons are related to geomagnetic field orientation,               mass movement, subglacial shearing, dewatering or compaction.                   Unlike previous works, this study will:  1) test remanence                      direction against an established geomagnetic field record, 2)                   distinguish between genetic diamicton types, and 3) use AAS and                 petrofabric analysis to study grain alignment.",
