 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economic theory, as well as ordinary intuition, indicates that                  uncertainty about future income should have important effects on                people's consumption and savings decisions.  Such effects of                    uncertainty on consumption choices are of more than theoretical                 significance, since they could have an important influence on (1)               the effect of social and private insurance on the saving rate,                  (2) the effect of government debt on risky investment, (4) the                  effect of movements in wealth on consumption, and (5) the effects               of short-term and long-term real interest rates on the level and                rate of growth of consumption.  The purpose of this project is to               develop and analyze models of consumption under conditions of                   uncertainty.  Previous research has focused on relatively simple                tow period models.  This project well involve the use of more                   realistic multi-period models.  The models will be analyzed by                  the use of simulations to estimate the effects of precautionary                 saving behavior.",
