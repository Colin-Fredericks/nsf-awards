 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a response to the need for the development of a                unified formulation for the dynamics of multi flexible/rigid body               systems, and for the development of computational methods for                   efficient integration of the equations of motion of such systems.               This unification of multibody dynamics formulations is founded                  upon the concept of geometrically exact structural theories,                    theories which are nonlinear in character and where the geometry                of deformation is exactly described and deformation can be large.               The claim is made that the geometrically exact structure                        formulation can be used to treat closed loop chains with flexible               links and avoid the difficulties imposed by non holonomic                       constraints when traditional methods are employed.  To pave the                 way to the above stated goal, this project explores several                     specific topics related to flexible multibody systems.  These                   include 1) development of a unified formulation for multi body                  systems using geometrically exact structural models; 2)  study of               the accuracy and stability characteristics of component                         digital/algebraic equations; 3) formulation of geometrically                    exact models for beams with prismatic joints; 4) incorporation of               gyro elastic material into the geometrically exact beam model; 5)               study of the implementation of cell to cell mapping to evaluate                 the stability of geometrically exact models in a parallel                       computing environment.  This research is broad in scope,                        fundamental in nature, and interdisciplinary in content.  Its                   successful completion will have a measurable impact on the                      unification goal alluded to earlier.  Tools developed herein can                be used to assess the dynamic response and stability of multi                   flexible/rigid body systems which are prevalent in robotics,                    machine design, high speed ground transportation vehicles,                      aircraft and spacecraft technologies.",
