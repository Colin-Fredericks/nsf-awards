 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the              subfields of electrosynthesis and electrocatalysis.  The thrust of              this experimental effort is to determine the suitability of                     fluorinated and unfluorinated high surface area graphites as anode              materials for the electrosynthesis of chlorate and hypochlorite                 chemicals.  The number of stable, inexpensive anode materials                   available for the electrosythesis of chemicals, especially under                highly oxidative conditions, is quite limited.  The effectiveness               of these high surface area graphite electrodes relative to that of              conventional dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) \u0131RuO2 on Ti! and                Pt/Ir coated titanium will be evaluated for these two                           industrially important electrochemical processes.  Cell operating               requirements and conversion efficiencies will be compared.                                                                                                      The electrode materials whose feasibility will be evaluated in                  this Phase I research could provide equivalent or better                        performance than DSA electrodes, resulting in lower capital costs               for on-site production of these desirable chemicals.  Following                 demonstration of feasibility in Phase I, research in a subsequent               Phase II undertaking will continue these studies in larger scale                electrochemical flow cells.",
