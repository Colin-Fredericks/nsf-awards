Ethnographic as well as survey research methods,                    including anthropometric measurements and diet surveys will be                  used to study children's growth and the culturally-defined issues               considered by mothers in deciding how to budget their resources                 to provide for their small children.                                            %%%                                                                             This research is important because children all over the world                  are at risk of growth impairment due to the poverty of their                    rural households.  Understanding how their health is influenced                 by the cultural beliefs and socio-economic situations of their                  mothers can help planners target the benefits of development                    resources.",
