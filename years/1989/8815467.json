 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research encompasses three problem areas whose                common feature is the prominent role played by singular perturba-               tion theory.  The first area deals with boundary-value problems                 for differential-difference equations.  The goal is to initiate                 an in-depth study of representative classes of problems of mixed                type (involving both positive and negative shifts) and problems                 with small delays.  The second area concerns singularly perturbed               integral equations.  The emphasis will be on problems whose solu-               tions involve boundary and interior layer phenomena.  Various                   classes of kernels will be considered including those with singu-               lar behavior.  Finally, the third problem area involves a study                 of certain nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations.  Of               particular importance is the sensitivity of singular points such                as bifurcation and limit points to a small perturbation of the                  domain.  The latter work has important application to elastic                   structures and to tubular chemical reactors.",
