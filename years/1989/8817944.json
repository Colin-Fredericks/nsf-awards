 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the next two years we propose to develop, refine and                test a detailed model of the sedimentation history of the central               North Pacific.  With this model we will be able to characterize                 the marine geochemical behavior of a large number of minor and                  trace elements which are presently poorly understood.  The model                will be based on a detailed data base including all available                   chemical, stratigraphic, mineralogic and physical data for piston               core LL44-GPC3.  The primary difference between this study and                  other previous studies of pelagic clay sequences, is the size and               temporal resolution of the chemical database which includes                     analyses of 39 elements of -450 samples representing the last 70                Ma.  These data will allow distinction of more sedimentary                      chemical components with greater precision and much greater                     stratigraphic resolution than any previous study of pelagic                     clays.  The resulting sedimentation model will provide a                        detailed, internally consistent, and testable picture of the                    tectonic, climatic, oceanic, and diagenetic processes which have                affected the central North Pacific over the last 70 Ma.  We                     believe that the final geochemical model when combined with the                 extraordinary amount of ancillary data available for the core                   will also allow sedimentologists to make a quantum leap in the                  understanding the relationships between the chemistry of pelagic                clay sequences, their mineralogy, their rock magnetic properties,               and their physical properties.",
