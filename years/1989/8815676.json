 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will document the changes in farming in Burkina                    Faso, Upper Volta.  The researcher will combine ethnographic                    fieldwork with archival research to analyze the changes over the                colonial past in farming practices and the social relations                     entailed. The project will study the links between the                          transformation of social relations, modifications in the                        management of farms and production trends in local farming with                 the establishment of effective administration and the broadening                of markets.  Changes in the composition of work groups, the                     ownership patterns of work tools, and the gender pattern of                     workers and tasks will be analyzed.  During the ethnographic                    portion of the research the anthropological researcher will be                  assisted by a folklorist who will study the oral narrative                      accounts of farming system changes.                                                                                                                             This research is important because changes in agriculture and                   their impact on social relations are not well understood in                     Africa, while the changes have been radical.  Understanding the                 past African experience will help us improve that experience in                 the future as well as provide a comparison that will help us                    understand and improve the social relations of farming in our own               country.",
