The objectives of the fellowships           are to enable active U.S. scientists and engineers to acquire                   sufficient familiarity with the language and customs of Japan to                allow them to function independently there; or to acquire sufficient            expertise in reading Japanese to be able to understand technical                abstracts in their field of interest.                                                                                                                           There is a critical need for more effective technical communication             between American and Japanese researchers.  This award is intended to           help remove language and cultural barriers to U.S.-Japanese                     cooperative research and to facilitate science and technology                   exchange.",
