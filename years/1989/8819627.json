 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfields of structure and growth of thin                  films and heterogeneous catalysis.  Variation of the electronic                 properties and structure of thin metal and metal alloy films                    will be investigated and correlated with their catalytic                        activity.  The films will be grown epitaxially on metal and                     mica substrates.  Their growth mode and structure will be                       characterized by low energy electron diffraction, Auger                         electron spectroscopy and helium scattering. Chemical rections                  to be studied include the dissociation of carbon monoxide,                      atomic exchange reactions of molecular hydrogen and deuterium,                  and the reactions of hydrocarbons with atomic hydrogen.                         Molecular beams will be employed to avoid wall effects.                         Ensemble effects will be investigated using gold-palladium                      alloy films, employing ion surface scattering spectrometry to                   determine the alloy surface layer composition.                                                                                                                  The results of these catalytic studies with thin films will                     provide a correlation between chemical reactivity on large                      metal single-crystal surfaces under very low pressure                           conditions and reactivity on supported metal crystallites, with                 characteristic diameters 20- 100 Angstroms, of the type                         commonly employed as comercial catalysts under high pressure                    conditions.  Effects of dimensionality on electronic properties                 will be assessed.",
