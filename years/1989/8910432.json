 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information is sought to answer questions about the relationship                between the differing electrical characteristics of neurons that                secrete different peptide hormones and their biochemical and                    morphological characteristics.  The neurons will be studied                     intact within an acutely isolated preparation and isolated in                   cell culture.  In culture, the neurons synthesizing different                   hormones, as indicated by their immunoreactivity to specific                    antisera, assume distinct morphologies under defined conditions.                The cultured neurons having different form show distinct                        differences in their electrical characteristics.  The material                  used for these studies is the X-organ - sinus gland of the                      tropical land crab, Cardisoma carnifex.  Earlier work has                       demonstrated that this crustacean neurosecretory system is                      directly analogous to the major vertebrate neurosecretory system,               the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal system, and that at every level               of analysis yet undertaken the physiological and cell biological                mechanisms involved are directly comparable.  Many of the                       observations obtainable with the crab material, however, would                  not be possible with vertebrate material.  The crab                             neurosecretory system is easily isolated and consists exclusively               of peptidergic neurons and supporting tissue.  The terminals are                unusually large (up to 30um), permitting recording with                         intracellular or patch electrodes.  Antisera to several peptide-                hormonal activities permit typing of neurons and terminals.                     Isolated X-organ neurons immediately commence regeneration of                   processes in unconditioned dishes and defined media.                            Conventional microelectrode techniques and dye injection will be                used to characterize neurons in acutely isolated systems.  Both                 conventional and patch-clamping techniques will be applied to the               neurons in culture.  The regional distribution in the membrane of               channels giving rise to different ionic currents will be explored               by testing the effects of axotomy and by localized recording.                   Regional sensitivity to putative neurotransmitter agents will be                explored.  As feasible, changes with time in culture or with                    changed morphology induced by altered culturing conditions will                 be detailed.",
