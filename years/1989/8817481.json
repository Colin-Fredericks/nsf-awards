The Texas Symposia are                     celebrating their 25th Anniversary since the first Texas                        Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics was held in 1963 in                      Dallas.                                                                                                                                                         The Texas Symposia take place every other year and serve                        as international summary of recent developments in the main areas               of astrophysics and relativity.  The biannual meetings are held                 in different cities in the U.S., and every third meeting is held                in a foreign country such as the meetings in Munich, Germany in                 1978, land in Jerusalem, Israel in 1984.                                                                                                                        The first presentations on the discovery of quasars were                        made at the first Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics.                 The identification of pulsars as neutron stars, the first                       candidates for black holes, the indirect evidence for the                       existence of gravitational waves, millisecond pulsars, and other                rather important discoveries were first presented at the Texas                  Symposia.  In addition to this, X-ray astronomy, the interaction                of particle physics and cosmology, big bang theories and the                    early universe, galaxy formation, active galactic nuclei,                       supernovae and compact objects, cosmic rays and recent problems                 of general relativity were extensively covered at the Texas                     Symposia.                                                                                                                                                       The 1988 Texas Symposium will have mainly invited review talks                  which give a comprehensive overview of the major developments in                the forefront of astrophysics, cosmology related topics of                      particle physics and space sciences, as well as relativity                      theory.",
