The model is based on a particular dynamical systems                  approach called \"task dynamics\", which abstractly characterizes                 speech gestures in terms of coordinated patterns of articulator                 movements during speech production.  The relative timing and                    parameterization of the gestures comprising a given utterance are               specified by a \"gestural score\" that is generated by the model's                linguistic gestural component.                                                                                                                                  Articulatory measurements obtained from speakers of English,                    Italian, and Japanese will be analyzed to derive values for the                 relations between vowel and consonant gestures as well as for the               parameters of the individual gestures in the gestural score.                    Because the model is based on such articulatory evidence, it is                 particularly appropriate as a phonetic framework for use with                   recent non-linear phonologies that emphasize the phonological                   relevance of articulatory features.  Further, because the model                 is couched within a dynamical systems approach, it provides a                   concise and principled account of much variability, including                   historical change, in terms of spatial and temporal overlap among               speech gestures.",
