 "awd_abstract_narration": "Equipment to improve an undergraduate laboratory in the thermal and             fluid sciences will be provided.  In light of our nation's renewed              interest is supersonic and hypersonic flight, the teaching of                   compressible fluid mechanics is of paramount importance.  In addition,          the rapid pace of technology has given the science and engineering              community new tools with which the student must be familiar.  The               Supersonic Windtunnel Digital Measurement and Imaging Laboratory                satisfies these two needs in a unique way.  The heart of the project            is a high Reynolds number, supersonic windtunnel, exhausting to                 atmospheric pressure and capable of attaining Mach 2.5 and Reynolds             numbers exceeding one million.  It is a blowdown facility that relies           on modern, fast-response, computer-controlled instrumentation.  Since           the typical run time is only a few seconds, only instruments capable            of quickly making and storing measurements are useful.  The main                instruments required are a multiple-channel pressure scanner, a                 digital computer for control, data acquisition, and analysis, and the           equipment making up the unique digital imaging unit.  The purpose of            this last unit is to take snapshots of the flow in one of several               useful optical modes (e.g., Schlieren to observe the shock structure,           and shadowgraphy for single gas turbulence or multiple gas mixing).  A          pulse YAG laser illuminates the flow periodically, then the image is            captured by a CCD camera, digitized, and stored in the controlling              computer which allows subsequent image processing of the data.",
