 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitrogen oxides are important chemical species in the                      atmosphere.  For instance, the amount of nitrogen oxides                        controls whether ozone is produced or consumed in the oxidation                 of hydrocarbons.  To assess the importance of industrial and                    other anthropogenic sources of nitrogen oxides, it is necessary                 to determine the natural production of these compounds.                         Lighting is suspected to be a significant natural source of                     nitrogen oxides.  Yet, a major uncertainty exists in the                        quantity of nitrogen oxide produced during a flash.  As a                       consequence, the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen add                         nitrogen photochemistry in the natural atmosphere is also                       uncertain.                                                                           This project seeks to determine experimentally the                         production of nitrogen oxides from nearby triggered lightning                   and also from more distant natural lightning.  The project will                 measure with a chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen analyzer the                 ratio of NO to NO2 in plumes from lightning flashes and will                    measure with an absorption spectrometer the cross sectional                     burden of NO2 in plumes from lightning flashes and in air                       parcels in which a number of lightning flashes have occurred.                   The project will lead to improved and more confined estimates                   of the natural production of nitrogen oxides by lightning and                   thus                                                                            determine the importance of lightning as a global source.",
