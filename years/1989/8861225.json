 "awd_abstract_narration": "Substantial reduction of defects in silicon-on-sapphire material                is required to broaden the range of applications to include                     bipolar devices.  During the past few years, it has been shown                  that regional amorphization of the silicon layer by implantation                of silicon and solid phase epitaxy regrowth can reduce the defect               density in the silicon overlayer.  However, one obstacle to large               scale use of this process is that it requires implantation of                   silicon-29 ions to avoid introduction of contaminants.  Another                 obstacle is that the wafers must be cooled to liquid nitrogen                   temperature.  This program will study the effect of a germanium                 implantation and solid phase epitaxy process which could be                     feasible for large scale wafer improvement.  Implantation of                    germanium is advantageous because amorphization can be achieved                 with a dose almost an order of magnitude lower than required                    with silicon and without liquid nitrogen cooling.",
