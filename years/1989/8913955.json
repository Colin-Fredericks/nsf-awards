Such                                      studies include documenting perishable                                          information valuable to researchers, planners,                                  designers, practitioners, and building                                          officials, as well as to emergency                                              preparedness officials, for their use in                                        mitigating future natural disasters.  The                                       committee also conducts separate studies,                                       meetings, seminars, or symposia in the                                          interests of (a) implementing recommendations                                   of the quick-response teams, and (b) improving                                  our ability to cope with future natural                                         disasters.  Long-term issues regarding non-                                     earthquake types of natural disasters and                                       multiple-hazards issues also are routinely a                                    part of the committee's agenda.",
