 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past 25 years, instrumentation use in chemical analysis has          changed dramatically.  The rapid development of mass spectroscopic              analysis for example, has been made possible by advances in computer            interfacing, gas chromatography, and quadrupole mass detection systems.         Since mass spectroscopy analysis has become a routine indispensable             tool for identifying organic substances, it is essential that students          majoring in laboratory sciences gain experiences with this technique.           This project enables IUP to implement these goals.  The experiments             done by the students allow them to become more proficient in using the          mass spectrometer and in interpreting data produced by this instrument.         This instrument is also used in other laboratory disciplines including          Biology, Medical Technology, Criminology, and Safety Science.                                                                                                   The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of               funds.",
