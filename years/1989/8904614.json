 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will explore the oxygen binding site in cytochrome c                 oxidase and related respiratory proteins by X-ray absorption                    spectroscopy.  Three specific objectives will be:  1) to refine                 the mathematical analysis of EXAFS spectra of iron porphyrins: 2)               to apply the refined method of analysis to study chemically                     defined states of cytochrome c oxidase; and 3) to extend these                  results to characterize reactive intermediates in the reduction                 of dioxygen to water by the enzyme.                                                                                                                             X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy and extended X-ray                      absorption fine structure spectroscopy will be directed                         initially toward the iron and copper binding centers for dioxygen               in cytochrome c oxidase and toward related simpler iron and                     copper respiratory proteins.  The work will focus on a small                    number of metal centers with detailed analyses of data obtained                 at high resolution and high signal/noise.  Such high quality                    X-ray spectroscopic data will permit the evaluation of the                      mathematical models that have been used previously and extend                   them to include curved wave functions and multiple scattering                   effects.  This is essential in order to relate chemical                         information to structural perturbations.",
