 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Dr. William L. Oliver of Boston University in           a collaboration for three months with Prof. Susumu Kato and co-                 workers at the Radio Atmospheric Science Center of Kyoto University,            Japan.  They will use the Middle and Upper Atmosphere (MU) Radar at             Shigaraki, Japan, and in particular its capability for ionospheric              incoherent scatter studies, to 1) improve the statistical accuracy of           the electrodynamics model by increasing the available data base; 2)             develop a new model for velocity motion parallel to the magnetic                field to study neutral-wind patterns; 3) use Doppler velocity as well           as multi-beam density measurements to study ionospheric traveling               waves; and 4) correlate current and past MU radar experiments with              results of similar experiments conducted elsewhere.                                                                                                             Understanding the behavior of the upper atmosphere in response to solar         and particle inputs is one part of the overall problem of modeling              changes in the total global atmosphere.  The incoherent scatter radar           technique provides data on the electrons, ions and neutral densities            of the upper atmosphere and how these quantities change with various            types of energy inputs.  This project will permit Dr. Oliver to                 continue a study of the incoherent scatter radar data from the MU               Radar at Shigaraki.  The studies will take advantage of the increased           data base to investigate seasonal and solar-cycle dependence of the             electrodynamics of the ionosphere in relation to current models;                study the vertical ion motions due to neutral winds; look for the               influence of geomagnetic activity on the ionosphere; and compare the            data from this station with other data taken throughout the world               over the same time periods.  The previous collaborative program                 initiated by this principal investigator has already increased the              interaction between the Japanese and the rest of the world's incoherent         scatter radar scientific community and this current project will                strengthen and increase this activity.",
