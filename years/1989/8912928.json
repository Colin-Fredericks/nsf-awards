 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research to determine the nature                    of chemical compounds that are produced when ozone is used                      to treat water that contains phenols and aromatic amines.                       Ozone reacts with aromatic organic compounds, rapidly                           cleaving the ring double bonds to yield non-aromatic products                   that typically are of lower toxicity and more biodegradable                     than the precursors.  In this project, a series of studies                      are planned that will characterize the products formed during                   ozonation under conditions that simulate its use for                            treatment of water that has been polluted with phenolic                         compounds.  Analytical methods that will be used to                             characterize the products of ozonation include use of gas                       chromatography/mass spectroscopy for volatile compounds of                      low molecular weight and adaptive methods using mass                            spectroscopy for non-volatile compounds of high molecular                       weight.  Work will include determination of the toxicity of                     intermediate and final compounds formed by use of their                         impact on exertion of the biochemical oxygen demand and by                      their toxicity toward Daphnia Magna.                                                                                                                            Use of ozone for total oxidation of organic water pollutants                    is generally not cost-effective, however its use to convert                     toxic compounds of limited biodegradability into those which                    are readily biodegradable may be an effective way of                            obtaining the advantages that accrue to use of ozone in                         treatment of water and wastewater.",
