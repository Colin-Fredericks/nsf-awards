 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports four U.S. scientists to                     travel to India to participate in a workshop on atomic and                      molecular physics at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Aligarh,                  India.  The workshop is organized by the Indian Society of                      Atomic and Molecular Physics.  The Indian counterpart is Dr.                    M.S.Z. Chaghtai of the Physics Department at AMU.  The topics                   to be covered include the structure of atoms and molecule,                      collision and scattering with atoms, ions and molecules,                        spectroscopy of multiplying ionized atoms, beam-foil                            spectroscopy, cyclotron and tokomak radiation, and lasers in                    the study of atoms and molecules.  The U.S. participants are                    expected to visit other Indian research institutions and to                     plan initiation of cooperative research.                                                                                                                        Scope:  The workshop is the seventh in a series of meetings in                  the same field.  The proposed workshop is expected to result                    in published proceedings that will cover advances in the field                  as was done with proceedings of past meetings.  Support for                     the workshop is partially provided by the International Center                  for Theoretical Physics in Trieste and by the Government of                     India.  Indian scientists have a strong tradition of good                       research in atomic, molecular and optical physics, and it is                    highly likely that both they and U.S. scientists will benefit                   from the interaction in this meeting.",
