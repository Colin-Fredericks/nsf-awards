 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study will be conducted on the use of DNA gel electrophoresis                 and related laboratory techniques, coupled with DNA probe                       hybridization, and the application and development of techniques,               standards, and instrumentation.  The long term goal and the                     compelling need for the study is to establish standards for the                 application of such recombinant DNA technology to the forensic                  sciences.  Of more immediate use and general importance for basic               science are the automation of the procedures such as restriction                fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) mapping, the polymerase chain               reaction (PCR), gel electrophoresis, DNA hybridization, and DNA                 sequencing; automation and standardization of these procedures                  are important for all genome projects and for biological research               in general; in the longer run, the standards, and the necessary                 instrumentation that can be used to interpret results reliably,                 including the computer analysis of autoradiograms, will not only                benefit biology but also make a rigorous set of techniques                      available to forensic science.  Support for this study will also                be provided by the National Institutes of Health, the Justice                   Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Sloan                  Foundation.",
