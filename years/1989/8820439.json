The project                 will chart many important aspects of this development.  The                     English data will be collected in the United States, and the                    Chinese data in Taiwan, in collaboration with colleagues there.                                                                                                                                                                                      Among the topics to be considered will be (1) the                          interaction between the formulation of Chomsky's \"Principle B\"                  with regard to bound variables and referential pronouns, and the                child's knowledge of the principle; (2) the apparent lack of                    long-distance binding in the Chinese of the young child; (3) the                possibility of explaining anomalous acquisition phenomena by the                Subset Principle and a parameterized theory with independent                    parameters, on the one hand, versus a richly interrelated                       developmental theory on the other hand; (4) the explanation of                  long-distance binding via LF movement of the reflexive, and the                 slow development of long-distance binding; and (5) the                          development of non-canonical patterns such as chain-binding and                 binding of adjuncts.                                                            %%%                                                                                  The study of language acquisition by children has moved in                 the direction of seeking much more comprehensive and more                       formalized theoretical modeling, informed by developments in                    linguistic theory.  This project reflects that trend, and                       furthers it.  It also responds to the increasing emphasis on                    cross-linguistic study of language acquisition, in the attempt to               discover patterns of development which are general to human                     beings, not just to those speaking a particular language.",
