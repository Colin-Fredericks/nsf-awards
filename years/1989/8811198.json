 "awd_abstract_narration": "The roles of free cytosolic calcium pulses, waves, and gradients                in the early development of ascidian eggs as well as of cellular                slime molds will be explored.  The proposal is particularly                     concerned with the roles of calcium in establishing developmental               pattern in these systems, i.e., in ooplasmic segregation in the                 Ciona or Phallusia egg; and in establishing a pattern of prestalk               and spore cells in Dictyostelium.  These explorations will be                   carried out in three main ways:  1) Directly visualize free                     calcium changes and patterns with the aid of the photoprotein                   aequorin and an imaging photon detector.  2) Specifically perturb               (and thus study the roles) of these calcium patterns with various               means which will include the injection of newly synthesized weak                calcium buffers.  3) Examine the transcellular calcium currents                 which help produce these free calcium patterns by using a newly                 developed calcium-specific vibrating extracellular electrode.                   %%%                                                                             The development of an early embryo is controlled by gradients of                informational molecules localized in different regions of the                   unfertilized and newly fertilized egg.  One of the major                        components involved in establishing this information appears to                 be coupled to calcium distribution itself.  Dr. Jaffe will test                 this idea directly using reagents and detectors originally                      developed in his laboratory.",
