 "awd_abstract_narration": "To address the special needs of our middle schools and junior high              schools, \"Explorations in Middle School Science\" promises a computer-           based program that will be developed by a highly qualified team of              content experts, science educators, instructional designers, and                marketers.  Participants will include practicing scientists; teachers           and officers from such professional organizations as the National               Science Teachers Association and the National Association of Biology            Teachers; seven major school districts; the California State Department         of Education; Apple, Tandy, and IBM; and Education Systems Corporation,         a successful developer and marketer of computer software for schools.           And the University of California, Irvine, will be responsible for the           evaluation and teacher training portions of the project.                                                                                                        Explorations in Middle School Science will provide a set of 90 computer         lessons in Life, Earth, and Physical science for Grades 6-9.  At the            heart of each lesson will be a computer simulated laboratory to involve         students in \"doing\" science and improving (1) understanding science             concepts by applying critical thinking to solve problems; (2) skills in         scientific processes and communication; and (3) attitudes about science.        These lessons will reflect specific science education objectives in             State guidelines from across the country and realize the full power of          computer technology to reach these objectives.  Students will use a             number of on-line tools (notebook, data base manager, calculator) to            help them perform the simulated laboratory experiments, most of which           would be too difficult, dangerous or time consuming to be done in a             \"live\" laboratory.  Suggested extension investigations will lead the            students to experience nature first hand, away from the computer.               Explorations in Middle School Science will be modular, flexible, and            well documented.  The lessons will be strongly curriculum based, and run        on a networked, managed system of microcomputers with 16 colors, sound,         mouse input, and excellent graphics.",
