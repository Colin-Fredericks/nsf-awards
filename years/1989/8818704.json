 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research of Dr. Paul Knochel will be supported by the                      Organic Synthesis Program at the Department of Chemistry at the                 University of Michigan.  Studies will be made of organometallic                 reagents which have the potential for producing new types of                    synthetic reagents.  These will provide the synthetic organic                   chemist with more sophisticated reagents required for the                       synthesis of the more complex molecules.                                                                                                                        New classes of 1,1-, and to some extent 1,2- and 1,3-                           diorganometallics will be studied which have two carbon-metal                   bonds in close proximity so they can interact.  As a result,                    the properties of the carbon-metal bonds will be essentially                    different from those of the isolated carbon-metal bond and                      special reactivities and structural properties may be observed                  (planar tetracoordinated carbon atom, unusual bridged                           structures).  Efforts will be made to obtain X-ray structures                   of these sensitive compounds.  However, the new synthetic                       possibilities of these diorganometallics will constitute the                    major part of the research.  The possibility to have two                        carbanionic centers in a 1,1-, or 1,3- relationships will open                  unique synthetic possibilities in organic and in organometallic                 chemistry (synthesis of new reactive transition metal                           organometallics and new approaches for the formation of                         carbon-carbon bonds).  A controlled and high yield oxidation of                 1,1- diorganometallics has been established and will be                         extensively studied.",
