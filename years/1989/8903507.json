 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years rule-based and frame-based systems became                       popular tools for developing a wide range of knowledge                          intensive applications.  Although these tools provide                           significant help to the application developer, building expert                  systems remains a largely ad hoc and a very labor-intensive                     activity. Recent achievements in knowledge representation and                   deductive database research made time ripe for attempting a                     systematic logic-based approach to expert systems. The proposed                 contention is that expert system programming can be made more                   declarative by releaving the developer from the burden of                       specifying most details of control strategy. This burden should                 be taken over by the system which will use various optimization                 techniques to achieve desirable response time.                                                                                                                  In this research, a language which integrates rules and frames                  under one roof, and is suitable for reasoning with uncertainty                  will be designed and implemented.  Being purely declarative,                    this language will allow shortening of the development phase of                 knowledge-intensive applications and make them more reliable                    and extensible.  Industrial expert system developers as well as                 knowledge engineering researchers will benefit from theresults                  of this research.",
