 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish an REU site in the Science and                        Technology Department at Peru State College.  The REU site will:                1) provide scientific research training to undergraduate biology                students in a small rural college (FTE = 1,500), 2) integrate                   students with established scientists who will be involved in                    implementing student research projects, and 3) further the                      scientific knowledge of biosystematics and evolutionary theory.                 Eight undergraduate students were selected to work on research                  projects.  The areas of research to be examined by students are                 insect chemosystematics, insect morphometrics, central and                      marginal population theory, and classical taxonomy.  These                      projects were selected to give all student participants a full                  range of exposure to the multifaceted disciplines of science.                   Individual research protocols were developed by the principal                   investigator and faculty associate in conjunction with the                      students working within this program.  Each student is                          responsible for the planning of experiments to be conducted.  In                addition, seven research advisors from other colleges and                       universities  will work with students during the final planning,                data gathering, and data analysis stages of this project.  The                  goal of this undergraduate research program is to involve                       students from the planning stage through the completion and                     publication of results.",
