Civil Engineering,                          which has most of its' activities eventually expressed                          in construction, has one of the lowest levels of                                research activity of any major industry in the U.S.                             This low level of research activity along with an                               extremely conservative attitude toward change and the                           introduction of new materials and technologies has                              actually resulted in a decreased level of productivity                          for increasingly complex Civil Engineering projects.  A                         new attitude responsive to increased change and                                 introduction of new technologies is developing in Civil                         Engineering and it will be timely to assess the role                            which Engineering Mechanics' research can play in the                           future to improve productivity, quality and costs in                            Civil Engineering projects.  A small report will be                             published containing summaries of deliberations at the                          Workshop and recommendations for future activity.",
