 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project is to solve three physically                important problems in low-aspect ratio flat ship theory.  These                 problems are 1) the calculation of the rise and trim of a high                  speed vessel, 2) the performance of a stability analysis for near               optimal lift/drag hulls under time dependent perturbations and 3)               the calculation of the flow past a low-aspect ratio flat ship                   traveling at moderate speeds.                                                        The solution techniques for the first two problems involve                 an extension of existing work by the principal investigator where               mixed boundary value problems are reformulated in terms of                      complex variable theory and solved by a series expansion in terms               of analytic functions using symbolic manipulation software.                     These problems are mathematically interesting because of the                    inherent difficulty of mixed boundary value problems and the                    recent developments in symbolic computation.  The third problem                 requires a novel apparoach that uses matched asymptotic                         expansions, with the inner solution satisfying a double body flow               in each cross plane, and the outer solution corresponding to the                flow past a line of pressure sources.",
