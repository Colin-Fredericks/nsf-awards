 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the study of the physical properties of                   new diblock and triblock copolymers in dilute and semi-dilute                   solutions and their processing into polymeric membranes.                        Emphasis will be on blocks of high incompatibility.  Physical                   properties relevant to the process of membrane formation will                   be focussed on:  1) Determination of the interaction                            parameters between the segments of different blocks in                          solution; 2) Physical behavior (conformation and swelling) of                   diblock and triblock copolymers in \"selective\" solvents; 3)                     Swelling and mechanical properties of block copolymer gels.                     Membranes will be obtained by quenching copolymer solution                      films; their structure and properties will be examined as a                     function of initial polymer concentration, relative size of                     the blocks, and quench temperature.  Low angle total intensity                  light scattering, viscometry, dynamic light scattering,                         mechanical measurements, and electron microscopy will be used                   to characterize the membranes.                                                                                                                                  This project is being funded simultaneously with a project at                   the University of Southern California (USC) where a group                       directed by Professor Thieo E. Hogen-Esch will collaborate                      with the group at Cornell directed by Professor Cohen.  The                     group at USC will perform the synthesis of new AB and ABA                       block copolymers to be used in the physicochemical and                          mechanical studies on solution and gel properties of the                        copolymers.  The overall goal of this group project is to                       identify block copolymers and processing conditions with the                    potential for use in the manufacturing of a new generation of                   high performance membranes for chemical processing,                             biotechnology, biomedical applications, and pollution control                   technology.",
