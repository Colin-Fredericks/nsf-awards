During the first summer of                  the project, forty teachers of such students from eight middle                  school will participate in a four-week institute that                           empahasizes problem-solving and the use of computers to teach                   mathematics.  The same teachers will return for a second four-                  week workshop during the following summer.  NSF support is being                sought only for the summer institute since initiation and                       follow-up activities are being funded by the Maryland State                     Board of Higher Education.                                                                                                                                      The university and the State of Maryland are contributing an                    amount equal to 37% of the NSF award.",
