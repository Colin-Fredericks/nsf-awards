 "awd_abstract_narration": "The enteric nervous system controls motility.  Enteric neurons                  produce a variety of neurotransmitters and form a neuronal                      network in the gut.  The long-term objective of this research is                to elucidate the mechanisms which regulate the development of                   these neuronal transmitter phenotypes and the formation of the                  enteric neuronal circuitry.  Evidence indicates that the                        environment in general and the gut in particular can influence                  the expression of peptide transmitter phenotypes.  The goal of                  this research is to find the components in the gut environment                  that are instructive to the neural crest cells which are the                    precursors of enteric neurons.                                                                                                                                  Previous work from Dr. Epstein's laboratory has indicated that                  instruction is best observed in intact gut.  Studies will be                    carried out to describe systematically the formation of enteric                 ganglia and the differentiation of enteric neurons in order to                  pinpoint conditions critical to these processes.  Immunostaining                and radioautography will be used to characterize the phenotypes                 and birthdates of cells in ganglia from intact gut.  Studies will               also be carried out to determine the number, location, and                      phenotypes of the descendants  of single neural crest cells                     injected into pieces of isolated chick gut grown on                             chorioallantoic membrane of chick hosts.  These cells and their                 descendants will be detected by either quail-specific antisera or               by the presence of a histochemical marker for beta-galactosidase.               Quail cells will have been previously transfected with a retro-                 virus carrying the beta-galactosidase gene.  The single cell                    experiments will indicate if patterns of expression can be                      detected in cells placed in the intact gut environment.  The                    knowledge obtained will be useful in designing future experiments               to elucidate the mechanisms which regulate the phenotypic                       expression.  Basic information about the development and                        organization of the enteric neuronal circuitry will help in                     understanding the reasons for defects in gut motility as                        manifested by conditions such as pseudo-obstruction.",
