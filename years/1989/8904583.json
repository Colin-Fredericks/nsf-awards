 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have isolated four prototrophic pectolytic avirulent mutants                 of Erwina carotovora subsp.  carotovora (Ecc) which seem to be                  defective in overcoming host resistant.  These mutants show                     initial in plants growth (10 to 17 logarithmic generations)                     similar to pathogenic strains of Ecc but fail to reach the                      threshold of bacteria (1 x 108 cfu) required to demonstrate the                 soft-rot disease phenotype.  We have isolated clones which                      complement these mutations.  Two subclones obtained from one of                 these complementing loci seem to inhibit production of pectate                  lyases, polygalacturonase, cellulase and protease in for Ecc and                E. carotovora subsp. atroseptica and thereby impart an avirulent                phenotype to these phytopathogenic bacteria.  The goals of our                  proposed research are (1) the molecular characterization of                     pathogenicity genes of Ecc and their regulation of expression in                cultures and during pathogenesis in planta, and (2) to determine                the molecular basis of inhibition of production of extracellular                enzymes by cloned DNA sequences.  The nature and mechanisms of                  pathogenicity genes, isolated using avirulent pectolytic mutants,               will be demonstrated by integrated series of experiments                        including (a) analysis of the structural and regulatory                         components of these operons by saturation transposon mutagenesis,               S1 mapping and DNA sequencing, (b) localization of gene product                 and determination of the timing and regulation of gene activation               using antibodies and reporter gene fusions, and (c) DNA mobility                retardation and DNaseI foot-printing analysis to characterize the               trans-acting regulatory factors.  Experiments also are outlined                 to close any trans-acting factor(s) which may be responsible for                the inhibition of the extracellular enzyme production.  This                    research will provide insight into the molecular basis of                       plant-microbe interactions and will add to our understanding                    of the regulation of expression of extracellular enzymes in                     phytopathogenic bacteria.  Experiments will be conducted to                     determine whether or not these effects are caused by the cloning                vector.  Cloned bacterial genes will be sequenced and experiments               which are required to establish the physical relationships                      between the gene which complements the AH2552 mutation and the                  DNA sequence which inhibits production of plant cell-degrading                  enzymes will be carried out.                                                                                                                                    This research will provide insight into the molecular basis of                  plant-microbe interactions and will add to our understanding of                 the regulation of expression of extracellular enzymes in                        phytopathogenic bacteria.",
