 "awd_abstract_narration": "An accumulating body of data has provided strong evidence                  that cyclonic disturbances together with the jet stream at                      tropopause altitudes vary in response to the 11 year solar cycle                and to the quasibiennial oscillation of equatorial stratospheric                winds (the QBO).  Short term responses to magnetic storms, solar                wind sector boundaries, and solar flares have been found, and                   these can be examined as diagnostics on the effectiveness of                    carriers of solar variability to the troposphere and lower                      stratosphere.  A new short term response has been found in the                  form of changes in tropopause pressure and vertical temperature                 profile in the troposphere in the two days following solar-flare-               related high-speed plasma streams (HSPS).  This effect is made                  understandable in the context of galactic cosmic rays being the                 main carrier of the solar variability.                                               This grant will support a data analysis effort relevant to                 Solar Variability/QBO/Weather effects in the context of the                     galactic cosmic rays being the main carrier of the solar                        variability.  Tests will be made of the adequacy of the time                    variations of the cosmic ray flux, particularly for the energy                  range 0.3 to 3 GeV, to account for the observed short term and                  long term solar variability influences on the troposphere and                   lower stratosphere.  An analysis will be made of variations in                  stratospheric minor constituent variations in the context of                    chemical/aerosol carriers for the tropospheric QBO variation.                   The work should provide constraints on several possible                         mechanisms of troposphere/stratosphere response, particularly                   those involving electrical and chemical effects on cloud                        microphysics, and on possible links to latent heat release and                  storm intensification.",
