 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Delaware requests planning grant funds to                     develop a Science and Technology Research Center proposal for a                 South Pole Astrophysics Research Center to serve as the focus for               scientific, technical, and logistical aspects of astrophysical                  research in the Antarctic.  The goal of the Center is to advance                understanding of the universe through the promotion and                         realization of experiments at the cutting edge of knowledge.  The               Center's activities will include assisting scientists in                        determining feasibility of their research and in conducting it,                 facilitating collaborations among scientists, providing training,               facilitating international collaboration, providing technical                   support for onsite research, and providing a framework for                      planning and program support activities.  The planning grant                    funds will support a workshop that will identify significant                    astrophysical problems for which observations at the South Pole                 are critical as well as additional workshops wherein the center                 proposal will be developed.                                                                                                                                     The goal of the proposed center is to make a significant                        contribution in astrophysics research.  The South Pole is a                     unique site, and the difficulty of conducting research there                    demands planning, coordination, and logistical support.  The                    Center can provide this as well as play a major role in setting                 the agenda for future scientific research.",
