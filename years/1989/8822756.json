 "awd_abstract_narration": "Job opportunities have long been recognized as playing a                        crucial role in a wide range of important academic and policy                   issues.  However, it is not clear what impact the continuing                    shift from a manufacturing to a service economy has had on                      the number and type of job opportunities that the economy has                   generated in recent years, and on the changing ability of                       various segments of the population to successfully compete                      for these opportunities.  Has the declining need for low-                       skilled labor generated the growth of an underclass?  What                      are the blue-collar opportunities for middle income jobs?                       How have shifts in the economy affected the efforts by women                    and minorities to reduce the occupation and wage                                differentials they experience?                                                                                                                                  This research examines the implications of changes in the                       nation's occupations and industries by examining the job                        opportunities that arose as a consequence of these changes.                     The project will obtain estimates of the number of job                          opportunities that arose in each year from 1968 to 1984, and                    will examine how trends in job opportunities over these years                   have contributed to the changing occupational status of                         important sub-populations (including women, minorities, and                     workers in traditionally blue-collar manufacturing jobs).                       The study will draw on data from the Current Population                         Survey to estimate the total number of opportunities                            generated during each year, and will distinguish these job                      opportunities by industry and occupation.  This will permit a                   description of trends in job opportunities by occupation from                   1968 to 1984, with particular attention to questions of how                     job opportunities are changing. The principal investigator                      will also develop new statistical models of the influence of                    economic opportunities on the likelihood that workers will                      move from one job strata to another.                                                                                                                            The project in its entirety should considerably advance our                     knowledge of the job opportunities created in the past two                      decades and of ways in which changing opportunities have                        affected the labor market experiences of important segments                     of the population.  It should also improve our understanding                    of the career trajectories of workers with various skills and                   characteristics who are confronted with a changing labor                        market.",
