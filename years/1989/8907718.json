 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project                      in elementary particle physics involves three investigators                     in nuclear physics theory:  Norma Mankoc Borstnik, Jozef                        Stefan Institute in Ljubljana, D. Klabucar, Rudjer Boskovic                     Institute in Zagreb, and Gerald Brown at State University of                    New York, Stony Brook.  The project is divided into two                         parts: Mankoc-Borstnik is proposing innovative studies on                       the structure and constituents of the subatomic particles,                      quarks and leptons.  Klabucar will pursue work on hadronic                      structure and nuclear models.  The Stony Brook group will                       participate in both areas.  This work will advance knowledge                    of subatomic theory and will contribute to the research                         efforts of major U.S. experimental groups.                                                                                                                      This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board                      on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported                       through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions                       from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia.                       The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department                    of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to                       the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia, but                         include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia                    and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
