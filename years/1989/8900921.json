 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program deals with the chemistry of metal cluster                     compounds, which are molecules containing three or more metal                   atoms joined together by metal-metal bonds. The physical and                    chemical properties of such clusters are different in many ways                 from those of compounds containing a single metal atom, and are                 useful models of metal surfaces or small metal particles, which                 are of technological importance as catalysts.                                                                                                                   The project will focus on the effects of nuclearity, i.e. the                   number of metal atoms, and of variations in the identity of the                 metal atoms of the cluster upon its chemical reactivity. The                    project will be divided into three areas of research, according                 to the size of the clusters. The chemistry of clusters                          containing three metal atoms bridged by a methylidyne ligand                    will be studied, with the goal of understanding the                             electrochemically-induced chemistry of the methylidyne ligand                   and the influence of the identities of the metal atoms (Fe, Ru                  or Os). The chemistry of clusters containing four metal atoms,                  of which three or four are bridged by methylidyne ligands, will                 be studied with the goal of comparing the chemical reactivity                   of the methylidyne ligand on clusters of three or four metal                    atoms. The chemical and electrochemical behavior of large                       clusters of nine to eighteen rhodium atoms will be studied to                   determine how these properties are influenced by the                            nuclearity, charge and face geometries of the cluster. The                      ultimate goal of the work is to determine the way in which the                  properties of metal clusters differ from small metal particles                  and from monometallic metal complexes and to be able to                         selectively modify these properties by changing the number and                  identities of the metal atons and the coordination sphere of                    the cluster.",
