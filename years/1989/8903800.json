 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metamorphosis consists of a dramatic, temporally compressed                     series of developmental events that includes cell death, cell                   movement, cell division, and tissue transformation. It thus                     offers numerous developmental processes for simultaneous study.                 Knowledge of the developmentally timed endocrine control of                     metamorphosis  in amphibians and insects is extensive. However,                 most of the animal species with metamorphic development are                     marine invertebrates, and most marine invertebrates have                        externally, not hormonally, triggered metamorphoses. The research               described here will utilize the marine slug Phestilla sibogae to                explore further the mechanisms by which externally induced                      metamorphosis is activated within the larva. Because of their                   proven utility as a model for such studies, larvae of Phestilla                 will serve as a source of tissues for in vitro investigation of                 their priming for metamorphosis (i.e. competence) and their                     specific chemical sensitivities. Neurophysiological experiments                 will be used to locate and characterize the neurons and nervous                 mechanisms that bring abut tissue-specific responses throughout                 the larva. At the completion of these studies Dr. Hadfield should               have sufficient understanding of the inductive pathway to begin                 examination of the intracellular responses that culminate in                    metamorphosis.                                                                  %%%                                                                             There are hundreds of thousands of marine invertebrate species                  which undergo metamorphosis. The understanding of this process in               any of these species is very slight compared to that in insects                 and amphibians. The current proposal is to continue a study of                  metamorphosis in one such model marine invertebrate.",
