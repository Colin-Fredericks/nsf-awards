 "awd_abstract_narration": "Steroid hormones have a major impact on the behavior of mammals.                Most of the behavioral effects of steroid hormones are thought to               be mediated by the central nervous system; however, very little                 is known about the underlying mechanisms.  Dr. Albers, who has                  previously received support from the National Science Foundation,               will continue to work on steroid-peptide-transmitter                            interactions, a general problem of substantial interest in                      neurobiology.  Sophisticated anatomical and biochemical                         techniques are used to examine scent marking, a functionally                    significant communicative behavior that is also sexually                        dimorphic.  As a model system, scent marking is interesting                     because of the involvement of a neuropeptide, arginine-                         vasopressin in its control.  Dr. Albers will determine whether                  steroid hormones influence scent marking by diminishing the                     sensitivity of a specific area in the brain to vasopressin.  He                 will also investigate the role of vasopressin in regulating the                 sex differences in scent marking.  A carefully designed set of                  pharmacological studies will examine how the noradrenergic                      transmitter system is involved in coordinating the expression of                this communication behavior as well as with other behaviors.                    These studies will make important contributions to our                          understanding of how endocrine signals act on neural systems to                 control behavior.",
