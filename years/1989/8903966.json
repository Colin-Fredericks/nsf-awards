 "awd_abstract_narration": "The specific goal of this proposal is to understand the role of            spindle microtubules (MTs) in chromosome motion during mitosis.                 Emphasis will be placed in two areas:  1) the energy requirements and           role of the kinetochore in attaching chromosomes to the spindle during          prometaphase and 2) analysis of spindle forces using high resolution UV         microbeam irradiation of spindle components. We propose that chromosome         movement is controlled by two classes of spindle MTs, each of which             forms a stable continuum between the two spindle poles by metaphase.            The continuum associated between the chromosomes and the kinetochore            fibers (the kMT continuum) is postulated to be:  1) responsible for             moving chromosomes to the metaphase plate, 2) able to reduce spindle            length during the prometaphase-to-metaphase transition, 3) indirectly           related to the creation of the shape of the spindle at metaphase and, 4)        directly responsible for chromosome-to-pole separation during anaphase          B.  The second continuum is composed of those MTs not associated with           chromosomes (nKMT continuum) and hold compression which is loaded into          it in the form of MT curvature during normal spindle formation.  The            experimental focus of this proposal is to determine the energy                  requirements necessary to load compression (energy) into the form               spindle during the prometaphase-to-metaphase transition.  Functional            assays, using the ATP analog quinacrine will be done to establish the           role of the kinetochore and MT associated proteins in pre-loading this          energy into the spindle.  The second emphasis will be a UV microbeam            study to determine the role of microtubules and perhaps a second,               elastic component in holding and expressing this energy.  These studies         will allow analysis of spindle forces responsible for the congression of        chromosomes to the metaphase plate and the movement of chromosomes              during the events of anaphase.  Using light and electron optics analysis        of perturbations of mitosis will be analyzed.  Where appropriate, three         dimensional reconstruction of serial section electron micrographs will          also be done to determine the effects of treatments on spindle                  morphology and function.  The significance of the problem is the                significance of nuclear division: there is no eukaryotic life without           it.  In spite of over 100 years of research, much intensified during the        past decade, it remains one of the unsolved fundamental problems in cell        biology.",
