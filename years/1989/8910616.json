 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are (a) to develop effective methods            for optimizing the entropy of an efficient neural network model; (b) to         study the effects of feedback on the design of an associative memory;           and (c) to develop machines architecture for implementing the                   theoretical models.  The model under study expands during adaptation;           hence fundamental problems, such as determining a network topology and          avoiding local minima of gradient descent procedures, do not exist.             Hybird architectures emerging from the use of optical computing                 structures in conventional dataflow architectures are considered and            refined for implementing the proposed neural network model.  Effective          training methods and architectures for implementation with existing             technology are developed.                                                                                                                                       Neural networks have been found to be effective in learning                     representations that cannot be represented formally.  One major                 drawback of the various learning algorithms is that there is a tendency         to stop once local minima are found.  The model under study uses                feedback links and expanding configuration, hence reducing such                 possibilities.  Problems related to implementation and architectural            designs are also addressed in this research.  The project considers the         design of an effective neural network model from both the theoretical           and experimental points of view.",
