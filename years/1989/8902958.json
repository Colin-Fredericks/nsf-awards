Mohamed Sultan and Raymond Arvidson of Washington University, St.               Louis, Missouri, and Dr. Atef Dardir, Director General of the                   Geological Survey of Egypt, Dr. Baher El Kaliouby of Ain Shams                  University and Dr. Eugene O'Connor of the British Geological                    Survey.  The project will build on the ongoing NASA supported                   research work of Drs. Sultan and Arvidson, where they have                      determined that thematic mapper data is very useful in generating               systematic geological maps. A portion of the requested NSF support              is planned for the purchase of four digital Landsat thematic mapper             (TM) scenes.  These scenes, when joined with the current set of                 three TM scenes held by the investigators, will provide thematic                mapper coverage for all Late Proterozic outcrops in the Eastern                 Desert of Egypt.  From these seven scenes, color and black and white            composites prints at scales of 1:150K and 1:50K will be generated.              Those composites will used to generate interpretative maps depicting            the lithology, structures and mineral resources of the Eastern                  Desert.  These products will be delivered to the Egyptian Geological            Survey, Ain Shams University and British Geological Survey (for                 supervision of the mapping program) for checking the validity of TM             based intrepretations and instructions on ways to refine the initial            maps.  The first TM products will be refined by the project and used            as base maps by the two Egyptian institutions to generate regional              maps on the scale of 1:250K and local maps to the scale of 1:50K.                                                                                               Scope:  This proposal is an opportunity for U.S. and Egyptian                   scientists, aided by British geologists, to develop a set of                    complete geological maps of the Eastern Desert of Egypt.  These maps            will give scientists valuable additional information to pursue field            studies of the continental growth processes in the Late Proterozic              Era in the Arabian-Nubian Shield existing in the Eastern Desert.                The greater resolution of the smaller scale maps will define the                details necessary for more definitive studies of geological history             and economic potenial of the region.  These final maps, while adding            to the knowledge and understanding of the tectonic evolution of the             Nubian Shield in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, may provide                       significant assistance in mapping less known areas of arid                      continents elsewhere in the world.  This proposal does meet the                 objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program of                    advancing the international exchange of scientific knowledge and                does cointribute to the enhancement of science in a developing                  country.",
