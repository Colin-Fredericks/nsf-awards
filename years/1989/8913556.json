 "awd_abstract_narration": "The combustion of carbon/titanium powders has been demonstrated to be           a feasible technique for synthesizing TiC.  The primary advantages of           the method are the reduction in energy requirements for the process             (it is a self-sustaining exothermic reaction) and the high temperature          (3500 K) attained in the product, providing a unique opportunity for            manipulating the crystalline structure.  Work in the past has been              conducted primarily by material scientists; however there is much               which can be offered to the field by the principal investigator who is          a combustion scientist.  The proposed research is novel in that                 analytical and experimental approaches developed in the more mature             discipline of combustion are to be applied to the SHS (Self-                    propagating, High temperature Synthesis) process.  Since combustion             deals traditionally with pure gaseous or condensed phase plus gaseous           reactants forming gaseous products, a good deal of work is required to          generalize to the solid reactants going to solid products case.  The            ultimate goal is to develop a unified theory for all classes of                 combustion processes.",
