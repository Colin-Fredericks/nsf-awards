 "awd_abstract_narration": "The left and right hemispheres of the human cortex are                          specialized for different cognitive functions.  This research                   will investigate the consequences of this specialization for                    information processing in neurologically normal individuals.  The               left hemisphere appears to be specialized for the processing of                 verbal and phonetic information; one set of studies will explore                consequences of this left-hemisphere verbal/phonetic superiority.               Other studies will test the hypothesis that the brain computes                  two types of spatial representations, one (computed by the left                 hemisphere) that is appropriate for categorizing locations (e.g.,               one stimulus is above another) and another (computed by the right               hemisphere) that is appropriate for processing information about                distance (e.g., two stimuli are more than 2 cm apart).  The                     research will also investigate the manner in which unified                      information processing emerges from a brain consisting of two                   separate but interacting hemispheres.  Of particular importance                 is the investigation of conditions that determine when the mode                 or style of processing characteristic of one hemisphere dominates               performance.  The research is designed around an experimental                   paradigm that allows a comparison of the style of cognitive                     processing when both hemispheres are stimulated at the same time                to the styles of processing that are obtained when each                         individual hemisphere is stimulated separately.   Individuals                   differ in their patterns of hemispheric superiority and it is                   likely that they also differ with respect to which hemisphere's                 preferred style of processing emerges when both hemispheres are                 equally stimulated.  The research will investigate this by having               the same individuals participate in a number of tasks chosen to                 measure different aspects of hemispheric asymmetry and                          interaction, to discover how performance on one task relates to                 performance on others.  Although the research will address basic                issues in human cognition, the outcome will have implications for               a variety of important societal concerns.  For example, many                    educators and scientists have held that individual differences in               hemispheric asymmetry are related to a variety of learning                      disabilities such as dyslexia and attentional deficit disorder.                 Testing such notions has been nearly impossible because of the                  absence of noninvasive behavioral techniques to separate                        differences in hemispheric asymmetry from differences in the                    tendency to rely more on the processing style of one hemisphere                 or the other.  The techniques developed in this research should                 make it possible to begin such testing, thus opening the door to                answering a host of questions of great immediate practical import               to our society.",
