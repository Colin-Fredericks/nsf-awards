 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry                        Program supports research in the area of spectroscopy and                       kinetics of transition metal complexes.  A grant is made to                     James N. Demas of The University of Virginia for investigations                 in this field and for the purchase of instrumentation to                        facilitate the research.  The results of this research have                     direct implication in solar energy conversion, luminescent                      sensors and the design and application of new luminescent                       probes of the structure and dynamics of biopolymers such as DNA.                                                                                                Inter- and intramolecular environmental interactions on Ru(II),                 Os(II), Ir(III) and Re(I) photosensitizers will be studied.                     Variations in state orderings and decay paths will be examined                  using different techniques including steady state and pulsed                    and phase transient luminescent spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic                  resonance spectroscopy and crystallography. In particular, the                  novel perturbation of excited state properties by                               intramolecular alkyl chain foldback onto the luminescent                        portion of the complex will be studied. For example, rhenium(I)                 complexes containing a bipyridyl ligand and a nitrile with a                    long n-alkyl group show a strong variation in luminescence                      properties with the number of methylene groups of the nitrile.                  This phenomenon involves molecular state switching with the                     addition of as little as one methylene. The effect will help                    understand environmental factors affecting photochemistry and                   photophysics. The work will contribute to the rational design                   of site selective molecular probes for a variety of                             environments including microheterogeneous systems.",
