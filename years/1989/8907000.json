 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project in cultural anthropology will                study the cultural meanings of heavy public drinking among                      fishermen in Kodiak, Alaska.  The cultural pressures to drink                   will be examined by interviewing and observing captains and                     crewmen in three fisheries.  The importance of status, and of the               differing constraints imposed by the different fishery regimes,                 will be analyzed.  Fishermen who have stopped drinking, through                 membership in alcoholics anonymous, will be interviewed to assess               their reaction to the cultural norm which facilitates heavy                     drinking among fishermen.                                                                                                                                       This research is important because substance abuse is one of the                major problems in the world, and is especially pronounced among                 Native Americans.  This project should provide insight into the                 cultural norms governing heavy drinking, and the means people use               to control the need to drink.",
