 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many benthic marine invertebrates, including polar species, produce             larvae that must survive a period in the plankton before setting into           benthic adult populations.  Understanding the factors that influence            larval survival therefore is crucial for understanding recruitment and          the maintenance of adult populations.  This study will clarify one of           the most important of these factors: nutrition.  Larvae may be nourish          by particulate food, dissolved organic material, and/or yolk provided by        the parent.  The relative role of these sources for different types of          larvae is poorly understood.  This project will examine comparable              larvae (asteroid and echinoid; feeding and nonfeeding) in two                   contrasting environments;  Monterey Bay, California, where primary              production and phytoplankton production are high during most of the             year; and McMurdo Sound, antarctica, where phytoplankton production and         biomass are markedly seasonal and extremely low during most of the year.        The study will have important bearing on the understanding of how               different nutritional environments affect larval growth, survival and           subsequent availability of recruitment into adult populations and               influence the evolution of larval nutritional modes.",
