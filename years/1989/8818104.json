 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the                    roles played by plant chemistry in the ecology and evolution of a               single taxon of herbivorous insects, namely the butterfly family                Papilionidae.  Emphasis is placed on the chemical basis of plant                recognition by ovipositing females.  Identification of contact                  oviposition stimulants for the black swallowtail, Papilio                       polyxenes (tribe Papilionini), will be extended from carrot,                    Daucus carota, to other umbelliferous plants to assess the                      specificity of chemical response profiles in one insect species.                Identification of contact stimulants will also be carried out                   with two subspecies of a close relative, P. machaon, which show                 apparent steps in a host switch from the Apiaceae to the                        Asteraceae (genus Artemisia).  Identification of contact                        stimulants from Aristolochia species for Battus philenor, a more                distant relative (tribe Troidini), will be completed and followed               by similar studies with Eurytides marcellus, an Asimina-feeding                 species belonging to yet a third tribe (Graphiini).  These                      comparative studies will permit testing of the long-held                        hypothesis that the adaptive radiation of swallowtail butterflies               has been constrained by preadaptation to particular chemical                    compounds that are used as behavioral cues in host recognition.",
