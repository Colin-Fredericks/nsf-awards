 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides resources for the procurement of equipment                to support structural dynamics research.  The equipment comprises               a single laser Michelson interferometric velocimeter with its                   associated control/display computers and software for structural                measurements.  This system could establish the basis of a unique                and innovative technological advancement in experimental structural             dynamics modeling.  The noncontacting characteristic of laser                   measurements eliminates many of the problems of contaminated                    response data encountered with accelerometers normally used in                  experimental structural analysis.  Rotational effects, which cannot             be measured with translational transducers, can also be determined              with the laser velocimeter.  The equipment supports two major                   current research activities.  The first, high density mode shape                extraction and spatial modal analysis, focuses on the experimental              extraction of real or complex modes of a structure at more than                 65,000 points with 3 degrees of freedom.  The second activity                   addresses the assessment of existing modeling approaches and                    development of new elasticity theories for predicting dynamic                   behavior of structures.  Furthermore, this velocimeter will be used             for a six dimensional comparison of finite element models and                   experimental modal analysis mode shapes for the determination of                finite modeling defects, for quantitative non-destructive                       structural damage evaluation via detailed mode shape comparison,                and for the development of mathematical models from measured multi-             mode six degree of freedom experimental mode shapes.",
