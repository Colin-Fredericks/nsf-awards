 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relative importance of male-male competition and female mate                preference in determining reproductive success has been studied                 in a variety of species, including freshwater guppies.  Dr.                     Bruce's preliminary observations indicate that male guppies                     appear to adjust their courtship displays depending on the                      presence or absence of the highest-ranking male of their social                 group.  These observations suggest that the roles of male-male                  competition and alternative mating strategies deserve further                   investigation.                                                                                                                                                  Dr. Bruce will investigate the effects of social structure on                   courtship displays of male guppies.  Social groups of three male                and three female guppies will be observed to determine male                     social rank; the highest-ranking (alpha) male will then be                      removed from the group and the behavior of the subordinate males                monitored.  The alpha male will then be reintroduced and all                    males' courtship behavior observed.  Subordinate males' sexual                  behavior is expected to increase when the alpha male is absent                  and decrease after his reintroduction.  In a subsequent study,                  the behavior of males in a stable social group will be monitored                before and after the introduction of a novel male.  The resident                males' sexual behavior is expected to remain high or increase and               inhibit the novel male's courtship displays to females.                                                                                                         If competition affects the courtship displays of male guppies,                  then male-male competition may affect reproductive success not                  only directly, by removing some males from contention, but also                 indirectly, by influencing males' communication with females and                thereby the females' preference for mates.  Dr. Bruce's research                thus has the potential for contributing to our understanding of                 the behavioral factors in reproductive success.",
