 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator plans to work on three classes of                         problems involving the applications of algebraic topology to                    the study of curvature and symmetry properties of manifolds.                    One class of questions deals with the existence of riemannian                   metrics with positive scalar curvature.  The second class of                    questions concerns group actions on relatively low-dimensional                  manifolds, and the third class concerns the interaction between                 homotopy theory, surgery theory, and group actions on manifolds                 in higher dimensions.  Topics to receive special emphasis                       include the curvature properties of non-linear spherical                        spaceforms and cyclic group actions on 4-manifolds and spheres.                      Several of these problems feature the interplay between                    topology and geometry, the extent to which geometric properties                 that do not directly or obviously involve measurement actually                  entail restrictions on such metric properties as curvature.                     Powerful modern methods have been revealing more and more such                  situations, with profound relevance for the physicists'                         theories about the world in which we live.",
