 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a reliable theory            of nucleate pool boiling heat transfer that can be used to predict the          rate of heat transfer from a heated surface to a liquid.  The research          will examine boiling incipience criteria, bubble growth and heat                transfer mechanisms in boiling.  Boiling incipience will be studied by          a rigorous mathematical analysis of the nucleation process in a                 microcavity on a solid surface.  The bewildering temperature overshoot          phenomenon, associated with boiling incipience, will be elucidated by           examining the influence of an evaporative barrier which is formed on            the liquid-vapor interface by insoluble surfactants.  The analysis of           bubble growth will be carried out by the boundary element method, and           will account for evaporation of a thin microlayer at the bubble base            and surface deformation.  A new bubble detachment criterion will be             introduced based on the capillary instability of the bubble neck which          is formed during the growth process.  An experiment will be conducted           to visualize the nucleation and growth processes in a 20 um v-groove            to add credence to the proposed microscopic phenomenalogical                    description.                                                                                                                                                    A comprehensive theory of boiling that can predict the rate of heat             transfer from a solid surface to a liquid is still unavailable in               spite of the importance of the process to many modern engineering               applications to high power density equipment.  The proposed research            will aid the development of such a theory by increasing our                     understanding of the intricate microscale processes in a single                 nucleation site.",
