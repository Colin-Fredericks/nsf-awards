These          students will be introduced to the basic principals and practice of             astronomical observation under the direction of teams consisting of             practicing, established astronomers at Lowell and NAU and two Arizona           high school teachers.                                                                                                                                           The following Young Scholars Program is designed to achieve the                 following goals and objectives:  To provide ten gifted high school              juniors with a three-week, intensive array of activities designed to            introduce them to the fundamentals of astronomical theory and practice.         The activities should also enhance their appreciation of science,               mathematics, and engineering, in general; to introduce these students to        the many astronomy related opportunities available; and to provide              students with a serious consideration of the scientific method in               context of astronomical theory and practice as well as relevant issues          related to the philosophy and ethics of science.",
