 "awd_abstract_narration": "The flux of biogenic debris has often been implicated as major                  vector in the vertical transport of metals in aquatic systems.                  However, efforts to model quantitatively these processes have                   been limited by an inadequate data base on the retention times of               most metals in biogenic debris particularly under different                     conditions of microbial decomposition.  This study includes a                   series of radiotracer experiments in which the retention times of               thirteen metals will be measured in phytoplankton, copepods,                    appendicularians, and chaetognaths as well as zooplankton fecal                 pellets, crustacean molts, and larvacean houses under different                 condition of microbial degradation.  Metal biokinetics and                      pathways in organisms will be studied for metals accumulated from               dissolved and ingested sources.  Metal compartmentalization in                  phytoplankton will be assessed to help understand the fate of                   ingested in herbivores.  A simple model to quantify the roles                   that different forms of biogenic debris can play in mediating the               flux of metals will be constructed and tested off the NE US                     coast.  Decomposition of biogenic debris and metal flux in                      individual types of debris will be measured in material caught in               sediment traps deployed for the SEEP program.  Metal analyses                   will employ the X-ray microprobe facility of the National                       Synchrotron Light Source.",
