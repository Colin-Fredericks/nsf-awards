 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research is to understand and                     interpret the anatomical changes that took place in the human                   back during the transition to bipedalism among our ancestors.                   This is a biological problem of considerble interest to                         anthropologists and the results will be directly relevant to                    reconstructing locomotor behavior and the transformation to                     bipedality in the fossil record.  The first step in solving this                problem will be to conduct a thorough description of the                        musculoskeletal anatomy of the back of apes and an analysis of                  its function in locomotion.                                                                                                                                     The proposed study will combine (1) osteometric comparision of                  the lower thoracic and lumbar regions of the back among humans,                 apes, and other selected primates; (2) comparative dissections of               the muscles of this region in the same species; and, (3)                        cineradiographic analysis of the movements of the vertebral                     column in several species, so that functional hypotheses can be                 verified more objectively.                                                                                                                                      Anthropologists currently disagree on both the posture and                      locomotion that likely characterized our prebipedal ancestor and                on the identification of fully modern bipedality in the fossil                  record.  The results of this study will contribute to our                       knowledge of locomotor analysis and function in the living apes,                and identify anatomical correlates to upright posture in several                types of primates.  Moreover, it should prove valuable to future                understanding of the origin of human bipedalism.",
