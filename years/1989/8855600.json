 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building upon a currently funded NSF project, this three-year project           seeks to address the underrepresentation of deaf persons in mathematics         and science by improving the mathematical knowledge and pedagogical             skills of pre-college teachers of deaf students.  Each summer, fifty            teachers from grades K-12 will participate in a six-week summer session         that will improve their understanding of mathematics content, enhance           their pedagogical knowledge and practice (especially as applied to deaf         students), and familiarize them with the use of microcomputers.                 Participants will be teachers in residential and day schools for the            deaf or in self-contained classrooms for the deaf throughout the nation.                                                                                        Follow-up activities include regional conferences and visits to the             participants' schools by project staff.  Evaluation will include                questionnaires and pre- and post-tests of participants' skills and              knowledge.                                                                                                                                                      Gallaudet University is contributing as cost-sharing an amount equal to         7% of the NSF award.",
