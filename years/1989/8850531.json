 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to help counteract the reported decline in secondary                   science education a cadre of high school science teachers                       will be afford the opportunity for direct encounters with new                   developments in their fields.                                                                                                                                   During the next two years, teachers will actively participate                   in research projects conducted by faculty at Union College,                     Schenectady, New York. During the summer, teachers will be                      involved in such areas as high energy physics,                                  photochemistry, ecology, geological field mapping and                           astrophysics.  Participating secondary teachers and college                     faculty will meet periodically during the eight months                          preceding the summer research experience to facilitate                          familiarization with the computer systems, library, and                         laboratories.  Participants will be able to discuss readings                    and background of the research with their mentors.  An                          important feature of this \"hands-on\" program is a teacher to                    faculty ratio of one to one.  Some sharing of                                   responsibilities will be expected and the teacher will have                     the opportunity to become a \"junior\" collaborator.  Although                    there will not be a traditional classroom setting, scheduled                    daily discussions will help to disseminate and share                            information between the teachers and the faculty.                                                                                                               Teachers will be selected on the basis of their commitment to                   this program and their ability to contribute to and benefit                     from the research experience.  To encourage school districts                    to be more supportive of science education, superintendents                     of participants will agree to five days of release time for                     participants for planning and implementation activities                         related to the summer research experience.  In addition,                        school districts must allocate $200 to $500 for each of two                     years for science equipment and supplies to incorporate some                    aspect of the research experience into the classroom.                           Through the program teachers will obtain the competence to                      serve as resource persons for their schools and the area.                       The ties established between college faculty and the                            teachers, as well as several follow-up activities will ensure                   further college-local school interactions.  Examples are                        lectures given by Union faculty at the home schools of the                      participants, borrowing of equipment for classroom                              demonstrations, and research participation for gifted high                      school students.  Since many teachers have not been involved                    in research activities, this type of program should produce                     committed, research experienced and more competent and self-                    assured science teachers.  Union College and the school                         systems involved have contributed an amount equal to                            approximately 9% of the NSF award.",
