 "awd_abstract_narration": "Analyses of rates of change in fossil-pollen data from                     eastern North America reveal that many sites experienced major                  changes 10,000-14,000 years ago during the last deglaciation and                again during the last 1000 years.  The major objective of the                   proposed research is to determine the timing, magnitude, and                    geographic patterns of the changes in climate and vegetation                    during the past 3000 years in eastern North America and during                  the past 14,000 years in Sweden.  High-frequency pollen data from               an array of sites across eastern North America will be used to                  analyze in detail the apparently rapid changes occurring during                 the past millennium and to sort out the climatic and post-                      Columbian anthropogenic causes.  Data from 40 late-glacial sites                in southern Sweden will be used to compare the temporal structure               of the Scandinavian late-glacial with that of North America.                    Rates of vegetation change attributable to agriculture and other                human activities (as opposed to climatic influences) will be                    evaluated by contrasting Swedish sites from areas having                        intensive human impact iwth those from marginal areas receiving                 little impact.  This research will establish the degree to which                rapid vegetation changes in eastern North America and Europe are                synchronous and will thus identify probable times of major rapid                changes in atmospheric circulation.  The results will also reveal               the degree to which recent vegetation is transitory and to which                presettlement vegetation in North America justifiably serves as a               steady-state baseline for modern studies.",
