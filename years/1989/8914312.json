 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nomadic Turkana pastoralists of northwest Kenya have been                  studied for a number of years as part of a multidisciplinary                    project concerning the people and their ecosystem.  Among the                   most interesting components of the human studies is the                         demography of the Turkana; although they inhabit an extremely                   harsh environment sufficient to impact health and reproduction,                 the Turkana experience an unusually high fertility level for                    nomadic populations, with a very marked seasonal distribution of                births.  Recent studies, finding extremely high rates of infant                 and childhood mortality, suggest that the fertility pattern may                 largely be explained by the pattern and level of mortality.  The                research proposed here is designed to examine the pattern of                    morbidity and mortality among infants and children, and to                      identify determinants of observed patterns.                                                                                                                          Traditional demographic studies of the causes of morbidity                 and mortality have emphasized correlations among socioeconomic                  factors, such as household size, and risk of disease and death,                 and have largely ignored underlying biological processes.  This                 study will employ recently developed immunological techniques to                measure precisely the effect of nutrition and infection on human                health and survival, and will link these factors to analyses of                 sociocultural predictors of risk of disease and death.  The                     results of this work will contribute to our understanding of                    micro-level causes of morbidity and mortality, and will                         facilitate the development of a unified biological and                          demographic approach to the study of child survival.",
