 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Drs. Sanders and Whittington to continue                     archaeological research at the site of Copan.  Located in                       Honduras, this large site documents the rise of Mayan culture.                  It was also occupied during the \"classic period\" when monumental                construction reached its peak and during the following interval                 which saw the \"collapse\" of Mayan society.  Building on work by                 other teams, Dr. Sanders led a multidisciplinary field project                  there from December 1980 until the present.                                                                                                                     Copan developed with an urban \"core\" which housed high status                   individuals, surrounded by a rural area with smaller homesteads.                Within this outlying region, however, a few larger elite                        residences are also located.  These tend to occur in paired                     sites which differ in configuration.  Although some work has been               done in these rural elite compounds their functions are not well                understood.  Drs. Sanders and Whittington will excavate two such                centers.  Artifacts such as pottery should provide insight into                 site function.  Recovered burials will yield data on health,                    nutrition, and demography of residents and obsidian, which can be               dated by a hydration technique, will allow for more precise                     dating.                                                                                                                                                         Archaeologists still do not understand how the Mayan empire                     arose, was maintained, and then collapsed in such a relatively                  short period of time, and this research will help to answer this                question.  It will also increase our knowledge about this very                  important site.                                                                                                                                                 Archaeological data, because they cover such long spans of time                 and because of the direct environmental information they provide,               are well suited to answering such questions of culture process.",
