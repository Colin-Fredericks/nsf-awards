 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ion transport across the plasma membrane by proteins such as ion                channels and ion pumps is vital to cellular functions such as                   signal transduction and volume control.  Despite increased                      information about the molecular structure of transport proteins                 from the cloning of the respective genes, mechanisms underlying                 the cellular regulation of ion transport by channels and pumps                  are not well understood.  This research will focus on the                       regulation of mechanosensitive ion channels and a proton pump in                the plasma membrane of the model eukaryote, Saccharomyces                       cerevisiae.  Mechanosensitive channels will be analyzed using                   patch-clamp electrophysiology to determine the relationship of                  membrane deformation and specific ions to the activation and                    adaptation of mechanosensitive channels by combined measurements                of membrane capacitance and conductance.  Another goal of this                  proposal is to determine the number and function of proteins                    which functionally interact with the proton pump, either as                     modulators or as parallel ion transport mechanisms such as                      channels.  Isolation and genetic characterization of mutants                    affecting proton extrusion by the pump will be followed by                      biochemical, electrophysiological, and molecular genetic studies                to determine exactly how pump regulation is altered in the                      mutants.                                                                                                                                                        Ion channels and ion pumps are of great fundamental importance to               the physiology of cells since they control the traffic of                       specific ions across the membrane.  The proposed combined                       application of the powerful techniques of molecular genetics and                sophisticated electrophysiology to study ion channels and pumps                 in yeast will make it possible to develop parallel knowledge of                 their molecular structure of the channels and their function.",
