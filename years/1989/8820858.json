 "awd_abstract_narration": "The forebrain is the part of the brain of vertebrates that has                  evolved into the elaborate cerebral hemispheres.  Roughly half of               all vertebrate species are bony fishes, yet we know very little                 about the forebrain structure of this important group.  This                    project will clarify the identity of the neuronal fields in the                 two major anterior parts of the brain, the telencephalon and                    diencephalon, in bony fishes.                                                                                                                                   Anatomical studies will follow four lines of approach.  1)                      Distribution of certain chemical markers will be studied by                     antibody binding, to identify regions that are comparable to                    similarly studied regions in the forebrain of other vertebrates.                2) Patterns of connections between forebrain and other brain                    regions will be determined by local uptake and neuronal transport               of certain tracer substances.  3) The unusual development of the                forebrain in these fish will be analyzed to better understand the               origins and correspondences of certain structures with those                    found in other vertebrates.  4) Comparisons will be made among                  fish species that are closely related evolutionarily, but have                  diverse lifestyles and differentially developed sensory systems,                to gain insight into the functional significance of specific                    regions of the forebrain.                                                                                                                                       This work will provide a morphological foundation for                           physiological and behavioral studies, lead to better                            understanding of the organization and evolution of the vertebrate               brain, and reveal new aspects of form and functional relations in               the forebrain.  It will be important to neuroscience in general,                beyond just sensory, motor, or neuroscience, and perhaps                        important to brain modelers.",
