 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will investigate affiliated relationships between               unrelated adult rhesus monkey females of disparate rank.                        Individual focal animals will be followed before, during, and                   after food delivery, together with scans of all animals which are               feeding.  The purpose is to investigate why some subordinates                   gain access to preferred fresh food.  Of particular interest is                 whether subordinates selectively join their dominant affiliates                 in feeding situations.  These data, together with data previously               collected by the investigators will reveal the stability over                   time of frequently affiliating pairs.                                                                                                                                This study will advance our understanding of how subordinate               animals survive in a group where they are dominated, and of the                 social aspects of competitive and noncompetitive feeding.  These                results will bear on current theories of both group bonding and                 reciprocal altruism.",
