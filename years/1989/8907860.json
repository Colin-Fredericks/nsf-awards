 "awd_abstract_narration": "A proposal is being submitted to acquire an ultramicrotome, an                  anti-vibration table and a  knife-maker.  There are four proposed               projects submitted.  Project one will study the fine structure of               the skink (lizard) spermatozoan and its development.  Its                       principle aim will be to elucidate the fine structure of the                    centriolar region (between head and tail) of the lizard sperm and               to describe the process of spermatogenesis in the southern                      united states skinks of the genus Eumeces.  Project two is aimed                at elucidating the details of hormone-receptor binding between                  gonadotrophins (LH) and the mouse epididymis at the                             ultrastructural level.  Results so far obtained at the light                    microscope level indicate a possible concentration of receptors                 for LH in the mouse epididymis perhaps in the Golgi complex and                 endoplasmic reticulum.  The actual site of binding may be                       determined using electron microscope immunohistochemistry.                      Project three will study fungus-host interactions between fungal                endophytes of the family Clavipitaceae (Ascomycotina) and their                 grass hosts with the objective of unraveling the fine structural                changes of fungal and host cells that permit the two organisms to               exist mutualistically.  The fourth project will examine several                 isolates of Haemophilus somnus, a bacterium that is the causative               agent of thromboembolic meningoencephalitis and certain types of                reproductive failure in cattle, for possible presence of a                      capsule, with the objective of discovering its method of                        adherence to host cells.",
