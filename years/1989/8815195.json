 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research addresses potential causes of                   avian extinction in a recently fragmented forest.  Barro Colorado               Island is a 1500 hectare forest preserve in the Panama Canal that               was isolated from mainland forests approximately 70 years ago.                  The disappearance of certain species from Barro Colorado (BCI)                  since the formation of the canal is typical of extinctions that                 occur in habitat fragmented by clear-cutting and other types of                 human activities.  While some species tend to be tolerant of                    habitat fragmentation, and manage to persist in small isolates,                 other species are prone to disappear even from the largest of                   habitat fragments.                                                                   The investigators will examine the additional possibility                  that natural variation in population genetic structure may                      account for variation in extinction probability in a habitat                    isolate.  Since species extinction from habitat isolates is a                   complex biological process, involving changes in species                        interactions and population biology, the problem warrants                       examination of more than one factor.  Using the rapidly                         developing technique of DNA fingerprinting, the investigators                   will seek to describe population genetic structure at a fine                    scale that is difficult to examine with less sensitive methods.                 In addition to assessing the research question posed here, the                  data generated will lend itself to further characterization of                  hypervariable minisatellite regions of DNA.                                          The promise of DNA fingerprinting, and similar new                         molecular techniques that can distinguish genetic variation among               individuals, is for its use in determining minimum viable                       population sizes, suitability of mates in captive breeding                      programs and the genetic impacts of re-introductions.  With                     continued development, molecular biological techniques will allow               close monitoring of the genetic status of dwindling populations.",
