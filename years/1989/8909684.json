 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evidence documenting the course of human change over                   past time is primarily a collection of unique hominid fossils.                  Their uniqueness precludes replacement in case of damage or loss.               Fossils should also be available for study to qualified                         investigators, but most museums justifiably will not allow unique               original specimens out of the museum.  The solution to this                     problem is to make available extremely accurate casts--a                        difficult problem given the minute details of importance on most                fossils.  One researcher has spent many years perfecting the                    process of making such casts and he is well known in the                        profession for doing so.  This project is to allow him to make                  casts of important human fossils currently housed in Yugoslavia,                Czechoslovakia, and Germany, that are currently not available for               study in this country.                                                                                                                                               The molds of these important specimens will be used to                     produce highly accurate positive replicas that will be                          incorporated into the University Museum repository of more than                 2200 fossil hominid and primate reproductions.  There, they are                 available to investigators for study or for loan.  Their                        inclusion in this collection significantly enhances its value to                the scientific community.",
