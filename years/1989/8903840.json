 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long, almost varved sequence of late Pleistocene-Holocene                laminations and bedding have been identified in the Estancia lake               basin in central New Mexico.  Remarkable vertical continutity of                laminations and bedding provide a basis for reconstructing a                    stratigraphic time-series with decadel, centennial and millenial                resolution.  Methods originally applied to varved sediments will                be adapted to reconstruct a time-series based on accumulated                    thickness of bedding and laminations and \"tuned\" with radiocarbon               dates.                                                                               Changes in water volume and expansion and contraction of the               shallow lake are reflected in the rate of accumulation of clay,                 calcium carbonate, and eolean influx of gypsum sand.  These                     parameters will be measured in closely spaced samples, indexed to               the reconstructed time-series, and expressed as sediment flux.                  Correlation of high-stand shoreline deposits with basin-center                  strata will lead to the development of an advanced hydrologic-                  climatic model.                                                                      The project will determine the feasibility of reconstructing               high-resolution stratigraphic records in semi-arid lacustrine                   environments and at the same time evaluate the hydrologic-                      climatic sensitivity of a potentially important site and sediment               record.",
