 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is often taken for granted that young children know very                     little, if anything, about the abstract conceptual domains of                   causality and mathematics, that they focus on perceptual learning               and only turn to abstract concepts around 6 or 7 years of age.                  Gelman and others have shown in their research that even very                   young children, in some cases infants, are interested in rather                 abstract materials.  For example, 6-8 month-old infants choose to               look at a picture with the same number of objects as they hear in               a sequence of drumbeats.  Three-year-olds can already use                       information in pictures of unfamiliar statues of animals to                     decide which of these can move on their own.  This suggests that                people spontaneously form some classes of abstract concepts at                  very early ages.  This research pursues this hypothesis by                      focussing on early knowledge and learning about number and cause.                                                                                               The research targets preschoolers' development and understanding                of the principles of counting and arithmetic, as well as how                    these support their ability and interest in acquiring more                      sophisticated concepts, e.g., infinity, as older children.  It                  also includes work on what information preschool children use to                learn the different principles which govern the causality of                    animate and inanimate objects, for instance that animate objects                have intentions and move on their own, obeying the laws of                      biology, while inanimate objects are moved by agents and are                    controlled solely by the laws of physics.  The research will                    document the sensitivity of humans to the kinds of perceptual                   information that distinguish animate and inanimate objects, e.g.,               that the former are made of malleable and the latter of rigid                   substance, that the movements of machines are stereotyped, while                those of animals are coordinated to respond to variations in the                environment.  It will also test the hypothesis that young                       children honor the constraint to associate statements about                     things they cannot see (e.g., it has a brain, a heart, etc.) with               objects that project appropriate perceptual information, a bias                 which aids their efforts to build the correct class of theories                 about the two different kinds of object classes.                                                                                                                This work is governed by a working theory which confronts the                   variability and fragility of the abilities of young children.                   Tests of the theory will help shape an account of conceptual                    competence and provide information about mechanisms of learning.                Although the work on mechanisms is embedded in the context of                   studies of arithmetic and casual knowledge, it is likely that it                will bear on a more general theory of learning and development.                 The research has implications for the conduct of the educational                enterprise, most particularly early childhood education.  If we                 know what young children are capable of, we can design their                    educational experiences to capitalize on those capabilities.",
