 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conduction of heat and electricity in condensed matter will                 be studied theoretically in four diverse situations.  Two of                    these, diffusive electrical transport in highly disordered                      alloys, and heat transport in insulating glasses, will be                       assisted by large scale computer evaluations of \"exact\" Kubo                    formulas designed both to test simpler approximations and to                    elucidate mechanisms of transport.  The alloy problem uses the                  conventional independent electron model, and the Kubo-Greenwood                 formula.  The glass problem will use the analogous harmonic                     approximation, and the analog conductivity formula which has not                been previously worked out.  Among the aims of these projects are               \"saturation\" of resistivity, and the occurrence in metals of                    negative temperature coefficients of resistivity.  Also a                       rigorous test will be made of the KKR-CPA theory of alloy                       resistivity.                                                                                                                                                    The two other regimes involve quasi-particle transport, in                      conventional band Fermi liquid metals and in the new oxide                      superconductors.  For the former, band theory will be used to                   extract coupling constants from the anistropic resistivity of                   hexagonal metals, and also to analyze the Hall coefficients.  For               the latter, an effort will be made to deduce the nature of the                  current carrying quasi-particles and of the scattering                          mechanisms, by comparison with experimental measurements.",
