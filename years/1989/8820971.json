 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacteria of the genus Bacillus are intensively studied in both                  basic and applied research efforts.  The powerful array of                      genetic techniques available for these organisms allows the                     scientist engaged in basic research to probe the inner workings                 of the cell's genetic machinery.  Their ability to form                         specialized cells (spores) -- analogous to the formation of                     specialized tissues and organs in higher organisms -- allows                    insights into the mysteries of cell differentiation and                         development.  The applied researcher focuses on the ability of                  the bacilli to synthesize a variety of products:  medically                     useful antibiotics; enzymes which degrade proteins (in laundry                  detergents and contact-lens cleaners, for example) or turn starch               to sugar; and natural pesticides that provide an environmentally                responsible alternative to chemicals.                                                                                                                           The Bacillus Genetic Stock Center (BGSC) greatly assists these                  research efforts by maintaining the world's largest public                      culture collection for the genus Bacillus and distributing                      cultures without prejudice to all scientists who request them.                  Each year some 1500 strains are distributed to scientists                       throughout the world.  The BGSC staff are available at all times                for expert consultation and periodically prepare and distribute a               100-page catalog of strains and reference work.                                                                                                                 This project provides partial support for the BGSC's activities                 for the next five years.",
