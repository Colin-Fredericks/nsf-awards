 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acoustic signals are produced by a variety of animals in                   various contexts.  Calls may  isolate species prior to mating and               thus are instrumental in understanding the mechanisms of                        speciation and in testing hypotheses in evolutionary biology and                behavior.  Additionally, acoustical signals have been useful to                 the scientist in distinguishing species that could not be told                  apart using external features.  Thus signals are important tools                for identification and classification of organisms.  The test                   organisms for these studies will be Prokelisia planthoppers.                    Their mating behavior and the mechanism of sound transmission                   will be researched.  Calls of geographic populations will be                    compared to understand signal variation and the parts of the                    calls which confer specified will be studied.  The planthoppers                 are strongly associated with their host plants, since it is the                 food source and also likely the channel of transmission for                     communication among individuals.  Because of their plant                        feeding, the planthoppers are an economically important group and               particularly because many transmit plant pathogens.  Thus                       knowledge of their mating behavior and signalling is essential in               designing effective control measures.",
