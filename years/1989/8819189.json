 "awd_abstract_narration": "Newborns of many species learn to identify their mother and their home          environment through the use of olfactory cues.  For altricial (late-            developing) animals, learning these cues is critical to survival, as            the mother is the sole source of nutrition and warmth during the pre-           weanling period.  Dr. Wilson and his colleagues have shown that                 rodents, and especially neonatal animals, possess an extraordinarily            good ability to learn about odors.  In fact, rodents' olfactory                 learning capabilities may be quite as powerful as are the visual                memories of humans and monkeys.  He is utilizing these striking                 olfactory learning capacities to clarify both how and where memories            are encoded within specific regions of the olfactory bulb.                                                                                                      Dr. Wilson's previous work has shown that this early learning is                associated with a measurable change in the neonate's brain, and that            the response of the olfactory neurons to the learned olfactory cues             shows a unique spatio-temporal pattern of activity.  He is now                  combining intracellular electrophysiology with neuroanatomy and                 cellular metabolism techniques, to investigate (a) how individual               cells in the olfactory bulb change their electrophysiological response          as a function of learning an odor, and (b) the overall pattern of               electrophysiological and metabolic activity occurring within adjacent           and distant layers of the olfactory bulb.  This work will further               define this unique, learned response pattern, and will attempt to               provide an understanding of the mechanisms involved in producing these          neuronal changes, which are perhaps the cellular mechanisms of                  learning.",
