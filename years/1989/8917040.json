Two                       workshops are proposed, one on the subject of autonomous                        underwater vehicle and subsea robotics technology in Norway,                    and the other on aquaculture/sea ranching technology in                         Florida.  These workshops will serve to bring leading                           researchers in both countries together to further develop                       joint research programs in this area.  The Harbor Branch                        Foundation, Ft. Pierce, FL will provide assistance as stated                    herein.                                                                                                                                                         Approximately ten individuals from the U.S. will be selected                    to participate in each workshop.  The Norwegians will also                      select approximately ten participants for each workshop.  The                   participants will meet for three days, presenting papers,                       discussing topics of mutual research interest and planning                      for future collaboration.  One or two additional days will                      be used for conducting visits of facilities pertaining to the                   workshop topics.",
