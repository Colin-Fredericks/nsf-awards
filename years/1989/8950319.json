 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies have documented that many institutions of higher education offer        marginal physical science programs; some offer no physical science              courses.  Further, a significant fraction of elementary and middle-             school science teachers are poorly prepared to teach physical science.          This project at California State University Long Beach will develop a           new interdisciplinary college-level physical science course, with the           clear intention of serving both future teachers and general liberal arts        students.  The process is widely supported within the university, and           has the potential of affecting a significant fraction of California's           future elementary and middle-school teachers.  The course will change           the usual limited and isolated social interaction that is common in             introductory laboratories in science, and replace it with a simulation          of a more realistic scientific community, one involving the sharing of          data, honesty in reporting, and the public \"coming together\" of                 participants to make sense of multiple measurements.  In general, the           new course will connect research in cognitive science and psychology to         effective classroom practices for college physical science students.                                                                                            The cost sharing for the project will be twenty-four percent of the             National Science Foundation portion.",
