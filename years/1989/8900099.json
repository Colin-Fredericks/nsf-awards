Properties of triplet excited states and reaction intermediates                 formed in the photoexcitation of cyclic enones in the presence                  and absence of alkenes will be studied by nanosecond flash                      photolysis, photoacoustic calorimetry and time-resolved                         resonance Raman spectroscopy.  The goal is to obtain data which                 will allow specification of the molecular structures and                        energies of singlet and triplet states, strained trans isomers                  of cyclic enones and of triplet 1,4-biradical intermediates.                    These studies will establish how energetic relaxation in cyclic                 enone triplets is affected by ring size and substitution and                    how molecular structure affects rates of spin inversions to                     ground states from triplet excited states, a matter of                          fundamental significance in organic photochemistry.                             Mechanistic studies of the synthetically important                              photocycloaddition of cyclic enones to olefins will be carried                  out.  In particular, secondary deuterium isotope effects will                   be determined for quenching of enone triplets by alkenes and                    for formation of cycloadducts in order to determine if                          enone-alkene exciplexes of any kind are on the reaction pathway                 to triplet 1,4-biradicals.",
