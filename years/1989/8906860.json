 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several technologies have been developed for the safe disposal of               hazardous wastes.  For dilute aqueous streams with moderate organic             concentrations, oxidation in supercritical water (SCW) to innocuous             compounds (such as carbon dioxide and water) has been shown to be               effective.  The overall objective of the PI's research is to elucidate          the fundamental reaction pathways, kinetics, and mechanisms occurring           during such oxidation in SCW and to understand fully the role and               effect of the supercritical fluid in these reaction.  An understanding          of the fundamental physical and chemical phenomena operative during             this process could lead to  more efficient and economical process               designs.                                                                                                                                                        In this phase of his work, the PI plans experimental studies on the             conversion of some typical organic compounds (such as phenol and                substituted phenol) present in waste streams.  This equipment grant             will provide the funds to purchase the components needed to construct           a flow reactor.  Flow reactors are well suited for experimental                 studies of such rapid exothermic reactions.  Using the experimental             results, the PI plans to deduce the reaction pathways and determine             the relevant kinetics parameters such as the reaction order, rate               constant, activation energy and activation volume for each reaction             step.  Reaction mechanisms will be probed by using isotopically tagged          phenol, water, and                                                              oxygen and monitoring the ultimate fate of the tagged functional                groups.//",
