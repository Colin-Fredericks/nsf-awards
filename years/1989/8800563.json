 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide a real-time verification of the                  input code for numerical control (NC) machine tools.  The                       program will have several facets: visualization of the cutting                  process in wireframe, solid model display of the part after any                 desired interactive rendering of part geometry.  The key aspect                 of this project -- solid modeling of the as-machined part -- is                 accomplished by a novel approach termed \"extended octrees\"                      (EO).  In contrast to other popular solid model methods, the                    time per cut (Boolean operation) remains roughly constant with                  EO, as the part complexity grows.  EO recursively subdivides                    the space occupied by the workpiece into cubic regions of                       variable size that are empty or filled (classical octrees) as                   well as face, edge and vertex cells.  The model is fully                        three-dimensional with each cut input as a boundary                             representation of the volume swept out by the tool.                             Various improvements are proposed to reduce the time per cut                    (currently a few seconds per cut on a 386-based PC).  The as-                   machined solid model can be compared with the computer aided                    design solid model (via a  boolean) for automated verification.                 The solid model may also be  helpful in assisting heuristic                     methods to carry out process planning for multi-axis NC code                    generation.",
