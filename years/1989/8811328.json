 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to obtain a superminicomputer.                     The research programs of the principal user group are directed                  at structural studies of macromolecules and macromolecular                      assemblies.  The major techniques to be employed center around                  x-ray crystallographic and NMR-spectroscopic data collection,                   interpretation, and molecular modelling studies.  Recent                        developments have increased the experimental information to an                  unprecedented extent.  First, the availability of multi-wire                    area detectors has increased the rate and quality of x-ray data                 collection by a factor of at least 10 to 100.  Second,                          crystallization of very large macromolecular complexes has been                 possible on a few cases.  Third, with recent advances on NMR                    techniques it is now possible to obtain a number  of                            approximate interproton distances for small to medium-size                      macromolecular sufficient to define the structures in solution.                 Fourth, progress has been made in the area of computer                          simulation of macromolecules.  All of this combined implies                     that the experimental data analysis and interpretation clearly                  becomes a bottleneck for our studies, and thus requires another                 major computational upgrade of our facilities.",
