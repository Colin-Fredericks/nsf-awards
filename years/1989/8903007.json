One certainly,                   was the discovery by Hans Lewy in 1957 of a simple, linear                      partial differential equation of first order which had no                       solutions whatsoever.  The key to the example was the use of                    complex rather than real-valued coefficients.  Part of the                      continuing work carried out in this project belongs to a                        long-term project to explain and understand this phenomenon.                         The context of the research is that of systems of complex                  vector fields representing overdetermined systems of partial                    differential equations.  One says that such a system represents                 a differential complex.  An algebraic characteristic of                         complexes is a quantity called the cohomology.  Actually there                  are levels of cohomology; the one of interest here is the p-th                  cohomology.  It is of interest because there is strong evidence                 to suggest that the vanishing of the p-th cohomology is related                 to the triviality of the homology, in dimension p-1, of the                     level sets of the solutions to the associated partial                           differential equations.  A systematic study of this                             relationship is planned.                                                             A second line of investigation will be concerned with                      obstructions to local solvability of differential equations                     through the application of homotopy methods.  Recent advances                   in this area indicate that homotopy formulas can be used on                     certain important differential operators even when the                          underlying domains do not satisfy even weak pseudo-convexity                    conditions on the boundary.",
