 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PYI award is to a leader in undergraduate as well as graduate              research.  The research of the PI examines the mechanisms by which              intracellular proteolysis is regulated during muscle restructuring.             Controlled proteolysis is an important aspect of the normal development         and differentiation of tissues.  Using biochemical, morphological and           organ culture techniques, the PI focuses on the role of nonlysosomal            proteinases (enzymes that degrade or hydrolyze protein) in myofibrillar         protein turnover.  The crustacean claw muscles is employed as a model           because as the animal prepares to molt, the claw muscles undergo a              profound atrophy in which up to 40% of the muscle protein is degraded.          This protein is resynthesized during a post-molt period.                                                                                                        The PI is currently examinging the control of proteinases by humoral            agents.  Future studies will use recombinant DNA technology to elucidate        the developmental expression of proteinases during the molt cycle.  In          this manner proteinase expression should be correlated with the                 initiation, maintenance, and termination of muscle atrophy.",
