The materials will be in          two major forms, SourceBook and SourceView.  SourceBook will be the             teaching database for the high school teacher of chemistry.  It will            include a series of Chemistry Resources Planning Topics at its core,            surrounded by general practical methodologies and collected practical           information for the safe and effective teaching of chemistry.                   SourceView will include visualizations of methods of teaching in the            context of high school chemistry classrooms with the goal of providing          nearly ideal examples of chemistry lessons.  The materials in both              SourceBook and SourceView  will be developed by a team of outstanding           high school and college level chemical educators from across the United         States.  Printing, dissemination, and updating of the materials will be         the responsibility of the American Chemical Society.",
