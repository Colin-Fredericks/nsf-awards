 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitrogen-fixing organisms are especially vulnerable to oxygen                   damage due to the oxygen sensitivity of nitrogenase and to                      the strong reducing conditions required to fix nitrogen.  In                    legume root nodules, oxygen toxicity is minimized by action                     of special defense enzymes including superoxide dismutase,                      ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate reductase and                        other enzymes of the ascorbate-glutathione cycle.  The main                     objectives of this research are to characterize the enzymes                     involved in oxygen defense, to determine the subcellular                        localization of these enzymes, to determine if these enzymes                    are nodule-specific, and to examine the criticality of the                      link between oxygen defense and nitrogen fixation.                              Enzymological studies will involve purification and 2-D gel                     electrophoresis followed by immunological detection.                            Purified enzymes will be used to prepare antisera for                           immunological detection of subcellular localization using                       both light and electron microscopy.  Ineffective nodules will                   be examined for deficiencies in oxygen defense enzymes.                         Plants with effective nodules will be grown in root                             atmospheres of various oxygen concentrations and the response                   of nodule defense mechanisms will be monitored.%%%                                                                                                              Legumes provide a substantial portion of the world's protein                    without requiring nitrogen fertilizer.  The enhancement of                      nitrogen fixation in these, as well as other crop plants, is                    an attractive alternative to increasing reliance on nitrogen                    fertilizers.  In order for such improvements to come about we                   must understand both the biochemistry and physiology of                         nitrogen nodule physiology.  This research investigates the                     enzymes responsible for minimizing oxygen toxicity in these                     nodules.  A better understanding of these enzymes may allow                     for their manipulation which may, in turn, increase crop                        yields.  Furthermore, they may be required for the future                       development of new nitrogen-fixing associations in crop                         species.***//",
