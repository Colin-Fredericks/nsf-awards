 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in Automorphic Forms of                   Professor Paul Garrett of the University of Minnesota. Dr.                      Garrett's work is concerned with integral representations of L-                 functions and Eisenstein series. Among the topics he plans to                   work on are: criteria for expressibility of automorphic forms as                theta series, relations between zeros and poles of Eisenstein                   series and L-functions, integral representations of Eisenstein                  series attached to cuspforms, and uniqueness results for Hecke                  eigenfunctions with prescribed invariance.                                           Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                 century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                     century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                       fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                 The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                  rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                    study of Modular and Automorphic Forms is one of the most active.               This field is principally concerned with questions about the                    whole numbers, but in its use of Geometry and Analysis, it                      retains connection to its historical roots.",
