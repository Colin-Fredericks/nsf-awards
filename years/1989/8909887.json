 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last few years the controversy about competition as               a major determinant of community structure has made a variable                  contribution to the ecological literature.  Empirical work in                   natural communities which provides unambiguous data to support                  either of the arguments is uncommon.  The experiments, field and                lab, which are proposed will demonstrate the existence or absence               of competition within a guild of parasites.  Results will show if               it is possible for several species to occupy the \"same niche\" at                the same time.  In addition, sufficient data will be gathered on                host parasite interactions to determine if the relationship is                  parasitic or commensal.  This proposal will test the hypothesis                 that: (1) the Wyoming ground squirrel (Spermophilus elegans                     elegans)-Coccidia (Eimeria) association is the product of a long                coevolutionary history and that the \"parasites\" are really                      commensals with animal effects on host fitness, (2) the                         parasites elicit no immune response in the host, and (3) there is               no niche partitioning among parasite species with the host.  It                 is proposed that these parasites have evolved to use ephermeral                 resources, the quickly regenerating cells of the intestinal                     epithelium, and they are the epitome of fugitive species.  The                  proposal will test the lack of community-level controls on                      \"fugitive\" species using a model system of ground squirrels and                 their parasites.  This is the first long-term experimental study                on host-parasite interactions of this duration or with such a                   large sample size in a natural population.",
