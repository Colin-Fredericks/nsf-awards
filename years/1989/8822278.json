 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Forster is pursuing a line of research which he began in his                paper, \"Unification, Explanation, and the Composition of Causes                 in Newtonian Mechanics.\"  His goal under this grant it to extend                and develop this research into what he calls a \"Whewellian\"                     approach to the philosophy of science.  William Whewell, an                     astronomer and leading science educator, made major                             contributions to the history and philosophy of science.  His                    philosophical works on induction have been undergoing a recent                  revival among current historians, philosophers and sociologists                 of science.  This work entails a summary of Whewell's philosophy                of science with special emphasis on the hierarchical nature of                  scientific induction.  He will examine in this context problems                 concerning the existence of component forces and inertial                       reference frames in Newtonian mechanics.  He will further examine               applications of Whewell's ideas to probabilistic methods of                     causal inference, strange quantum mechanical correlations, the                  confirmational utility of unification, Glymour's bootstrapping                  account of confirmation, and the problem of old evidence.  These                issues are of central concern for contemporary philosophy of                    science.",
