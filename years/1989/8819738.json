 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phospholipids are major components of biological membranes                      and undergo a continuous cycle of synthesis and degradation                     as part of normal membrane function.  Within this cycle,                        lysophospholipids exist as metabolically active                                 intermediates, the amounts of which are regulated by the                        catalytic activity of several enzymes.  The potent effects of                   lysophospholipids on numerous biological processes and the                      accumulation of these compounds under pathological conditions                   suggest a requirement for stringent regulation of the                           concentration of lysophospholipids.  The working hypothesis                     of this research project is that specific lysophospholipids                     are transiently released during stimulation of brain                            synaptosome, and that these compounds serve as modulators in                    regulating neurotransmitter release.  Recent studies have                       provided evidence for such regulation and have implicated                       these compounds in intercellular communication mechanisms.                      Studies currently are underway on the characterization of                       some of the relevant enzymes in these metabolic pathways and                    on the factors responsible for controlling the metabolism of                    these compounds.  The research will extend the studies to (a)                   determine the quantitative importance of different chemical                     reactions which generate and remove lysophospholipids in                        brain synaptosomes under resting (basal) conditions, (b)                        determine the physiological mechanisms of lysophospholipid                      production in brain synaptosomes under conditions of                            stimulation, and (c) purify and characterize some of the key                    enzymes (phospholipase A2, lysophosphatidylcholine                              acyltransferase, and lysophosphatidylinositol                                   acyltransferase) controlling these processes.  The overall                      goal of the project is to elucidate the biochemical pathways                    responsible for regulating the amounts of these important                       biomolecules.  The studies are expected to lead to a better                     understanding of the molecular events occurring during                          neurotransmission.",
