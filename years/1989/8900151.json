 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of faculty adviser Dr. Jeffrey Doyle,                   graduate student Anne Bruneau of Cornell University will study                  the molecular systematics, morphology, and pollination biology of               species in the legume genus Erythrina.  Several species are                     cultivated as street trees in the tropics, used as living fences,               or planted as shade trees in coffee and cacao plantations.  All                 Erythrina species have red or orange flowers and are pollinated                 by either hummingbirds or perching birds (order Passeriformes).                 Species pollinated by perching birds have wide, gaping flowers                  that are oriented toward branches or branch tips; species                       pollinated by hummingbirds have narrow-tubed flowers that face                  outwards and only birds that hover can obtain nectar, and thereby               effect pollination.  Hummingbird pollination has been considered                more specialized than pollination by perching birds, but this has               never been critically tested.                                                        Considerable biological and horticultural interest has                     resulted in the availability of nearly all 112 species in the                   genus in living collections.  Laboratory work will focus on                     molecular markers of species diversification, obtained from                     analyses of chloroplast DNA and nuclear ribosomal DNA.  Combined                molecular and morphological evidence will produce a robust                      phylogenetic tree for the group.  Field work will document the                  specific pollinators of those remaining species not yet studied.                The researchers can then determine the evolutionary relationships               between hummingbird- and perching bird-pollinated species and                   test whether the evolutionary change occurred once or several                   times among species of this genus.",
