 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the area of transition metal chemistry.                 The goal of the project is the synthesis of molecules which                     have two binding sites for transition metals, one of which will                 enclose the metal completely, and the other of which will hold                  the metal firmly but still leave it able to bind an additional                  small molecule, such as dioxygen. The resulting new metal                       complexes are expected to act as catalysts for oxidation                        reactions, and will serve as useful models for important                        respiratory enzymes.                                                                                                                                            The focus of the project is the synthesis of binucleating                       ligands for the generation of homo- and heterobimetallic                        complexes of the first transition series. These ligands are                     designed so that one metal resides in a coordinatively                          saturated site, whereas the other contiguous metal is                           coordinatively unsaturated. These complexes are expected to                     bind dioxygen and oxo groups at the exposed metal, and the                      metal in the encapsulated site should serve to provide                          electrons to the neighboring site. Such systems could lead to                   intramolecular four-electron reduction of dioxygen and possibly                 serve as catalysts for the direct use of dioxygen for                           oxidations. The binding of oxygen to these bimetallic complexes                 will be studied in order to determine which complexes reduce                    oxygen and which combinations of metals lead to four-electron                   reduction of oxygen. Metal oxo complexes, which are the                         possible products of reaction with oxygen, will be prepared and                 their reactivity as oxidants toward a variety of reducing                       agents will be studied.",
