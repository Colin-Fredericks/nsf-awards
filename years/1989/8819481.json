 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. McEwan and his colleagues will conduct two seasons of                       archaeological research at the site of Pikillacta which is                      located in the Peruvian highlands near the city of Cuzco.  This                 large and impressive site exhibits evidence of strong centralized               planning.  Within a surrounding wall, the interior reveals a                    rigid geometric layout.  Previous work at the site by Dr. McEwan                and other investigators indicate that it was established ca. 600                A.D. and served as a provincial center in a larger Wari empire                  (named after the Peruvian site of Wari.)  To gain greater insight               into the functioning of this city Dr. McEwan and colleages will                 excavate a number of buildings to determine their function.  By                 this means he will attempt to learn how the city itself was                     organized and how it interacted with other sites.  Ceramic and                  other materials will be analyzed to provide a more detailed                     chronology.  Trace element analysis of selected ceramic types                   will permit identification of non.local objects and hopefully                   permit the reconstruction of trade networks.                                                                                                                    Wari culture flourished from ca. 540 to 900 A.D. and is believed                by many scholars to represent the first organized imperial state                in the New World.  However it is unclear just how it functioned                 and how the center at Wari incorporated and controlled outlying                 regions.  Some scholars have argued for a tight form of control                 and integration while others have maintained that looser                        relations existed.  Because Pikillacta is a major provincial                    center, it should provide data which may be fruitfully compared                 to similar information from the Wari itself.                                                                                                                    This research is important because it will provide data about an                obviously important but little known archaeological site.                       Because the political situation in the Peruvian highlands is                    growing increasingly difficult, the project should be done now.                 The research will also increase our understanding of how large                  and complex political entities emerge, are maintained and                       decline.",
