 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is being performed on a three-dimensional (3-D) graphics               workstation based on the CUBE architecture, which is centered around a          cubic frame-buffer of voxels with three processors accessing the cubic          memory to input geometric and scanned data, to manipulate, to project,          and to render the 3-D images.  An inherent 3-D user interface employing         a true 3-D input device and the complementing 3-D screen environment is         being developed.  Skewed memory organizations of the cubic frame buffer         that provide conflict-free access to beams in arbitrary directions are          being simulated.  Finally, a viewing architecture that allows direct            and faster arbitrary parallel and perspective projections is being              simulated.  The architecture designed is a versatile 3-D workbench for          medical, engineering, biological, geological, and other 3-D                     visualization applications.                                                     The principal investigator's prior work on the CUBE architecture                (supported by NSF) is well-recognized and well-respected.  His idea of          voxel memory is an innovative and sound engineering approach.  The              approach using VLSI is in the right direction and avoids the                    conventional bus delays.  This proposal represents one of a few serious         academic efforts in developing substantial computer graphics hardware           ideas.  The work proposed will likely lead to tools that help                   scientists to visualize three-dimensional images.  Support is strongly          recommended.",
