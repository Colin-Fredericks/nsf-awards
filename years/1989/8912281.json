 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Guam Marine Laboratory is a research unit of the University                 of Guam, the major institution of higher education within the                   geographic region of Micronesia.  Functions of the Marine                       Laboratory include basic and applied research relevant to the                   development, conservation and regulation of the region's marine                 resources.  In addition, the Marine Laboratory helps to develop                 the analytical capabilities of future leaders of the region.                                                                                                    The University of Guam Marine Laboratory is uniquely situated                   near a variety of thriving coral reef habitat that are easily                   accessible by land and by small boats.  It is located at Pago                   Bay, on the eastern coast of Guam and is presently housed in two                main buildings.  The laboratory currently has four small research               boats and an 11.4-m research vessel for studies around Guam and                 nearby areas.  A flowing seawater system allows the successful                  rearing and maintenance of marine organisms.                                                                                                                    The equipment provided in this award will enhance the                           laboratory's research capabilities for the study and                            documentation of microscopic and cellular phenomena.  The                       microscope and dissecting scope will be employed in a wide                      variety of studies of biological events requiring substantial                   clear magnification.  Such studies range from direct                            observation, particularly in studies of larval fish and                         invertebrates, to the demonstration, through the use of                         fluorescent anti-body techniques of specific metabolic                          capabilities of marine organisms.  The low-temperature freezer                  will allow scientists to properly store cells and tissues to be                 used in examining molecular and cellular aspects of genetics such               as the sequencing of mitochondrial DNA.  The pure-water system                  will be of use in the many studies requiring reagents to be                     mixed at the laboratory.",
