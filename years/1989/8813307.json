 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a primary feature of ocean circulation and key component of                  the global carbon cycle, changes in the thermocline must be                     accounted for if we are to understand the processes involved in                 Quaternary climatic fluctuation.  Preliminary results, based on                 the benthic foraminiferal 018 and 13c records in cores from the                 mid-and lower-thermocline at Little Bahama Bank, suggest the                    glacial thermocline at about 540 meters wataer depth was                        approximately 2oC cooler and more 13c enriched that it is                       today.  The objective for this project is to determine how                      bathymetric profiles of nutrients and physical properties                       within the thermocline have evolved from the last glacial                       maximum to the present.  The goal is to relate thermocline                      evolution in the North  Atlantic subtropical gyre to glacial-                   interglacial changes of physical forcing factors, the global                    carbon budget/atmospheric pCO2 and intermediate/deep water                      circulation.  In order to accomplish this goal, a suite of                      cores from the well-sedimented southern flank of Little Bahama                  Bank will be collected Over the depth range 400 to 1700 meters.                 %%%                                                                                                                                                             A primary feature of ocean circulation is the depth of the                      thermocline where warm, well-mixed surface water lies on top of                 colder deep water. the depth to this fundamental boundary must                  be known for glacial periods in order to reconstruct the                        history of oceans during the last glacial maximum.  This                        project will use oxygen and carbon iosotopes in benthic                         foraminifera found in sedimentary cores from the flanks of                      Little Bahama Bank to document the fluctuations of the                          thermocline during fluctuations of the climate. The evolution                   of patterns in theromcline thickness, temperature, and nutrient                 supply will be determined for the first time in an open ocean                   environment where local coastal effects will be absent.",
