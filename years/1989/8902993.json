 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Corwin and Goodman will pursue a wide-ranging                   program of research in the representation theory of Lie groups                  and related objects. Part of Corwin's work will deal with                       invariant differential operators on homogeneous spaces of                       nilpotent groups. He will also study supercuspidal                              representations of p-adic groups. Goodman will continue                         investigating the representations of current algebras and loop                  groups. The algebraic properties of higher-order Sugawara                       operators will be studied using the theory of tensor invariants                 for the classical groups. Analytic aspects of the geometric                     models for positive-energy representations of loop groups will be               examined. Goodman will also seek new types of Whittaker models                  for representations of real reductive groups.                                        This project has to do with the representation theory of Lie               groups (and of their cousins, Lie algebras), which bear the name                of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie. One basic example of a               Lie group is the group of rotations of a sphere, where the group                operation consists of following one motion by another. Detailed                 information concerning this group is very helpful in solving                    mathematical or physical problems in which spherical symmetry is                present. Other groups of motions capture other kinds of symmetry.               A more algebraic (as opposed to geometric) source of examples of                Lie groups comes from the multiplication of matrices. The group                 of all invertible real (or complex) matrices of a given size is a               Lie group, as is just about any subgroup thereof that can be                    described in a natural manner. It is desirable to be able to go                 back and forth between the geometric and algebraic points of                    view, for instance to consider the numerous ways in which the                   rotation group of the sphere can be realized as a group of                      invertible matrices. This, roughly, is representation theory.                   Facts about the representations of a given group tend to store a                lot of information very economically. Depending on where the                    group in question comes from, this information can impinge on                   almost any subject from number theory to mathematical physics.                  The project of Professors Corwin and Goodman spans a fair                       portion of the applications and emphases of contemporary                        representation theory",
