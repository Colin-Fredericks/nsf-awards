 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to purchase equipment for a newly                     developed laboratory course in the Department of Psychology at                  Bryn Mawr College.  This course will teach female undergraduates                sophisticated techniques to enable them to conduct advanced,                    publishable research in neural and behavioral sciences.  The                    course will use oscilloscopes, waveform generators, brain                       stimulators and will deal with Ohm's law, Kirchoff's laws,                      Thevin's theorem, resistor capacitor networks for low-pass and                  high-pass filters.  Ultimately students will simulate the                       electrical properties of nerve conduction and ionic conductances.               A sciatic nerve lab will introduce the student to principles of                 recording and to classic nerve conduction experiments.  The goal                will be the understanding of principles of volume conduction,                   especially as they apply to the recording of remote potentials in               the brain.  Use will be made of stimulators, digital                            oscilloscopes for examination of waveform, and the                              electrophysiological amplifiers.  Chronic recording of EEG will                 use the computer and the amplifier and the band pass amplifier to               enable the student to use power spectral analysis of endogenous                 rhythmic activity in order to correlate such activity with                      behavior.  Students could conduct research projects on the                      relation of hippocampal theta rhythms and pharmacological                       manipulations on recorded activity of single cell.  Students will               learn how to use the digital oscilloscope and the computer                      software packages in order to determine the criteria for                        identifying single units.  The grantee institution is matching                  this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.",
