 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inherent response time of electronic devices can be improved by             decreasing the active device capacitance.  As devices are scaled                laterally using sophisticated lithographic tools, such as e-beam                lithography, the devices must also be scaled vertically to ensure               proper charge control.  This includes the thinning of active channel            and contact regions in devices such as FET's and HEMT's.  Contact               regions, in particular, are difficult to scale by conventional                  techniques such as ion-implantation.  Selective etch-back and regrowth          techniques will substantially influence the development of nanometer            gate length devices with reduced short channel effects.  Using a                chemically assisted ion-beam etching system and a regrowth chamber              will allow nanometer gate length devices with reduced short channel             effects to be fabricated.  Vertical devices are exciting because                enhanced substrate currents which cause short channel effects in                lateral devices are absent.  Also, the critical device dimensions are           grown by epitaxial techniques and hence can be made extremely small,            thereby decreasing electron transit times and enhancing device speed.           These and other advanced fabrication techniques will be investigated            for use in producing improved performance solid state devices for               integrated circuit applications.",
