 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Messina's research is aimed at elucidiating the behavioral                  mechanisms by which an insect chooses its food plants.  Whether a               particular insect will become a serious pest or not depends on                  its response to a series of physical and chemical traits                        associated with its potential hosts.  Some insects are known to                 avoid laying eggs on plants if those plants already bear eggs;                  chemical \"marking pheromones\" are typically used by egg-laying                  females to distinguish between occupied and unoccupied hosts.                   Several investigators have suggested that these natural                         deterrents to egg-laying may eventually provide an additional                   tool in pest management.                                                                                                                                        Dr. Messina is investigating the behavioral sequence involved in                rejecting or accepting a host on the basis of whether or not                    other insects are already present on it.  The research also                     attempts to understand the high degree of variation in egg-laying               behavior that has been observed among separate populations or                   \"biotypes.\"  Finally, the experiments will assess how egg-laying                decisions are influenced by learning or experience, which has                   been largely ignored in insect studies.  When combined with                     previous genetic and physiological data, the experiments should                 provide a thorough picture of an unusually complex invertebrate                 behavior.                                                                                                                                                       The seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus is perhaps the most                    destructive pest of cowpea and related grain legumes in several                 regions of the world.  It has been associated with human stores                 of legume seeds for at least a few thousand years.  Female                      beetles are known to use a variety of cues in their host choices.               The susceptibility of a legume variety is strongly affected, for                example, by the texture of the seed coat.  Predicting beetle                    behavior and population growth has been complicated, however, by                extreme variation in several traits among different geographic                  populations.  Dr. Messina's research will identify how variation                in both larval and adult behavior affects the degree of                         competition between individuals and, in turn, the rate of                       population growth.  In general, these studies provide a model                   system for understanding the origin and maintenance of life-                    history variation among populations of a single species.",
