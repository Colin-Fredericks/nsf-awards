 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mappings from domains in Euclidean space of any dimension                  into the same space are said to be quasiregular if the distortion               remains bounded.  This means that infinitesimal dilations remain                within fixed limits in all directions and at all points.  The                   concept is similar to that of quasiconformal mapping except that                quasiregular maps are not required to be univalent.  Aside from                 their interest as transformations which preserve reasonable                     geometric properties, they also occur as solutions of quasilinear               elliptic partial differential equations involving the gradient of               scalar-valued functions.  The first goal of this mathematical                   research is to determine the interior regularity of these                       solutions, which may fail since the gradient of the solution can                vanish at interior points (in contrast to quasiconformal maps).                 A specific objective is to show that the gradients of solutions                 are locally of bounded mean variation.  This is a natural                       question since it has recently been shown that the gradients                    are in all the Lebesgue spaces (locally).                                            Additional work will focus on the differential operator                    known as the p-Laplacian which is receiving considerable                        attention at this time.  Gradients of solutions of the                          corresponding homogeneous equation have their oscillation bounded               by the maximum of their length.  This is not the best possible                  estimate on the oscillation - a better one has been found in two                dimensions.  Efforts will be made to extend the sharper bound to                higher dimensions.                                                                   In a more geometric vein, work will continue on the question               of boundary limits of quasiregular mappings.  At issue is the                   extent to which a quasiregular mapping or a solution of the                     p-Laplacian can be expected to approach a limiting value as the                 independent variable approaches the boundary of the domain of                   definition in a nontangential manner.  When the domain is a ball,               the existence of nontangential limits is known to exist in sets                 of low Hausdorff measure in the case of the p-Laplacian, but it                 is not known whether quasiregular maps must have any such limits                at all.  Those with smooth distortion are understood, but                       quasiregular maps do not always have smooth or even continuous                  distortion.",
