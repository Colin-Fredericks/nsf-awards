 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support cooperative research between Prof. W.S.                 Reeburgh of the University of Alaska, and Dr. David T. Heggie of the            Australian Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology, and Geophysics,                Canberra, Australia.  The investigators will participate in a joint             geochemical/geophysical research cruise on the northwest shelf of               Australia, aboard the vessel RIG SEISMIC.  Measurements of water                column and sediment methane concentrations and carbon isotope ratios            will be made with the intention of determining whether the hydrocarbons         observed are modern, or are related to the presence of petroleum                under the sea.                                                                                                                                                  The northwest shelf of Australia is known to have petroleum potential.          Measurements in this environment will extend the U.S. investigator's            previous experience in Alaskan and Black Sea waters, and the earlier            joint studies of the U.S. and Australian investigators in methane               geochemistry.  This research is aimed at understanding the geochemical          and microbiological controls on anaerobic methane oxidation, and the            role this process plays in the global methane budget, which could               play an important role in atmospheric warming.",
