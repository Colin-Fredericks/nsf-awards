 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two applied mathematics workshops are being offered for college                 faculty.  The five-day workshops are being held in the Summer of 1989           at Salisbury State University and are sponsored by the MD-DC-VA Section         of the Mathematical Association of America.  The primary population             will be members of the section and members from contiguous states.  The         emerging symbiosis of mathematics and microcomputers is being                   emphasized, with the goal of the workshop to provide effective                  applications for the classroom.  The first workshop on Chaos theory is          being given by Celso Grebogi of the University of Maryland Lab for              Plasma Physics.  Chaos is a field with conceptual and technical                 contributions that should be in everyone's applied math kit.  It makes          natural and powerful use of computers.  The second workshop on Decision         Making, is being given by T. L. Saaty of the University of Pittsburgh.          His Analytic Hierarchy Process is applicable to complex systems,                especially in the behavioral and social science fields.  Moreover, an           expert system is available that has been designed to implement AHP and          to run on a microcomputer.                                                                                                                                      The institution is contributing additional support for the program and          the participant's institutions will also provide support.",
