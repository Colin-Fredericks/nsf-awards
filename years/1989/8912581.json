 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was submitted for consideration as an Expedited Award             for Novel Research.  The PI has proposed to study theoretically a               novel variant to high-energy particle acceleration utilizing laser-             plasma interactions.  Currently, two laser-plasma approaches are in             the literature, the beat-wave accelerator and the inverse free-                 electron laser.  The basic idea originally suggested by Bobin of                introducing a plasma into the IFEL could improve significantly the              acceleration gradient.  The PI considers Bobin's theoretical                    calculations as far from complete or reliable and, in particular,               feels that a treatment of phase information is lacking that is crucial          to its operation.  He proposes to carry out theoretical modeling and            computer simulation of the plasma-enhanced concept, based in large              degree on new ideas of adapting particle codes available from UCLA.             The project is timely as it could serve as proof-of-principle                   experiments for future advanced accelerator concepts planned at the             Brookhaven National Laboratory.",
