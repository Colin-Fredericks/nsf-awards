 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in atmospheric                   chemistry between Dr. Anthony J. Hynes, Georgia Institute of                    Technology and Dr. D.L. Bauch, School of Chemistry, University of               Leeds, England.  The objective of the proposed research is to                   study the kinetics and mechanisms of the atmospheric oxidation of               dimethyl sulfide using flow discharge techniques.  Dimethyl                     sulfide is known to be emitted by marine organisms and has been                 suggested to be a precursor to aerosol and cloud formation in                   marine environments; it is therefore of particular interest for                 the study of global climate.                                                                                                                                    Experiments will utilize a discharge flow apparatus coupled with                laser induced fluorescence and mass spectrometric detection of                  reactive intermediates and reaction products.  Use of calibrated                laser induced fluorescence and simultaneous observation of                      reactant loss and product formation should allow quantitative                   yields of methyl sulfide radical and sulfur dioxide from the                    hydroxyl radical initiated oxidation of dimethyl sulfide to be                  established.  Attempts will be made to establish the feasibility                of mass spectrometric sampling for the detection of stable                      reaction products.  The project will benefit from the expertise of              Dr. Hynes in the development of laser diagnostic techniques in                  molecular beams, atmospheric sampling and atmospheric kinetics.                 The British collaborator Dr. Bauch has many years of experience in              the application of discharge flow technique to the study of oxygen              and hydroxyl radical reactions.  The results of this research                   should contribute to the understanding of the sulphur cycle in                  global atmospheric chemistry.",
