 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of                redesigning courses in mathematics and science by incorporating into the        courses research results from cognitive science, and by focusing on the         development of pedagogical content knowledge.  The three courses                selected, one-semester courses in biology, calculus. and rational number        learning and probability, are all courses in a program for preparing            middle school teachers of mathematics and science.                                                                                                              The project would begin with a preparatory faculty seminar covering             research on topics such as organization, memory constraints, analogical         reasoning, and semantic networks.  Pairs of Faculty would plan each             course in the fall term, and team-teach it in the spring term.                  understanding of content will be evaluated by content specialists and           cognitive psychologists with written examinations, individual                   interviews, and a computer-based semantic network program.  If                  successful, the project will form the basis for planning a new teacher          preparation program for middle school teachers of mathematics and               science.",
