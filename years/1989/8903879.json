 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current models of Hawaiian magma genesis postulate the                          involvement  of at least two or more isotopically and chemically                distinct end member mantle sources, one of which is a primitive                 hot plume and another one is the lithosphere.  The relative roles               of the lithosphere and the plume have been a matter of debate in                these models, which are generally based on the composition of the               erupted lavas.  Fragments of the lithosphere occur in abundance                 as xenoliths in the post-erosional Honolulu lavas of Oahu, which                provide a window into the Hawaiian lithosphere, and a critical                  examination of these rocks may help resolve some of these                       disputes.  The present project is concerned with the second phase               of an ongoing study of upper mantle xenoliths from Oahu, which                  includes a detailed isotopic and trace element investigation into               the mineral phases of several xenoliths selected on the basis of                their mineralogy and petrography (and, in some cases, trace                     elements).  In the first phase of this research, petrographic and               mineral-chemical characterization was carried out on a large                    number of xenoliths from number of vents that cut across the                    koolau shield volcano.  The proposed isotopic and trace element                 investigation, in conjunction with the earlier petrographic-                    mineralogic study, is expected to offer an insight into the                     nature of the lithosphere and the fluids which have crystallized                the hydrous phases.  Comparative studies of the compositional the               hydrous phases.  Comparative studies of the compositional                       variations within and between xenoliths and the erupted Koolau                  (tholeiitic) and Honolulu (alkalic) lavas will help evaluate                    models of Hawaiian magma generation and help evaluate models of                 Hawaiian magmas generation and lithosphere-magma interaction                    processes during hot spot magmatism.    //",
