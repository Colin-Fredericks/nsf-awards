 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals, in general, do not behave in the same way toward all the               members of their species.  Sex, age, and reproductive status are                all examples of well-known factors that might change how members                of the same species interact.  Less well known, and more recently               discovered, is the fact that genetic relationship can also affect               interactions.                                                                                                                                                   In this collaborative research project, Dr. Michael D. Breed, of                the University of Colorado, and Dr. Robert E. Page, Jr., of the                 University of California at Davis, will conduct experiments to                  determine how genetic relationship affects social interactions                  among honey bees.  Drs. Breed and Page will try to identify the                 chemicals used by bees to recognize genetic relationship.  They                 also will investigate exactly how this information is used in                   social interactions.                                                                                                                                            This research is important because the details of how genetic                   relationship affects social interaction are not well understood                 in any species.  Thus, the findings may help to generate new,                   broadly generalizable, understanding of how animals behave.  This               work on honey bees may also help in improving management                        techniques for the economically important apiculture industry.",
