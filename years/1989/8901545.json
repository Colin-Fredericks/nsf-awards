 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns the area of interacting particle                    systems in probability theory, the theory of random walks in                    random environments, and the understanding of branching                         processes.  This project should contribute to understanding the                 general theory of particle systems, the rate of diffusion of                    random walks in random environments, and the limiting density of                branching random walks.                                                              Work on particle systems dates to about 1970 and has been                  motivated by examples of such systems from the biological                       sciences, statistical mechanics, and cybernetics.  Typically,                   large numbers of particles are assumed to interact according to                 some rule; one is interested in the limiting behavior of such                   systems after a long time.  Basic systems such as the contact                   process, voter model, and coalescing and annihilating random                    walks are simple models for the propagation of a species, the                   spread of disease, or the state of a chemical reaction.",
