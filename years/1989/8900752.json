 "awd_abstract_narration": "The six students supported by this REU site grant will                     explore several areas of research on mathematical problems in the               field of topology.  The basic question arises in algebraic                      topology, specifically homotopy theory, a field of pure                         mathematics generally considered beyond the undergraduate                       curriculum.  The question is within the students' capabilities                  because it can be reduced to a computer search for certain kinds                of matrices.                                                                         In algebraic topology, questions about a topological space                 are translated into questions about algebraic objects, usually                  Abelian groups.  These Abelian groups, and homomorphisms between                them, can in turn, be represented by matrices and matrix                        operations.  This allows for computer representation and                        manipulation.                                                                        The undergraduates will design algorithms and implement them               on computers to search for certain kinds of space, called a                     nilpotent complex.  The computer approach is valuable here                      because, though understood in many ways, nilpotent complexes are                hard to picture geometrically.  Using these ideas, computer                     programs have been developed and new nilpotent complexes                        discovered.  However, major existence questions are still                       unanswered.  A specific goal of this project is to answer an                    unsolved question about the existence of finite three-dimensional               nilpotent complexes.                                                                 A secondary, but very important, goal is one of improving                  programs developed during the past year's REU project.  Searching               more complex groups is time consuming.  Efficient, faster methods               must be created to overcome this obstacle.",
