 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Haegel has been selected as a Presidential Young                       Investigator.  She is active in research on optoelectronic                      properties of semiconductor materials, with emphasis on transient               behavior and space charge-related effects in high resistivity                   materials.  In this research program for the National Science                   Foundation she will pursue studies to include the following:  (1)               electrical transport and trasient phenomena in high resistivity                 materials, such as high purity materials at low temperature,                    semi-insulating gallium arsenide, or large bandgap materials, (2)               transition from transport dominated by carrier lifetime to                      transport dominated by dielectric relaxation as a function of                   temperature, (3) effects of extended defects, and point defects                 on optical and electronic properties, (4) development of new                    techniqaues to characterize semiconductor thin films and                        heterostructures.  The ultimate goal of the research is to                      acquire the knowledge and understanding necessary to study both                 optically and electrical induced transient effects in materials                 over a wide range of time scales to elucidate the dynamics of the               interactions between free and trapped carriers and defects in                   semiconductors.                                                                                                                                                      The research is important for materials used in high=speed                 switches, fast detectors, isolating substrates for optoelectronic               circuits, and future communications and computation systems.",
