 "awd_abstract_narration": "While many plant-feeding insect species are quite specific                 in their food choices, selecting only one or two plant species                  for food, many grasshopper species feed on a wide range of                      different plants.  This study will focus on grasshopper                         Dactylotum variegatum  which inhabits the grasslands of the                     southwestern United States; this habitat contains a diverse array               of food plants.  Through detailed observations of individual                    insects in field, the PI's will determine whether each individual               insect feeds on a number of different plant species or whether                  individuals tend to restrict their feeding to only one or two of                the many foods utilized by the species.  Associated with these                  field observations will be controlled experiments in which we                   will determine whether an insect's growth and development is                    enhanced by feeding on a mix of plants species rather than                      feeding on only a single plant.  Finally, the PI's investigate                  what role learning, which has been previously demonstrated in                   grasshoppers, plays in determining the food choices of individual               insects.                                                                             This study will be one of the few detailed analyses of food                selection by plant-feeding insects in the field and will                        contribute fundamental research information on the behaviors                    involved in the selection of food.  A better understanding of why               some insect species feed on many plants, while other species are                very restricted in the plants they will feed on a likely result                 of the project.",
