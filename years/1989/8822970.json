 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions of                         molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.                                                                                                                                              The Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa will use                  this award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program to                 help acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer.  The areas of                       research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the                   following:                                                                                                                                                      1) Organofluorine chemistry                                                     2) Novel natural products from fungi                                            3) Synthesis, spectroscopy and novel reactivity of                                 metalloporphyrin compounds                                                   4) Synthesis and chemistry of reactive organometallic complexes                 5) Polymer synthesis and transition metal catalyzed organic                        reactions                                                                    6) Synthetic organic and natural products chemistry.",
