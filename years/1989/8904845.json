 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of two parts.  The first part is                     concerned with linear and nonlinear mathematical problems in                    solid mechanics.  Specifically, we shall study foundations                      problems in the elastostatic theory of thin and slender bodies,                 optimal control problems involving viscoelastic bodies, and                     stress concentration problems in finite strain and materially                   nonlinear thin elastic bodies and shells.                                                                                                                            The second part deals with the development of new                          perturbation techniques for weakly nonlinear wave propagation                   problems.  Specifically we shall study problems for which the                   linearized hyperbolic equations do not split up into individual                 unidirectional modes, and cases where the linearized problem is                 unstable even though the nonlinear problem has stable                           solutions.  We shall also extend multiple scale perturbation                    techniques to problems with more than two dependent variables                   (as in nonisentropic flow) and  to higher space dimensions as                   in two-dimensional shallow water flow and acoustics.",
