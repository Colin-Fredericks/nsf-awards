 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small  quantities of the volatile molecules H2O and CO2 are                     found                                                                           magmas and rocks from the Earth's upper mantle.  These volatiles                can have important effects on such problems as the origin of                    magmas, the melting temperature of the mantle as a function of                  depth, the existence of melts along geotherms in the primitive                  mantle, and the chemical differentiation of the mantle.                         Experimental research completed in the past 30 years has focused                on answering these questions at pressures up to 35 kbar, reaching               only into the uppermost mantle.  The upper pressure was largely                 determined by apparatus limitations. In the last three years, a                 burst of activity focusing on the 70-250 kbar pressure range has                occurred due to the advent of the multiple anvil high pressure                  device.                                                                         Fragments of upper mantle rocks found in kimberlite breccias                    record fossil geotherms (temperature profiles) with an inflection               (change) in their pressure-temperature trajectories at  pressure                of about 50 kbar.  The deepest samples record pressures of 60                   kbar.  Diamonds found in these garnet peridotite fragments and in               the kimberlites suggest somewhat higher pressures.  The                         inflection in the geotherm suggests that major processes occur in               this pressure range.                                                            The proposed problems that will investigate the interaction of                  volatiles with minerals and magmas at a 50-70 kbar pressure range               are:                                                                            *Which H2O reservoir minerals are stable, and do they have a                    required constituent such as potassium?                                         *What is the effect of CO2 on magma compositions?                               *What is the effect of pressure on the ferric/ferrous iron ratio                in magmas?                                                                      *What is the relationship between H2O-CO2-oxygen and primary                    magma composition?                                                              A newly developed apparatus, an active girdle piston-cylinder                   with a routine operating range to 70 kbar, will be used to                      explore these questions.",
