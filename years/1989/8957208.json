The specific focus is on the                         development of non-intrusive optical methods to study particle                                                                                                  transport, heat transfer, and mass transport through boundary                   layers in two-phase flows.  A burning droplet is typically 0.2                                                                                                  mm in diameter surrounded by a 2 mm envelope flame.  One of                     the most powerful optical probes is based upon the coherent                     anti-Stokes scattering of laser light by gas molecules within                   a cylindrical volume about 0.1 mm in diameter by 2 mm long; so                                                                                                  that to apply this method to droplet flames the probe volume                    must be reduced an order-of-magnitude.  Methods to accomplish                   this increase in spatial resolution will be explored.                                                                                                           Optical diagnostics are ideally suited to boundary layer                        measurements because typical boundary layers are sensitive to                   perturbations caused by physical probes.  Application of                        optical diagnostics is difficult, however, because the                          physical dimensions of the boundary layer require extremely                     high spatial resolution.  The research will be centered on                      this problem, with applications to heat transfer to solid                       surfaces in combustion engines, rapid solidification in molten                                                                                                  metal sprays, particle attrition and deposition on surfaces,                    and boundary layer heat transfer in supersonic flows.",
