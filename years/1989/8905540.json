 "awd_abstract_narration": "The two senior investigators will study the relationship                   between Lp bounds on curvature and the geometry and topology of a               Riemannian manifold.  They will work towards a proof that a new                 topological invariant, if zero, implies an F-structure in the                   sense of Cheeger-Gromov.  The relationship between the                          isoperimetric constant and the curvature of a manifold will be                  investigated.  The investigators will generalize the Heintze-                   Karcher estimate on the volume of a geodesic neighborhood.  A                   lower bound on the shortest closed geodesic would be very useful.               A computer will be used to compute some nontrivial examples of                  convergent Riemannian manifolds.                                                     The standard sphere has positive Gaussian curvature                        everywhere.  Even when deformed, the average curvature remains                  positive.  Such is not the case for the two-holed torus.                        Regardless of how one of these is deformed, the average curvature               must be negative.  In higher dimensions the picture is much more                complicated.  Other sorts of curvature, such as Ricci curvature,                play the central roles.  A central problem in differential                      geometry, which the two investigators will address, is how the                  averages of these curvatures relates to topological properties                  such as numbers of holes.",
