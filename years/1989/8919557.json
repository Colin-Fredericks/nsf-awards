 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed SUPER - SUbartic Pacific Ecosystem Research is a                  renewal of the 1984-86 SUPER Program.  The initial and proposed                 project have focused on understanding the food web                              relationships and other upper ocean processes leading to the                    population dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton in the                     Subarctic Pacific.  The population dynamics in this region                      contrast greatly with the wide seasonal fluctuations (blooms,                   etc.) characteristic of the North Atlantic.  While the North                    Atlantic has been considered by many to be the model of how                     high latitude oceans work, increasing evidence suggests the                     North Pacific may be more of a norm.                                                                                                                            Initially, work in the Subarctic Pacific centered on the larger                 size fractions of both phytoplankton and zooplankton and on the                 notion that phytoplankton growth was continuously balanced by                   zooplankton feeding (the Major Grazer Hypothesis).  Unusual                     characteristics of the surface water mass allowed the                           maintenance of higher zooplankton abundance in the euphotic                     zone, thus allowing zooplankton to closely tract any                            phytoplankton increases.  The lag seen.                                                                                                                         The results of the initial SUPER Program, indicate that                         zooplankton numbers/feeding capabilities are 10X too low to                     account for the balance of populations, and the copepods must                   have a direct feeding connection to microzooplankton                            (heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates).  The Major Grazer                     Hypothesis is not an accurate paradigm of the ecosystem                         dynamics; and alternative Limited Mixing/Micrograzer Hypothesis                 has been forwarded and tests of this new hypothesis are                         proposed.  This will involve comparisons of phytoplankton (all                  sizes) production rates with zooplankton (all sizes) grazing                    rates, and a quantitative assessment of nitrogen dynamics as a                  basis for estimates of phytoplankton production capabilities.                                                                                                   Over 30 scientists have contributed reviews of the proposed                     program withoverwhelming support for the investigation.  All of                 the SUPER investigators are leaders in their respective                         subdisciplines; all are productive and experienced in large                     program cooperation/collaboration.  Dr. Welschmeyer's component                 is considered an essential facet of the multi-disciplinary,                     multi-institution effort.  The Biological Oceanography Program                  strongly recommends support of the entire integrated program.                   An award to Dr. Welschmeyer for research on phytoplankton                       rates, zooplankton feeding rates, and sediment trapping studies                 is recommended at the following levels:  FY 87, $197,201; FY                    88, $141,573; FY 89 $81,333.",
