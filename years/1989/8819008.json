 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biopolymers serve as physical barriers of plants and protect                    them from adverse environmental factors including pathogens.                    Two biopolymers, cutin and suberin, are being investigated by                   chemical and 13C- NMR methods during plant development.  The                    biosynthesis of these natural products is being studied using                   enzymology and recombinant DNA approaches.  The regulation of                   the enzyme cutinase is being studied at the gene level by                       fungal transformation and deletion analysis.  The enzymes                       that degrade pectin will also be similarly studied and their                    role in fungal pathogenesis will be studied by gene                             disruption.                                                                                                                                                     This project provides basic information on the biochemistry                     and function of the defensive barriers of plants.  This                         information is needed to devise ways to improve plant                           protection and production.***//",
