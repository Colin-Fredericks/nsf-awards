 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with experimental and theoretical studies            of thermal plasmas, in particular with the impact of anode evaporation          to the anode region of a high intensity nitrogen arc.  An improved              emission spectroscopic technique will be utilized to measure the                temperature and the vapor density distribution of the anode material            (copper).  In a two-step process the unresolved (0,0) emission band of          molecules at 3914.4  A and the spectral line of CuI at 5218.2  A are            chosen for the measurements.  The plasma properties will be also                determined by the relative line intensity method of CuI using 5105.5,           5153.2, 5218.2, 5700.2, and 5782.1  A spectral lines.  Holographic              interferometry will be used for flow visualization and for temperature          measurements in the lower temperature regions (in the absence of                turbulence and in the presence of an axisymmetrical plasma).  An                already existing computer program for the modeling of a mixture of              argon and copper thermal plasma will be modified for a nitrogen-copper          free burning arc.  The thermodynamic and transport properties of the            nitrogen-copper plasma required for the modeling will be calculated by          a program written for a general multicomponent two-temperature plasma.          In the intended study the plasma is assumed to be optically thin and            in the state of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium.                                                                                                                Thermal plasmas can be applied for melting, cutting, welding and                refining materials, and they play an important role in high power               interrupters, arc lamps, reduction metallurgy and plasma                        spraying.  A change in the anode geometry due to evaporation can                have a deleterious affect on the desired heat and mass transfer                 and can damage switching devices.  By applying advanced optical                 methods to determine the temperature and flow characteristics of                the plasma in the vicinity of the electrodes, the evaporation                   process can be better understood.",
