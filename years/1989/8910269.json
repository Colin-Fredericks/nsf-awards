 "awd_abstract_narration": "Melatonin has long been known to be produced by the pineal gland                and to influence daily cycles in vertebrates.  Melatonin is also                produced in the vertebrate retina where it controls functions                   such as allowing old fragments of light sensitive membrane to be                discarded.  Melatonin is synthesized from serotonin by rods and                 cones during the dark, and because it is lipid soluble, it                      quickly diffuses through the retina.  In light, the enzyme                      converting serotonin to melatonin disappears and serotonin                      accumulates.  It is unknown if all photoreceptors can actively                  accumulate serotonin and manufacture melatonin or if only green                 sensitive rods perform these functions.  Also unknown is the path               information must take from the reception of light by the                        photoreceptor to melatonin synthesis and from there to                          photomembrane disposal.  Possible paths are:  (i) a single                      transducer such as the green sensitive rods, suppressing all                    photoreceptors; (ii) each photoreceptor receiving the signal for                itself; and (iii) every photoreceptor broadcasting an inhibitory                message to all other rods and cones.  Radioactive serotonin and                 electron microscopic autoradiography will be used to determine if               all classes of photoreceptors in the frog retina can accumulate                 serotonin and which colors of light are capable of inhibiting                   melatonin syntheses.  The relation of melatonin synthesis to the                periodic disposal of photoreceptor membrane will be investigated.",
