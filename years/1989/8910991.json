 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program is supporting the                       research of Dr. Randolph P. Thummel of the Department of                        Chemistry at the University of Houston.  Dr. Thummel is                         developing syntheses of molecules that will bind two or more                    metal ions which will be then positioned so that they can                       interact with one another. This interaction may lead to                         interesting new properties which can be used in the complex                     materials required by agriculture, medicine and industry.                                                                                                       The research outlines the design and synthesis of three related                 types of chelating systems each of which is capable of binding                  more than one metal center.  Sub-units such as 2,2'-bipyridine,                 8-hydroxyquinoline, and \u01313,2-g!pyridoindole are separated by                    spacer groups such tetracyclo-undecane (TCU),                                   1,8-diazaanthracene, ferrocene, and others which orient the                     binding centers in parallel, planar, or helical arrangements.                   These systems will be prepared by application of the                            Friedlander condensation and the Fisher Indole synthesis with                   appropriate oriented carbonyl systems.  Complexes will be                       prepared with these ligands using metals such as Ru(II),                        Pd(II), Pt(II), and Eu(III).                                                                                                                                    The impact of ligand structure on the geometry of the resulting                 metal complexes will be evaluated using high field NMR and                      X-ray analysis.  Electrochemical and photochemical properties                   will be examined to help better understand interactions between                 the ligand and metal centers.  The possible existence of charge                 transfer relays, mixed valence species, and host-guest                          typeinteractions will be explored.  It is anticipated that                      ligands capable of orienting two or more metals will behave as                  organic templates which mediate and encourage unusual inorganic                 chemistry.",
