 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much recent work has focused on the dynamic nature of the                  abiotic environment, and on the ways plants respond to these                    changing conditions.  In particular, emphasis has been placed on                the importance of variation in light availability for two                       fundamental aspects of plant performance: growth and defense.                   However, our understanding of light effects on photosynthesis and               synthesis of defensive secondary metabolites comes primarily from               temperate high light environments and agricultural systems.  In                 humid tropical forests, light availability at the forest floor is               extremely low (<1% full sunlight), with periods of higher light                 lasting from seconds to hours, depending on the size of the                     opening in the canopy above.  Tree saplings and understory plants               must therefore be capable of persisting at extremely low light                  levels, yet be able to take advantage of short periods of intense               and perhaps damaging light.  Little is known about how these                    shade-tolerant species adjust to long-and short-term variation in               light availability, despite the fact the majority of the world's                species exists under these conditions.                                               The investigators will collect comparative data on                         photosynthetic physiology, secondary metabolites, and leaf                      anatomy for a range of shade-tolerant tropical woody species.                   This will enable them to assess the physiological mechanisms                    underlying adjustments to long-and short-term variation in light                availability, and to track how resources are differentially                     allocated to growth vs defense.",
