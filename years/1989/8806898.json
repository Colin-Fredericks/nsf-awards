 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid development and intensification of winter                         cyclones in coastal regions presents a major weather                            forecasting problem.  Along the East Coast of the United                        States, the development of cyclonic storms and frontal                          systems often occurs along the coastal region of the                            Carolinas.  These weather systems may lead to severe weather                    in the heavily populated Northeast Corridor in the form of                      freezing rain, heavy snowfall, blizzards and extensive                          coastal erosion.  A complex interaction of cold continental                     air, warm ocean currents, traveling atmospheric disturbances                    and local geography all appear to contribute to the rapid                       development of these systems; however, the processes are                        not well understood and the phenomena are often poorly                          forecast.                                                                           In January-March 1986 a cooperative research project to                     study winter storms in this region was held by an consortium                    of universities and Federal agencies.  Entitled GALE                            (Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment), the project was                          designed to provide detailed information on the role of air-                    sea interaction, planetary boundary-layer processes and                         mesoscale meteorological processes.  As one of the core                         investigators of the GALE, the Principal Investigator was                       instrumental in designing and executing the experiment.                             The Principal Investigator's research focussed on the                       upper troposphere.  The primary data sources were aircraft                      surveys using the National Center for Atmospheric Research                      Sabreliner research aircraft, the specialized GALE upper-air                    sounding network, and satellite data.  Using GALE data, the                     Principal Investigator proposes to continue his research on                     the role of the jet stream and tropopause structure in the                      rapid development of winter cyclones and on comparison of                       remote sensing techniques of the tropopause with in situ                        verification.  Additionally, contingent on successful tests                     of new temperature and humidity instruments, the Principal                      Investigator may enhance the GALE data by participating in                      the Office of Naval Research Sponsored Experiment on Rapidly                    Intensifying Cyclones over the Atlantic (ERICA) to be                           conducted during the Winter of 1988-89.",
