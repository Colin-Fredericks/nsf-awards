 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now evident that natural populations harbor far more                 genetic variation than was expected prior to initiation of                      electrophoretic studies 20 years ago.  Theoretical work has                     clarified what processes may potentially be responsible for the                 maintenance of such vast stores of genetic variation, but there                 has been insufficient experimental work to demonstrate the actual               mechanisms in more than a few unusual cases.  The proposed                      studies will investigate the importance of a particular mechanism               for maintaining genetic variation: the process of locally varying               selection in conjunction with genetically based variation in                    environmental response.  In particular, the magnitude and nature                of genetic variation of individual plants in response to the                    density and composition of neighboring plants will be documented.               These studies will permit prediction of the response to selection               under differing biotic environments.  Such predictions will be                  compared with observed responses in selection experiments.                           Because natural variation in the biotic environment is                     ubiquitous in wild populations, the findings of these studies may               have bearing on the general importance of locally varying                       selection.  The focal species for this work include one native                  and one introduced species.  This system may therefore serve as a               model for elucidating the evolution of interactions between                     species following invasions of exotics into wild communities and                may provide insights into methods for enhancing the success of                  native communities following such introductions.",
