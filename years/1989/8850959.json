In each of three summerrs,a                     different group of thirty high school teachers from                             California and contiguous states will participate in a two-                     week program structured on the chemistry and biology of toxic                   substances, proper management of hazardous materials, and                       related concerns of human health.  Content lectures and                         varied discussion sessions will be complemented by individual                   and group laboratory exercises as well as planned field trips                   to a dump site, a sewage treatment plant, a hazartdous waste                    facility (Lawrence Livermore), and research laboratories                        analyzing and investigating management methods of toxic                         substances.  Participants will be expected to incorporate the                   concepts of and activties into their classroom curriculum                       with special emphasis on the process approach emphasized in                     the program.  Follow-up sessions during the school year will                    not only facilitate an exchange of information and                              experiences among the teachers, but will also provide an                        opportunity for the project staff to evaluate the                               effectivenesss of the program in introducing the timely                         subject of toxic substances and human health into high school                   science courses.",
