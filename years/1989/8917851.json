 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jackson State University (JSU) is one of the few historically minority          institutions in the Nation that presently has Environmental and Marine          Sciences programs.  JSU is committed to the development of these                programs as part of the overall long-term plan of the University,               which is to provide the Nation with highly trained minority men and             women in every sphere of education but particularly in the natural              sciences.  The JSU Marine and Environmental Sciences programs have              made significant contributions in preparing minorities for the ocean            sciences workforce and graduate programs.  This project will enable             these programs to continue their mission.  The main objective of this           project is to prepare and motivate minority undergraduates to pursue            advanced degrees and/or professional careers in the ocean sciences.             The project will involve the following:  (1) provide early research             experience with dedicated mentors and role models to high ability               undergraduate students during the academic year at JSU, (2) provide             academic enrichment activities in order to enhance the interest of the          students in the ocean sciences, (3) provide opportunities to minority           students to participate in off-campus research during the summer                months, (4) produce graduates in chemistry, marine and environmental            sciences who will be qualified to pursue postgraduate studies in these          fields.                                                                                                                                                         In addition to the regular curricula, and specific courses in the               ocean sciences, students will be required to take courses in                    Independent Study and Introduction to Research, which will parallel             their career objectives.  These courses will consist of supervised              research projects and will include formalized training in technical             writing and literature survey as well as laboratory experimentation.            Students will be required to submit a report at the conclusion of               their projects.  All students will make at least one oral presentation          of their research at one of the seminars which will be held during              their tenure in the program.  Students will travel to at least one              conference or meeting related to their research experiences and will            be encouraged to read papers where possible and appropriate.                    Participating faculty will be expected to accompany students to                 conferences and professional meetings.",
