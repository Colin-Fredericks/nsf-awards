 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes proposed collaborative research project                 between UCLA and the U.S. Army Electronics Technology and Devices               Laboratory (ETDL) through the support of the NSF-Fort Monmouth                  Interaction Program.  The objective of this project is to investigate           the ultrafast carrier dynamics of the intersubband transitions in the           doped GaAs/A1GaAs quantum-well and superlattice structures.  Of                 particular interest are structures which have resonant intersubband             transitions corresponding to optical wavelengths in the 8 to 14 um              atmospheric window spectral range.  The quantum well will be grown at           ETDL in collaboration with Dr. Mitro Dutta.  Basic preparation and              characterization of the samples will also be carried out at ETDL by a           participating graduate student from UCLA.  The dynamic processes                involved in the intersubband transitions will be investigated at UCLA           with tunable picosecond time-resolved infrared spectroscopy.  The               carrier dynamics as a function of material and structural parameters            will also be studied.  The results from this research will lead to              better understanding of the ultrafast carrier dynamics in the                   intersubband transitions and will enable us to determine the dominant           processes involved.  This knowledge is of crucial importance for the            future development of the infrared devices based on the intersubband            transition process in the quantum wells and superlattices.",
