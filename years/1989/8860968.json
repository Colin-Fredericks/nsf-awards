 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of a thin film vacuum deposition process suitable               for the fabrication of superconducting microwave circuit elements               based on high Tc yttrium-barium-copper-oxide is proposed.  The                  dual ion beam fabrication method will facilitate low temperature                deposition of dense epitaxial films of uniform stoichiometry on                 semiconducting or insulating substrates.  As such, this                         technology will alleviate many of the complications implicit in                 present high Tc deposition techniques such as high process                      temperatures and limited applicability of compatible substrate                  materials.  Since most high performance devices will require the                achievement of high critical current densities in deposited                     films, a method is proposed by which continuity, epitaxy, and                   stoichiometry are encouraged in the growth of the superconducting               film.  Ion and neutral beam assisted deposition will be used to                 promote low temperature epitaxial growth achieving dense films                  with the desired (001) texture and appropriate cation and oxygen                stoichiometry.  The deposition scheme will avoid high temperature               annealing so that high critical current density films can be                    grown directly onto a variety of important substrates without                   harmful interdiffusion effects.  Device structures and                          superconducting properties appropriate for Josephson junction                   devices, microstrips, and chirp filters will be sought.",
