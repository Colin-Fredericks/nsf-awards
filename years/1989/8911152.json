 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Robert Cummins of the University of Arizona and Dr. David                   Kirsh of the University of California, San Diego,  are analyzing                and comparing two radically different approaches to the study of                cognition and intelligence, the orthodox \"computational\"                        approach, on the one hand, and the \"new connectionist\" or                       parallel distributed processing approach on the other.  The                     orthodox computational approach takes mental processes to be                    analogous to the processes in a programmed digital computer.  The               connectionist approach understands mental processes as changes in               patterns of activation in a network of simple neuron-like                       elements.  Drs. Cummins and Kirsh are undertaking a systematic                  analysis and comparison of these paradigms in a scientifically                  and philosophically informed way.                                                                                                                               The goals of this project are 1) to compare the research methods                and explanatory goals of the connectionist and computational                    approach to cognitive science; 2) to articulate the underlying                  conception of cognition, intelligence and mentality that drives                 exponents of each approach; and 3) to assess the possible impact                on cognitive science of the major shift of resources into                       connectionist research that is currently taking place.                                                                                                          The investigators will carry out site visits to major centers of                connectionist and orthodox computational research.  They are                    targeting two specific research areas for investigation on these                visits:  speech perception ( a strength of connectionism) and                   problem solving (a strength of the orthodox approach).",
