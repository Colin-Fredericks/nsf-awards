 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field associated with organic charge transfer salts has                     virtually exploded within the past several years.  From a single                material which was superconducting at - 1K under pressure, there                are now several families of compounds with Tc's up to 12K at                    ambient pressure.  In addition, these are beautiful model systems               for studying a wealth of new physical phenomena which result from               a combination of reduced dimensionality, relatively small                       bandwidths and strong electron-electron interactions.  They have                been most active in the past grant period in the investigations                 of the remarkable properties of these materials in high magnetic                fields.  The (TMTSF)2X compounds show a unique cascade of                       magnetic field induced spin density wave transitions involving                  aspects of the integer and fractional Quantum Hall Effect,                      commensurability of the SDW wavelength with the magnetic length                 and the underlying lattice, Landau bands and subbands, and new                  types of quantum oscillations.  Although there has been rapid                   theoretical development in this area, some of the more recent                   experiments and new theories suggest that there are still more                  interesting phenomena to be observed.                                                                                                                           They therefore propose a further study of the magnetic field                    effects using different compounds and additional probes.  They                  also plan a series of experiments on the new organic                            superconductors to elucidate the nature of the superconductivity,               and the roles played by correlations, dimensionality and                        disorder.  A vital part of this work is the synthesis of high                   quality single crystals.  Our past research was only made                       possible by the synthetic effort at Exxon under the direction of                Dr. L.Y. Chaing.  This effort will continue and be expanded to                  develop and characterize new materials as well as prepare                       established ones.",
