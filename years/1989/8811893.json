 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major data synthesis effort will bring to a close an                     eight-year study of the effects of a major volcanic eruption on                 the structure and function of several ecosystems on Mt. St.                     Helens in the state of Washington.  Ecological studies have been                conducted on the rates and patterns of recovery of three                        ecosystem types on Mt. St. Helens; coniferous forests, and sub-                 alpine and alpine meadows.                                                           During the past eight years the ecological research has been               focussed in four areas: soil processes and development, plant                   physiology, plant population dynamics, and insect population                    dynamics.  Data derived from these studies will be used to                      develop a set of sub-models that will be linked together in a                   \"master\" model of landscape dynamics in these \"recovering\"                      ecosystems.  The models will be structured such that they can be                applied at a variety scales in space and time.  In addition, the                models will be linked to a geographic information system (GIS) so               that they will be geographically specific.                                           The development of geographically-referenced process models                will be an important advance in ecological research because it                  will permit field-based validation of these models.  Beyond                     contribution to advances in ecological modeling, this research                  will help us to understand how biological systems respond to and                recover from major catastrophic disturbances such as volcanic                   eruptions.                                                                           Such understanding should help us to devise management                     strategies for reconstructing natural ecosystems following                      various kinds of destructive events associated with human                       activities.                                                                          Dr. Bliss and his colleagues have good records of                          productivity.  The institutional support available to them is                   superior.",
