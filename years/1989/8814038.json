 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funds for the purchase of electronic                        equipment for precise analysis of sounds.  The equipment will                   first be used by Dr. Trainer to answer questions about                          characteristics of bird song that may be important in the                       female's choice of a mate.                                                                                                                                      According to one model of the evolution of female mating                        preferences, females who choose older males have longer-lived                   offspring, and this causes preferences for traits that indicate a               male's age to increase in frequency.  This mechanism is likely to               be important in long-tailed manakins, because males of this                     species do not reproduce until they are at least nine years old,                and only a few of the mature males attract most of the females.                                                                                                 Male manakins attract females through a unique and puzzling                     cooperative display:  two reproductively mature males sing and                  dance together, yet only one male mates.  Dr. Trainer's previous                research showed that pairs of males that have well-coordinated                  songs receive more visits by females than those with                            uncoordinated songs.  Dr. Trainer now will examine the                          relationship between age and song coordination in this unusual                  display.  She will perform a precise acoustic analysis of the                   songs of males of known relative age, in order to answer three                  questions:  (1)  Do females prefer well-coordinated songs?  (2)                 Are older males more able to coordinate with the partner and to                 sing in a consistent manner?  (3)  Does song coordination improve               through learning as a male adjusts his song to match his                        partner's?                                                                                                                                                      This study will increase our understanding of the role of                       individual development in sexual selection of male                              characteristics and the evolution of female mating preferences.",
