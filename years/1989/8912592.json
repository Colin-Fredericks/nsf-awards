 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two workshops on statistical methodology in quality and                    product improvement are to be conducted.  The first workshop will               focus on the identification and exploration of a broad range of                 research problems involving statistical science and its use in                  addressing problems in process quality and productivity.  Typical               problems range from the development of process diagnostics to                   detect processes out of control or deterioration of machines or                 tools used in these processes to new experimental design                        techniques to improve the quality of processes having a large                   number of control variables to techniques related to the                        development of large scale software products and project                        management.  The workshop will look at specific problems                        involving response surface methodology in very high dimensions                  with vector outcome variables and will address the issues arising               in combining observational data analysis with designed                          experiments to learn the shape of the response surface and                      optimize the production process.  Statistical graphics techniques               as well as computer science methods of artificial intelligence                  (e.g., neural networks ) will be explored.",
