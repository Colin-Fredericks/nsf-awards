 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three-year renewal of a U.S.-Yugoslav                     cooperative research project in mechanical engineering between                  Bozidar Vujanovic of the University of Novi Sad and Stanley Jones               from the University of Alabama, is to study the variational methods             (direct solution, conservation laws and Noether's theorem) applied to           non conservative engineering systems.  This grant affords the                   opportunity of linking oen of the major European research groups with           U.s. engineer.  Previous collaboration has resulted in significant              number of joint publications.                                                                                                                                   This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The grants are            composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal               Yugoslav institute.  Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to               Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists'               living expenses in the U.S.",
