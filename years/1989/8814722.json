 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide a new generation of VUV spectral                 data necessary for rigorous testing of theoretical models for                   photoionization, photodissociation, and other processes involving               bound-continuum electronic interactions.  Precise variations of                 intensity with wavelength over wide ranges of energy are                        essential to further progress in this area because all                          electronic structure and photoinduced-process information must be               deduced from deconvolution of the experimental data using theory                based models.  Precise spectral photometric intensities (1% or                  better) and absolute photoabsorption cross sections (0.5-2.5%                   range) will be determined with high spectral resolving powers                   (R.P > 100,000) using facilities at the University of Maryland                  (UM) and at the SURF II electron storage ring.                                       Absolute photoabsorption cross sections measured to high                   accuracy are rare because they are difficult to measure.  They                  are however of great practical significance in many applications.               We thus recommend support for this work.",
