Linear programming is the most basic                   constrained optimization problem and has wide-ranging                           applications in the physical and engineering sciences.                          Variants of Karmarkar's projective algorithm have very                          attractive theoretical and computational properties.  Part of                   the effort will be devoted to understanding and improving Ye's                  potential function method.  Convex quadratic programming is                     also a fundamental problem, both in its own right and as a                      subroutine in nonlinearly-constrained optimization.  Efforts                    will be made to develop new potential function methods for its                  solution.  New probabilistic models for linear programming will                 also be investigated both to understand more fully the                          structure of such problems and to evaluate experimentally and                   analytically the expected behavior of particular algorithms.",
