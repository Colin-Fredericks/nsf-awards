 "awd_abstract_narration": "Normal visual acuity, that is, the minimum separation                           required to resolve two features (about 1 min of arc), is fairly                well understood. Another class of tasks involves spatial                        localization of features, the so-called hyperacuities, with                     thresholds of 1 to 10 seconds of arc. Several models have                       recently shown how the visual system can achieve this astonishing               performance. The demonstration that visual acuity and hyperacuity               are relatively unaffected by retinal image motion at velocities                 ranging up to 3 deg/sec causes problems for many of these models.                                                                                               The importance of achieving good acuity in the presence of                      image motion should not be underestimated. The task of                          compensating for retinal motion is likely to be one of the main                 problems to be solved by the mechanisms of early vision. The eyes               are constantly moving, so in order to preserve image quality                    there must have been strong evolutionary pressures to solve this                problem.                                                                                                                                                        Dr. Stanley Klein is a leading investigator in the area of                      spatial vision. Dr. Klein's research has two goals. The first is                to understand how high levels of acuity are maintained during                   image motion. The second goal is to use image motion to isolate                 distinct localization cues for a variety of hyperacuity tasks.                  The experiments will test predictions from several models of                    acuity and hyperacuity. The results of the proposed experiments                 will also provide additional constraints on a model of human                    spatial localization for stationary stimuli being developed by                  Dr. Klein.",
