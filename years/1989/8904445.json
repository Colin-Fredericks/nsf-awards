 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miocene crustal extension in Arizona was accompanied by                    uplift and uproofing of metamorphic core complexes and crustal                  thinning, creating the presently observed variation in crustal                  thickness from about 25 km in the Basin and Range to about 45 km                beneath the Colorado Plateau.  The effect of thinning on the                    lower crust is poorly understood.                                                    Researchers at two universities will study four basalt-                    rhyolite volcanic fields that define a transect spanning the                    Basin and Range - Colorado Plateau province boundary.  We will                  use trace element and isotopic compositions of these lavas to                   constrain their source compositions.  Inferred source                           compositions will be compared with data collected from crustal                  xenoliths from nearby localities.  Preliminary work demonstrates                that the rhyolites contain a large crustal component and that the               lavas change composition systematically along the transect.  Our                major goals are to test hypotheses of the origins of the rhyolite               and to relate our crustal source constraints to recent and                      ancient tectonic and crust formation events.  Additionally, we                  will investigate the relationship between the high-silica and                   low-silica rhyolites that occur in each field and study the time-               space relations of alkali-olivine and tholeiitic basalt                         volcanism.",
