 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support for Dr. Robert A. Schowengerdt          of the University of Arizona to spend six months doing collaborative            research with Drs. Donald Fraser and John Richards of the University            of New South Wales in Campbell, Australia.  They will work on two               research topics which are important to the application of image                 processing to remote sensing:  (1) Fourier and spatial domain image             resampling, and (2) Expert system architectures for image enhancement           and analysis.                                                                                                                                                   Dr. Fraser's background is in mathematical and algorithmic techniques           in signal and image processing.  Dr. Richard's interests are in the             physics of remote sensing, in particular the use of radar, and in               multisource data analysis in remote sensing.  Dr. Schowengerdt's                research has been on sensor aspects and pragmatic image processing              tools for remote sensing application.  This complementarity of                  expertise, together with the parallel development of a network of               image processing workstations based on the Macintosh II computer at             both the University of Arizona and the University of New South Wales,           should insure a productive collaboration.",
