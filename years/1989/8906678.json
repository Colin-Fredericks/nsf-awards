 "awd_abstract_narration": "A software system called RRL, the Rewrite Rule Laboratory, developed            over the past four years with partial support from previous NSF grants,         is both a theorem prover and an environment for experimenting with and          developing new automated reasoning procedures based on rewrite methods.         RRL includes implementations of a collection of rule-completion and             rewriting algorithms that can be applied to proving predicate calculus          and structural induction theorems.  RRL has been successfully used for          solving problems often considered a challenge for mechanized theorem            provers, including significant applications in verification and                 specification of hardware and software.                                                                                                                         Further development of RRL and research in the associated theory are            proposed. The focus will be to develop and extend RRL to be more useful         and convenient for reasoning about software and hardware specifications         and implementations.  Towards this goal, RRL will be enhanced to                provide powerful methods for automatically proving properties by                induction.  Theoretical research will be undertaken to combine two              different approaches for automating proofs by induction, the proof by           consistency approach and the explicit induction approach developed              under the last NSF grant.  Further investigations will also be                  conducted on methods for analyzing structural properties of                     specifications such as the consistency and definitional completeness            properties and for reasoning about incomplete specifications.                                                                                                   Theoretical and experimental research in developing heuristics,                 including identifying unnecessary computations, will be undertaken to           improve the performance of completion procedures and of first-order             theorem proving methods.  Complexity studies and efficient                      implementations of primitive operations will also be continued and              results will be incorporated into RRL.",
