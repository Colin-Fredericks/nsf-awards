 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethics and Values Studies supports research and educational                     projects on ethical and value aspects of the interaction between                science, technology and society.  Projects examine the social                   values and mutual obligations and responsibilities that arise in                these interactions.  This project will provide information about                what computer science students are learning in courses designed                 to develop their understanding of professional ethics. It is                    widely agreed that computer science students, like students in                  other professional education programs, need to learn professional               ethics.  A recent survey of members of the ACM Spcial Interest                  Group on Computers and Society listed ethical issues and related                curricular development as their top priority.  However, there has               been little empirical assessment of the effectiveness of attempts               to incorporate ethics into the computer science curriculum.  This               research activity consists of an empirical assessment of the                    changes (if any) in ethical reasoning about computers and society               resulting from courses designed to introduce students to these                  issues.  Two components of ethical reasoning have been                          distinguished.  For the first, ethical sensitivity, a measurement               instrument has been developed, since none has been available in                 this specific area.  The second component, ethical reasoning,                   will be measured by the Rest Defining Issues Test.  The measured                change in ethical sensitivity is predicted to be greater than any               change in ethical reasoning.  This is because students' basic                   moral values and reasoning processes are believed to be less                    amenable to change than their ability to recognize social                       contexts requiring ethical judgment on their part.  Products of                 the research will include dissemination of a new insrument to                   measure the ethical sensitivity of computer professionals,                      empirical knowledge of the effects of courses designed to teach                 professional ethics, and recommendations for improving computer                 science education in this area.                                                                                                                                 This study comes from two well-qualified researchers.  Research                 and dissemination plans are appropriate; institutional support is               good.  The project has important implications for the development               of instruments for measuring effectiveness in applied ethics                    courses; thereby it provides assistance in future curriculum                    development.  Support is recommended.",
