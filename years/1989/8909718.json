 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will support purchase of a            Cascade microwave probe station.  This prober is designed for use in            conjunction with a microwave network analyzer and provides a precise,           convenient microwave connection between the analyzer ports and the              surface of a semiconductor substrate.  This equipment will be used for          the microwave measurement and characterization of novel microwave,              millimeter wave and optoelectronic semiconductor devices and circuits.          The prober would fill a gap in what are otherwise well-equipped                 laboratory facilities.  The department has several HP 8510 systems              available for research and instruction.  It has also developed                  semiconductor processing facilities for the fabrication of state-of-            the-art high speed devices.  These facilities include an OMCVD system           for compound semiconductor growth, an ion reactive etcher, an e-beam            evaporator and a sub-micron mask aligner.  The microwave prober would           enhance the ability to use the extensive microwave instrumentation to           characterize the devices which are built.  Seven faculty are involved           with projects which could make use of the probe station.  These                 projects range from millimeter wave imaging arrays to resonant                  tunneling diode oscillators and optoelectronic devices.  The                    availability of a probe station would impact the efficiency and                 quality of the research done on all these topics.",
