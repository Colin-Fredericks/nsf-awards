 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines the founding of three kinds of                           cultural institutions in the United States:  museums,                           resident opera companies, and resident orchestras.  The                         principal investigators will examine the influence of a wide                    array of social, economic, and political changes on the                         founding of cultural organizations in a representative sample                   of counties across the nation.  In contrast with European                       societies, which had rich cultural traditions, Americans were                   initially suspicious of high culture and, moreover, were                        preoccupied with the tasks of developing industry and                           agriculture, and contending with the problems of growing                        cities and immigration.  Once precedents for culture                            institutions were established, however, the rate of increase                    in museums, opera and orchestra companies was extraordinarily                   great.  This research will investigate the conditions under                     which these cultural institutions came into being, including                    the effects of major national events (such as wars and                          recessions).  One thesis to be tested is that the conditions                    that fostered culture in the early 19th century largely                         relate to the inequality of resources, but other influences                     (such as education) increasingly prevailed.  This study will                    contribute to an understanding of how major cultural                            institutions were initially established and developed over                                                                                                      time.",
