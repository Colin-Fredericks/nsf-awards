 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Education of Hispanic students, particularly in mathematics,                continues to be a pressing issue.  Language factors such as bilingualism        and limited-English proficiency play important roles in Hispanic                achievement in general; however, the influence of language factors on           the development of mathematical meanings for this population has yet to         be studied in detail.  The purpose of this project is to investigate            linguistic factors (Spanish and English) which help or hinder the               acquisition of mathematical knowledge and understanding.                                                                                                        This project will conduct an ethnographic study of mathematics teaching         in four elementary classrooms with students of varying levels of English        proficiency.  The objective is to gather contrastive data based on              teacher-student interaction during mathematics instruction.  Data               analysis will be guided by theoretical frameworks drawn from research on        mathematics teaching, on teacher discourse and the development of               meaning, and on bilingual learners.  The results will be disseminated to        both researchers and practitioners and will contribute to our                   understanding of the teaching of mathematics in general and the                 improvement of instruction for Hispanic students, in particular.",
