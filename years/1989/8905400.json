 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with several aspects of the relationship               between quantum theory and gravitation, especially those which                  are relevant to understanding the origin and evolution of the                   universe.  This work is part of a line of enquiry that seeks to                 better understand the effects of gravitation on quantum systems                 and the quantum nature of gravity.  The specific research topics                include:  (1) The problem of the cosmological constant, a                       fundamental, unsolved problem in cosmology.  The problem will be                studied in the context of possible dynamical mechanism that force               the value of the cosmological \"constant\" to decay.  (2) Quantum                 violations of classical energy conditions (e.g. generation of                   negative energy densities) and their effects upon gravitation.                  This will study the extent to which one can produce exotic                      gravitational fields with quantum matter and avoid the                          singularities of classical general relativity.  (3) The limits of               validity of the semiclassical approximation to quantum gravity.                 This is of importance both for understanding the early history of               the universe and for guiding the development of a more complete                 quantum gravity theory.  (4) Alternative approaches to quantum                  field theory.  This is a search for new ways of studying quantum                processes, especially in the presence of gravity.",
