 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research betwen Dr. Emile                 Okal, Department of Geological Sciences, Northwestern University                and Professor Michael Cara, Institut de Physique du Globe,                      University of Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, France.  The research                  project will involve the joint operation of a three-component                   broad-band seismic station at Midway Island (Pacific Ocean)                                                                                                     Both investigators have been engaged for several years in                       surface-wave studies on a world-wide basis, and locally in the                  Pacific Ocean.  The common goal in this research has been the                   resolution of the crustal and upper mantle structure under the                  Pacific Basin, in particular, its lateral heterogeneity and                     anisotropy.  In this general framework, Drs. Cara and Okal have                 started an active cooperation in surface-wave investigations in the             Pacific Basin.  In this project they will jointly operate a                     \"portable\" high quality broad-band seismic station in Midway                    Island.  The data to be gathered will be of importance for our                  understanding of the mechanical and thermal evolution of the                    lithosphere near hot spots, as well as for the dynamics of the                  mantle plumes.  A major difficulty in constraining models of                    thermal rejuvenation of the lithosphere is the lack of                          observational constraints, other than ocean bathymetry and heat                 flow.  The results of this research will address this problem.",
