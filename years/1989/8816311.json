 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will conduct laboratory and field investigations                   into the molecular-level transformations in the macromolecular                  component of dissolved organic matter in seawater that are caused               by photooxidative processes.  The hypotheses to be tested in the                research are:  1) that photooxidation represents a major process                for remineralization of both allochthonous and autochthonous DOC                in the ocean; 2) that terrestrial (riverine) DOC, especially its                lignin component, is preferentially destroyed by photooxidation                 in comparison to marine DOC; 3) that photoprocesses in the ocean                are predominately destructive, not constructive, to DOC; 4) that                these photooxidative processes impart a unique molecular level                  signature on DOC that can be distinguished by Pyrolysis-GC-MS.                  The approach will be to examine the relative rates of                           photooxidation and macromolecular oxidation products of                         \"endmember\" sources of DOC in laboratory experiments and                        simultaneously determine the distributions of reactive starting                 materials and photooxidation products in areas of the ocean where               natural gradients can be expected.  Examining oceanic processes                 affecting DOC at the molecular level is fundamental to                          understanding the transport and fats of material, particularly                  carbon, in the marine environment.  Thus, this research is                      addressing an aspect of current concerns relating to climate, a                 present problem of planetary significance.",
