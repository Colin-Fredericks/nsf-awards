 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research                project in physical oceanography between Miroslav Gacic,of the                  Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries and Paul E. La Violette                 of the Naval Ocean Research and Development Station, is to                      develop the first climatological atlas of the Adriatic Sea using                NOAA satellite imagery and oceanographic ship data collected by                 the Yugoslavs.    The atlas will deepen understanding of the                    effects of temperature patterns, coastal weather fronts on                      formation of the deep waters in the eastern Mediterranean and                   Adriatic Seas.   The investigators will jointly perform computer                simulations aimed at predicting the physical behavior of these                  solutions.                                                                                                                                                      This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually               by the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The                    grants are composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to                  the principal Yugoslav institute.  Funds include travel for U.S.                scientists to Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for                      Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
