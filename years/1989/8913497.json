 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this project is to determine and quantify the                     environmental factors that influence the productivity of a                      cloned protein by a recombinant yeast population.  The                          system used as a model is Saccharomyces cerevisiae                              transformed with a 2u hybrid plasmid.  This is a host-                          vector system with significant practical applicability due                      to the potential of 2u-based plasmids for good stability                        and relatively high copy numbers.  The effects of the                           bioculturing environment on host cell physiology and                            recombinant productivity will be studied for the system S.                      cerevisiae - 2u hybrid plasmid under the control of                             constitutive and inducible promoters.  The identity and                         concentration of medium components, the nature of nutrient                      limitation in the chemostat, and the bioreactor operation                       strategy will be examined systematically in order to assess                     quantitatively the influence of these parameters on plasmid                     stability, copy number, growth rate, and cloned protein                         expression rate.                                                                                                                                                Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) is an excellent                        microorganism for the production of recombinant proteins                        since it is non-pathogenic to humans and has been grown at                      an industrial scale for centuries.  Large-scale                                 fermentation of recombinant yeast is currently used for the                     production of several valuable products, including                              therapeutic proteins.  The proposed research program will                       provide a better understanding of the factors that                              influence the efficiency of recombinant protein production                      in yeast using a system of commercial significance, the 2u                      hybrid plasmid.  This project will also suggest appropriate                     manipulations of the various fermentation parameters that                       can result in more economic production of biomedically                          important proteins through this biotechnological route.                         The generation of new knowledge in this area and the                            potential development of industrial operational strategies                      will increase the competitive edge of the United States in                      biotechnology.",
