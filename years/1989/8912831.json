Such                        issues concern the delineation of regions associated with                       single phase forced convections, forced convection nucleate                     boiling, and film boiling on a heated plate exposed to a                        single jet or an array of jets.  Transitions from one region                    to another are strongly influenced by jet hydrodynamic                          condition (turbulence intensity and velocity profile), by the                                                                                                   transition from a laminar to turbulent boundary layer for flow                                                                                                  on the plate, and by the interactions of such flows for an                      array of jets.  Photography will be used to identify nucleate,                                                                                                  transition and film boiling, while local heat transfer                          measurements will be used to determine convection coefficients                                                                                                  in single and two-phase flow regimes.  Parameters to be                         studied include hydrodynamic and geometrical features of the                    jet and jet arrays, plate speed and surface conditions, and                     the presence of noncondensibles in the liquid.  Where possible                                                                                                  transition and convection heat transfer coefficient data will                                                                                                   be correlated.  In an attempt to predict heat transfer data                     for the single phase forced convection and film boiling                         regions, finite-difference and integral solutions of the                        conservation equations will be developed.  To assess the                        applicability of basic results inferred from laboratory                         studies, flow visualization experiments will also be performed                                                                                                  at Inland Steel Corporation's hot rolling mill, and scaling                     considerations will be addressed by contrasting results                         obtained in the laboratory and the mill.  A model which uses                    laboratory generated data to predict the thermal response of                    strip steel under mill conditions will be developed, and                        predictions will be compared with available data.                                                                                                                                                                                               In recent years, cooling by means of low turbulence, liquid                     jets has become widely used in the processing of primary                        metals such as steel and aluminum.  However, currently the                      knowledge base required to support the establishment of                         optimal design and operating conditions is limited, and                         recourse must be made to trial-and-error procedures.  In a                      single application, cooling of hot metals simultaneously                        involve regions of single phase forced convection, forced                       convection nucleate boiling, and film boiling, and the                          attendant temperature history of the metal strongly influences                                                                                                  its final mechnical and metallurical properties.  To develop                    tools for establishing optimal design and operating                             conditions, it is essential that flow and heat transfer                         processes associated with jet impingement be well understood.                                                                                                   This research program should provide such a knowledge base.",
