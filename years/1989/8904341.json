 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structure of dienelactone hydrolase (DLH) has been solved and               is currently being refined at high resolution.  Dr. Ollis plans                 to determine the enzymatic mechanism of DLH using a combination                 of solution studies and substrate binding studies with the                      crystalline protein.  He will also structurally and chemically                  characterize the catalytic triad of DLH using both diffraction                  methods and NMR.  In addition, crystals of two proteins that                    interact with DNA, a single stranded binding protein and a DNA                  ligase, have been obtained and will now be studied.                                                                                                             The study of how organisms evolve to utilize new nutrient sources               is both fascinating and of critical importance for the survival                 of living systems.  The enzyme DLH is an ideal model system to                  understand this evolution at a molecular level.  DLH is a                       component of the ketoadipate pathway which operates in bacteria                 and fungi and which possesses of a number of different branches,                in each of which catechol or a catechol derivative is                           catabolized.",
