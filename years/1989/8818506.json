 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the many important changes which occur in the physiology of serum-        starved cells is the accelerated lysosomal proteolysis of many                  cytoplasmic proteins.  It has been demonstrated that ferritin is spared         this fate in serum-deprived K562 erythroleukemia cells.  The absence of         a specific recognition sequence which codes for protein uptake by               lysosomes during serum starvation may account for the phenomenon.  The          proposed work will directly test this hypothesis by detailed evaluation         of ferritin physiology with serum deprivation and by the creation of            site-directed mutants of ferritin which can be used in cell transfection        experiments.  The normal steady-state uptake of ferritin into lysosomes         may mediated by a specific receptor protein on the organelle.  They will        construct modified ferritin cDNAs which contain the amino acid sequence         KFERQ which enhances the uptake of ribonuclease A from cytoplasm into           lysosomes with serum deprivation, determine whether any relationship            exists between ascorbic acid and serum starvation as concerns ferritin          degradation, and use isolated ferritin and lysosomes to explore the             effects of serum starvation on variables important to ferritin turnover         such as cytoplasmic aggregation of the protein and the interaction of           ferritin aggregates with lysosomes.  Also, purification of a lysosomal          membrane receptor for ferritin will be attempted.",
