 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to deduce how the genome specifies                  neuronal connections by focussing on mutations that alter                       a particular identifiable synapse in the adult Drosophila                       nervous system.  The synapse is part of the giant fiber                         escape system; it connects the giant fiber interneuron                          and the jump muscle  motoneuron.  Mutations which alter                         the structure and/or function of the giant fiber-jump                           muscle motoneuron connection may be identified by a combination                 of behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroanatomical methods.               One such mutation defines the bendless (ben) gene which appears                 to play a key role late in the formation of neuronal connections.               It may be involved in the final recognition events between a                    presynaptic neuron and its post-synaptic target.  The PI will                   conduct a detailed genetic and phenotypic analysis of ben to                    determine the nature of its role in neuronal connectivity.  He                  then clone the ben gene, determine if its product has amino acid                homology to other known molecules, and study the spatial and                    temporal pattern of its expression.  The detailed genetic and                   molecular description of how one particular synapse is formed may               serve as a model that gives insight into the general problem of                 neuronal connectivity.",
