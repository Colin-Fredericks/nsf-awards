 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will formulate a model for turbidite                         deposition in the Catskill Sea that can resolve important                       problems encountered in modern and ancient submarine fan                        research, in Devonian sea level curves, and in recent sequence                  stratigraphy models.  An additional objective is to resolve the                 present controversy of submarine fan vs. non-fan deposition in                  the Catskill Sea.  PI will construct a model of 1) deposition and               flow character for individual, nonchannelized turbidity current                 and 2) submarine fan development in western New York.  PI's will                study the vertical and lateral variations in the sedimentology                  and stratigraphy of individual sand layers in three members of                  the Upper Devonian of western New York.  A pilot project                        demonstrates that the many gorges and ravines in western New York               provide the control necessary to trace individual sandstone                     layers across the region, allowing us to characterize the lateral               variability in bedforms, texture and thickness of individual                    sandstone layers.  Applications of the detailed Devonian model to               modern and ancient turbidite systems will provide insights into                 their development, thereby resolving some of the remaining                      uncertainties.",
