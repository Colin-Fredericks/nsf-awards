 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators are continuing their research on the                use of Sr/Ca ratios in fish otoliths to resolve questions about                 an organism's growth rate history and about the environmental                   conditions that fish were exposed to during their growth.  There                are two phases: (1) a laboratory phase to improve the technique                 the investigators developed to examine Sr/Ca ratios in otolith                  bands, and (2) a field phase to gain insight into how the                       overwintering distibutions of herring larvae in the Gulf of Maine               may affect recruitment.  For the field component of their study,                they will determine the distribution of herring larve shortly                   after spawing in the fall and in mid-winter.  The data obtained                 will be compared with Sr/Ca otolith measurements on adult fish to               determine if the distribution of larvae observed is reflected in                the otolith banding.",
