 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southern Florida's relatively shallow freshwater table in a                porous substrate, (oolitic limestone), is particularly                          susceptible to ocean water intrusion.  Other than gross effects,                little is known about more subtle effects and processes                         responsible for this intrusion.  It is well known that pumping of               ground water to supply expanding urban areas and canal building                 have contributed to intrusion problems.  Several questions about                salt water intrusion remain to be answered, however.  For                       example, Is there a seasonality of intrusion; dry season versus                 wet season?  If ocean levels are rising because of global                       climatic changes, is this effect already detectable in coastal                  plant communities of southern Florida?  What about the effect of                salt water intrusion in plant communities; will this mean an                    increase in exotic pest plants?  The proposed research addresses                such questions.                                                                      The results of this research will answer many basic                        scientific questions about how plants react to periodic and                     chronic salt water stress.  The research will rely heavily on                   stable isotope analysis of plant biomass.  Recently much has been               learned about biological systems with this technique.  Stable                   isotope analysis will shed light on the history of salt water                   intrusion in plant communities.  In addition, stable isotope                    techniques can be used to integrate hydrological  and                           ecophysiological concepts in the study of salt water intrusion.                      The potential applications of this research are quite clear.               Much of the salt water intrusion in southern Florida is caused by               water management projects.  This research can aid in predicting                 more precisely the effects of water management strategies.  As an               example; if ocean water intrusion is seasonal, then an                          appropriate strategy would be limitation of freshwater pumping                  during the dry season.  Further, the experimental techniques to                 be used here will permit the detection of salt water intrusion in               plant communities before irreversible changes occur.",
