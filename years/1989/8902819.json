 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on studying a highly parallel distributed                 processing system based on neural networks with and without simulated           annealing.  The neural network under investigation takes advantage of           the hill-climbing capability of Cauchy machines with decentralized              control and the fast convergence property of Hopfield networks.  A              reformulation of an energy cost function and appropriate weights of the         neural network are crucial to reducing local minima.                            Many neural networks used in solving NP-complete problems apply a               gradient descent algorithm.  Although convergence is fast, it is very           easy for the system to be trapped in a local minimum.  Neural networks          employing simulated annealing give better results but converge very             slowly.  The proposed Gaussian machine, which is composed of sigmoid            neurons and stochastic synaptic links, takes advantage of the fast              convergence property of the Hopfield network and the hill-climbing              property of the Boltzmann machine.  Such a study will further our               knowledge in mapping neural networks to VLSI and result in more                 efficient learning algorithms.  Support is, therefore, highly                   recommended.",
