 "awd_abstract_narration": "In district heating and cooling systems heated or chilled water is              recirculated through a 10 to 20 km loop, exchanging heat with various           installations.  Much of the capital investment is concentrated in the           pipes, pumps, and fittings needed for the recirculation.  Drag                  reduction in turbulent flow could result in cost and energy savings.            Several cationic and nonionic surfactant systems which form rod-shaped          micelles have been identified as drag reducing agents.  This research           project will establish basic criteria for effective drag reducing               systems and develop a convenient screening technique.  Variables                affecting micellar size, shape, and orientation will be studied,                examining temperature, type and concentration of counter-ion,                   electrolyte content, and the effect of coadditives.  Quasielastic               light scattering will be used to study the micellar behavior of the             additive systems.                                                                                                                                               Interactive activities include teaching a course in the fundamentals            of colloid science, participating in a university course which focuses          on the unique problems of women and minorities in engineering and               science, and contributing to a workshop for women in the College of             Engineering.                                                                                                                                                    This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women          to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater               visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the                      participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
