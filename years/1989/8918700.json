 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, conducted in collaboration with Dedre Gentner of                 the University of Illinois, is concerned with the development and               testing of psychological theories of similarity structure and                   similarity judgments.  Similarity is a concept fundamental to                   virtually all aspects of cognition, theoretical and applied.  For               example, theories of memory rely on the observation that people                 often are reminded of similar events, and theories of learning                  predict transfer on the basis of similarity between learning and                test conditions.  In everyday life, the errors people make are                  often based on the use of inappropriate similarity matches, and a               good deal of learning and transfer of training appears to be                    governed by what people find similar.  Thus, an adequate theory                 of similarity is essential for theoretical advances in                          understanding cognition and in their application.                                                                                                               This research stems from the fundamental insight that similarity                of two things depends not only on the similarity of features or                 parts, but also on how those parts are put together, the                        relations among the parts.  Previous research has demonstrated                  the advantages of formal mathematical models in understanding the               role of attributes in similarity.  The current research will                    apply and extend these previous formalisms to incorporate the                   contribution of relations to similarity, in addition to the role                of attributes.  Separating structure from processing principles                 is crucial for understanding a variety of experimental results,                 such as (1) that the similarity of object A to object B may be                  different from the similarity of B to A, (2) that the similarity                of A to B may depend on what other objects are present, and (3)                 that adding the same property to objects A and B may change which               one of the them is judged to be more similar to object C.                       Preliminary research indicates that these observations depend                   importantly on whether similarity is based on attributes,                       relations, or mixtures of attributes and relations.                                                                                                             Most of the studies involve presenting people with material                     (e.g., geometric forms, descriptions of objects) and asking them                to make similarity judgments.  In other studies, reaction times                 and errors in various tasks will provide an indirect measure of                 similarity.  Computer simulations of similarity and analogy will                model the experimental results.  The research will also begin the               study of the role of structural similarity in learning and                      concept formation.",
