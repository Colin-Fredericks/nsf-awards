 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of                  Professor Robert Lazarsfeld of the University of California at                  Los Angeles. Dr. Lazarsfeld will be continuing his work on the                  applications of vector bundle techniques in the study of linear                 series. In particular, he intends to investigate some problems                  involving the Noether-Lefschetz locus as well as some questions                 arising out of work already begun with Dr. Mark Green of UCLA, on               generic vanishing theorems.                                                          This is research in the field of Algebraic Geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                     origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from Algebra, but from Analysis and               Topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical Computer Science and in Robotics.",
