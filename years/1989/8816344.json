 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Dr. Mark M. Green of the Polytechnic                    University, Brooklyn, New York, to collaborate with Professor Koichi            Hatada and Yoshio Okamoto of the Department of Chemistry, Osaka                 University, for six months beginning in September, 1989.  They will             work on the synthesis of copolymers of specific composition and                 microstructure from isocyanates and from methacrylates to test the              idea that secondary conformational information can be transmitted               across a diblock boundary in the growth process.  Controlled anionic            polymerization will be used for the copolymer synthesis, and chiral             optical techniques will be used to characterize the resulting                   structure.                                                                                                                                                      This cooperative project will provide Dr. Pearse access to the anionic          techniques used to produce conformationally chiral and optically                active molecules which have been developed by the Japanese col-                 laborators.  This research will also complement that currently                  supported by the National Science Foundation's Materials-Chemistry              Initiative, and may have important implications in the development of           synthesis techniques for commercially important polymers.",
