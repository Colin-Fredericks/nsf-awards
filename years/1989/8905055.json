 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethylene is a plant hormone of particular importance in agriculture             today because of its many effects on plant growth and development, from         seed germination through senescence and death of the plant.  Commercial         use of ethylene in stimulating plant ripening is currently practiced,           despite the fact that little is known about how its natural production          by the plant is regulated or how it acts in controlling the plant's             growth and maturation.  The purification of the enzyme ACC synthase             which is primarily responsible for the production of ethylene has been          completed.  This purification was achieved for the enzyme from mung             bean tissue, an excellent system for further studies on the molecular           events which surround ethylene formation for the following reasons:             the tissue is quickly grown, it can be obtained in large quantity, and          it exhibits rapid and large increases in ACC synthase production upon           appropriate stimulation.                                                                                                                                        This proposal is designed to address the question of how production of          the ethylene-forming enzyme ACC synthase is regulated in mung bean              tissue and whether the dominant controls are exerted at the gene                expression level.  Towards this goal, the molecular events which lead           to increased formation of ACC synthase (and therefore of increased              ethylene) will be examined.  Through the use of antibodies directed             against ACC synthase, the extent to which increased gene expression             accounts for the elevation in ACC synthase production and how this              process is affected by other plant hormones, specifically indole-3-             acetic acid and brassinosteroids will be determined.  In addition, the          gene for ACC synthase in mung beans will be isolated and its DNA                sequence determined.  This information will greatly assist efforts to           understand how the enzyme works in producing ethylene.",
