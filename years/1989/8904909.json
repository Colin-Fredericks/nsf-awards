This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic, corporate,               and government cooperation in the support of basic research in                  the mathematical sciences.                                                           This equipment will be used to support three research                      projects in the Department of Mathematics at Kansas State                       University: Numerical Solution of Inverse Scattering Problems,                  directed by Alexander Ramm and Qisu Zou; The CAYLEY Program in                  Group Theory Research, directed by Andrew Chermak, Alberto                      Delgado, Ernest Shult, and David Surowski; and Investigation of                 Steady-State and Dynamical Bifurcations in Poorly-Stirred                       Premixed and Nonpremixed Chemically-Reacting Systems, directed by               Wendell Dan Curtis, Rodney Fox, and Kadosa Halasi.",
