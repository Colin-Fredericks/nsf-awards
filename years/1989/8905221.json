 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alginate synthesis and de novo assembly into a cell wall by the                 fertilized egg of the brown alga. Fucus provides a simple system                for studying plant cell wall formation. Alginate is a linear                    polymer of the two acidic sugars, mannuronate and guluronate,                   arranged in nongelling and gelling subunits. Recent work                        identified the intracellular site of synthesis of the gelling                   subunits as the Golgi apparatus. Alginate molecular size and the                subunit length distributions of intracellular and extracellular                 alginate will be examined by electrophoresis after cleavage by                  specific enzymes. The ability of zygote alginate to gel in a                    seawater environment will be studied by labelling zygote sections               with fluorescent hybridization probes of known chain length. The                activities of two enzymes, one regulating alginate gelation                     (epimerase converts nongelling subunits to gelling subunits) and                one causing its cleavage (lyase cuts alginate chains for wall                   expansion) will be correlated with wall development by enzyme                   microassays. Antisera to the purified enzymes will be prepared                  for immunogold ultrastructural localization during wall                         development. In vitro translation products of messenger RNA                     prepared form zygotes during development will be                                immunoprecipitated. This project will provide information on                    enzyme and mRNA controls of the synthesis, assembly, structure                  and modification of a gelling wall carbohydrate.                                %%%                                                                             This project will provide detailed information on the control of                a gelling plant cell wall polymer at the carbohydrate, protein                  and mRNA levels of control. This gelling/nongelling allows the                  cell wall components to adapt to growth while maintaining the                   integrity of the organism.",
