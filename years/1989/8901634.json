 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of a series of three workshops to be                 held in successive summers for approximately twenty women                       researchers in statistics and probability who have received their               doctorate degree within the five years prior to the workshop                    year.  The first workshop is scheduled for August 4-5, 1989 and                 would immediately precede the 52nd Annual Meeting of the                        Institute of Mathematical Statistics to be held in conjunction                  with the American Statistical Association and regions of the                    Biometric Society from August 6-10, 1989 in Washington, D.C.  The               second workshop would likely be scheduled for August 4-5, 1990                  and would precede the Annual American Statistical Association                   meeting from August 6-9, 1990 in Anaheim, California.  The third                workshop is tentatively scheduled for August 18-19, 1991 and                    would be held prior to the 54th Annual Meeting of the Institute                 of Mathematical Statistics and regions of the Biometric Society                 from August 19-22, 1991 in Atlanta, Georgia.  The director of the               project is Professor Lynne Billard of the University of Georgia.                     The purpose of the workshops will be to increase and foster                the research activity of the participants.  It is hoped that the                participants will use the workshop and the resulting professional               contacts to enhance their research and decrease their isolation.",
