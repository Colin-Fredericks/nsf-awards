 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to familiarize undergraduate                   students with experimental methods of studying the mechanical                   properties of composite materials.  There is great demand in                    industry for young mechanical engineers who can deal with the                   unusual properties of the recently developed composite materials.               Traditional mechanical engineering courses have not trained                     students to deal with the highly anisotropic nature of these                    materials; i.e., the stiffness and strength properties are highly               dependent on the direction load is applied.  To teach                           undergraduate students about the anisotropic characteristics of                 composite materials, a special course will include both theory                  sessions and at least eight lab experiments.  Of the equipment                  needed, one major piece is already on hand.  The existing                       static test frame needs to be augmented with the following new                  equipment: multichannel data acquisition unit interfaced with a PC              for the purpose of collecting strain gage data and load signals, a              compression fixture, a shear fixture and electronic                             instrumentation.  Full characterization of composite materials                  requires a determination of the volume fraction of fibers in the                material through weighing the fibers in a sample after dissolving               the matrix.  For this purpose a precision balance is necessary.",
