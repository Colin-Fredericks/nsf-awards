In each of three summers, a different group of forty                   leader teachers of honors and Advanced Placement chemistry                      will participate in an intensive five-week residential                          program structured on chemical laboratory experiences and                       integrally incorporating attention to practices of potential                    success in peer leadership activities.  In addition to the                      goal of extending the effect of this program to other                           teachers, it is expected that the participant teachers will                     strengthen the disciplinary base of their students and                          positively influence career decisions for science among able                    students.  Extensive follow-up activities by the participants                   will provide a system for networking the teachers with each                     other and with the project staff.",
