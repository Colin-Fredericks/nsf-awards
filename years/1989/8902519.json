 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support U.S.-Irish research in theoretical                      physics.  The principal investigators are Dr. Robert O'Connell,                 Louisiana State University, Dr. G. W. Ford, University of                       Michigan, Dr. John Lewis, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies,                and Dr. D. M. Heffernan, National Institute for Higher Education,               Dublin, Ireland.  The proposed work focuses on quantum stochastic               processes, with special emphasis on systems in such areas as                    quantum optics and laser, atomic and condensed matter physics,                  which involve the presence of a heat bath as an integral element                of a quantum system.  Drs. O'Connell and Lewis have worked                      together on this topic since 1983.                                                                                                                              In the present project, they will apply results obtained for a                  general oscillator heat bath to such problems as non-Markovian                  effects on time decay, as well as to an investigation of improved               heat bath models for quantum optics.  Two major new elements in                 this study will be 1) the pursuit of new ideas in relation to the               spin boson problem and 2) the formulation of quantum dissipations               in terms of a master equations (the von Neumann equation of                     motion for the density matrix).  This work will enable the                      investigators to study the effect of quantum dissipation on                     systems exhibiting the phenomenon of chaos.  The participation of               Heffernan, since he is a well-recognized expert in the phenomenon               of chaos in semiconductor lasers, will be of importance.",
