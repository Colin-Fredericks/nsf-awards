 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will formulate quantitative models that integrate                 equilibrium models of exchange rates -- based on real                           disturbances in dynamic,  stochastic,  general-equilibrium models               with flexible prices -- with real business cycle models --                      dynamic stochastic models of the effects of real disturbances on                macroeconomic aggregates.  It will involve the use of numerical                 methods to solve models with parameters taken from historical                   data and microeconomic studies,  and to determine the properties                of these models,  their sensitivity to parameter values,  and                   their implications.  The research will also study the use of                    nonlinear statistical representations of exogenous disturbances.                The results will improve our understanding of the effects of real               disturbances on exchange rates,  add new testable implications of               dynamic general-equilibrium macroeconomic models for open-                      economy variables such as the trade balance,  terms of trade,                   and relative price of non-traded goods, add to our knowledge of                 the international transmission of exogenous disturbances and of                 government policies,  especially fiscal and international-trade                 policies,  and improve our understanding of the roles of sector-                specific versus nation-specific disturbances in aggregate                       fluctuations and of the effects of alternative exchange-rate                    systems on macroeconomic and international-trade performance.",
