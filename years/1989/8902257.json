 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic                    and Organometallic Chemistry Program is to discover new ways to                 use transition metals as templates for the formation of                         chemical bonds. Such research is important in the design of                     catalysts for chemical synthesis and in modelling the action of                 metalloenzymes.                                                                                                                                                 The focus of the project is on reductive coupling, oxidative                    coupling and enantiospecific C-C bond formation (e.g.,                          catalytic conjugate addition) between closely positioned                        ligands in transition metal complexes. High coordinate early                    transition metal complexes with linear ligands (CO, CNR, -CCR,                  etc.) provide a reaction channel for reductive coupling                         chemistry. Oxidative coupling will be explored using the                        polymetallic scaffold provided by fusing two oxo-centered                       triangular metal aggregates (M3O, M=Fe, Mn, Cr, Ru) or two                      di(mu2)dioxomanganese units, the latter affording a new                         approach to modelling the tetramanganese center in the dioxygen                 evolving complex of photosystem II. New catalytic and                           stoichiometric C-C bond forming reactions will be carried out                   between ligands bonded to two identical or disparate metal                      centers held at the poles of symmetric (containing two pairs of                 nitrogen donors) or asymmetric (e.g., containing a pair of                      phosphine donors and a set of three nitrogen donors)                            binucleating macrocycles. The results of these studies will                     afford insights into how high coordinate and polymetallic                       transition metal centers promote bond forming reactions in                      organometallic and bioinorganic chemistry and should lead to                    new molecules of fundamental interest as well as synthetic                      utility.",
