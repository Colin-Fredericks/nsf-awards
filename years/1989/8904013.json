 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support joint research in nuclear astrophy-                     sics between two groups of U.S. and Belgian physicists.                         The U.S. group will be under the direction of Dr. William S.                    Rodney, Georgetown University.  The Belgium collaborator is                     Dr. J. Vervier, Institute for Nuclear Physics, Louvain,                         Belgium.  The objective of this project is to carry out a                       program of experiments using radioactive beams to measure                       cross sections important to understanding nucleosynthesis.                                                                                                      In novae, supernovae, X-ray bursters and possibly in the                        early universe, the temperature and density were such that                      the lifetimes of some radioactive (and isomeric) nuclides                       were comparable with the burning times for their destruction                    by proton- or alpha-particle-induced nuclear reactions.  In                     these instances, these reactions must be taken into account                     in developing models for stellar evolution and nucleosyn-                       thesis.  Thus, the potential for the use of radioactive                         targets and/or beams is receiving increasing attention in                       the nuclear physics community.  In this project, the series                     of experiments outlined represent a major step in the                           direction of providing the needed cross section information.                    The Louvain-la-Neuve coupled cyclotron facility will be                         able to produce the required beam intensity to carry out                        these experiments.  There are no existing U.S. facilities                       capable of such radioactive beam measurements.  The research                    will benefit from Dr. Rodney's expertise in nuclear                             astrophysics and the background of his research group in                        active nuclear experimentation.  The results of this                            research will contribute to our understanding of stellar                        evolution and nucleosynthesis in stars.",
