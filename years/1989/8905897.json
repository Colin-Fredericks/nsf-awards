 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop techniques which can               be used for in situ measurements of nitrogen cycling processes in               saltmarsh ecosystems.  Techniques which can be used to measure                  rates of nitrification by autotrophic and heterotrophic                         nitrifiers, rates of denitrification by heterotrophic                           denitrifiers as well as by autotrophic and heterotrophic                        nitrifiers, and rates of dissimulator nitrate reduction will be                 developed.  The percentage of the products of these nitrogen                    cycling processes that may be lost from an ecosystem as N20, NO,                and N2 will be determined.  Initially laboratory studies will be                conducted using pure cultures of representative autotrophic                     nitrifiers, heterotrophic nitrifiers, denitrifiers, and                         dissimulator nitrate reducers.  Emphasis will be place on using                 a variety of inhibitors to determine which nitrogen metabolizing                processes operate under a given set of conditions (pO2, electron                donor or substrate availability, pH).  Preliminary studies with                 14C- and 15N- labelled substrates in conjunction with inhibitors                will be performed.  Promising techniques will then be tested on                 soil cores held in a gas-recirculation system.  Cores for study                 will be taken from the Long Term Ecological Research Site,                      located within the Virginia Coast Reserve.  Soil core experiments               will be designed to determine which inhibitor and/or labelling                  technique is most useful for assessing the relative importance of               particular nitrogen cycling processes in saltmarsh soil.                        Finally, exploratory studies will be initiated at the LTER site                 to determine whether selected inhibitor techniques can be                       performed effectively under in situ conditions.                                      This team of investigators is very well qualified.                         Institutional accommodations are appropriate to the work.  The                  association with the Long-Term Ecological Research project at the               Virginia Coast Reserve is an added strength.                                         Outputs from this type of research will be of importance not               only to the fundament process-level understanding of saltmarsh                  wetlands but will also provide estimates for the role played by                 such systems in the biological import of nitrogenous gases to the               atmosphere.",
