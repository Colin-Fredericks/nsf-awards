 "awd_abstract_narration": "Combined biophysical and molecular biological studies will be                   carried out on the structural determinants of the complex                       functions of reaction centers from Rh. sphaeroides, with the goal               of manipulating, by means of site directed mutations, the                       functional properties of several of the cofactors active in the                 light energy transduction.  Attempts are also being made to                     establish a molecular genetics system for Rps. Viridis reaction                 centers.  Meanwhile, the biophysical characterization of this                   species will be continued.                                                                                                                                      The primary process of photosynthesis involves the light-induced                transfer of an electron from a primary electron donor to a                      sequence of electron acceptors.  This is accomplished in a                      membrane bound pigment-protein complex called a reaction center.                The proteins involved in energy transduction in photosynthesis                  provide a unique opportunity for investigating the biophysical                  chemistry of proteins and the principles behind their remarkable                activities and behavior.",
