 "awd_abstract_narration": "Important dimensions in the relationship between social and legal               change include the form of law, its content, and the process                    whereby change occurs within the legal arena.  One of the first                 decisions of a newly established government is the content of                   law.  This is determined by the beliefs held by the political                   leadership and includes substantive concerns that they think can                be addressed within the legal order.  A second and related                      decision is what form the legal order will take.  The essence of                this decision is the mix of formalism and informalism that                      characterizes the law.  Research on legal and social change has                 been hindered by a lack of conceptual clarity regarding                         informalism and a failure to locate changes in the form and                     content of law in the broader context of structural and                         historical influences on the society.                                                                                                                           This project examines these dimensions through an analysis of                   specific changes in the content of law, the mix of formalism and                informalism of law, and the relationship between this mix and the               content of law in Latin American socialist legal orders.  Cuba                  and Nicaragua, two socialist regimes that have taken different                  approaches to legal order and which have undergone marked                       changes in their political-economic structures, are the natural                 settings for the research.  Central to the analysis is an                       understanding of the historical and structural factors that shape               particular aspects of legal institutions.  The methodology is                   both comparative and historical.  Documentary data and in-depth                 interviews with key actors will be used deductively and                         inductively by testing the theoretical framework in one site and                further refining the model as new information emerges from the                  comparison site.                                                                                                                                                This research bridges the gap between structural analyses of                    lawmaking and research on the dialectical relationship between                  informal and formal justice, thus enhancing our understanding of                the relationship between legal and social change.  The role of                  legal professionals, the strategy of legal borrowings from other                countries, and the specifics of Cuban and Nicaraguan initiatives                have important policy implications as well.  Finally, the study                 will inform research on the use of informal justice options in                  the U.S. by enhancing our understanding of the tension between                  formalism and informalism in the legal arena.",
