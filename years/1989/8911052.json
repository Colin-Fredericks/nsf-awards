 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Michael Coe, Mr. Kevin Johnston will                 conduct archeological research at the site of Itzan to collect                  data as part of his doctoral dissertation research.  Itzan,                     located in the Department of Peten, Guatemala, dates from the                   Late Classic Maya period (AD 550 to 900) and documents this                     complex society at the height of its development.  Because of a                 road which was recently cut across the site, Mr. Johnston has                   located a series of cultural occurrences which appear in the cut                profiles along the sides of the roads.  Because these small or                  \"hidden sites\" appear not to be associated with architecture,                   they are invisible from the surface and have been found only by                 the greatest of luck.  Mr. Johnston will produce a large scale                  map of the area, which includes many buildings which are visible                from surface remains, to determine the relative position of the                 hidden structures.  Several of these sites will then be excavated               and the materials recovered compared from those from larger                     sites.  By these means, it should be possible to determine what                 functions these hidden sites served.                                                                                                                            This research is important for several reasons.  First,                         archaeologists have long suspected that such small \"hidden\" sites               might exist.  However, rarely has it been possible to locate                    them.  Since researchers use the distribution of known                          archaeological remains and the patterns observed among them to                  derive population estimates and reconstruct how prehistoric Mayan               society functioned, the results may be seriously in error if an                 entire class of remains has been missed.  Mr. Johnston's work                   raises this possibility, and it is, therefore, important to                     understand what these hidden sites are and the role they served                 in the broader cultural picture.                                                                                                                                Secondly, Mr. Johnston is an extremely competent young scientist                and this research will significantly add to his training.",
