Because of the                   complexity of the data, the subject matter of the substantive                   field will play a crucial role in modelling and analysis; however               it is anticipated that the techniques developed will be broadly                 applicable.  Variants of techniques for ordinary random variables               will be developed for complex random functions.  Some of the                    particular problems to be studied are: 1) parameter estimation                  and input signal design for the bilinear system basic to nuclear                magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 2) technique development for                   modelling and discerning the structure of collections of                        interacting point processes as applicable to networks of firing                 nerve cells.  The investigator will obtain both theoretical and                 applied results for the problems studied.
